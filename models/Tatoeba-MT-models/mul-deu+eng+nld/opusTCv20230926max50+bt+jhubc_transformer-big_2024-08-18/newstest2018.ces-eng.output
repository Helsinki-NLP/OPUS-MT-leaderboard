Civil Rights Movement Issues Travel Alert for Missouri <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has issued a warning for colored people travelling to Missouri on the basis of state discriminatory principles and racist attacks.
“NAACP’s travel recommendation for the State of Missouri, effective August 28, 2017, invites African-American travelers, visitors and residents of Missouri to pay increased attention to the state as a result of a series of controversial racially motivated incidents across the state.”
The NAACP stated that it had taken this step on the basis of current laws of the State of Missouri, which make it difficult to defend racist acts before the court, as well as as as a result of the actions of the criminal proceedings authorities that are disproportionately targeting minorities.
“There is a violation of civil rights.
People are stopped by police just because of the color of their skin, they are attacked or killed," NAACP president for Missouri Rod Chapel told Kansas City Star.
“We have the largest number of complaints to date.”
This is the first warning of its kind issued by the organization to the U.S. state.
Among the incidents cited by the organization were racially motivated allegations against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in controversial circumstances earlier this year after he was hit by gasoline while traveling across the country, and police put him in jail without charge of committing a crime.
The travel recommendation also draws attention to a recent statement by the Missouri State Attorney’s Office stating that black drivers are 75 percent more likely to be stopped by the police.
“The purpose of the travel recommendation is to alert people and warn their families, friends and co-workers of what might happen in Missouri,” Chapel said.
“People need to be prepared – they should carry money with them to make any bail payments or alert their relatives that they are going to travel by state.”
According to the FBI’s current numbers, there were a hundred cases of hate behavior reported in 2015 in Missouri, which puts the state in 16th place among all states.
The travel alert is also a response to the new Missouri law, which makes it easier for a company to sue for discrimination in providing accommodation or employment.
The American Civil Liberties Association (ACLU) issued travel recommendations for Texas and Arizona after states passed an immigration law that allows state officials to detain people on the basis of a violation of this law, which the ACLU says is intended to improve racial profiling.
Travel recommendations are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for Foreign Countries, but lately law firms have resorted to these measures in response to specific laws and trends within the United States.
The model was killed by the chef.
Her family has no peace after 12 years!
Killed is model Sally Anne Bowman.
The Croydon-born girl was murdered in 2005 by chef Mark Dixie right in the restaurant she worked in, who had her stab wounds.
The victim and the killer were supposed to have sex together and smoke marijuana, then he killed her.
The thief then sat in a nearby cafe and watched a careful criminal investigation of the scene of the crime.
Dixie, a former chef, was sentenced in 2008 to 34 years in prison for the murder and rape of model Sally.
He only confessed to assaulting the teenager in court, and the lawyer claimed that his client had already found the girl lying dead on the street.
Three years later, the police convicted him.
Dixie claimed that Sally and her ex-boyfriend Lewis Sprotson were fighting fateful nights.
The thief said, "He was really angry, and after his attack, the girl started screaming."
"It even attracted the attention of the taxi drivers," he said falsely.
The girl was supposed to defend herself, if she could, in vain.
Lewis was supposed to stab her in the street.
Dixie's version was proven a lie and accused him.
After Dixie's confession, he talked about his passion and taste for the girl.
When he dressed her after sex, he felt satisfied and had to burn marijuana.
Before the incident, Sally was at his ex-girlfriend's, drinking alcohol and taking cocaine, Dexie told the police himself.
He said he felt the adrenaline.
Sally started screaming for help, so he attacked her from behind and put his hand over her mouth," the Mirror Linda added.
And after twelve years, the family faces further attacks by the vandals destroying her grave.
He has been injured four times in the past six months.
There are so many people who are digging these graves.
"So our daughter is no longer there," the Mirror mother of the deceased girl Linda revealed information about the disappearance of the urn with ash.
Linda was waiting for the assailants, but they always had to attack when she left the cemetery.
Design vibrators cost tens of thousands.
"The Czechs are neither conservative nor prudent," says Martin R<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xBE>, who runs the Prague Intimacy boutique.
In it you will find design and luxury erotic aids.
Including those from the Czech designer Anna Mare<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1>.
It started inconspicuously, about 12 years ago.
Martin R<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xBE> and his friends went on a bike ride through Moravia.
One of them brought not only a bicycle, but also a box full of unusually looking vibrators.
"Various squirrels and dolphins and all that was green and yellow and just completely different," he tells me over lunch.
His friend decided to work with another companion with the German design erotic aid manufacturer Fun Factory, which Martina was interested in, and so offered to help with marketing.
When the companion left so that he could pursue another profession, he replaced him.
Today, in Prague’s Benedictine Street, she runs the Intimacy boutique, where she sells erotic utilities in the way luxury handbags or shoes are usually offered.
And why not?
It is also a design object.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
Come on, don't be so puritanical!
It was the Berlin store Fun Factory, designed by renowned designer Karim Rashid, that served as inspiration for the Intimacy boutique.
They opened it in 2010 and it was a completely different concept of an erotic business than what everyone is used to here.
No covered outlays, all made in a beautiful, decent style, products exhibited rather like in perfumery.
Martin and his business partner Zdenek <0xC5><0xA0>ebelka began to think about how to understand the Prague business, where it should be and what it should be called.
The name Intimate was liked by both of them.
“It’s related to intimacy, and it’s, you might say, tender,” she says.
It followed the purchase of an internet domain and the search for suitable space, which went in parallel with various visualizations of the interior.
Eventually, the variant won, which divided the store into the garden of delight and the bedroom with the duke's bed.
It was prepared by Dagmar <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>p<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1> from FormaFatal studio.
We found space in 2013.
At first, it didn’t seem perfect, because it wasn’t on the main street, but thanks to it, it sat under the name of Intimacy.
He's intimate.
It is in the alley next to the main one, so no one cares about customers," praises Martin R<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xBE>.
We wanted to be first.
We wanted to do a business that will be different, with branded nice goods, in an environment where women, who are mostly our customers, feel good.
And not to be ashamed for ever having entered into such a business.
When I entered the Intimacy boutique half an hour ago, the streets were full of emptiness.
Besides, I didn't even feel like I was going to the erotic aid shop.
Right at the door, I was surprised by the pure elegance of the interior, which I know from the fashion boutiques.
Even though there is only women’s service in the store, the fact that women don’t hesitate to ask for help doesn’t mean that a man’s foot wouldn’t come here.
Usually gentlemen come here to buy gifts for their girlfriends.
"Men usually can't guess the right size and choose the bigger one," Martin smiles at the frequent mistake.
These are the prejudices, the clichés that women need some great tools, and it's not true.
So a man in good faith chooses, for example, an unnecessary large vibrator.
In the same way, men prefer mostly black underwear, while the woman usually tends to pink color.
The absolute bestseller is currently a product called Satisfyer.
From the expression in my face, it must be clear that I don’t know which one is beating, because Martin immediately explains how it works.
It's such a touchless clitoral stimulator.
Pere has in me a teenage need to admire with admiration the tone with which the interpretation is given to me.
It's like she's not shy.
And it doesn't really bother.
It is at a good price and has perfect user references.
We didn't think he'd be so well-received.
This is one of the last revolutionary novelties.
The first revolution was caused by a vibrator in the shape of a seahorse.
He took care that women began to be more interested in the design of such products.
The second one was a vibrator for the We-Vibe pairs.
He completely eroded the taboo that some men may persist, and that he sees competition in erotic devices.
“There are different variants,” he continues.
With one engine, with two engines, with remote control.
This is a favorite category.
In a loving relationship, a woman can have a controller in her hand and determine the intensity of the vibrations.
On the contrary, a certain failure is the category of attaching vibrators.
At least with us.
Czech women, it seems, prefer multi-purpose tools and buy classic vibrators, although they may only use it externally.
However, in Western Europe, especially with younger customers, it is very popular.
What about the men?
It is difficult to say whether a similar concept would work exclusively for men.
I think it would have to be a little different.
The question is what to offer men,” Martin thinks.
"We also have tools for them, but to a limited extent." Most of the time, the masturbator is sold, in this case from the manufacturer Tenga.
It does not look like an anatomical imitation of the vagina, but rather like a shower gel or an egg or futuristic object.
They focus a lot on functionality and experiences in use.
In Japan, however, it is completely different.
It's amazing in me.
I thought the Japanese would suffer a lot for erotica, I object.
"That's the internet reality," I'm told.
The day-to-day is completely different.
Here in Europe, erotic tools are more associated with the fact that they are used by women.
In Japan, they are completely normal for men, and vice versa, they are taboo for women." Just for the sake of curiosity - what the Japanese brand Tenga, represented in the Intimacy boutique, sells worldwide, still accounts for about half of what is sold only in Japan.
In Our Waters
The Czechs and the Czechs are not at all cautious.
On the contrary, we are a very welcoming nation.
Definitely unlike countries such as Catholic Poland or Italy.
A typical business client is between 35 and 50 years old and "already has some experience with both sex life and some tools.
She will come up with something nice, better, which would complement her partner life, or for herself." Martin R<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xBE> and his business partner Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k <0xC5><0xA0>ebelka take care of her to make sure that each product is perfectly functional.
We also don’t want to get into the specialties of bondage and latex, because we don’t have room for it, and it doesn’t fit here.
Such things could discourage the ones we're trying to target.
Which are people who have always had a tough time going to the sex shop because they were afraid that something like that would look at them.
Many of the products on display on the shelves are really enjoyable.
This is also due to the selection of represented reputable brands.
Some of them even won design awards, including the Red Dot Design Award.
The first ever awarded was the aforementioned seahorse 'and it triggered a change across the industry.
It began to let go of cheap materials and, conversely, work with health-free, began to produce other designs, different colors...
The nice thing is that behind the design of some is the Czech, the popular designer Anna Mare<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1>.
I have to say that I was quite pleasantly surprised by how many people buy those Whoop.de.doo design items from Anna Mare<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1>, although they are relatively more expensive.
There are customers who go straight for Venus's balls from Anna Mare<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1>.
She did a really huge piece of work by presenting exactly what we are trying to present ourselves within the Czech Republic and abroad - that erotic tools can be done differently, nicely, with a story.
Ann's story began as a school job.
Now this is a finished product, which is also manufactured by us.
I wanted to have the production process under control and also wanted to know what materials and how Whoop.de.doo products are produced.
Because it is not a large production, but a small series, it is certainly more expensive than a large series.
Maybe I'm a little against the current, but I think it's important to keep up with the development here in the Czech Republic.
It could be calm that in a few years we will not be able to produce anything," Anna later describes to me the situation, who agrees with Martin that our society is becoming more and more open.
He does not have a negative or negative attitude.
At the very least, people are desperate.
Anna Mare<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1> currently has a vibrator on offer, for which you can have a personal message prepared, and this year she also plans her own lubricating gel.
Next year, there will be more vibrating eggs and more news.
The Limits of Healthy Sex
I wonder where the boundaries of what's right are.
Is there anything Martin R<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xBE> would no longer do?
It is very difficult to define.
What seems normal to one, may seem completely abnormal to the other, so we are rather defined by the range of brand manufacturers.
None of them are allowed to go to some extremes.
Before we say goodbye, I have one last question: What was the craziest demand they got?
Just this week, an e-mail came in, in which a lady asked for a masturbation aid for her friend with a nature of twenty-eight centimeters long.
So we had to write to her that unfortunately we don't have anything like that.
The question remains whether any of us have made a joke," Martin measures me with a suspicious look.
And that happens from time to time...
An injury to Karl Gott.
After two Alzheimer's cancers!
His friend Karel <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>dr<0xC3><0xBD> is struggling with a serious illness.
Karl Gott's best friend fights a disease that will steal people's memories.
"Yes, it's true, unfortunately," the singer himself confirmed the sad information of the Lightning.
I know about my illness, and for the time being, I am quite able to cope with it.
"I'm taking medications that slow down the accompanying symptoms of the disease," he added, thanking his loved ones for their support.
The whole branched family came together to make life easier for Karl.
Eva's wife tries to be home, as best as possible, and the daughters from the first marriage of Zuzana and Teresa come to her father's house on the White Mountain.
<0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>d<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> fought cancer twice and passed on his experience to Slav<0xC3><0xAD>k to support him in his demanding treatment.
He has 60 chemo therapies.
After them, he was able to return to work on the tennis court and on the ski slopes.
"I've been told by an astrologer that I'll be here by 90," said Karel Blesku.
He's a fighter.
He still wants to sing.
"I keep repeating the words of the songs so that I don't forget them," Karel admitted.
Even actress Kv<0xC4><0x9B>ta Vialov<0xC3><0xA1> is now battling the same disease at the institute.
Do you have an Alzheimer's patient in your family?
Take a look at how to treat him.
The Chilean parliament has lifted the ban on interruptions, the law will assess the UC.
In Chile, an absolute ban on the artificial termination of pregnancy is still in place, so it must not be carried out for health reasons.
“I’m sorry that the legislators have filed a complaint with the Constitutional Court and that now ten people will decide what we’ve been working on in parliament for more than two years,” said Socialist Senator Isabel Allende.
Chile’s Constitutional Court has ten members and is expected to get a new president by the end of August, which AFP says is close to the opposition.
The law repealing the absolute ban on interruptions, initiated by the current president Michelle Bachelet, was passed by the Senate on July 19.
The legal opposition then announced that the law would go to court because it said it violates the right of an unborn child to life.
MEPs postponed the vote on the bill last month until it was analysed by the Joint Parliamentary Committee.
On Wednesday, MPs approved the proposal, and the Senate did so again after them.
Under the new legislation, the criminal artificial termination of pregnancy should be stopped in three cases: if the life of a woman is threatened, if the fetus has no hope of survival, or if the pregnancy originated from rape.
According to the Spanish newspaper El Pa<0xC3><0xAD>s, similar exceptions have existed in Chile since 1931, even before women were granted the right to vote there in 1949.
The absolute ban on interruptions was imposed in 1989 by right-wing dictator Augusto Pinochet, just months before he left office.
Chile is one of the few countries in the world where there is an absolute ban on interruptions.
The others are Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Haiti, Malta and Honduras.
In El Salvador, for example, there are now about 20 women behind bars who are serving up to 30 years in prison for interruption of pregnancy.
In many cases, according to human rights defenders, it was a spontaneous abortion, which the court described as murder.
Is there anything sacred at all?
Trump’s White House is now Statue of Liberty
An unmistakable sign of regime change is the critique of the statue.
The Americans could tell about it as well as everyone else - see the carefully staged overthrow of the statue of Saddam Hussein in Baghdad's Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, a key proponent of Trump’s regime, certainly knew what he was doing when, during a passionate debate with CNN reporter Jim Acosta on presidential proposals to drastically restrict legal immigrants, he set out with a symbolic axe at the Svoboda Statue.
It's worth noting that Miller didn't attack the statue as such.
This would be the result of a crowd of owners of cruise ships and imitators of the Statue of Liberty.
However, he attacked its importance, specifically the fact that in 1903 a plaque with the famous poem Emmy Lazarus was placed on the base, up to 17 years after the completion of the monument.
Miller condemned Acosta, saying, “I don’t want to let myself down in history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that sheds light on the whole world.
A poem that has been added to the base, and to which you refer, is not part of it."
Miller is actually right, but as he said, this is not about history.
These are especially striking words of Emmy Lazarus, which resonate with today - he invites not only immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Let the one who falls to me, the one who is poor, the one who can barely breathe, the one who is poor in the midst of the worm."
And it is in the modern age that we can see these “poor worms” better than ever on our screens.
Miller did not try to criticize poetry – he wanted to explain that these people are not welcome in the United States.
This conflict about the importance of the statue is part of a comprehensive political and cultural war: it is essentially a conflict about the importance of America.
Emma Lazarus, as well as her friends, who after her death tried to put plaques with poems on the base of the statue, knew quite well that she was deserting into a high political game.
The statue was intended to express the union of the French and American republican governments by representing a classic theme, i.e. the feminine embodiment of freedom.
Emma Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem, the female character is not abstract, but has her own voice.
She also has a very different name: Mother of Emigrants.
Combining poetry with the idea of women is a brilliant feminist move and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And in the same way that Emma Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, right-wingers have long sought to reverse this meaning.
Well-known commentator Rush Limbaugh - John the Baptist in Trump's rise to power - argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not actually invite anyone into the country, but represents early neoconstructivism, bringing the American flame to the rest of the world: "The Statue of Liberty is running out.
It exports the fruit of freedom from the United States and offers it to the rest of the world.
It is not meant to illuminate the way to the United States.”
Limbaugh is curiously confronted with an important thing.
The meaning of the statue depends on the angle of view.
Emma Lazarus describes the statue from the point of view of an exhausted and damned traveler, who often arrives in the heart of a new country after a long and terrifying voyage across the ocean.
It’s literally a view of the world through the eyes of people looking for shelter and a chance at a better life.
From this point of view, he expresses the statue of hope and listens to their needs.
And that is, of course, a perspective that neither Miller nor Trump certainly recognize.
Their passion is not to illuminate the way, but to incite hatred, which is their only source of power.
2017 World Athletics Championships: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the British team
Eilidh Doyle remembers the time when the British team had only two Scottish members
British athletic federation director Neil Black said the strong squad of 16 Scots in the World Championship team would be “a huge benefit to the team.”
For the World Championships in London 2017, which starts on Friday, a record number of Scottish athletes have been selected.
Black believes that “something strange is happening” in Scotland, and British athletics could be learned from the Scots.
"We're trying to understand and adapt to it - we're going to work on it," Black said.
“I’ve talked to people from the Scottish Sports Institute and they think it has something to do with what they’ve done.
Representatives of Scottish athletics think it has something to do with what they did.
British athletics: it has to do with what they did.
People on the streets think so too.
Whatever it is, it’s absolutely amazing.”
Several Scottish athletes will seek medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart – who will compete against Sir Mo Farah in the 5000 m race, while Eilidh Doyle was selected as the team's captain.
"She's going to be modest.
Her opening speech was amazing," Black said.
“Several athletes, whether Scotsmen or athletes of other nationalities, came out of the room with a sense of immense pride and motivation.
The passion and the unseen feelings with which Eilidh spoke were unrepeatable."
The silver medalist of the Commonwealth, who will compete in the 400 m over the hurdles at her fifth World Cup, said it was “unbelievable” that there were 16 Scottish athletes in the British team.
The previous record for 1983 and 2015 is seven.
The middle track runner Muirov<0xC3><0xA1> has set only five British and two European records in the last year.
The race will take place at 1500 m and 5000 m.
Another of the great Scots is Chris O'Hare, who will run the 1500 m track. In this season he won the British team races and the Annual Games.
Doyle recalls her first championship, at which she was the only other Scottish member of the Lee McConnell team.
The team captain said she was “very proud” that not only did a large number of her teammates get into the team, but in many cases they would also attack for participation in the finals and medals.
“What’s unusual about being a team captain is that I’ve been chosen by other team members. It’s been a great honor for me, but knowing that I’ve been chosen by team members is a pleasure.”
"Obviously I'm very proud of all the Scots who got into the team.
It proves where I've gone.
They are the athletes who will think of the front seats on the stage.
And my introductory speech?
Yeah, I think she did.
I just pointed out the fact that we can be proud of this year’s championship because it’s taking place on home soil.
It’s important to take advantage of the support of home fans and rejoice at the fact that we’re back in the Olympic stadium.
I got a second chance at the race and I'm going to enjoy the incredible atmosphere."
Blocking critics on Facebook: Don’t run for public office if you can’t stand the criticism of voters
The father of our country knew of his criticism.
Americans loved George Washington, but it didn’t take long for the newspapers to start criticizing him for anything, from domestic politics to his political views.
Yes, this criticism did not leave him cold.
But he didn't try to silence the critics.
Because in 1783 Washington said, “Freedom of speech can be taken away from us – and stupid and silent we will be led like sheep to slaughter.”
That brings me to Maryland is Governor Larry Hogan, who needs to work on him to start acting like Washington.
Hogan’s employees blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who freely expressed their views on his official Facebook page.
This week, the U.S. Civil Liberties Union accused him of these acts.
The gubernatorial staff dismissed the lawsuit as unfounded, and many “who cares” views appeared in comments on the Internet.
“It’s just Facebook,” many users said.
It does matter, though.
Especially when it comes to people like Hogan.
In an absolutely democratic state, he is a very popular Republican governor.
He can boast the second-highest popularity of all 50 governors.
Hogan's not intriguing.
As can be seen, the state governs itself with self-confidence and strictly observes the principles.
It turned out to be also useful in using Facebook as the main means of connecting with its voters – the exception is not even the publication of the first bare-headed photo after completing chemotherapy.
Blocking people who visit the governor’s website – which is a public forum, labeled as official and managed by its employees paid from taxpayers’ money – is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with the Washington Post, Hogan spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor by saying that the blocking of comments took place from the position of moderating posts.
However, using the image of Internet trolls, spammers or scattered people is too easy.
The Washington Post reported to several real people who had deleted the posts.
And that is exactly what they are - real people who speak to their chosen leaders; a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, no trolls.
As everyone said, their comments were polite and thoughtful, not grim.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his commentary, appealing to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
The lawyer for Bowie Lakshmi Sarma Ramani, Md., asked about the hate crimes, but her comment was not hateful.
“I have kindly noted that I am disappointed by his inadequate response to hate crimes and other current reports,” she wrote in the comments section of the Washington Post.
“I don’t like the idea that once a certain number of people comment on the same topic, some people are labeled as promoting so-called collective effort, rather than being recognized as a larger group of interested citizens.”
What the governor’s employees called a “focused spam rate” would most likely be called “defensive.”
The modern Facebook era allows us to easily manage posts by blocking criticism or deleting negative comments.
It is much more convenient than in the past, when the same procedure would require the sending of employees to the streets, where they would collect and burn all the prints with criticism, or arrest or silence Protestants.
And that's exactly what's happening, only in digital form.
Hogan is not the last public agent to be criticized for smearing Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is facing a lawsuit by Twitter users who have been denied access to his account.
One of the first important regulations was born last week in Virginia.
The chairman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors, James C. Cacheris, violated the first amendment in Alexandria, where she prevented one of the voters from accessing her Facebook page.
Governor Matt Bevin (R) of Kentucky also received a visit from the ACLU due to his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
In the days of Washington, the low price of mail had virtually the same impact as the internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of daily presses quadrupled and his position as leader was challenged by many anonymous writers.
And even in those days, Washington had to deal with anonymous trolls.
People writing under pseudonyms such as "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote letters to the newspapers and questioned Washington's decision.
According to historical documents collected by people within the online project Papers of George Washington Project, petitions were gathered in his office criticizing his position against the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation agreement with Britain.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of speech, disagreement and intimidation lies at the very foundation of our nation.
And the real leader has to accept it.
The Czechs quickly took advantage of free roaming, consuming more data abroad than at home.
The Czechs consume more of their tariffs abroad than they do at home.
Most often they move in Austria, but the consumption of data in the summer season is dominated by Croatia.
On holiday, they have more time to browse the web, and under the sun they usually do not have the ability to connect to Wi-Fi.
Beach, bathing and a smart phone in hand.
This is what a typical Czech holiday in Croatia looks like after customers can take advantage of the services of the local operators at domestic prices.
This is according to the latest O2 statistics.
Thanks to the new roaming rules, the majority of Czech travellers abroad have more data available within the voucher than at home.
It is therefore no wonder that in Croatia, where the minimum number of our passengers drive during the winter, data consumption has even increased fifty-fold in this summer season.
In the second place in the ranking of consumed data, Italy was placed.
The Czechs take the most minutes from Germany, where many of them go to work even during the summer.
According to the data of the Association of Czech Travel Agencies, Croatia is visited by 800,000 Czechs annually, making it our most popular tourist destination.
However, people here exchanged the book for sharing experiences using a mobile phone.
This year's record was July 7.
"Tens of millions of photos would fit into the transferred data," said Silvia Cieslarov<0xC3><0xA1>, director of the mobile segment at O2.
Although Croatia is leading in data volume, the highest number of Czech users moves in neighboring countries.
Austria is in first place, followed by Germany and Slovakia.
Croatia is fourth and Italy is sixth.
We go to Austria for hiking and active holidays, for which we do not have so much time to browse the internet.
"Through Austria, the Czechs are heading towards the Adriatic," Cieslarov<0xC3><0xA1> explained.
While in terms of data, the operator recorded high year-on-year growth after the release of roaming charges, in terms of telephony, the growth is much lower.
The number of minutes roaming has doubled compared to last year.
With a huge leap forward in front of other countries, Germany dominates here.
“Roaming trains are rather used by corporate customers on business trips,” added Cieslarov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for a homely atmosphere at the Renaissance Club
Former golfer Ronan Rafferty will hope for the next three days in a relaxed atmosphere at the Renaissance Club in Scotland’s East Lothian administrative area, which hosts the 25th Scottish Senior Open.
Ronan Rafferty, who comes from Northern Ireland, last year at the nearby Archerfield Links golf course after the trip to the final, was named Paul Eales. This year he will play the role of the tournament's ambassador to represent the club's founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
“I watched the Renaissance Club grow slowly in front of my eyes and this year’s tournament will show the world its beauty,” Rafferty said.
“The players will be able to love the first-class quality of the playground.
Jerry did a great job.
He is a passionate advocate of this game and is proud of his achievements.
This year’s tournament is in the right hands.”
Englishman Eales will defend the championship for the first time, despite winning both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour during his 32-year career.
"I feel good about it," said the Southport golfer.
“I didn’t have the opportunity to defend my win at the Extremadura Open because the tournament was cancelled a year after my win.
Returning to this part of the country is magical.
It's a nice place to go golfing.
I remember last year, when for me and my wife, Sharon, winning really meant a lot.
It was a wonderful time that I will not forget.”
Gary Orr returns home to join the European Senior Tour after celebrating 50 years in the region this year.

Poverty and Death in Indonesian Gold Country
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use the stove.
In fact, it rarely uses a pan.
In her wooden cottage, located in the capital Paniai Enarotali in the Indonesian province of Papua, a woman usually simply throws a sweet potato - in the local "note" language - right into the fire.
After half an hour, he takes out the potato and tastes delicious with his hands not wet.
Bardina sits on a muddy ground - the house is not equipped with furniture - where she does her daily work, such as washing laundry in boiling water from a nearby pond.
A bucket in a room without a roof complements the toilet.
As the youngest of her husband’s four wives, she was not assigned any field for processing.
Polygamy is common here.
Working until late at night poses a danger: most men in the village are unemployed and often drink alcohol. In addition, soldiers reside in the village.
“In the afternoon after five o’clock, no one is allowed to wander around the village,” says Bardina.
It is a rare view of everyday life on the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was declared part of Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum, when only 1,026 seniors were forced to vote in the form of a public outcry.
The current movement protesting against Dutch rules quickly turned its anger against the Jakarta government, which controlled the entire region with the exception of foreign journalists or civil rights watchdogs.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua - independent Papua New Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is such a remote and desolate city that you can reach after a 90-minute flight from the capital of the province of Jayapura to Nabire, and then a five-hour drive.
Public transport does not work in this area.
The city with 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses lined with bamboo fences, roofs made of woolly sheets in shades of gray and razor color.
Very few Indonesians, for example, journalists, and practically no foreigners, were looking at this place.
Before the arrival of the Christians, the locals worshiped God in the name of Uga Tamee.
And that's not all.
“We weren’t used to wearing these dresses,” says Bardina, pointing to her colorful, hand-woven turban, a dark t-shirt and a shiny skirt.
"We used to only wear sheets."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia - 28% of the population lives below the poverty line and child mortality and literacy is one of the worst in all of Asia.
At the same time, it is an Indonesian country of gold.
The largest and most lucrative gold mine in the world, Grasberg, which owns Freeport McMoran, is located only 60 miles from Paniai, a rocky province about the size of New Jersey, which is home to about 153,000 people.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua supports the estimated value of $78 billion in timber mining.
This wealth, however, is a source of suffering for the Papuans and a guarantee of repression by the powerful Indonesian army.
A 2005 investigation by the New York Times found that Freeport paid about $20 million to local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004, including $150,000 for a single officer.
Papuans calling for self-government are threatening this golden goose and are therefore severely repressed.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed since 1969 and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian army.
The mass murders in the Papuan tribal region during the 1970s amounted to genocide, according to the Asian Commission on Human Rights.
Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region last year.
We Will Lose Everything, a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, describes the atrocities that occurred last year as extrajudicial executions, torture - according to another report - particularly popular rape and execution by electric currents - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrators.
“It is difficult to calculate the number of victims because incidents occur every week,” said Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
The whole situation was aggravated by the fact that Papuan resources were attracting colonists to Indonesia.
Of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province, 83% report to Christianity, but demographics are changing with the influx of Muslim immigrants from Indonesian islands - Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Java canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado or a mixture of vegetables with peanut sauce.
The locals are fighting for survival.
“Immigrants began selling chickens and vegetables in traditional markets at lower prices than local Papuans,” explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old who was born in Paniai and moved to work in the capital, Jayapura province.
"The natives of Papua - mama-mama (women) - thus lost their jobs."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, who is known as Jokowi, promised in his 2014 presidential campaign a solution to inequality and violations of rights.
The former carpenter secured his way to the presidential palace in Jakarta, 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Paniai.
But very little has changed in Papua and the local people feel betrayed.
“Our hearts were broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokpwi in the hope that he would hear our call for justice,” You said.
The fact is that just two months after Jakowi’s inauguration in October, Paniai experienced a great shock.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children sang a Christmas song at a camp fire in the town of Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers appeared on motorcycles from the bush of the night.
Two of the surprised children told them that they should turn on the lights.
One of the soldiers touched the exclamation and tone she was uttered with and later returned with four more soldiers, local parish priest Yavedt Tebai said.
Two of the soldiers pursued a group of children in a crowded condition and stabbed them with their weapons, reported victims and witnesses.
One of the soldiers then set fire to a group of children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so hard that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, someone set fire to a nearby election commission building, and the next day things got even worse.
About 1,000 young Papuan men and women gathered on the football field in front of the local police station and the military command, and demanded justice.
They came with ceremonial hunting bows and performed a waiti dance - in which the singing of birds is running in a circle - of the Papuan tribe Mee Pago.
Several Protestants began throwing stones at the buildings.
As tension escalated, a radio order was issued to the soldiers: “If the crowd tries at least three times for resistance, you are allowed to shoot,” according to TIME Weekly, the content of which has never been published in the local media.
Jeremiah Kayame (56), the head of Enarotali Kego Koto district, recognized the imminent danger and called on residents to leave their homes.
But no one was neglecting his words.
“When I turned around, someone shot me in the left wrist,” he told TIME on the porch of his ruggedly painted wooden house.
Kayame does not yet know who the shooter was, but according to him, the bullet belonged to one of the soldiers present.
“There were a lot of people around and a lot of people were shot,” he added.
One of the locals, Alfius Youw, was shot three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shooting.
“I ran to the body to make sure it was really him,” she told TIME magazine in a gloomy voice of John, who, like many Indonesians, uses only one name.
"I saw him dead... I kissed him."
Papuan police inspector General Yotje Mende told reporters that his officers had only “secured” the station that was under attack.
“We have to defend ourselves when people threaten us with death,” said a Papuan police spokesman, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, in 2015.
“It’s a matter of life and death.”
According to Human Rights Watch, five protesters have been killed and many have been injured.
The news of the murders was leaked to the Jakarta media the following day.
Three weeks later, he gave a passionate speech to Joko in Jayapur, expressing his sympathy for the families of the victims and vowing to deal with violence in Papua.
“I demand an immediate solution to this problem so that it can never happen again,” he said.
In October 2016, the Minister of National Security Wiranto announced that it would set up an extrajudicial mechanism to resolve acts of violence that occurred in the past.
Almost immediately, however, an apology began to be heard.
“Most of the violence has happened a long time ago.
Some of them occurred in the 1990s and some at the beginning of the 21st century.
I want to say that we are determined to punish these violent acts, but it will not be an easy task," he said.
In a June 5 interview with TIME, which took place in Jakarta, Wiranto claimed that he did not plan to take any action in Papua.
Instead, I say that “all cases will be brought before the court.”
The Wiranto, which the United Nations has accused of “crimes against humanity” based on more than one thousand deaths during the 1999 independent elections in East Timor, said 11 human rights violations in Papua have so far been resolved, including the Paniain incident.
The families of the victims of the shooting in Paniai welcomed his claim with distrust.
“In the last three years I’ve been asked four times, but I haven’t expected anything yet,” John said.
"I'm tired."
As he says, a few years later, he still lives in fear.
"I'm afraid," he says himself.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me or someone will shoot me."
His brother Yacobus confirmed the view of many Paniai residents who are afraid to talk about the incident.
According to him, he was killed by members of the army after helping to bury four of the victims.
“After the body was buried, the army started looking for me,” he said.
And the shooting is still going on.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot at villagers in neighbouring Deiyai.
A clash, in which one person died and 17 others were injured, occurred between the villagers and the manager of the construction company, who refused to provide assistance in transporting the man unconscious to the hospital.
Ravianus Douw, 24, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the company building.
According to the police, the villagers threw stones at the villagers, and their response was a warning shot.
Locals, however, claim that the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) started shooting at the crowd and killed one person.
“There was panic, we were afraid of retaliation,” said 29-year-old Domingo Badia, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the arrival of the wounded.
“I haven’t left the house for two days.”
The Deiyai parliament demanded the punishment of the police officers involved and the withdrawal of the mobile brigade from the area.
Paniai has always been a thorn in the eye for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development only deepens the separation of the indigenous peoples of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes who live in the central highlands.
Many of them joined the Papua Liberation Movement (OPM), an army of insurgents that protects the rights of Papuans by attacking and abducting Indonesian police.
Some of the leaders of the OPM come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Judas Kogoya.
In recent years, as a result of the attacks, the army has arrested and arbitrarily detained thousands of Paniai residents, all under the pretext of “providing national sovereignty”.
Some of them are never seen again.
Paniai is known among the people of Papua as the “tragic and forgotten place”.
Oil brings poverty to the fire.
The little rice that is sold in Enarotali is too expensive for the locals.
The bread is equally unattainable.
The locals grow their food: mainly sweet potatoes, fruit and leafy vegetables.
Women work in the fields; each of them cultivates four or five fields with sweet potatoes.
Most of the harvest is intended for the needs of the family, the rest are sold in the local market.
Ten pieces of sweet potatoes cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Since Nabire Airport has opened more air routes and new immigrants have flown into the country, economic inequality between native Papuans and immigrants has increased.
Already so few jobs are usually occupied by more educated and wealthy immigrants.
Parrots rarely have the capital and education they need to get into business.
“Young people are moving out of villages because of a lack of jobs and money,” said John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council.
Thanks to isolation, the province of Papua is hidden from the world.
There are also stringent rules for foreign journalists.
Earlier this year, two French journalists - Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp - were expelled from Papua for "lack of cooperation with the authorities", despite the fact that they received so rare permission to film.
Phelim Kine, deputy director of the Asian branch of Human Rights Watch, promised Jokowi in his election campaign the abolition of strict rules for journalists and the achievement of transparency and development, but this has never happened.
“Foreign journalists working in the most rebellious eastern areas of Papua and West Papua are at great risk: non-recognition of visas and blacklisting,” he said in a statement.
The lack of reports from foreign journalists means that the international pressure on Indonesia in the Papuan case is largely limited.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "different and widespread acts of violence" in Papua, including the shootings in Paia.
These countries have also supported OPM in the past.
A spokesman for the Indonesian Foreign Ministry, Arrmanatha Nasir, told reporters in Jakarta: “In Indonesia, there is still a democratic system and the media is free, so it is difficult to hide the evidence of human rights violations.”
Locals are calling for the participation of foreign governments.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by human rights envoy Kees Van Barer, visited Jayapura on May 4, locals were calling for a source who also attended the meeting, but wanted to remain anonymous, the slogan "we want our pain".
In Indonesia, more elections are scheduled for 2019, but the Papuans say they will not vote for Jokowi.
“Jokowi is a man who has good intentions but is surrounded by people associated with the shootings in Paniai,” said Gobau, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the people of Paniai – in addition to living in constant fear of a robbery army – are living in poverty, miserable education and the health system.
Gobai argues that the inhabitants of Paniai, like the other Papuans, consider their voice to be a “debt” that must pay Joko.
“They don’t want money, they want justice,” he added.
Despite the threats and intimidation of the family of the victims of the Panian shooting, the last symbolic act of resistance continues: they bury the bodies of the victims on the grounds opposite the police and military stations.
Knowing that justice will never be done enough, at least it will not allow the responsible persons to forget about their crimes.
“A member of our family was killed,” Yacobus said with his head bent.
"What can we do?"
The French navy has captured a huge supply of cocaine to Australia.
The French Navy has detained a 1.46-ton yacht carrying approximately $256 million worth of cocaine in the Pacific.
The shipment was headed to Australia.
During the attack, a four-member crew of the ship, apparently composed of people from Lithuania and Latvia, was arrested.
The yacht, named after Afalina, sailed out of South America and was taken by police to the port of Nouméa, the metropolis of the French overseas territory of New Caledonia in the Pacific, after being detained.
The Australian intelligence service said it would, in cooperation with its international partners, seek to determine exactly where and where the drugs were heading, and to reveal the "Lithuanian syndicate".
"We are grateful to the French authorities for the measures taken to stop large amounts of drugs heading to Australia," said Col Blanch, its executive director.
Drugs were destroyed in Noumée this week.
Australia is an attractive destination for its smugglers due to high street prices.
The country also faces the problem of an increasing number of people suffering from drug addiction.
The current situation has not been the first in recent times.
Last month, three men were accused of transporting large amounts of drugs from the United States to Australia, who tried to smuggle across the Pacific in a small plane.
Seniors do not feel thirsty, drinking is necessary to remind them.
The problem could be in homes for seniors, the solution could be an infusion of a physiological solution that is punctured with a thin needle under the skin, according to a doctor at the Geriatric Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague Pavly M<0xC3><0xA1>dlov<0xC3><0xA1>.
However, these are currently only used in medical facilities.
The older a person is, the more the amount of water in his body decreases.
"In addition, it loses a sense of thirst, so seniors generally take in less fluids and dehydrate very quickly," said M<0xC3><0xA1>dlov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Two liters should definitely drink.
"But getting into an old man so much fluid is a big problem," she added.
In homes for seniors, she says, it is often not looked after by any doctor.
In hospitals, dehydration is usually treated with infusions.
"I think it should be gradually introduced there, too, so that they can get subcutaneous infusions," she said.
According to her, up to two half-liter bottles of physiological solution can be supplied to old people in a day.
A lack of fluids can cause numbness, headaches and decreased performance.
Dehydration manifests itself as a complete loss of self-sufficiency.
“One day the old man will say he can’t get out of bed, he’s talking confused,” she added.
In case of negligence, it can lead to a stroke.
The blood clots and clogs the blood vessel in the brain, also at risk of kidney failure.
Lying patients should not be covered with a feather, maximum cotton sheet.
Disposable diapers can also be a problem.
“It’s more nursing-intensive, but it would be ideal to uncover the patient from time to time and let the skin ventilate,” she said.
The Torch has burned in Dubai for the second time.
In Dubai, one of the world’s largest residential skyscrapers was set on fire on Friday, with firefighters forced to evacuate all the residents of a 337-metre-high and 79-story building.
In the last two years, it is already the second fire of this high-rise building, which bears the appropriate name The Torch (Pochodene).
All the residents of the building were evacuated and no injuries were reported, the cause of the fire is unknown.
“We were asleep and we were woken up by an alarm. We heard a scream.
It took us ten minutes to run down from the 50th floor," Geroge, one of the residents of the skyscraper, told Reuters.
Dubai Civil Defense said firefighters managed to get the fire under control around 4 a.m. (00:00 GMT) and continued to cool the building.
The government officials added that they are providing replacement accommodation for the affected populations.
The incident could again spark a discussion about the safety of materials used to plaster high-rise buildings around the world.
The results of the investigation, initiated by the Torch skyscraper management after the fire in 2015, showed that the lining and external panels used for decoration or insulation were the most damaged.
British police said the insulation and cladding system at London’s Grenfell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of fire in a June fire that killed nearly 80 people.
The results of the survey showed that more than one in five passengers to the U.S. are placing prohibited items on board the aircraft.
A survey of passengers showed that more than 20 percent of them knowingly or unwittingly transported prohibited items through the U.S. government agency’s Transportation Security Administration checkpoint on board the aircraft. At least six percent of passengers boarded the aircraft with their knives or knives.
Less than one percent of passengers said they were late to find out they were travelling with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The results of a survey conducted by Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - which was answered by more than 1,000 respondents - showed that younger passengers were more likely to be in violation of the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted to knowingly attempting to travel with an item that is prohibited by the TSA, 19.7 percent were passengers with several thousand hours flown compared to less than 15 percent of Generation X members.
The most common items that have escaped the attention of TSA include food and alcohol.
More than three percent of the respondents consciously conveyed a sharp subject over the watch, while 2.2 percent of the women surveyed and 3.7 percent of the men surveyed also admitted that they intentionally conveyed banned drugs on board the aircraft.
The company said it was conducting a survey of passengers around the world to find out how many of them accidentally passed unauthorised items through airport checks and how many did so voluntarily.
It’s no surprise that most people who have carried unauthorised items – whether consciously or unconsciously – travel by plane very often.
As the company has pointed out, the TSA directives are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People often don’t know what fluids and how much they can carry on a plane.
It is not surprising, therefore, that the TSA contained the largest amount of the forbidden liquid.
For some time, people thought that the TSA would handle books in the same way as smuggled goods.
Transfers of liquids are allowed on domestic flights, not international flights.
EPA chief Scott Pruitt on postponement of planned directives to reduce emissions from the Obama administration
After the Environmental Protection Agency was sued by fifteen states, its boss Scott Pruitt appealed his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the former Obama administration’s plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
Pruitt has introduced changes to his plan, responding more vehemently than previous governments to the needs of state environmental regulators.
However, he did not mention the legal challenge against his previous position in the Federal Court of Appeal.
This is the last date set for 1 October, when states should begin to comply with the 2015 Regulation on the reduction of ground-based ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would postpone the deal for one year and order a more detailed study of the plan to avoid “interventions with local decisions or imminent economic growth.”
Pruitt, who served as Oklahoma’s Attorney General before EPA chief Donald Trump took office, has long served as a reliable opponent of more stringent environmental regulations.
Since he settled in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved or postponed the regulations proposed by the chemical and fossil industry.
The sudden Wednesday turnover is the biggest legal failure for Pruitt’s regulatory agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that an EPA contractor exceeded its authority in an attempt to delay the Obama administration’s integration plan, which required oil and gas companies to reduce methane leaks.
In a statement released on Wednesday evening, Pruitt proposed its version of the ozone standards and strengthened the EPA’s commitment to cooperating with states through complex processes and meeting new standards within the given time frame.
“For the previous EPA administration, it has often failed to meet deadlines and waited for it to be sued by activist groups and others, agreeing to settle and further set up plans,” Pruitt, who in his previous position filed more than a dozen lawsuits with the EPA, said in a statement.
“We don’t believe in regulation through litigation and we take compliance seriously.
We never joke about our status and the authority that comes from it.”
The EPA statement, however, states that Pruitt may, at some point, use “the possibility of delays and any other legally available authorities” to ensure that the regulations “will be based on sound policies and the most accessible information.”
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader revision of the ozone rules.
The White House budget approved last month seeks to postpone implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been passed by the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led a coalition of states that sued this week, said the group would not allow legal pressure.
"Turning the EPA's views - following our trial - is an important victory for the health and safety of those 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by air pollution," Schneiderman added.
New York City was joined by California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Washington, D.C.
Ground-based ozone occurs when common harmful substances emitted by automobiles, power plants, oil refineries, chemical power plants and other sources react in the atmosphere with solar radiation.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive people and thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health advocates and environmentalists are appreciative of Pruitt’s sudden change.
“It’s worrying what pressure needs to be developed to change the minds of those responsible and protect the air we breathe,” said Lori Ann Burd from the Center for Biological Diversity.
“We must continue to fight the ideological pull of the Trump administration, which is trying to help polluters and special interests.”
He polished the man with acid, but according to the court, he's not dangerous.
You never know what might happen to you.
At one point you are at home with your family and you laugh, at the other your whole life will suddenly change from the ground up.
And the worst part is that you can't do anything about it.
A similar fate was encountered by Andreas Christopherose of the United Kingdom, whose face was polished with acid by an unknown assailant, who was eventually released from the blame.
The news was reported by Reuters website.
In December 2014, someone knocked on the door at Christopheros's.
Andreas said he was going to open the door.
He thought there was probably a courier behind the door who was supposed to deliver Christmas presents for the family that day.
Instead, there was a cruel surprise waiting for him.
The man, whom he had never seen in his life, immediately after opening him without warning, soaked him with acid with the words, "This is for you, my friend."
The pain was indescribable.
“The clothes broke on me like nothing and I just felt an incredible pain on my skin,” said Andreas.
The family quickly transported him to the hospital, but there his relatives learned a terrible news - according to doctors, he had no chance of surviving.
Several weeks after the incident, doctors were constantly afraid that their patient would be exposed to an infection that threatened to penetrate his wounds.
His injury was very serious.
Ninety percent of the patients had a face that doctors tried to put together with skin from other parts of the patient’s body.
A major complication for Christopherose was the loss of eyelids.
It's probably the most painful thing I've ever experienced.
"You can't hide from the unexpected light, you can't close your eyes," he described his suffering.
Today, Christopheros has twelve operations behind him, which are by far not the last.
Injuries to victims of acid attacks may require hundreds of surgeries and years of treatment, according to plastic surgeons.
Even after demanding and long-term treatment, the victims have tissues scarred for the rest of their lives.
"Sometimes people don't recover and fight deformation and deformation all their lives," said Professor Peter Dziewulski, a spokesman for the British Association of Plastic and Aesthetic Surgeons.
The attacker was mistaken.
As for the attack, Christopheros is certain that an unknown man must have confused him with someone.
The smuggler believed he was taking revenge on a man who sexually abused his loved one.
The police investigated the whole case properly, and the assailant was later found.
The man was originally sentenced to at least eight years in prison.
However, later the verdict to the surprise of Christopher's family changed substantially.
"Three judges eventually came to the conclusion that the sentence should be abolished because the man is not considered a threat to the public," Christopheros said.
Over the past few years, the number of seizures of fertilisers has increased significantly.
The Ministry of the Interior has expressed itself on the issue by planning to establish new guidelines for state prosecutors on the classification of groceries.
They should be placed among the dangerous weapons.
Victims of such attacks are not willing to give up.
They demand that the UK government impose stricter and longer sentences of deprivation of liberty on people who attack their surroundings with acid or other greasy substances.
They also require stricter controls on the sale of dangerous substances, which are often commonly available in different stores, as these are different detergents.
In the largest city of the United Arab Emirates, Dubai burned at night the famous skyscraper The Torch, which is among the largest residential buildings in the world.
According to the Dubai Civil Defense, residents of the 80-story building were able to evacuate in time and no one was injured.
According to a spokesman for the Dubai police, a fire broke out on the ninth floor and spread upwards.
However, according to several residents of the house, it was the opposite.
"It started on the 67th floor, that's how they told us," one of the tenants said.
Also, according to another tenant, cited by Reuters, the fire erupted in the highest floors and spread down with falling hot rubble.
We're asleep.
We were woken up by an alarm, people were screaming.
"We ran down the stairs, it took us about ten minutes from the 50th floor," George said.
Another eyewitness told CNN that the fires had engulfed about 40 apartments.
On the ground, a fire destroyed at least two cars when they were hit by burning parts of the building.
About two hours later, according to a civil defense statement, the fire managed to get under control.
The cause of its formation is not yet known.
According to witnesses, the power went out in the surrounding buildings.
A large fire damaged the Dubai skyscraper The Torch also in February 2015, destroying over a hundred apartments.
There are about 680 apartments in the entire building.
Nothing happened to anyone at the time, as the inhabitants were able to evacuate in time.
The Torch was built in 2011 and at that time it became the world’s tallest residential building with its 352 meters.
The record was set by another Dubai skyscraper the following year.
The bodybuilder had an incredible 14 doping drugs in his body.
He didn't win anyway.
According to the Corriere della Serra, there was a vast collection of illicit drugs in a sample of 23-year-old Ippolit – from steroids to diuretics to medications for Parkinson’s disease or anorexia.
Paradoxically, even this wild mix did not help him to the title, he finished fourth.
Now the bodybuilder is threatened with a four-year distance and criminal prosecution.
The record was 11.
Last year, Italian rugby player Davide Vasta was tested positive for 11 doping drugs, which was a record number of caught athletes.
The third-tier player began taking steroids a year prior to when he lost bodybuilding.
Lucka Vondr<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1> in the Czech Republic.
She was passionately hugging her ex-girlfriend!
Barely Lucka Vondr<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1> entered the territory of the Czech Republic, it is in one round.
It also attracts attention wherever it comes.
The last time she fell into the arms of her former lover Michal Dlouh<0xC3><0xBD>, with whom she lived for three years.
The actor was 12 years older at the time and already wanted a family.
Lucia was only 19 years old at the time and certainly did not want to hang her career on a nail.
So they went away, but the friends remained to this day.
They also did so at the TV Prima press conference, where they met for a long time.
Both coincidentally matched to the blue color.
At first they didn’t notice each other, but then they came closer, and Lucie laughed at Michal’s jokes until she fell behind her belly.
Then they hugged each other and posed to the photographers willingly.
However, their meeting was no coincidence, because they played a love affair together in the new series Prima Kapit<0xC3><0xA1>n Exner.
The Islamists were given a life in Britain for the preparation of the assassination.
A British court on Thursday sent four members of the Islamist cell, which called itself the Three Musketeers, for life and according to the prosecutor's office planned a terrorist attack on police and the army.
Four men, two of whom took part in a training camp in Pakistan and were previously convicted of similar acts, were arrested in August last year.
At the time, the authorities thought they were going to attack immediately.
In the car of one of the men, security agents found a partially finished pipe bomb, knives with inscriptions that mean "infidel" in Arabic, and a pattern of a gun.
This happened at the time MI5's secret service agent placed a listening device in the car.
"The recent assassinations have shown what horror the defendants could have caused if they hadn't been stopped," prosecutor Sue Hemming said in a statement.
Three convictions aged 28, 25 and 33 years can apply for dismissal after twenty years.
The fourth convict, who is 38 years old, can do so after 15 years behind bars.
During the trial in London, the men said they were innocent and that the weapons found in the car were placed there by MI5.
The court also heard him, but then rejected the defendants' claims.
Thursday was the warmest day of the year.
They measured 38.3 <0xC2><0xB0>C on Hodon<0xC3><0xAD>nsk.
Tuesday's temperature record of 37.3 degrees Celsius remained at its peak for just two days.
With 38.3 degrees Celsius recorded in the Watchtower in Hodoninsk, it was surpassed by Thursday, which thus became the warmest day of the year.
This was confirmed by the employees of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
On Tuesday, however, not many temperature records fell on Thursday.
On Tuesday, 35 of the 145 meteorological stations measured over 30 years were broken or set records.
On Thursday, only nine long-term measuring stations recorded record temperatures.
The temperature on Thursday was the same as the previous record for 2013.
In Lednice on B<0xC5><0x99>eclavsk on Thursday, 37.4 degrees exceeded the original maximum by four decimal degrees and in Poho<0xC5><0x99>elice on Brno, the current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three decimal degrees.
Both records, as well as the Sr<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xBE>nice, came from 2013.
In the west, it was 10 degrees less.
High temperatures occurred on Thursday, mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
After Str<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xBE>nica, the biggest heat in Dyj<0xC3><0xA1>kovic in Znojemsk and Brod nad Dyj<0xC3><0xAD> in B<0xC5><0x99>eclav, where the mercury climbed to 37.8 degrees, but did not exceed the record.
In contrast, for example, in western and northwestern Bohemia, according to the website of the <0xC4><0x8C>HM<0xC3><0x9A>, the highest temperatures so far were only around 22 degrees Celsius.
"The temperatures there started to rise until later in the afternoon," the meteorologists said.
The current heat in the Czech Republic will gradually fade, according to the Czech Republic, and more heavy rains could occur on Sunday.
In most places of Moravia, however, high temperatures will remain on Friday and in southeastern Moravia as well as on Saturday.
There are no tourists in China.
Beijing is losing billions due to its visa policy.
For decades, China has been trying to exert its influence without the use of force.
It spends ten billion dollars a year to support language schools and the construction of universities abroad, pushing its entertainment industry to foreign markets, and trying to attract Western tourists.
Beijing is not going to do that.
The state media there are talking about a plan to make tourism a driving force for economic transformation and modernization.
Last year, however, the number of arrivals increased by only 3.8 percent and about 80 percent of tourists to China came from Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.
This is due, among other things, to the fact that despite all its global aspirations, China does not welcome foreigners with open arms, assessing the situation in the world’s most populous country, economics professor Christopher Balding of Beijing University in an article for the Bloomberg agency.
An example that speaks for everything is China’s visa policy.
Only 13 countries have visa-free contact with China, and the citizens of the others have to manage their visas in advance.
The Chinese authorities in the US are therefore similar to the Chinese New Year celebrations.
The visa costs $140, but if you don’t want to wait long hours at the front, you have to pay $100 and more for additional services.
Such restrictions build up significant economic barriers.
A study in the Journal of Economics and Finance found that the need for a visa reduces the number of visitors to the country by 70 percent.
In 2015, only two million Americans visited mainland China, while Hong Kong, which accounts for less than three percent of China’s gross domestic product and lives there less than one percent of all population, visited 1.8 million Americans.
China often deepens this problem itself when tourism is used to achieve its political goals, for example in disputes with Taiwan and South Korea.
When China restricted transport to South Korea in the spring as part of a crack around the South Korean anti-missile system, the South Koreans paid it back and China avoided it.
In May, the number of visits dropped by 42 percent year-on-year, while Japan saw an increase of 85 percent.
All of this has an impact on macroeconomic stability.
According to a recently published report by the Fed, China could leave up to $190 billion as a result of Chinese foreign travel, while China will earn about $35 billion a year as part of the currency’s sale to incoming tourists.
According to official figures on the development of the balance of payments, last year China had a deficit of $217 billion in tourism, which is equal to 44 percent of the total Chinese surplus in trade in goods.
So a small number of tourists in the country, who are anxiously preventing the flow of capital, is inflicting a very painful wound.
However, the above mentioned factors are only one manifestation of a more general deterrence towards foreigners.
In many parts of China, virtually no one has heard of immigrants.
In 2013, there were less than one million foreigners living in China.
There are several cities in the United States as well.
Even Japan, which is not exactly a crossroads of immigration, has doubled.
A number of scientific papers show that immigrants are usually revitalizing economic growth, entrepreneurship and innovation.
You can hardly find them in China.
Solving these problems will be politically challenging, but the step that is offered is to simplify the visa system.
Other Asian countries, particularly India and Vietnam, have been making great efforts lately to simplify and reduce the procedures for granting visas.
If China wants more foreign tourists and their hard currency, it should be easier for them to get there.
In the Pilsen zoo, deadly poisonous pests were bred.
The Kingdom of Poison in Pilsen can enjoy from the young three rare, deadly poisonous pests.
In the exhibition, visitors will see only all nine newly born Turkish snakes.
This species lives in northern Anatolia, even at an altitude of 2,000 meters.
"The length of the meter is growing," Zoo spokesman Martin Vobruba said.
The pups of the other two species, mortals and red cobras, will gain strength in the rearing grounds of the garden.
We still can't say when people will see them.
"We wouldn't like to lose them," said Nurse Miroslav Dohnal, with the fact that it could take a year or two.
Australian Snake Death Eaters came into the world eight, they are descendants of the breeding pair native to the population around Sydney.
"The one that visitors can see in the exhibition is among the mortals from around Perth," Vobruba said, adding that in human care it is necessary for the mortals to winter for 6-8 weeks at a temperature of 13 degrees Celsius.
A hundred percent success accompanies the dream of African floating red cobras.
A couple in the Pilsen zoo had a total of four puppies hatched from four eggs.
"The incubation lasted 65 days," Vobruba added.
This species in nature sprays poison on its victims, up to a distance of four meters.
Pointing to the eyes, it can cause permanent blindness.
The pups of all three species feed on rats in the zoo.
Within 40 days in the garden, the young are still waiting to bend from the dream of a black mammal, the eggs are stored in an incubator.
According to an unconfirmed transcript of a phone conversation, Trump is creating pressure on Mexico over payment for the border wall
The Washington Post published a transcript of President Trump’s phone calls with top officials from Mexico and Australia.
In a January 27 telephone interview with Mexican President Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>oa Niete, Trump urged him to stop publicly declaring that he would not pay for the construction of the proposed wall.
The U.S. president told him that he publicly denounced the construction of the wall, allegedly saying, “You can’t talk like that in the press.”
As part of his campaign, Trump promised to build a wall along the southern border and announced that Mexico would pay for it.
He also evaded a transcript of his first conversation with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, revealing a tense exchange of views.
President Trump told Turnbull that the U.S. surveillance deal for refugees heading to Australia was "ridiculous" and "stupid" and insisted that if he agreed to such a deal - which came under President Obama's administration - the U.S. would look like a "drugged" upside down after he proposed a ban.
Trump ended the call after explaining to Turnbull that “this is my most unpleasant call of the day.”
Tusk resigned from the prosecutor's office for Smolensk.
"There is something to be afraid of," said Tusk's dead president's brother, the leader of the PiS Law and Justice party Jaroslaw Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski.
"I have nothing to fear, Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski will not scare me," Tusk replied, reciting to the country's current leadership that he was trying to abuse justice against political rivals.
When he left the prosecutor’s office, the crowd was waiting for Tusk, according to TVN 24, which chanted Donald Tusk! and wished the politician a hundred years!.
Tusk thanked for the support and assured that he had a clean conscience: "I have nothing to fear and Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski will not scare me."
According to the prosecutors, he does not say anything, but he does not doubt that justice has to serve as a tool against the current Polish rulers against opponents, opposition or people they do not like, and I fear that I belong to this group.
He was in the interrogation for the second time.
The prime minister was interrogated at the prosecutor's office for the second time, this time he was supposed to be involved in a miscarriage of the victims of the Smolensk disaster.
In addition, there was a confusion of the bodies in the coffins.
The families were forbidden to open the coffins, and there must have been some reason for that.
And the reason was that they were afraid of the scandal, because it would burden Polish-Russian relations.
"Keeping good relations at all costs, despite such a horrific event, should have served to make Donald Tusk a very important person in the EU," Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski said on Catholic television Trwam.
He added that a possible conflict with Russia would undermine Tusk’s chances of obtaining the most important seat in the Union, from which Poland has absolutely nothing.
Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski also said he had warned German Chancellor Angela Merkel that Donald Tusk could be different, but she did not take note of it.
Tusk has already undergone an eight-hour interrogation at the prosecutor's office on April 19.
At the time, he did not speak as a suspect, only as a witness.
However, many of his appeals to the interrogation were seen as part of the Polish government's apparent efforts and the head of PiS Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>sk<0xC3><0xBD> to discredit Tusk as a political rival by associating with various scandals.
In Poland, the Prosecutor’s Office is subordinate to the Minister of Justice, who serves as the Prosecutor General.
The hearing came shortly after Tusk was elected head of the European Council, which Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski tried hard but in vain to avoid, among other things, during a visit to Merkel in Warsaw.
At the EU summit, only Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlov<0xC3><0xA1> protested alone against the extension of Tusk’s mandate.
In this case, the Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n left Warsaw in the spotlight.
Barma in Senegal.
Where can the Czechs vote?
In the autumn parliamentary elections, registered voters will be able to vote again on the composition of the House of Commons of Burma, Senegal or Luxembourg.
In these and several other countries, since the last parliamentary elections in 2013, the Czech Republic has opened its representative offices.
It comes from a decree that regulates the delivery of ballots abroad.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has prepared its update, it is currently in commentary procedure.
Four years ago, MPs abroad voted for 10,000 Czech citizens.
"Since the last update of the decree in 2013, there have been some changes that need to be taken into account in these lists," the ministry said in a statement.
“In some countries, new representative offices have been created, some offices have been closed, or there has been a change in the level of representation,” the statement said.
The declaration shall contain two annexes, the first of which shall include the representative offices on which the paper ballots shall be delivered.
This group of authorities includes representation of the Czech Republic in neighbouring countries, namely Germany, Poland, Austria and Slovakia.
More than a hundred Czech authorities will receive a ballot in the press release.
It is their list that changes with the decree.
Four years ago, for example, the Czechs could vote at the Czech Embassy in Libya or Zimbabwe.
Today, both embassies are closed.
The Czech Republic has also cancelled its representation in Malaysian Bamako and Japan's Kyoto.
There will be no elections at the Consulate General in Donetsk.
The Czech Republic closed in 2014 because of the war in the east of Ukraine.
They are now on the list of embassies in Kenya’s Nairobi, Senegal’s capital city of Dakar and Zambia’s Lusace.
In Asia, since the last parliamentary elections, the Czech Republic has extended its representation to the consulate general in Iraq's Irbil and Chengdu, the capital of China's S'Chuan province.
Voting tickets will also be available for registered voters at Czech embassies in Burma and Cambodia.
The Czechs abroad have had the opportunity to elect members of the polling stations at representative offices or consulates four times so far.
Before each election, the State Electoral Commission shall determine by fate the region for which candidates are voted abroad.
This was the first time in 2002 that South Moravian candidates were selected.
In the next two elections, the Czechs voted abroad among the South Bohemian candidates.
In 2013, as this year, the Central Bohemian Region was chosen.
The number of Czechs voting abroad is steadily increasing.
At the premiere 15 years ago, about 3,800 people came to vote, in 2006 there were about 6,700, four years later 8222.
Four years ago, 10,571 voters were sent to the embassies for early parliamentary elections.
Moore's Ford Bridge Massacre: Activists Reminiscent of Racist Lynching
The 1948 Ford Mercury passed around the observant residents of Monroe, Georgia and scrambled towards the Moore's Ford Bridge.
But before a car with four passengers of black skin and a white driver could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns made their way to the bridge.
The leader of the group - a middle-aged man in a striped suit - long pulled out of a cigarette and looked at the windshield of the car.
Inside, the passengers trembled with fear.
"We don't want that-- Roger!" the man shouted.
“Bring him to me!”
The silence interrupts the roar of a young black man, who is pulled out of the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this scene is just a reconstruction of the events that took place on July 22nd.
But when one of the men crosses the "Roger's" neckline, the audience excites with excitement.
Since 2005, a group of activists have been returning to the Moore's Ford Bridge regularly reconstructing the fateful night of 1946, when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murra Dorsey - were killed by members of the Kukluxklan.
No one has been tried for the murders so far.
"It is surprising that not one person has been arrested in all these years - even though we still see them in our community; even though we know their identity," Tyrone Brooks, who helps organize the reconstruction of the event, said in a statement.
“It is a stain on our history and a burden on our souls.”
Brooks is a 71-year-old former congressman of the state of Georgia and a lifelong civil rights fighter.
In his eyes, the reconstruction of the event represents a dramatic call to action. Every year the community of Monroe reminds that justice has not been done enough.
“We demand prosecution and the closure of the case, we want peace of mind and reconciliation, but justice above all,” Brooks said.
“Until then, the process of healing and reconciliation cannot be initiated.”
On July 27, 1946, a forensic doctor covered one of the bodies of the victims of lynching at Moore's Ford.
According to FBI records, which received the NBC News report, up to 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were expected to take part in the lynching.
However, no one has been prosecuted yet.
Despite the fact that the suspects have been at liberty for decades, civil rights supporters claim that both the reasons for lynching - politics and sex - were known to all the city's residents.
In April 1946, by a decision of the Supreme Court, the black population of the state of Georgia was granted for the first time the right to participate in the elections scheduled for the summer.
And it was during the summer elections that, according to the FBI, black farmer Roger Malcom had to stab white-skinned landowner Barnett Hester during a fight - allegedly because of his wife.
According to Brooks, it was reported that Hester surrounded Malcom's wife Dorothy and brought her to a different state.
According to a statement by the FBI, on July 25, 1946, then-significant white-skinned landowner Loy Harrison filed a $600 bail for Malcom.
He was escorted to prison by Dorothy and his cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
On their way back from prison, just before entering the Moore's Ford Bridge, a group of suspects made their way.
“As it turned out, Harrison planned and organized the murders,” the FBI said.
"It is also clear that there was a secret agreement between state and local law enforcement officials who not only took part in lynching, but also got rid of the evidence and hid the identity of the witnesses."
Brooks made a shorter statement on the whole matter.
“It was a massacre because of the right to vote,” he said.
“They always had a clear subtext for all black people: ‘This is how you get it if you register and go vote.’”
The annual Moore’s Ford Bridge reconstruction event is organized by Cassandra Greene for almost ten years.
Her performance is picturesque, captivating and exquisite, showing a deeply rooted racism that many would like to consider extinct in modern America.
Watching this reconstruction is not easy and it is even more difficult to distract, but Greene says it makes sense.
“Nobody wants to talk about lynching because we have to face the unpleasant feelings that are hiding inside each of us,” Greene said.
"But there can be no relationship between us if you don't listen to what I've been through."
The main rehearsals of this year's reconstruction began in June and just the first day, about 30 actors - dozens of whites, the rest of blacks - gathered in a room where Greene introduced them to a very carefully planned performance.
Wade Marbaugh is an assistant director.
For many years he played the leader of the Kukluxklan, but according to him, the role is exhausting.
"I feel bad about it because it contradicts who I am," Marbaugh said.
“I think it’s very important to remember this part of history on a regular basis, because we never want to go back to that time.”
Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascon, who play the role of Roger Malcom, as well as Barnett Hester, practice their roles.
The show begins with a fight - Malcolm deals with Hester and blames him for sleeping with his wife.
"Get out of my land n---e!"
It can't be scratched.
There's a fight.
At that moment, everyone (at least every black actor) explodes in laughter.
Greene laughs the most.
"What happened?" asked Rascon.
He's confused.
Was I too rude?
"No," answered Greene cheerfully.
"I just don't think the white people said 'n--r' in that tone."
"Exactly," one of the black actors yells.
"You have to put more emphasis on R."
The energy in the room is suddenly better; hostility replaces a sense of closeness.
They all want the show to be authentic, just to make it look like four victims of the massacre.
The actors repeat the scene.
This time, Rascona emphasizes the correct pronunciation of the word on N.
No one's laughing now.
The show ends violently and quickly.
The dream, the shots... and the silence.
A woman dressed in black stands over the bodies of the actors and sings Billie Holiday's sad song "Strange Fruit".
With every word, there is sadness in the room.
Against the background of all this, about a dozen observers wipe sweat and tears from their eyes.
In the audience there is virtually the same number of blacks and whites.
One couple arrived from Ithaca, New York, with many watching them from close proximity.
Each of them endures the local humid climate for almost eight hours and Brooks is in the crowd leading to the graves of Malcolm and Dorsey.
Until then, the murders could have been viewed from a distance, but now, standing in the same place where the lynching took place, the atmosphere is terrifying.
With the last words of the song, Greene invites the crowd to inspect the bodies.
The children cling to the victims' heads, watch the fake blood and immovable bodies and whisper something into their ears.
"They're not dead," whispered the little boy.
It'll be a few minutes and Greene's thanking the audience.
The actors clean the rope and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbaug, a man in costume who played the leader of the Kukluxklan.
Nick Rascona embraces his two acting buddies and cries in their arms; eventually, he is overwhelmed by emotions.
"That's okay," whispered one of the women.
“We know you have a role to play.
But you had a reason for that."
Later that day, the audience will meet with the actors for dinner.
At one table, a young white couple is talking about a performance with a black couple that they met today.
Denise Duplinski could hardly find the words to express her feelings from today’s performance.
“It’s hard to listen to those ugly words and look at the obscene acts ... that people do that look like you and they do it because they look like you,” she said.
“It makes me realize that lynching is still a topical topic,” she added, “it’s just called police clashes.”
On the other side of the room, Tyrone Brooks is sitting in the courtroom, enjoying dinner, talking about civil rights.
In his own words, he has already started planning the show for the next year.
“Reconstructing these events is inspiring because it describes the fear we had to experience – but it’s also a moment to think about,” he said.
“If we don’t learn from it, who knows... it could happen again.
People who do not know and do not study the history of their country are condemned to repeat it.”
I love the instructions for use.
One of my friends says that the instructions for use read only the slob.
I don't agree, on the contrary.
It is one of the modern forms of art, often pure surrealism.
With nostalgia I remember the times of long ago, where the instruction to use anything was rather a rare command.
So, for example, my first gramophone contained only one paper, on which were hieroglyphs depicting the involvement of some components, all of them had some secret markings.
When something went wrong inside me over the years, I offered that letter to a shaman who wasn't afraid to screw the back plate off.
With a snippet he advised me what that paper with a maze of charm is suitable for.
Yes, it was a common tool for chronic depletion of toilet paper.
The toy found a loose wire and allowed me to listen to expensive vinyl plaques again.
The new era has brought new instructions.
Even a relatively simple fruit juicer, where the overlapping grip was simply held, required about ten pictures.
Particularly successful was a sketch describing how to insert one piece into another.
The set was two-part and a different procedure was simply not possible.
To give it on the contrary required considerable effort with the need to break down certain plastic components.
My contempt for the manual ended with my self-movement of the Seat Leon.
The year of production 2003 had such a booklet with a manual of minor repairs, among which was, among other things, the replacement of the flashlight bulb.
It was easy.
A total of three steps and the work should be finished.
Unfortunately, the author of the manual forgot to mention that while the lamp on the right went to replace really only in three steps.
1. Separate the cover.
2. Screw the cracked bulb and screw the new one.
Third, cover up.
The lamp on the left had a problem in the form of the battery cover.
At first I thought that by inserting the right upper limb into the car's rims to our masters some spring, a screw with which the cover easily slides away, and then I will be guided by points 1-3 of the saving author of the service book.
It's the lads.
The cover had no place, no space, not even for the thin handle of the Ashes, let alone the obese Silesian.
I've lost half an hour of my life, without any success.
The condition was further amplified by my wife’s entry into the garage, which was invoked by the noise and words that are heard from my mouth quite exceptionally.
"What are you doing here?" she asked indistinctly.
My answer lasted about 90 seconds, but if I skip the vulgar terms, there are only two words left.
I'm changing the bulb.
"And why does it take you so long?" she risked with a sentence that could be her last in a long-lasting volume.
Slowly I explained the problem to her, with the main emphasis on the torture procedure of the author of the manual, where the blessing of the burnt iron on the hand that wrote the manual, after capturing it, so that he could never write anything again in a comic book, was a mere introduction to his comic book, in a wide range of tutorials.
"Why don't you disassemble the box?" said the woman disassembling the battery.
In a pure desperation it happened and then step 1-3 was as easy and fast as the right side.
I thought he couldn't surprise me.
And that's until the day a colleague called me, who was just discussing the state of collapse after checking two officials of the State Department for Drug Control.
I know him as a well-balanced colleague who has experienced the possible and the impossible in the field and who is able to interpret wild stories with an undisturbed voice.
"Imagine that I got a fine for not having a handwash instruction hanged," he told me in a faint voice.
Gradually I got the whole problem out of him, which was that he didn't have a picture manual on the washbasin on the patient's toilet.
His argument to the commission official that adults can wash their hands as a rule, and that no pictograms are needed to cope with the usual activity of decent people, did not have a healing effect and cost him a lot of money.
"It's not just that," she told him.
He understood that the simple rinsing of the palms of the house with running water is a primitive action at the level of the chromosome that the modern man, Homo sapiens sapiens, performs this ceremony in ten steps.
So it is necessary to tell that it is necessary to release water from the tap.
The whole process has a total of eleven points, but in the end it is a joy to find that a person has washed his hands exactly as ordered by the guest of the S<0xC3><0x9A>KL.
Finally, I have to state that I was inspired and preparing a detailed plan for the activity in the toilet.
In the matter of defecation, the procedure is uniform, there will not be a problem, in the case of urination, given certain differences between the two sexes, it will be necessary to suspend the instructions of two.
The problem remains those pictograms, because to create the perfect process also means the precise drawing of all anatomical details, which could arouse a certain upheaval in the discerning visitor to the toilet, despite the fact that he can finally learn his life from his whole life.
Pearson Releases 3,000 Employees and Reduces Dividend to Revitalize Business
British education group Pearson said on Friday it would lay off an additional 3,000 employees and cut temporary dividends by 72 percent in response to another restructuring program to change the business model.
Another wave of dismissal, which, according to CEO John Fallon, will take place at the end of 2018 and from the beginning of 2019, follows the company’s previous decision to lay off 4,000 employees as part of the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced a <0xC2><0xA3>300m ($394m) cost reduction plan in May as part of its third cost reduction program in an effort to revive declining trade as a result of the sharp development of digital education.
The company, which agreed to sell its stake in Bertelsmann’s Penguin Random House last month, said the outlook for this year remained unchanged after it reported a one-percent increase in core sales in the first half of the year to <0xC2><0xA3>2.05 billion.
Attack on convoy in Kabul: NATO soldiers killed in suicide bombing
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital of Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and injuring several others, officials said.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, NATO said in a statement.
According to unofficial reports, three civilians were also killed in the attack in Qarabagh district.
This month, Afghanistan hit a bomb attack - more than 30 people were killed in an explosion in a Herat mosque on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
NATO said in a statement that Tuesday’s blast occurred after the guard was attacked together with members of the Afghan army by a “local person with a homemade explosive device.”
The statement further states that all wounded soldiers are out of danger of life and are in a U.S. military hospital at Baghram Air Force Base.
According to the reporters, the growing power of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in the Qarabagh area is a significant source of concern for NATO allied forces in nearby Baghra.
According to the United Nations, at least 1,662 civilians died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which 20% died in the capital.
At the end of July, a bomb in a car killed at least 30 people in the Kabul district of Shia.
The Taliban has claimed responsibility for the attack.
On May 31, a large explosion in the city center killed more than 150 people, the deadliest militant attack in the country since U.S. troops ousted the Taliban government in 2001.
The violence is undermining the already dubious situation in Afghanistan, and US President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of U.S. troops supposed to help military forces and police in the country.
According to reporters, the suicide bombings, which he has trained in recent weeks, have shaken the public’s confidence in the government, its regulations, and in particular the reputation of President Ashraf Ghanin.
In response to the complaint, the EPA reconsidered its decision to postpone smoking rules
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has revoked its decision to delay the Obama administration’s law, which ordered states to cut emissions, just one day after 15 states sued the agency.
On Wednesday night, the EPA announced its decision to transfer the Ozone Standards 2015, saying it is presenting the Agency’s commitment to cooperation with states.
“We believe in dialogue with our state partners and will hear their views,” EPA Director Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt announced in June that the EPA is seeking to defer ozone standards - which measure actual air pollution in specific areas of the country and, based on measurements, set limits that need to be met by October 2018.
A group of fifteen of the majority of democratic states, along with Washington, D.C., filed a lawsuit on Tuesday on the grounds that the EPA’s actions were illegal.
The administration of President Donald Trump is seeking to avoid many environmental regulations proposed by former President Barack Obama - according to Trump's words in an effort to boost economic growth.
However, the new government’s efforts have started countermeasures by Democrats and conservative groups who fear the impact of emissions on public health.
The EPA states on its website that breathing air containing ozone “may reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms,” such as asthma.
Singer Ladislav Bubn<0xC3><0xA1>r got a wound and blood flowed!
This, with us a relatively new singer, you may have already registered in June of this year, when this almost unknown singer organized a monstrous event on Czech relations, which was not invited by such leading figures as Karel Gott, Ma<0xC5><0xA1>er and Ni<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC5><0xA1> Akci<0xC5><0xA1>, and others as Master Karel Gott, Lucie B<0xC3><0xAD>l<0xC3><0xA1>, Le Krav<0xC3><0xA1> Simon.
The purpose was simple, to show up to the public and introduce their music video to the song Sara, whose baptism was made by the newly appointed persona.
However, few people already know that the filming of the video, which took place in Russia, did not go without problems and the singer Ladislav Bubn<0xC3><0xA1>r himself had to be treated.
It was his first major shooting with the stars of the Russian national ballet, and it didn’t go without a real kick.
Sara's song is very emotional and is based on the unfortunate love of two lovers.
For the drama of the scene, the singer's juice in the video was supposed to indicate a blow to the facky.
At one point, however, he hit him so hard and straight into his nose that the young singer had to be treated by doctors.
"It was morning, I didn't expect it, blood came out of my nose immediately," Ladislav commented on the situation.
Colleagues and producers told each other that it was an unfortunate accident and Ladislav could not respond in time.
Fortunately, the injury was not so severe as to affect the continuation of the next shoot.
The aforementioned video clip of the young artist is now brought to you, you can also record the scene with a hit.
The unspecified version with blood, however, was not preferred to be used.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Loma<0xC4><0x8D>enko discussed the possibility of a mutual duel
Vasyl Lomacenko and Mikey Garcia, the two boxers who could stage the most exciting lightweight boxing match, met for the first time on Tuesday.
Each of them was located in a separate room at ESPN’s Los Angeles offices, until Garcia – an undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion – went down to the lobby where he welcomed Loma<0xC4><0x8D>enka, the World Boxing Organization featherweight champion.
After Garcia's victory on the basis of a unanimous decision against former four-time world champion Adrien Broner in Saturday's Showtime match, both boxers got on the list of the top five lightweight boxers.
Garcia pulled his right hand and said, “How are you, champion?
Good luck to you."
Loma<0xC4><0x8D>enko defends his title against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN on Saturday at 19:00.
Boxers pose for photographers and manager Lomacenka Egis Klimas adds that a potential fight by boxers would be “a perfect test”.
“I’m a former champion in featherweight,” Garcia adds.
“I had to add up because of the match with Broner (67 kg), but I’m not that big.
I'm small at 63 kg.
I would like to return to the lightweight category.
The butcher has to get back up to get lightweight... then we can fight.
That's what the fans want.
Why don't they do it?"
Loma<0xC4><0x8D>enko agrees.
“This game would be good for Boxing.”
The climate has raised a demand for payment for viewing - which is part of his strategy. Loma<0xC4><0x8D>enko should complete his lightweight debut at the end of this year and next year to compete with Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a (37-0, 30 knockouts). Ti<0xC3><0xBD>r<0xC3><0xAD>um <0xC3><0xBD>kétl<0xC3><0xAD>.
"The game should be a pay-per-view style, which fans are asking for," said Garcia, who later stated that the possibility of broadcasting the game through a TV station that comes with the best offer is open.
“We are the main attraction.
No one else gets that kind of attention.
We'll wait for the right opportunity..."
Garcia said he recognizes Loma<0xC4><0x8D>enko as an "awesome boxer" and could participate in his Saturday match.
But Loma<0xC4><0x8D>enko didn't give Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a praise when he said that the three-division champion from Riverside looks "very slow... sorry Mike, but you're talking about a knockout."
Garcia said his goal was to show strength and then box.
Both boxers said they felt a surge in tension ahead of a mutual duel.
“You won’t forget this game.
No other match is going to require so much attention.
And I will gladly put it into the fire," Garcia said.
Lomacenko said, "I've been waiting for the best boxers and this is Mikey."
It's going to be a great match."
A young couple went missing 12 years ago without a trace.
Their car has now been found at the bottom of the Wolhy.
Two young Russians, Ilya Zirnov and Kira Cherkasov, have been missing since December 2005.
There was an extensive search for them, but without success.
And the police eventually terminated the investigation for lack of evidence.
The families of the lost couple lived in uncertainty that they would not know what happened to the couple.
After 12 years came the sad end of the whole story.
The wreck of their car was found by a lay diver at the bottom of the Volhy River in the town of <0xC4><0x8C>eboksary, <0xC4><0x8C>uva<0xC5><0xA1>sk<0xC3><0xA1>.
Only thanks to the documents that remained in the car, the police managed to identify a couple.
The documents survived a decade underwater, and without them it would have taken the police much longer to find out the identity of the found ones.
The couple was last seen when Zirnov borrowed a car from his father to pick up his girlfriend from work.
The diver who discovered the car remains in anonymity for the time being.
He reported his findings to the Cheboksar police, who pulled the car to the beach the next day.
Investigators believe the death of the young couple was an accident caused by a busy road leading around the river.
However, the investigation continues, further details will be made public after its completion.
The latest results of tests to determine the age limit of asylum applications in Sweden
The latest results of tests of asylum seekers in Sweden who have been subjected to a new method of assessing their age show that over 80 percent of people have been questioned as older than 18 years, but not everyone believes their accuracy.
The Swedish Forensic Medicines Agency (R<0xC3><0x83><0xC2><0xA4>ttsmedicinalverket) began conducting new tests earlier this year.
The aim of the method is to assess applicants more accurately in the context of the assessment of asylum applications. The measure was adopted after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticised for failing to determine the correct age of some refugees.
To date, the Swedish Migration Agency has submitted 6,880 cases for investigation and the Forensic Medical Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests carried out from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
80 percent (2002) were judged to be older than 18 years, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medical Agency considered the respondent to be "possibly older than 18 years".
In another 423 cases, it was decided that the respondent is “possibly under 18 years old”.
Tests shall be accessed only if the age of the respondent is disputed.
According to Johan G<0xC3><0x83><0xC2><0xB6>ransson of the Forensic Medical Agency, the results correspond to the previous month.
“Compared to last month, the statistics are kept on track and the numbers are very similar,” he told The Local.
The higher number of applicants whose age has been estimated to be over 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers are lying about their age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests, stating that in 442 cases it was found that “the person interviewed is 18 years of age or older.”
The newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated 581 published cases and found that in 243 cases the respondent said he would be 18 this year.
Critics have also come to the medical method of determining the age, which includes X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of the knee joints, which are subsequently assessed by dentists and x-ray specialists.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus from the Karolinska Institute, who, among other things, deals with assessing the biological maturity of people to determine the age at which the person has gone through puberty.
“I had reason to think about this issue and I don’t think these types of measurements to assess age are right.
The assessment of biological age is, in a sense, very uncertain.
If we can’t accurately determine age, we shouldn’t pretend the opposite,” he told Metro newspapers.
Forensic medical agency Agency's G<0xC3><0x83><0xC2><0xB6>ransson defended the decision by saying: "Generally speaking, the risk of misjudging a child as an adult is small.
The highest risk is the fact that the respondent is just under 18 years of age, which in this case corresponds to 10 percent of all respondents."
Trump threatened the president of Mexico by phone.
U.S. President Donald Trump threatened in a January phone call to Mexican President Enrique Penn Niet that he would not meet unless he publicly said his country would not pay for the construction of a wall between the United States and Mexico.
Trump said in an interview that funding would be arranged somehow, even though he admitted that it would have to be secured from other sources.
Trump also spoke openly with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
This is according to the transcripts of the interviews published Thursday by the American newspaper The Washington Post.
Trump has made the construction of a wall on the southern border for Mexican money one of the main promises in his election campaign last year.
In his first interview with the Mexican president shortly after Trump’s inauguration as Penny Nieta, he undiplomatically criticized his plan to build a wall.
He outlined the southern neighbor as a growing political problem and pressured the Mexican president not to say publicly that his government would never pay for the wall.
"You can't say that to the press," Trump said repeatedly in a January 27 interview, threatening to interrupt contacts with the Mexican president if he continues to make a rebuttal.
Financing is going to be invented and eventually it will work out.
“But if you’re going to say that Mexico won’t pay for the wall, then I don’t want to get in touch with you gentlemen anymore, because that’s unacceptable to me,” Trump said.
The wall was the least important thing we are talking about, but politically it is perhaps the most important.
Trump issued an executive order to build the wall shortly after taking power.
Mexico has rejected the construction and financing of the 3,200-kilometer wall, which has also undermined relations between the two countries.
At the end of March, Trump said the project would still be paid by the United States.
Trump finally met his Mexican counterpart for the first time at the July G20 summit in Hamburg.
The Washington Post also reported on Trump’s phone conversation with Australian Prime Minister Turnbull on January 28.
The head of the White House called the conversation ridiculous.
To this conclusion, he was prompted by an exchange of views on an agreement under which Australia would grant asylum to Central American refugees in exchange for the United States to accept persons from internment facilities in the Pacific Island States.
Trump initially considered the deal to be stupid, but later agreed to it.
"You can say for sure that this is not the deal you made, but you're going to have to stick to it," Turnbull told Trump.
In some passages, the telephone conversation with Turnbull was almost lively, for example, when Trump rated it as a good idea for Australia’s refusal to accept refugees arriving in boats.
"You're worse than me," Trump joked.
Suddenly, however, the tone of the conversation was sharpened.
"I hate accepting these people," Trump said.
I assure you, they're bad.
That's why they're in prison now.
“They won’t be great people going to work for local dairy farmers,” he said.
In the interview, he also said that a refugee could become a Boston bomber in five years.
Trump conducted telephone conversations with a number of world statesmen at the end of January, that is, about a week after he arrived at the White House, often even several in one day.
The conversation with Turnbull eventually called it the least pleasant one of the whole day.
Before he finished it, he said he had had a pleasant conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Rana's killer was executed in front of the crowd.
Her father also looked at her.
The execution took place on the square in the Yemeni capital Sanaa.
Muhammad al-Maghrabi chose Rana Almatari, who lived in his neighborhood, as his victim.
Al Maghrabi kidnapped the girl, took her to his father's house where he raped her and stabbed her with his bare hands.
He later raped her body, which he then stabbed near the mosque.
The violent death of a young girl has hit the entire country, facing the threat of civil war.
Yahya Almatari stood in the first line of the thousand-headed crowd, who gathered to witness the execution.
Muhammad al-Maghrabi was condemned under Sharia law.
The victim's father told the media about his feelings after his execution.
I feel like I'm reborn.
I'm sick of it.
It's a new day in my life.
Other members of the family were also present, along with the crowd shouting the slogan "Long live justice".
The rapist brought a police truck to the square from which he was dragged.
The policemen tied him to the abdomen.
One of the men turned his gun against him and fired from a nearby area.
The crowd in attendance celebrated every wound that had been burned.
Mr al Almatari told MailOnline that justice was carried out in accordance with the country’s legal system.
"Justice, Allah and Sharia law have won," he added.
I stood at Liberation Square in Sana, waiting for my daughter's killer to be executed.
Then my family and I went to the morgue.
We took Ran's little body and buried it in a nearby cemetery.
My wife Jamileh and I are grateful that justice has been done.
The police feared that the crowd gathered in the square would fall into a hatred of insanity, the killer would fall and die.
The execution was ordered by a court under the control of the Shiite Houthi.
However, Maghrabi was initially sentenced to 100 wounds by beatings after his arrest, but his act provoked such outrage that the judge decided on the death penalty.
Al Maghrabi was arrested two days after her disappearance on June 27.
Ranina's family knew him well.
When the police searched the basement of his house, they found evidence that the man was planning his act.
Mr. Almatari described him as a creature.
What could be his motive?
Even the animal would be more merciful to the Ran.
"Our family has no enemies and the injury that carried Ranina's body was terrible," he told the media.
"Rana disappeared in the afternoon, we reported it to the police that day, we told the newspapers and all our TV stations, posters with her photo were hanging everywhere," he continued.
Everyone thinks the police got a tip from the murderous parents who suspected their son of a horrific act.
The girl's mother, Jamileh, had to be hospitalized after learning that her daughter's body had been found.
The wound was walking out playing with the other kids from the neighborhood.
After 10-15 minutes I went out to see where he was.
We searched everywhere, but Rana was gone.
We walked around our block, our friends took cars and drove around, but we searched in vain.
The people of Yemen were disgusted by the crime and began to gather in front of the police station where al-Maghrabi was held and demand immediate punishment.
The representative of the Ministry of Justice read the record of the investigation to the present crowd in order to calm them down.
The accused apparently did not express regret over his act.
Shortly before the execution of the sentence, the police read the sentence to him, but the convict only glanced at his executioner.
The entire event was filmed for national television, but there were many recordings on the Internet that were taken by the crowd.
West Virginia Governor Announces Change of Political Party
West Virginia Democratic Governor Jim Justice announced Thursday evening at a meeting of President Trump that he is moving to another party.
“Whether you like it or not, the Democrats turned their backs on me,” the governor of Justice said.
"Today, after a long prayer and thought, I announce to you today, as a resident of West Virginia, that I can no longer support you from the position of a democratic governor."
The crowd of observers exploded in joy.
“Tomorrow I will join the Republicans,” Justice added.
“As a coach, I can tell you it’s time to jump into another game.”
Trump has already promised important announcements to the people at a meeting in West Virginia.
Trump won in West Virginia by 42 points and Justice did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
According to Forbes magazine, Justice, the only billionaire in the country, was elected in 2016.
Forbes adds that Justice inherited a large fortune from his father and is the owner of several coal mines.
The value of his assets is estimated at $1.59 billion.
The Republican National Committee, meanwhile, issued a statement on Thursday evening stating: "The transition of the governor of Justice is another wound for the democratic party, which puts obstacles in our way, rather than causing the rise of our country."
“For a democratic party that has only 15 governors and controls the least legislatures in history, the announcement by the governor of Justice is the last drop for an already so skewed party without a leader who is in vain seeking to find its news outlets positive and unifying reports,” she told RNCBS.
Sebastian Coe praises Russia's 'honest' apology for doping scandal
Former top athlete Sebastian Coe praised Russia on Thursday for a sincere apology for the doping scandal, but reiterated that the time has not yet come for Russia to return to the sporting world.
Russian athletics chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said on the occasion of the IAAF congress - which took place on the eve of the World Athletics Championships - that his country was right to be kicked out of the world of sport and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologized to “all athletes who lost gold and silver medals in this way.”
Despite his comments, members of the IAAF Congress voted in favour of maintaining the ban, which came into effect in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) revealed that Russia supported doping of its athletes.
"I think today we have witnessed very sincere responses and presentations," IAAF President Sebastian Coe told reporters.
“All members of the Council and Congress were pleasantly surprised that Russia has admitted its mistake and is working hard to correct and restore the proper functioning of the entire federation.”
Coe said he was also "satisfied" that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
“I think today has been a very successful day and we have moved to the next level, but Congress supports the recommendations of the crisis staff on maintaining the punishment imposed on Russia,” Coe added.
“In the coming months, we must do everything we can to stabilize the situation.
“Our goal has always been to separate honest athletes from dishonest athletes,” he said in a statement.
At the World Athletics Championships, which starts Friday in London, 19 Russian athletes will compete under the neutral flag, who have complied with the strict rules of the IAAF.
IAAF chief of staff Rune Andersen said on Monday that Russia still has to meet several criteria before it is allowed back.
Tests on the presence of drugs are still unsatisfactory and exclusion coaches continue to operate, he told reporters in London after the IAAF board's presentation ended.
The CzechTrade contract was acquired by Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ka Savova, whose state is pursuing.
The public procurement of the state pro-export agency CzechTrade was acquired by the publishing house Mlad<0xC3><0xA1> fronta Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Savov.
Officials awarded him 100 percent points in all qualitative criteria.
They did not mind that the Czech state is suing Savova for tax fraud and asking for his extradition to the Czech Republic.
In April, the pro-export agency of the Ministry of Industry and Trade CzechTrade issued a public contract for the provision of editorial content for the BusinessInfo portal.
The order totalled SEK 30.8 million was received by the publishing company Mlad<0xC3><0xA1> fronta of entrepreneur Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Savov.
The Czech police have accused him of tax evasion in 2014 and are chasing him to flee.
Savov fled to the UK and the Czech Republic is requesting his release.
This was reported by the server Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz.
According to the original criteria, CzechTrade had to decide on the offer price of 60% and on the remaining 40 beauty contests, i.e. the quality of the project.
The second criterion has helped Savo’s company significantly.
According to the information, Dotyk.cz received 100 points in all the sub-criteria of quality.
That is what pushed her in front of another candidate, the publishing house Vltava Labe Media VLM, which offered a better price.
While the Young Front operated at 404,900 kroner a month, the VLM offered 324,350 kroner.
Unlike the Young Front, however, it received a sub-average rating from the assessors in all the qualitative criteria, a total of 62 points.
The tender was also attended by the consulting firm BDO Advisory and the digital agency R-Media, which falls as well as the server Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz under the publishing house Economia.
VLM has raised several objections to the outcome of the tender, with the view that its assessment is unfair and insufficiently justified.
After their refusal, it was decided to contest the competition with the Office for the Protection of Competition of the OCTs.
It is believed that CzechTrade acted in violation of the law.
"The applicant is convinced that the contracting authority has reached a decision on the selection of the supplier of the public contract on the basis of purely subjective evaluation, clearly favouring the participant Mlad<0xC3><0xA1> fronta, a.s., at the expense of the applicant's tenderer, the applicant's tenderer and other contractors,"
According to the Director General and Chairman of the Board of VLM Michal Kl<0xC3><0xAD>ma, the selection committee’s scores appear to be an incredible and 100% evaluation of the Young Front project among all its members as extraordinarily suspicious.
"Any independent observer must consider the miraculous success of one of the competitors to be unlikely and suspicious," he said in a statement to Climate News.
CzechTrade has not yet commented on the situation.
CzechTrade does not generally comment on public contracts prior to their conclusion.
All information about the contract mentioned by you is published in accordance with the law in the Contractor Profile and in the Public Procurement Bulletin.
"After the end of the contract, a complete written report will be published, but during the duration of the contract we cannot express our opinion on the course of the contract," <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>p<0xC3><0xA1>n Dlouh<0xC3><0xBD>, the agency's media representative, told Dotyk.cz.
The young front responded by stating that it considers it extremely problematic that the publisher Economia intervened with an article in Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz in a competition where it has its own business interests.
However, this fact was stated in that article.
In the Tent, she may have been the one who provided BusinessInfo with editorial services in the previous four years.
The contract was awarded for the first time in 2013, when the Ministry of Industry and Trade was headed by Martim Cuba ODS.
Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ka Savova blames the police for tax evasion in connection with excessive deductions of VAT by his companies, which caused the alleged damage to the Czech state of up to 770 million kroner.
The Czech Republic has been asking the UK for its release since 2014.
According to Savov, the head of the ANO movement, Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1>, is behind his criminalization, under whose influence the Mafra publishing house falls.
Last year, the London court rejected Savo's appeal against the issue, but the businessman appealed.
"From our point of view, the case has not moved anywhere since last year, we have not received any understanding from the UK in the matter of acquiring the legal power of the judgment to date," spokeswoman for the Prague city prosecutor's office <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>p<0xC3><0xA1>nka Zenklov<0xC3><0xA1> told Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz.
In addition to the ownership of the Young Front, Savov was represented in the company Harvestor Limited, which is based in Cyprus, which operates the Samson brewery, and in the Cyprus company Maraflex, which profiles itself as an investment fund, buying endangered assets.
It should also be controlled by the failed company Heavy Machinery Services, formerly Legions, which owes more than three billion kroner.
In the past, Savov was also associated with the removal of property from the former Socialist Youth Union.
The motorcyclist drove through the pavements and parks, and ended up in slums.
The motorcyclist drew attention to himself by ruthless driving on the streets, pedestrians and park roads in <0xC3><0x9A><0xC5><0xA1>ovice.
When the guard started chasing him, he decided to take her in the direction of the Station.
"Policemen with increased caution were chasing the city when he failed to drive on one of the side roads behind the Mari<0xC3><0xA1>nské Spas and got into the field by motorcycle, where he crashed," said police spokesman Daniel Dvo<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>k.
In the end, a rescue helicopter had to arrive, which transported the injured motorcyclist to the hospital in Pilsen.
Afterwards, the police found that the motorcyclist did not own a driver's license, the registration marks on the motorcycle were removed, his production number was scratched and the production label itself removed.
It is possible that the machine was stolen.
The origin of the motorcycle is subject to further investigation.
"The breath test was carried out to exclude the presence of alcohol in the driver, but the test found a positive result on the substance methamphetamine," the police spokesperson added.
How the financial rules of football will affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules restricting funding for European football clubs do not disrupt Neymar’s record move from Spain to Paris-Saint Germain in France.
Any penalties for Paris Saint-Germain will be implemented by EUFA, which oversees European football teams and has the power to prohibit teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League.
The rules of financial fair play (FFP) introduced by UEFA in 2011 stipulate that PSG will have to prove that Neymar's transition was not financed without major losses.
Barcelona paid <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>222 million just to buy Neymar out of his contract and Neymar will demand a salary of several tens of millions of dollars a year.
The following are some financial terms for Neymar's move to France.
Since the PSG team is funded by a wealthy Qatari family that has been rich in energy sales, it can afford to bring Neymar into the already-starred football family.
Clubs can spend huge amounts on buying players, but on the other hand, they have to prove legal sources of income, which allows them to cover the operating costs of business activities related to football.
FFP was introduced by Michel Platini after joining the seat of UEFA Director in 2007.
The former French player believed that the clubs that owe themselves in pursuit of new strengths ultimately cheat and risk bankruptcy if the banks or owners refuse to insure them.
In 2011, FFP’s rules shifted its attention from club debt to monitoring their losses.
This change meant that the business model Roman Abramovich used with Chelsea in 2003 – buying a club with potential and spending rents for players and building a global brand – was suddenly not so advantageous.
Within the current three-year trial period, which ends in 2018, clubs can report losses of up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 million.
And despite Platini having to leave his post in 2015, his successor Aleksander <0xC4><0x8C>eferin is determined to defend the ban on excessive spending.
“The FFP rules still apply and we are determined to strengthen them in the future,” Andrea Traverso, who oversees the FFP rules, told the Associated Press last week.
Although PSG paid the amount for the purchase of Neymar in a one-off payment, it may, for accounting purposes, allocate the amount over the entire duration of the contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so the transfer can be signed at EUR 44.4 million annually for a period of five years.
The first wave of FFP sanctions hit PSG in 2014 along with Manchester City, owned by Abu Dhabi.
PSG fined <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 million ($82 million) - which was later reduced to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 million - and ordered the Champions League team to be reduced to 21 players in the 2014-2015 season, instead of 25 players.
UEFA is paying attention to teams that can try to bypass financial regulators by increasing their revenues through companies affiliated with club owners.
Even though the Qatari company sponsors PSG, once the financing exceeds the value of the standard market rate, UEFA has the right to prohibit the settlement of the amount.
A similar measure was adopted by UEFA in 2014 after it decided that the amount of funds provided by the Qatar Tourism Authority to PSG was too high.
According to some reports, Neymar’s earnings at PSG could be paid by the organising commission of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar.
However, PSG and the leaders of MS 2022 in Qatar denied the fat that Neymat should become an MS ambassador in football and that such a maneuver would be easily revealed by UEFY agents.
The previous sanctions imposed on PSG mean that UEFA will closely monitor any attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA has not launched any investigation into Neymar’s move to PSG, according to a statement from dedicated individuals on Tuesday.
The source of the report wanted to remain anonymous, as it is not authorized to comment on the situation with PSG, The Associated Press said.
The latest published financial statements show that PSG closed 2015-2016 with a net profit of EUR 10 million and a turnover of EUR 542.4 million.
The financial statements for the current financial year have not yet been published.
PSG expects the arrival of Neymara to be a huge opportunity for sponsors, merchandising and shirt sales.
The club has pledged to increase turnover by up to 30 percent from signing the contract.
Representatives of the Spanish league, apparently concerned about the departure of one of the biggest stars, sought to obscure Neymar’s departure, arguing that PSG violated the FFP rules.
“This is a clear case of ‘financial doping’ of the club and the state,” La Liga president Javier Teba told Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the ownership of the club by the Qatari syndicate.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club owns an American sports magnate, shares the same La Liga stance on funding the club.
“It’s a result of ownership that has fundamentally changed the football world over the last 15 years,” Wenger said in a statement.
“Once he becomes the owner of the club, everything is possible.
Compliance with the rules of financial fair play is very difficult because the state may have different interests in the participation of such players in its club."
Spartan backup Rosick<0xC3><0xBD>: Changes are painful, but we have to believe.
Sixteen thousand applauding fans on their feet.
Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Rosick<0xC3><0xBD> is going to the gym.
Same scene as in Sunday's match against the Bohemians.
The Spartan batsman tilted the game against the Red Star, inventing several goals, but his team-mates did not aim for black.
The flight team pumped with new multimillion-dollar reinforcements thus ends after the opening doubles in the European Cups.
Was there anything more difficult to do with the match after the goal of Belgrade?
After the incumbency goal, we had to shoot four, which was difficult for us.
At least we didn’t want to lose, we wanted to raise our confidence, so we had to get away from it for the next games.
We had some chances.
We need to work together as a team and move our game forward.
Why didn't Sparta get into the match so long?
The game is terribly elaborated.
The competitor's combinations were much better than ours.
We didn't get anything, we fired once in half time.
Of course, that’s a very small amount when you have to win two or three goals.
The second half was already much better, in the final third we managed to play with them.
But you have to push your opponents more often into such positions.
Is the problem a large number of changes in the composition?
Of course, this is one of the pains when a new team is formed.
We only played three competitions and the squad is still changing.
The point is to have the coach find the ideal eleven to sit down.
Is it encouraging for you that you have already played parts of two games in a row?
They're still just parts of the game.
I don’t know how my situation will develop and when I can finally play from the beginning.
Are you still optimistic about the changes that took place in Sparta?
We have to be, or we can't.
It's the same as getting hurt.
If you don't believe, you can't come back.
Sparta has decided somehow, we have to be optimistic, otherwise the situation will be even worse.
The fans came again in large numbers, but they left in despair.
What can you tell them?
There was an amazing visit here again, as well as with the goddess.
I'm so sorry that we can't make their joy a better performance.
I'll show you something that they'll come for next time.
We can thank them for coming.
I don't remember seeing them when I played here 15 years ago.
Can a cup-free season be at least an advantage for the league?
So far, we're fighting ourselves, we're playing, so that's not an advantage for us.
For an extreme tax evasion, the entrepreneur has to sit for ten years.
The Constitutional Court rejected the complaint of the businessman Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1>, who has been sentenced to 10 years in prison for tax cuts.
The damage amounted to SEK 645 million.
Toman argued in the complaint that justice violated his fundamental rights, the factual findings of the courts in Zl<0xC3><0xAD>n and Olomouc are said to be incomplete.
However, the constitutional judges described the complaint as unfounded, <0xC4><0x8C>TK found out from the court’s database.
The Court of Appeal is not another appeals court.
"It cannot, as a fourth instance, assess the factual or legal errors allegedly committed by the general courts unless they constitute a violation of constitutionally protected rights and freedoms," the resolution said.
Toman was tried as a fugitive.
The verdict has been in force since November 2015, when it was confirmed by the Supreme Court in Olomouc.
At the time, Toman was in extradition detention in Argentina, where, according to the resolution, he was also at the time of the decision of the UC.
The penalty imposed is at the upper limit of the legal rate, which according to the verdict corresponds to the damage caused.
The Supreme Court has referred to the case as an extreme tax evasion, which has only a macroeconomic impact on the state budget.
He served as Chairman of the Board of Directors of World Service from 2005 to 2008.
The damage amounted to SEK 645 million in the period from January to July 2008 alone, with a total loss of more than one billion, according to the expert.
However, for procedural reasons, it was no longer possible to judge Toman for the full amount.
According to the complaint, World Service did not include all invoices in its tax returns.
Instead of monthly deductions of VAT and consumer taxes in the order of at least tens of millions of kroner paid taxes in just hundreds of thousands.
World Service and some of the companies the company traded with have a relationship with the entrepreneur Radom<0xC3><0xAD>r Vyp<0xC3><0xAD>ralov, who was sentenced to 13 years in prison for VAT machinations in fuel stores.
His complaint was also rejected before the Constitutional Court.
The series "Summer to Survive" and "Comrade Detective" play a nostalgic string
This iteration of the story is nostalgic for both celebrities from the 1980s; for the dirty 90s (when geniuses David Wain and Michael Showalter featured on MTV the comedy sketch "The State"); and, of course, for modern times, specifically 2001, for projects like Paul and Rudd, and stars like Elizabeth Pobanks.
As a cultural artifact, it is a light parody and at the same time the embodiment of our modern Facebook era of lasting memories.
From a Frenchman’s point of view, it seems that someone is breathing.
The series "First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well - not only because of the absurd humor (an example may be the story of the creation of a talking can with vegetables, spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
The authors deflected from the main funny points — middle-aged actors playing teen excited children — and couldn’t get away from previous events.
The sequel to "Ten Years Later", in which adults play, doesn't push adults so much to the emotional level and satires places up to sporadic, including a parody of the '90s thrillers like "The Hand on a Wheel".
At one point, the character will find a bunch of Apple Powerbooks, scooters, and “a bunch of other things from 1991.”
Many of the main storylines are repeated.
The benevolent Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a writer, has still not moved through his love for Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a woman.
Not to mention the crazy complication that includes Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), driven by George H. W. Bush (very well-behaved Michael Ian Black).
As always, the best part of the franchise are many side stories.
Particularly fun is to watch an eternally young Rudd with long hair alias the character Matt Dillon from the film Young, whose once respected character Andy is now behind the old pepper.
The franchise could be triggered by moments of random insanity, such as the reversible series “Seven Up,” until it reaches the logical conclusion: “Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later,” when in the final scene, the entire group “is released for the premiere.”
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon is calling for another type of nostalgia: the revivalism of the Cold War series "So Normal Americans", the film "Atomic Blonde: No Mercy" and even the series "GLOW", in which the icons of the East and West wrestling clash.
The comedy by creators Brian Gatewood and Alessandr Tanak, directed by Rhys Thomas, is intended to act as a television production: a drama about two Romanian cops from the 1980s who fight for truth and atheism in the way of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles - the tough Gregor and the idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Street, who played in the English language Channing Tatum (executive producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a great idea.
Unfortunately, it is not much more.
You laugh at some jokes (such as cops watching chess on TV - a parody of American football).
The series has been voiced by many well-known actors, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny.
Comrade Detective, however, focuses too much on the non-toxic propaganda drama - which includes the killer with the Reagan mask - and it also looks like it.
Six long episodes are too diverse and comedic moments are not enough.
With a shorter footprint, the propagandistic satire in “Comrade Detective” could work, such as in a scene where Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the U.S. Embassy, in which two fat men sniff out hamburgers stacked on a large crowd.
A clear message for the imaginary communist audience is that Western culture can turn everything into a source and an orgy.
The ideas of the Romanian creators were not wrong: we do so with our own culture, as well as with theirs.
Russian athletes did not expect to see an end to the IAAF’s ban.
The International Athletic Federation (IAAF) at a congress in London confirmed the extension of the international ban on the start of Russian riders because of the state-backed doping program.
The vote in the history of the world championship, which starts on Friday, was very clear as expected.
166 delegates voted to extend the ban, with only 21 votes against.
The main reason for the rejection is above all the fact that Russia is not able to meet all the requirements for the introduction of the anti-doping system, as stated before the congress by the head of the IAAF Special Investigation Group Rune Andersen.
His group recommended that the ban be continued.
Some older doping cases remain unresolved, a number of suspected athletes have not yet been heard, and coaches are still working in the country with a shaky reputation.
The Russian anti-doping agency RUSADA, which does not meet the standards of the World Anti-Doping Agency, is not fully operational.
However, RUSADA can now conduct tests under the supervision of foreign experts and the British anti-doping agency.
“Although progress has been made, there is still a lot of work to be done,” said IAAF President Sebastian Coe.
The Russian athletic federation was suspended in November 2015, so Russian athletes lost, among other things, last year’s Olympic Games in Riu de Janeiro.
Despite the ban, the upcoming MS will be attended by 19 Russians who have previously proven that they have been tested outside the Russian anti-doping system for a long time.
However, they will not be able to start the championship in national colors and in case of victory they will not play a Russian anthem.
Bank of England to support interest rate of 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that the interest rate will remain unchanged, as a result of negligible economic growth and weakening inflation, which has fuelled speculation of sharp growth.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "background" in connection with maintaining the interest rate - despite the sluggishness of family budgets.
The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) political representatives voted six-to-two to maintain the interest rate at 0.25%, and the results of the vote to increase the interest rate supported a modest economic growth supported by weak growth.
In its annual inflation report, the bank predicted growth at 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and warned that family budget cuts would continue. The bank expects inflation to rise to 3% in the fall.
At the same time, the bank suggested that over the next few years there should be growth due to inflation caused by Brexit, and also stated that rents from mobility should grow more than expected in financial markets.
The members of the committee also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth package, which was put into practice a year ago in response to Brexit.
As a result of the above, the Futures Financing Plan is expected to come into effect from next February, which will offer cheap subsidies to banks, although the Bank of England has said it will now offer <0xC2><0xA3>15 billion less than the planned <0xC2><0xA3>115 billion.
Just before the decision, the bank said: “MPC predicts that gross domestic product (GDP) will stagnate in the short term along with pressure on real household income and a burden on consumption.”
On the issue of interest rates, the bank said it would need to “drawn the belts of monetary policy” to soothe inflation, “to a higher extent” than markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting first growth in the third quarter of next year and further growth in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that any increase will be “slow” and “restricted”.
The Bank has reduced its growth forecast for this year and next year, compared to 1.9% and 1.7% forecast in May.
The projected growth of 1.8% in 2018 has remained unchanged.
After the estimates were published, the pound fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell 0.5% to $1.31 and 0.4% to $1.11.
The decision to maintain the current state came after a disappointing increase buried hopes for further growth – GDP stood at 0.3% in the second quarter compared to 0.2% in the previous three months.
The growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it is expected to increase slightly by the end of the year, according to the bank.
The latest inflation report is a small consolation for households affected by rising inflation and a miserable rise in wages. The bank said that the situation will worsen before the increase.
The report further states that monetary policy cannot "prevent" income cuts in the coming years, but wages are expected to "significantly" increase towards the end of the three-year forecast.
The economy is also expected to grow due to a high interest in British goods due to a weak pound, which offsets a lower percentage of consumer spending.
The decision came a year after rates were lowered to 0.025% in August last year in response to the shocking vote on the EU referendum, which caused the pound to fall.
The Bank estimates that a full unification of prices and the economy will take at least four years.
Prior to the bank’s decision on the latest rates, many demanded an increase in rates along with rising inflation, which was putting increasing pressure on households. Three political actors demanded an increase to 0.5% in June.
Inflation declined last month to 2.6% from 2.9% in June, despite the bank’s prediction that it expected such a change, and inflation is expected to rise again over the next month.
The Bank stated that the overshoot relative to the 2% target was “completely” due to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, CEO of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: “Given the recent fall in swap rates, it seems that competition in the mortgage market will only increase once creditors start competing for contracts with a good outlook towards the end of the year.
The market looks particularly good for those who end existing contracts and recurring mortgages - there are free options on offer, as well as the low rates they gain in popularity."
NHS to Prescribe Controversial HIV Drug to 10,000 Patients
Patients will be given access to ‘transformative’ HIV prevention treatment from September on the basis of the Supreme Court’s decision to fund the NHS.
The National Health Service (NSH) has announced that the pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) pill, which is used before sex and reduces the risk of infection in high-risk patients by up to 86 percent, will be offered through health care to approximately 10,000 patients within a three-stage range.
The NSH agreed to fund the trial period after the appellate court endorsed last year’s Supreme Court decision by stating that the NHS had the financial means to pay for PrEP despite a statement that the drug should be funded by local authorities.
The decision, which was announced on Thursday, was adopted by NHS England from the mouth of CEO Simon Stevens as a “significant intervention,” while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described the decision as a “decisive moment.”
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start receiving patients. Other clinics will join in October and by April 2018 will be fully implemented across England.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an HIV drug given before sex to reduce the risk of HIV disease.
Tests have shown that PrEP significantly reduces the risk of HIV transmission among endangered patients.
The application of PrEP before sex means that there is a sufficient amount of specific drugs in the patient’s body to prevent infection.
These medications can be taken every day or at least two hours before sex.
Among the patients tested are gay or bisexual men, transgender people, and people with HIV-positive partners who are not successfully treated.
The clinics will identify eligible participants who will sign an agreement to participate in the testing, including men, women, transgender people and individuals with a partner whose HIV status is not yet controlled by appropriate treatment.
People living and registered with GP in the UK can also apply to their local sexual health clinic and apply for potential participation in testing.
The program will come to taxpayers for <0xC2><0xA3>10 million and the NHS England signed a drug distribution contract this week after obtaining an international public procurement.
The trial period is designed to gather clinical evidence and assess the full potential of PrEP, its targeting, use and implementation on a large scale.
Simon Stevens added: ‘This important intervention should complement and fully burden the ever-expanding and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in more than 30 years of efforts to tackle one of the greatest challenges to human health.”
Deborah Gold, executive director of the National Aids Trust, said: “We are witnessing a decisive moment in the fight against HIV.
If PrEP is administered correctly and patients are at risk, it will offer the possibility of a change in the English HIV epidemic.
From September, the NSH will offer patients at high risk of HIV infection a powerful new tool that is individually controlled and not subject to the need to talk to a partner, leading to an improvement in the quality of many lives.
We are pleased to accept this statement."
Ian Green, CEO of Terrence Higgins Trust, said: “Priority number one must be the rapid deployment of tests across the country; we must ensure that it is available to every patient.
We now have the PrEP trial drug available and we are on track to protect more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV infection.”
Shadow Health Minister Sharon Hodgson said: “The beginning of the PrEP trial period is a welcome and long-awaited change after months of delays and delays by the government.
Evidence suggests how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to preventing HIV and ending the transmission of this life-threatening infection.
Subsequent tests will bring us one step closer to a full understanding of the benefits of PrEP.
“It is now important that we start testing as soon as possible across the country to protect people who are exposed to HIV and together to stop the spread of HIV in society.”
High-legged life: mezzanine and smart design turned this small apartment into a spacious home at Earls Court
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, exchanged a large house in Knightsbridge for an apartment at Earls Cour in 2014.
Located on the first floor of Queen Anne's smart terrace - and is an optimistic example of modern design that takes full advantage of the available space.
“I used to live with my ex-husband in a much bigger house in the Knightsbridge neighborhood,” Joanne said.
“I was looking for something at a reasonable price.
I ran into this apartment in Earls Court and it was the same ceiling height.
I fell in love with him right away, and I kissed him the same day.”
Since then, the 1000-square-meter apartment has undergone a complete renovation.
A one-room apartment with a complicated layout - to get into the bedroom, you had to go through the kitchen - Joanne wanted to add a storage room and a staircase to use a high ceiling.
“I wanted a high ceiling, big windows and a lot of light.
That’s what my demands were,” she said.
To this end, she employed Erfan Azadi from the design and design studio Duck & Shed based in Notting Hill and used a nearly four-metre ceiling to create a home that was not only a project, but also a place to live.
The ceiling did not reach such heights that two gaps would come over each other - the challenge for the architects was to create an intersection on which to walk upright.
Erfan had to engage his creative thinking.
“The steel structure is quite complicated,” he explained.
“We had to arrange both rooms so that we could walk upright.
It was not just about building a simple platform, but at the same time bending the steel structure so that it was at the right height above and below the ceiling."
This arrangement allowed Erfan to construct two full-fledged rooms on his own - and at the same time add to the drama.
In the middle floor overlooks the beautiful living room with old copper window frames in Retrouvius design.
Mirror furniture in gold color, silver lines and retro chandelier Serge Mouille creates a unique style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in drama, space and lighting.
The short hallway is equipped with mirrors on both sides and looks so longer.
The mirror bar in the kitchen looks like a window into the next room.
At the entrance doors there are storage rooms equipped with mirrors for storage of cutlery and glassware.
The advantage of the living room, which gives the whole apartment an impression of significantly more space, is the possibility to separate it from the kitchen, if not used.
Foldable kitchens are nothing new.
What is unique about this solution, however, is the folding door.
“We had to solve the technical side,” says Erfan about the reinforced veneered doors.
“The doors are equipped with anti-balances so that they can be removed very easily.”
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne gained another 16 square meters, a second room and a better overall layout of the apartment.
“When it comes down to it, what you’re selling is the living space — or the valuation of your property,” Erfan said.
“The real estate agent essentially calculates its price on the basis of the living area when entering the apartment.”
In this case, it was possible to increase the living area while preserving the quality materials that lend the space a luxurious look.
“The material is very important because you touch it and create an emotional bond with the home,” Erfan added.
“You don’t love electricity in the walls.
Yes, they are important, but your hearts are not gaining.”
As it turned out, the quality design and enhancement of the living space can turn an ordinary apartment into an exceptional work.
And just like Joanne, you can finally decide to stay.
The United States is dismantling.
The cultural and political divide between the blue and red states is deepening.
California has banned its citizens from travelling to the state of Tennessee and seven other states.
The state of Tennessee retaliated and declared a legal ban on its citizens travelling to California.
Of course, this is not a ban in the full sense, citizens of the United States can travel freely across all 50 states.
California has banned spending state money on its citizens’ travels to eight other states, including Alabama, South Dakota, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.
Who will stop this madness?
California is strong for LGBT and any expression of disapproval of LGBT lifestyles is considered discrimination.
However, Tennessee passed a Conscience Retention Act that states that a psychotherapist who has a moral problem with the therapy of LGBT patients is not obliged to provide it to them, but is obliged to provide another therapist to those patients who does not have such a problem.
Texas and other states have again enacted laws under which religious charitable organizations that have received children from mothers after birth for adoption have no obligation to provide these children for adoption to same-sex couples.
Because of these Conscience Retention Acts, California has banned funding of its citizens' travels to eight Union states from its means.
In practice, this means that California professors may not have trips to a scientific symposium, for example, in Texas paid from their universities because they are co-financed by the state of California.
Similarly, school sports teams cannot travel to tournaments or competitions, for example, to Tennessee with financial support from their schools.
On the way, they must receive either federal grants, but it is absurd for the federal government to fund citizens’ trips from State A to State B, or private sponsorship.
The state of Tennessee has come to be patient and its parliament passed a law with a resolution that it also dislikes California’s policies of high taxes, high state spending, high deficits, and tolerance of illegal immigrants, but still in California because of this travel embargo.
He's rigging them in retaliation for the California travel embargo on Tennessee.
And the same will happen to every State of the Union that would order a similar travel ban to another State for any reason.
At the same time, he called on the parliaments of all states to stop this madness.
That's the facts, now the comment.
The situation is toxic.
First, all of this is constitutional, nothing is unconstitutional.
States have the right to enact laws on conscientious objections, as well as to decide what their money is going to and what they are not allowed to do.
Second, what’s wrong with conscientious objections?
If a butcher has a religious problem selling pork, why not just offer beef, lamb, poultry, and fish?
Why should he be forced to sell pork under penalty of fines when slaughterhouses offering pork are enough?
In Colorado, a baker faces an anti-discrimination lawsuit and a high fine for refusing to bake a cake for a gay wedding.
But he also refuses to bake Halloween cakes or alcohol-containing cakes.
Why don't you punish him and leave him alone and order the relevant cakes from hundreds of other bakers?
Third, the beauty of the federal system is that the constitutional rights of all the citizens of the federation are guaranteed, but individual states can adjust internal, domestic politics in powers that are not federal, according to their own, i.e. according to the preferences of their inhabitants.
Then there is diversity, diversity, diversity, and diversity.
California can be California and Texas can be Texas.
But California wants California to be California and Texas, and seven other states to be California too!
Fourthly, members of the LGBT community were rightly seeking tolerance for their lifestyles.
Today, many members of this community are guided by the rule of living and letting live by which all reasonable people should be guided, but some activists are striving not for tolerance towards themselves and others, but for extreme intolerance towards others.
According to them, no one should ever again express a moral, religious or philosophical disapproval of LGBT lifestyles, and if they do, they should be criminalized.
The mentality of these activists is totalitarian.
They are the modern enemies of freedom.
Fifthly, I do not know the situation in American history, when states, for political reasons, agreed to do so, except in the case of the only one.
Even in the days of the struggle for the civil rights of blacks, where the North and the West were on the side of integration and the South on the side of segregation, the states did not impose sanctions on each other.
The only case was in the 50s of the 19th century, the political cause was slavery, and it was moving towards a war between the North and the South.
Of course, nothing like this will happen now, but the situation is still toxic.
The cultural and political gap between the blue democratic and the red republican states is deepening and the United States is mentally dissolving internally.
Unauthorized agitation.
Putin's critics have received a heavy fine.
Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny was fined 300,000 rubles for violating the rules of the campaign ahead of next year’s presidential election.
The court fined him for inviting people to participate in unauthorised demonstrations.
Navalny has organized two major anti-government street protests in the last two months and announced that he wants to run for the post of head of state in March next year.
Kremlin chief Vladimir Putin has not announced his candidacy yet, but is generally expected to do so and win again.
Navalnyy said the police came to his house in the morning and took him to court.
He was fined for calling on people to demonstrate through videos posted on the YouTube web portal.
The fine is three hundred thousand.
"We'll cut them out of the judge's salary later," a Kremlin critic joked on Twitter.
The Russian election commission recently concluded that Navalny could not participate in the presidential election because he was previously convicted of wrongdoing.
However, Navalny, who is considered a fighter against corruption, considers the relevant judgment politically motivated.
The court also imposed fines of 300,000 rubles and 25 thousand rubles on Thursday against two members of the Naval pre-election team, Leonid Volkov and Nikolai Lyaskin.
Navalny joined Russian politics as an anti-corruption blogger and gradually became a dominant figure on the fragmented opposition scene.
The authorities are trying to defend Navalny in the campaign.
In February, he was sentenced to five years in prison for stealing the Kirovles forestry company.
The ruling was confirmed by the appeals court in May.
The verdict is so powerful, which prevents Navalny from running under Russian laws.
The brothers are fighting for an empire worth more than $500 million.
Two brothers now, more than four decades after the founding of the empire by their Italian family, are pulling over one of the most expensive Victorian real estate worth more than $500 million.
Former director of the Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis resides on the Toorak estate, only three rooms from his younger brother Paul, who has brought the dispute over common property and commercial property to the Supreme Court.
Paul wanted to leave the family business as early as 2014, but the sharp dispute is constantly being denied in the Supreme Court.
Together with his mother Anna, his brothers own a total of 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars. The first store was bought by the family in 1973 on Smith Street in Collingwood.
On this site, the family founded Westco Jeans, which has grown into a chain of 160 stone shops.
In 1999, the family sold the entire company for $85 million.
The De Lutis family’s portfolio now includes offices, construction sites in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments on the Gold Coast and Mt Buller, and shopping centers in the suburbs.
Paul owns about one-third of the company's assets, while his father Colin, who, according to Paul, is the "significant driving force and dominant personality" of the De Lutis family, owns less than two-thirds of the assets.
Court records state that Colin owns $316 million in real estate, while Paul manages $176 million in real estate.
For Paul, the division of property and funds has become a problem.
“Colin’s proposal has come out in my eyes in his favor,” Paul wrote in a 2015 adjudicatory statement.
Last Friday, after several unsuccessful attempts at peace, the first session of the Supreme Court was held.
The brothers are now also competing over who will control the existing business - from which Paula, according to his statement, cut off Colin.
Colin argues that this is not true and accuses Paul of mishandling some of his properties.
In a previous statement, Colin said he believed in the apparent resolution of the conflict.
“My Italian background dictates to me that family is the most important of all,” he wrote.
Hundreds of pages of adjudicatory statements, emails and messages from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer are flooded by lawyers including Allan Myers, QC, and lawyers on both sides.
Ms. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who had been running milk bars and delicacies since the 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the 1970s.
They bought a property in Collingwood, where Colin opened the first family business with jeans.
Colin said that when he founded Westco "in his final year of college, Paul was still a small, about 10-year-old boy."
Anna De Lutis said that together with Luigi, who died in 2012, they hoped that the transfer of property to their sons would take place after good.
“Luigi often said he never wanted his sons to end up in court,” she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis family group. Colin said Mark was compensated by $10 million on his departure and Luke by $26 million.
As Paul said, Luke and Mark “were not satisfied with the terms of their financial compensation.”
Colin has since held back despite the fact that he is a former member of the AFL's board, as Eddie McGuire, a well-known television personality and Colin's best friend, said in his 2015 autobiography.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paula de Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Colin responded only through a text message in which he stated that, given the fact that the dispute is being settled in court, “I have nothing to add.”
“It’s very sad that my brother Paul decided to take the whole matter to court,” he wrote.
In a statement in mid-2016, Colin said he was trying to adapt to his brother’s demands.
"Our father would be very dissatisfied if he saw our current situation," he said, adding that he "always hopes for an apparent solution."
On Friday, all hopes were out of sight.
“Our disputes will be resolved soon in court,” Colin wrote.
Vedra in the Czech Republic.
Teachers shower children.
MHD drivers fascinate water and summer clothes.
At Na Chodovci kindergarten in Prague 4, where there are now about 35 children, they go out only in the morning.
The <0xC5><0xA0>kolka is after reconstruction and the planted trees do not yet provide a large shade.
There is no pool, but the teachers shower the children in the fog.
In the afternoon, the children stay in the classrooms, where the blinds and covered curtains are removed.
The air is trying to cool with an air purifier because they do not have air conditioning.
It is also difficult for teachers and cooks.
"The temperature, which is inside and outside, exceeds the hygienic limits for kindergartens, so during this period we should not even have an open operation," said Miloslava Makovi<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1>, the director of the kindergarten.
In the nursery there is a glass corridor, where according to her the temperature moves around 40 degrees.
We ventilate in the morning after 6am, the windows close, and we have blinds on the southern sides to protect ourselves.
"But it won't help much," she added.
There are better conditions in the forest nursery Na Hr<0xC3><0xA1>zi in Hostivice, where children spend most of their time outside.
We have grown trees on the land, so we're under them.
“We have a beautiful walnut tree there, there’s a table underneath it, and we do different things there,” said Barbara Kompan, the head of the nursery.
Teachers try to go to the woods with children, where there is a bigger cradle.
Children wear wet hats and have different games with water on the program.
"We have a hand-held pressure sprayer that is used for spraying flowers, and we use it for showering children," Kompanov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
Also, the director of the kindergarten in Novoborsk<0xC3><0xA1> street in Prague’s Proseku Jitka Vilimovsk<0xC3><0xA1> said that the teachers of children are trying to keep in the shadows and dripping them with water.
"We have a fairly large garden, so they're under the trees," she said.
He goes out in the morning and then after 3 p.m.
Every child must have a head covering.
Teachers also remind children that they should have a drink.
For example, they can choose a little sweetened tea or diluted juice and have drinks with water in the garden.
Every day they also have a vegetable salad to eat and a snack always fresh fruits and vegetables, which sometimes even parents bring to them.
"Perhaps one mother brought here about ten kilograms of melon for the children today," Makovi<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1> added.
Drivers are given water or summer equestrians.
The Prague transport company DPP provides them with water, ion beverages or summer equatories on hot days.
Drivers' cabins and buses are in most cases air-conditioned, said DPP spokeswoman Aneta <0xC5><0x98>ehkov<0xC3><0xA1>.
In addition to the cabins, some trams are also air-conditioned in the passenger space.
The high-temperature trams have not been seriously damaged so far.
A small damage was done in the loop in Hostivar.
At current high temperatures, we take care, above all, to ensure that the drivers have sufficient quantities of drinks available.
"Golden drinking water is available in all loops, switch points and routes," <0xC5><0x98>ehkov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
On the routes and at some alternating points, employees have at their disposal so-called soda bars that produce refrigerated sodium.
Drivers also receive soluble protective ion beverages.
“They can also use a summer uniform that increases the comfort of drivers during their daily shifts,” the spokeswoman added.
The hot and dry weather of the last few days has resulted in an increase in the number of fires.
On Tuesday, firefighters across the Czech Republic liquidated 108 firefighters, twice the long-term daily average.
On Tuesday, on a day when temperatures in the Czech Republic fell above 35 degrees Celsius, firefighters mainly engaged in firefighting.
"The fires are predominant in the natural environment and also those associated with harvest work," said fire spokeswoman Nicole Zaoralov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Even the evening weather changes did not bring relief to the firefighters, when the heat in a number of places replaced storms and rainfall.
In connection with the storms, the firefighters went to 236 strikes.
It was mainly about the removal of fallen trees and branches.
"They hit the most in the Central Bohemian region," Zaoralov<0xC3><0xA1> continues.
However, firefighters were also needed in Stvol<0xC3><0xAD>nk in <0xC4><0x8C>eskolipsko, where 60 people from the children’s camp were evacuated to safety due to the storm.
Tropical temperatures also assigned the work to Prague rescue workers.
On Tuesday and on Wednesday night, ambulances drove to a dozen cases of carbon dioxide poisoning from the car.
People should therefore have their water heaters checked, warns the rescuers.
Coal oxide is a colorless odorless gas that is released when incomplete combustion occurs.
Symptoms of poisoning include nausea, vomiting, headache and feeling dizzy.
In case of suspicion of poisoning, it is necessary to leave the contaminated room.
Trump’s New Chief of Staff Plans to Limit President’s Media Diet
Many have tried it before, and have always failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can really do it.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico said the new White House chief of staff plans to curb President Trump’s flow of information — including news reports — in the hopes that he will keep Trump at a level.
Here is part of reporter Josh Dawsey's report:
“When the new White House chief of staff John F. Kelly met on the first day in a new job with employees, he outlined Trump’s key White House problem that he intends to fix: the incorrect information that is getting into the president’s hands.
Kelly told employees that he must personally approve all information - whether on paper or in a word - because the president can make better decisions based on the right information."
Kelly’s diagnosis actually makes sense, but many of his predecessors broke their teeth to control Trump and his media presentation.
Trump’s relationship with the media dates back decades – and now, sitting in the White House, his habit of watching TV news is even stronger.
“If Trump, as a candidate, was upset by honest reporting, it was appropriate to show him that a lot of other media were talking about him in a positive light, which was easier to convince,” Sam Nunberg, a former campaign adviser, told Politico in February.
Tara Palmeri of the Politico website wrote that “the key to keeping Trump’s tweets in line – at least according to the words of the six former campaign organizers – is to ensure that Trump regularly monitors the media that praises him.”
All right.
However, the idea that Trump’s tendency to post his views on Twitter was once “under control” is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign organizers know something that others don’t know – that Trump’s tweets would be more upsetting if someone didn’t control them.
The tweets that Trump never sent will most likely never be heard of.
If his employees managed to keep him at least a few times in line, then their efforts did not go far.
However, no one has been able to prevent Trump from regularly inciting controversial topics.
Part of this problem lies in the fact that in the White House, which is made up of rival factions, people are regularly trying to strengthen their agenda by undermining Trump’s materials — which can, but may not be, reliable — that support their view of the world.
The Politico portal, which covered the issue from all sides, published a report in May on the advisers’ tendency to submit dubious information to the head of state.
Here is an example of such information from pen reporter Shane Goldmacher:
“Contemporary and former Trump officials claim that the president often reacts very angryly to negative media reports, especially then to leaked information reports, and seeks to find their origin.
The situation came at the end of February when someone shoved the president a copy of an article from GotNews.com – the website of provocateur Charles C. Johnson – which accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh of being “the source of many leaks” from the White House.
Regardless of whether Johnson was permanently deported from Twitter for harassment; or that he did not substantiate his claim with any evidence; or that he had already issued false accusations in the past and later dismissed them.
Trump read the article and started to ask Walsh.
Goldmacher added that then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Secretary Rob Porter “have tried to implement a system to manage and document information that President Trump will receive.”
Would that work?
Kelly is now, three months later, trying to pursue the same strategy.
He may prove to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump’s impulsiveness will not be lost and his aides are still competing for power.
These immutable factors of Kelly's mission are certainly burdensome.
Tourists negotiate excavation and return to ‘Millionaire’s Quarter’
Some of the most movable homeowners in the English county of West Midland are once again deserting themselves with determined tourists who are negotiating with local authorities about the right to reclaim the land for their homes.
Tourists parked 20 caravans in the field near a thriving street in the city of Solihull, which is dubbed the “Millionaire’s Quarter.”
Bringing horses, children and an army of caravans, tourists return after being deported in May. They did not even notice a trench, which was excavated on the spot under a regulation of the authorities to prevent their entry.
The tactical group found gaps in the defense and penetrated into the field with the caravans unprotected gap that served as the way.
Residents of the district attacked the Solihull city council with the fact that 'they are unable to solve the problem'.
One resident, who wished to remain anonymous, said: ‘They planted the place on Monday night after being moved to Bentley Heath Street, where they threw stones at other people.
The Board of Directors should be ashamed of its inability to solve the problem.
All the tourists were moved to another place and now they are back.
There were more of them last night, and I think there will be more of them today."
She added: “The Birmingham Board of Directors knows how to deal with this problem. It uses court orders to protect the parks.
I live on Streetsbrook and I don't want to pay any more taxes until the board of directors settles with the tourists.'
Another anonymous resident said: ‘It’s ridiculous. We just recently watched the last outgoing tourists and now they’re back.
And this time there are even more of them, and this time they brought horses with them.'
A Solihull City Council spokesperson said: “We are aware of the unauthorized stay on the property near Streetsbrook Road and, in cooperation with the local police, we are taking the necessary legal steps to seemingly solve the whole problem.
In order to gather as much evidence as possible, it is necessary for as many locals as possible to report any unsocial or illegal behaviour to the police at number 101.
We'll get the whole picture that we'll bring to court."
The MEP’s husband crashed a car in Brussels.
He was brought in by a government special.
The government special transported the wounded R<0xC3><0xB3>bert <0xC5><0xBD>it<0xC5><0x88>anski to Bratislava on Wednesday afternoon.
Two ambulances were waiting at the airport and the plane was under the constant control of Slovak doctors.
The long-planned flight went uncomplicated.
According to TV JOJ, Robert <0xC5><0xBD>it<0xC5><0x88>ansk<0xC3><0xBD> had a serious accident in Brussels earlier this summer.
He was hit by a car and has been in serious condition ever since.
After the transfer to his homeland, he was transported to a specialized workplace of one of the Bratislava hospitals.
The economic analyst is the husband of Slovak MEP Jana <0xC5><0xBD>it<0xC5><0x88>ansk<0xC3><0xA1> from NOVA.
She did not want to comment on the incident.
The couple have three children together.
The Italians intensified in the fight against NGO rescue ships with immigrants on board
Italy has announced that it will block the arrival of NGO rescue ships sailing off the coast of Italy with immigrants from the Mediterranean Sea unless the NGOs sign new rules regulating their operations.
“Unless NGOs sign new rules of conduct, it will be hard for us to imagine that they could continue their operations,” Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with Turin daily La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized the ship of the German rescue organization Jugend Rettet on suspicion of trafficking in human beings, which greatly facilitates illegal immigration.
The rescue organization, which operates for the first year, has refused to comment on the whole case on the charges of the Italian prosecutor, Ambrogia Cartosi<0xC3><0xA8>.
“It is and will always be the number one priority to save human lives, so we are very sorry that we are not currently able to operate in rescue zones,” the organization said in a statement on social media.
“We can only comment on any current indictment after gathering all the information and evaluating the whole situation.”
The Italian authorities have been monitoring the Youth Rettet ship since October.
Her crew is suspected of transporting immigrants on board, who were handed over to them directly by human traffickers, repeatedly.
At least one meeting was held, according to the prosecutor's file, only 1.3 miles from the coast of Libya, the course of the meeting was published by Italian media.
The crew of the ship is suspected of breaking the law and circumventing the Italian coastguard, which oversees rescue operations in the area - from humanitarian enthusiasm, rather than anything else.
The Code of Conduct establishes the presence of an Italian police officer on board ships such as Iuventa to monitor activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in the rescue operations have so far agreed to comply with the Code: Save The Children, the Maltese MOAS and the Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms.
The last-named organisation said on Thursday that new rules are not necessary, but acceptable, as they do not represent any "substantial change or obstacle" in terms of rescue operations.
For example, the new code of conduct was rejected by Doctors Without Borders (MSF), which is the recipient of the Nobel Prize.
Minniti, meanwhile, has been told that the sharp decline of immigrants in recent weeks landing in Italy as part of rescue operations suggests that efforts to strengthen patrols off the coast of Libya and cooperation with local mayors bear fruit.
“In the last few days we are starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel,” the minister said.
He also revealed plans for further talks to be held this month with the mayors of Libya on the economic development initiative, as well as with the representatives of Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in hopes of achieving Europe.
Unashamed Mesaro<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1>: Silicone and cellulite climbed from the overall!
The hot summer days attract you to take on only the most necessary things that will cover the most intimate parties.
Only Dominika Mesaro<0xC5><0xA1>a does the opposite.
At an afternoon meeting at the Prague Zoo, where the actors, moderators, singers and everyone who has anything to do with TV Prima, just hung up, put their body into a mini-overall.
And just a few regular movements and the model showed everyone her silicones, but also her butt.
It was because he had cut himself in half several times, and he was so tall that he had to adjust it all the time.
The attention of the gentlemen and the photographers present was certainly not needed.
Michelle Carter Sentenced to Sending Text Messages Inciting Conrad Roy's Suicide
A woman from Massachusetts has been sentenced to two years in prison for inciting her friend to commit suicide via text messages and phone calls.
The 20-year-old Michelle Carter is serving 15 months of a two-year sentence behind bars and then spending five years on parole.
Carter was convicted in June of inadvertently killing Conrad Roy, who took his own life on July 13, 2014.
Roy’s father told the court on Thursday: “The whole family has been crushed.
My son was my best friend.”
Carter was left at liberty until the decision was made.
She was threatened with imprisonment for up to 20 years, but her lawyers argued that she and Roy suffered from a mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and cream blouses, Carter stood in a place where she had tears in her eyes, her hands swollen, and her eyes pointing to the ground.
"Her execution killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the judge.
“She ended her life to relieve herself.
She couldn’t take on her own responsibility,” she said.
“She didn’t have any regrets.”
But Carter's lawyer said it was "unfortunate circumstances that he deeply regrets."
Judge Lawrence Moniz added that “her age or level of maturity or even a mental disorder have no significant impact on her performance.”
The plaintiff read Roy’s mother Lynn Roy’s statement: “It’s not going to run one day so I don’t grieve over the loss of my son.
"I want him to be proud of me - I take care of his sisters and together we will endure the immense pain that we will carry with us forever."
Roy's sister Camdyn Roy testified that she was "persecuted" by the knowledge that she would never attend her brother's wedding and would never be his children's aunt.
“The loss of the person I’ve seen since I was born is a pain that I’ll carry with me for life,” she said.
The state of Massachusetts does not have a valid law that would affect a person assisting in the suicide of another person. This case therefore sets a legal precedent.
Carter was 17 when Roy was found in a car seat in 2014, poisoned by carbon dioxide.
The case attracted the attention of the entire nation after Carter's text messages were published, which incited suicide.
“It doesn’t matter if you hang yourself, jump out of a building, or stab yourself,” Carter wrote in text messages she sent just two weeks before his death when Roy was on family leave.
A few minutes before her suicide, she wrote to him: “You have to do it, Conrad” and “Just hit the generator and you’ll be free and happy.”
Judge Moniz said Carter wanted attention through Roy's death and ordered her to refrain from any comments in the press.
The case raised a lot of questions.
One of the people standing on Carter's side was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007. Two years ago, the charge was dismissed.
Ms. Knox, 30, said in a statement in the Los Angeles Times: “Michelle Carter deserves understanding and help, not prison.”
Audi adjusts up to 850,000 diesel vehicles in response to a sharp response
Just the day before the announcement, Audi said it would offer its customers a software update in more than 350,000 vehicles.
BMW said the company believes that “there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions” in response to European cities – including Munich, which is home to BMW – that are considering a ban or restriction on diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes cars across Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies referred to this decision as a withdrawal.
European car manufacturers have widely promoted the use of diesel cars in Europe and the United States in order to comply with the CO2 emissions regulations.
Nitrogen oxide, which is released by diesel engines, is considered a carcinogen and can cause asthma.
At the same time, there is an increase in the cost of installing equipment to neutralize the gases emitted by diesel engines, which hampers the competitiveness of cars.
While German automakers are facing careful scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel faces accusations of dismantling powerful car companies and ignoring their problems.
The company is trying to avoid mistakes made by Volkswagen, which, in an effort to meet the emission limits, installed software in its cars that reduced the amount of emissions emitted during testing, but under normal conditions the software was deactivated.
Several senior Volkswagen officials have been indicted in the United States and others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, a former head of thermodynamics at Audi’s engine development department was arrested in Germany.
Former manager Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is of Italian nationality and is therefore not subject to extradition, so he may face legal proceedings in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in a criminal investigation by German police into the Volkswagen car case after authorities accused Audi of installing a system that was supposed to bypass European emission limits - thus widening the charges Audi faces in the US.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation can have a negative impact on Volkswagen: luxury car manufacturers make up a disproportionate share of Volkswagen’s profits.
The plane landed on the beach in an emergency.
A man and a girl are dead.
The accident occurred on the Praia de S<0xC3><0xA3>o Jo<0xC3><0xA3>o beach in the Costa da Caparica area, about 30 kilometers south of Lisbon.
One of the witnesses told SIC News that the plane had flown just above the people who had sunk on the beach before landing.
Some people from the beach are said to have fled the danger to the sea.
Unfortunately, two people were unable to escape from the machine.
A 50-year-old man and an eight-year-old girl were killed on the beach.
"The plane crashed them and they were dead at the scene," said Pedro Coelho Dias, the local police chief.
Their nationality is not yet known.
Two people were on board the plane, both of whom were transported alive from the accident and the police took them to interrogation.
D11 or how not to build a highway.
Are the highways in the Czech Republic complete?
I'll give you a riddle.
It is unrealistic, even though it began to be built in 1978.
Even if it is unfinished, it is constantly being repaired.
And it can't be built anymore, even if it has a building permit.
- What's that?
Yes, the castle highway D11.
The construction of its next section for at least a few months has been stopped by the Children of Earth movement.
We Easterners get a freeway in pieces, like when they cut salami.
The wheel turns around, and then we'll see when and if we'll ever get another one.
We don't want anything miraculous.
We just want to shorten the driving time and we want to get trucks going to Poland or from Poland from villages and cities.
Infinite flows of trucks go directly through the cities of Jarom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99> or N<0xC3><0xA1>chod, which is not as reasonably accessible.
But so far the last section of our dream highway was launched in 2008, that is, an incredible nine years ago.
Since then, not a stick.
Therefore, when the remaining four kilometres of unfinished section to Hradec Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lové were recently started to be built and on the other sections to Jarom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>i began an archaeological survey with the fact that the construction will begin at the end of this year, you could have been in the eastern Boucht G<0xC5><0x82>y<0xC5><0xA1>e in the Czech Republic.
No one believed it any more.
Last week, it turned out that there will be no construction this year.
And maybe next year, too.
The movement of the children of the Earth Club for sustainable transport from Brno has been dismantled.
Children of the Earth repeat their D1 tactics.
The decision on a building permit was taken on a full scale.
They shall request, in due course, a review of all the binding opinions already issued by all the authorities concerned.
For example, the Castle Magistrate, the Ministry of the Environment, but also the Ministry of Defense or the Dr<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xBE>n<0xC3><0xAD> <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD>.
So for now, from D11 we go down near the village with the proverbial name Poh<0xC5><0x99>eba<0xC4><0x8D>ka.
So we go down, we just walk down the highway and all of a sudden we stand on the side road and prefer to join the column afterwards.
The worst thing is that you see similar stories all over the republic.
A terrible, constantly blocked road to Bene<0xC5><0xA1>ov, the D1 or D8 motorway.
Everyone has their own Funeral.
What do Earth’s children want?
What is the essence of the problems of communication construction in the Czech Republic?
And why in the current system is the highway network practically unfinished?
Read in the new reflex.
Lavender from Provence threatens climate change
The lavender has become a symbol of Provence in south-eastern France, but is now endangered by climate change.
Lavender is depleted as a result of dry climate and harmful insects, causing scare on the faces of researchers and farmers looking for a solution.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: “Lavender cultivation in Provence is at risk because in the last few years this plant has been exposed to climate change, which brings with it less rainfall in the spring and in the fall.
This affects the life of the lavender.
They are also responsible for the cicadas and ticks that carry microbacteria that thrive in dry climates.”
There's a lot at stake.
Lavender attracts tourists and the oil that is made from them is an important ingredient in perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: “Instead of long and beautiful flowers, smaller, undeveloped and often weak plants grow.
The amount of oil obtained from these lavenders is, of course, smaller."
A possible solution can be more efficient water distribution and slowing down the evaporation of water from the soil, but also spraying lavender with a protective mixture of clay and water and breeding more species resistant to dry weather.
Assassination of journalists highlights growing threats in Mexico <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Employees of the Riodoc weekly meet regularly every Wednesday to discuss news about the unrest in the Sinaloa area with the participation of organized criminals, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.
Today, however, with the help of recent events, it is meeting mainly for its own safety.
They learn that it is important to change their habits.
Two well-deserved journalists talk about what would be safer: taking their children to an office that was attacked by a grenade in 2009, or leaving them at home.
Security experts wrote three simple words on the blackboard: opponents, neutrals and allies.
They will ask journalists to give names to each word - no evidence is needed, it is enough to use imagination and prejudice.
Choosing them out of what – drug traffickers, politicians, traders and journalists are suspected of taking money from the government or drug cartels – is a catalogue of criminals whose task is to cover up criminal acts.
Violence continues and the bodies are piling up all over the country; journalists are constantly growing among them: according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, there are at least 25 of them since President Enrique Pena Nieta came to power in December 2012; 589 journalists are behind bars and behind bars after federal protection.
Among them are the co-founder of the magazine Riodioce, editor and inspiration for colleagues, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
“The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and working as a journalist,” Valdez wrote in one of his many books on violence associated with the drug trade.
His loss is noticeable, although his presence is all-pervading - a large photograph of Valdez with the inscription "Justice", on which the middleman points, hangs in front of the building; two journalists - Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez - over the age of 30, have a T-shirt with a photo of Valdez with a mouthpiece.
The meeting takes place less than two months after his death; journalists talk about mutual traumas, nightmares, insomnia and paranoia.
Despite the fact that a special federal prosecutor’s office was set up in 2010 to deal with journalists’ cases, two suspects have so far been charged, according to a statement from the Committee on the Protection of Journalists.
Most of the thousands of murders that occur each year are linked to drug trafficking and organized crime, and the perpetrators of the crime are so exceptionally court-martialed.
Journalists from Riod<0xC3><0xB3>c insist they will report on the violence that is taking place in Sinaloa; although the destruction is regrettable and the territory mentioned is currently very treacherous.
“Without information about the murders and without the vision of justice, the security meeting is subjectless,” Ibarra said.
“It’s silly to waste time on such meetings,” he adds.
“If we don’t get more information, we can’t trust anyone.”
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the headquarters of Riodoc in Culiac<0xC3><0xA1>n, the capital of Sinaloy.
He managed to capture several blocks when his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men who pulled him out of the car and shot him with 12 shots, apparently because of the article's name - which can be translated as the Twelve River.
The gunmen then got into his car and smashed it not far from the scene.
Valdez died at the age of 50.
He left behind a wife and two adult children.
It seems that rumors are spreading rapidly in Culiac<0xC3><0xA1>n.
In the case of Valdez, however, the suspect is silent.
Since Guzman’s arrest last year and his January release to the United States, Sinaloa has become one of the country’s bloodiest battlefields as rival factions try to fill a vacant spot.
Every day, several people are killed in the streets of Sinaloi, and the cemetery is full of embodied two-story mausoleums for drug kings, many of which are larger than houses.
Forget for a moment that the word “army” is meant to mean that a drug cartel controls a coastal state with precious ports and important routes that the drug travels to the United States.
Despite the fact that Valdez was intimately familiar with the risks of his employment, Ismail Bojorquez (60), the co-founder and director of Riodoce, still speculates that he did not protect his friend.
He believes that two errors have contributed to his death.
The first was the February issue of an interview with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the rival drug cartels that waged war with the sons of Joaqu<0xC3><0xAD>n Guzm<0xC3><0xA1>n.
Smir could have angered his sons; the suspect gang members bought all the copies of the newspapers as they landed on the counters.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the seizure of other newspapers in which the same story was printed.
Valdez has become a legend both in Mexico and abroad, and his death is seen as an important milestone in the fight against journalists by Mexican criminals.
He was able to survive for so long, and all his friends and colleagues believed that it would never change.
In the Noroeste periodical, he was practically a veteran when in 2003 he decided to sell his $50 stock and found it together with five Riodoc colleagues.
In Sinaloe, “it was impossible to run journalism without mentioning the drug trade,” Bojorquez said.
Over time, Riodace gained a good reputation for bold and truthful news; the newspapers began to prosper.
Journalists like to go out looking for problematic topics and publish texts without censorship – readers were fascinated by reading stories that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after its founding, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for reporting on Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his bold reporting on the Mexican drug trade.
Valdez openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I was fighting for my life," he said when he received the award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloae is “a way of life,” Valdez said in an interview with Rompeviento TV in October last year.
“You have to take on the role of a journalist – or play dumb.
I don't want anyone to ask me, 'What did you do to the face of death... why didn't you tell me what was going on?'"
The employees of Riodoc miss Valdez. The man was known for his jokes and indiscriminate language. He was a good friend who liked to give advice and hugs - a teacher who knew how to survive.
They all depended on his daily routine.
He's always wearing his hat.
He often went to the El Guayabo bar across from the office and sat at the same table.
Now they ask: did this routine cause his death?
His death in them also raised questions about his own assumptions - how to do his job as best as possible and stay alive?
"They don't like you messing with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret landing areas."
"These things were forbidden," said Bojorquez.
As a result, there is a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
You have to trust your instincts.
If you don't feel anything going on here, get your hands off.
The trouble is, Riodoc editor Andres Villarreal said that "it's a sense that can be confused... and then the thing happened with Javier."
According to him, the old rules, as well as others, no longer apply in Sinaloae – as well as in the states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, which are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling tracks, weak governments and corrupt politicians.
The landscape is constantly changing.
No mobile phones are allowed in the room where Riodoc employees meet; a few days ago, spyware was discovered, which was bought by governments to monitor Mexican journalists and activists.
In front of the building, two police officers find relief in the shadow of a nearby tree in front of a forty-degree oak tree.
They were chosen by the state to protect the offices of Riodoc, which are located in a four-story building in the urban district of Culiac<0xC3><0xA1>n.
Journalists are drawn to the question of whether it is these police officers who are not among those 50 percent of the law enforcement who, according to the government, are corrupt.
It’s been a few months now that journalists have spent the last time in the mountainous areas, which are essentially controlled by drug cartels.
There are three main stories on the program this week.
The first of these is the murder of the brother of former boxer Julius Caesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They are also informed of suspected government spending that took place in the home town of the governor of the state.
Recently, there have also been several kidnappings in one of Culiac<0xC3><0xA1>n’s most luxurious restaurants, just a block from the D.A.’s office.
Officially, no one announced the identities of the kidnapped people or the circumstances of the kidnapping, so reporters were alerted when they were going to write about what every inhabitant of the city knows: that this restaurant is a favorite destination for drug traffickers and politicians.
One of the journalists read from public records that the restaurant was registered under a name associated with a certain politician who is a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), controlling all levels of the political scene for almost the whole of the past century.
Several PRI governors have recently been charged with high-ranking corruption.
Villarreal asked reporters to write about earlier incidents at the restaurant, including an incident in which one of Joaqu<0xC3><0xAD>n's sons "El Chapo" Guzm<0xC3><0xA1>n escaped from the military intervention forces.
A month ago, readers would read about the topic in Valdez's headline, which was the best source of information about the kidnappings.
"Valdez would have cleared the case," said Villarreal, 46, who is nicknamed "El Flaco" for his slender character.
"Now all the informants turned their backs on us."
Valdez's office turned into a warehouse of stamps and stickers to protest against the killing of journalists. Employees certainly did not expect them to become activists in the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez grabbed several badges and went to protest in front of the D.A.’s office the next morning for another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared just three days after Valdez's murder in the western part of Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n.
Only an abrasive body has been discovered, and the authorities say it's Adame based on DNA analysis.
The activity of journalists is escalating throughout the country. Many of them are organizing protests and clamoring for corridors and buildings “SOS press”.
The head of the newspaper Bojorquez is on a day to visit Washington, D.C., where he seeks international support and achieve justice for Valdez's death.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloy, which took place the day after Valdez's murder, Ramirez accused the authorities of watching journalists and their murders for telling the truth.
In the meantime, she asked for a transfer to another department for fear that her anger might jeopardize her impartiality.
Valdez has repeatedly said that Mexican journalists are “obsessed” with organized crime, corrupt officials and an indifferent public.
In his latest book, Narco-Journalism, he wrote that journalists are dying not only by the hands of drug cartels, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who cooperate with organized crime.
The Articulo 19 media watchdog accused more than half of all attacks on journalists of police and public officials.
“You will die in Mexico because they want to silence you,” Ramirez added.
The murders obviously work.
No one will forget the death of blogger Marie Elizabeth Mac<0xC3><0xAD>as, who took place six years ago at the northern borders of the Tamaulipas.
Her body was found along with a message allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "This is how I ended up because of my messages."
Next to the unwrapped head lay the keyboard and headphones.
Some branches have decided to stop activities, such as the El Norte newspaper, based at the northern border of Chihuahua state, in response to the March murder of reporter Miroslava Breach.
Others continue to do the same as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of their director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an article on the introductory page titled “What do you want from us”?
Some journalists have escaped from their homes or even across the border.
It's an uneasy decision.
Finding a job in exile is difficult, as is getting rid of the feeling that someone is constantly chasing you.
And journalists are being persecuted and killed, as in the case of Ruben Espinos, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City, three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who choose to stay and not give up their jobs, every day poses a great risk.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that writing about drugs scares him.
“Mexico is heading to hell, that’s why I became a journalist,” he said.
It’s Friday midnight and Riodoc’s employees sit on the sidewalk in front of the office – the latest edition sent to the printer – drinking beer when the phone suddenly rings.
It is reported that 19 people were killed in a shooting between gang members and policemen near a beach resort in Mazatlan.
The war is escalating, just as many messages left by the members of the syndicate in this area promised.
Journalists publish this news from their mobile phone on the Riodoce website.
Not a single day goes by and the title changes again.
The sounds of the police sirens point to another shot.
Bojorquez throws a fleeting glance at the police guard to see if they are paying attention.
If they're afraid, they don't reveal it.
Under the huge portrait of the fallen co-founder of their periodical – whose middleman is an outspoken slogan for the entire Sinaloe – all Riodoc employees follow in his footsteps.
'How could we think of leaving,' said Bojorquez, 'when on the same day Javier was killed, an intern asked me to send her to the streets?'
Dinosaurs Use Camouflage to Avoid Enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, however scary.
Researchers have now revealed the findings of the first astonishing creature about the size of a rhinoceros, whose perfectly preserved remains — which experts have called the ‘Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs’ — were found by a Canadian miner.
The remains were preserved to such a high degree that experts were able to determine the reddish-brown color of his scaly skin, stating that the dinosaur had a ‘problematic past’.
An article in the journal Current Biology said it was “the most preserved armoured dinosaur ever found and one of the best dinosaur species in the world.”
The fossil is a new genus of Nodosauridae. The dinosaur lived during the Cretaceous period, about 110 to 112 million years ago.
His perfectly preserved condition was literally shocked by researchers who described him with the words “remarkable indeed.”
According to National Geographic, the armored whitefish is the best-preserved fossil of its kind.
Behind the discovery is Shawn Funk, who discovered the rock on March 21, 2011, while drilling in the Suncor Millenium mine near Alberta, Canada.
He came across something that looked like a foreign object and decided to explore it more closely.
The stone was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
The researchers spent the next six years working on the discovery of an animal from a huge piece of land weighing 1,100 kg.
Upon completion of the work, the dinosaur is ready to be discovered.
“Just close your eyes a little bit and you’ll believe he’s sleeping,” said work leader Caleb Brown and a naturalist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the animal is on display.
“It will certainly be recorded in history as one of the most beautiful and preserved species of dinosaurs – Mona Lisa dinosaurs.”
By studying his skin, the researchers found that this herbaceous plant — though covered in armor and reminiscent of a walking tank — was most likely facing a serious threat from meat-eating dinosaurs.
A heavily armed dinosaur used red and white camouflage to protect against predators and used a masking system that uses many animals today.
Experts say that this allowed him to blend better with his surroundings and avoid enemies. The masking system suggests that he was a favorite food of larger dinosaurs.
Reports of the 110-million-year-old dinosaur genus Nodosauridae first appeared in the newspapers in May. It is currently available for viewing at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
The researchers named it Borealoplet Markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, who spent more than 7,000 hours with the team carefully uncovering the fossil.
Thanks to the amazingly preserved state of the fossil, Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists were able to document patterns and shapes of scales and armour throughout the body.
They discovered the masking method commonly used by today's animals in defense - the upper part of the animal was darker than its lower part.
Although this masking effect is common in nature, the findings of the researchers are surprising, because the size of the Borealopelta far exceeds today’s animals using the same technique.
It is therefore possible that the dinosaur was so many predators that evolution preferred masking before confrontation in survival.
Many modern-day masked animals - for example deer, zebra, and belt - are much smaller and also more vulnerable as prey, suggesting that the connoisseur had to literally fight for his survivors.
“The betrayal of a huge and heavily armed dinosaur visually illustrates the dangers posed by predators during the Cretaceous period,” Brown said.
Chemical analysis of the organic components contained in the skulls also revealed that the skin of the dinosaurs was likely to have a reddish-brown coloration.
Researchers continue to study the animal and search for more information about his life, including the preserved contents of the stomach, to find out his last food.
They believe that the dinosaur fell into the river after his death and was taken to the sea, where it sank to the bottom.
In the Alberta region at that time, the climate was the same as in today’s Florida, and the rivers and oceans stretched far further inland than it is today.
“This nodosaurus is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered in perfectly preserved skin and at the same time is preserved in three dimensions and so we can see its original size,” Brown said.
For these reasons, the animal looks practically the same as in the time of the Cretaceous.
You don’t have to use your imagination to reconstruct it; just close your eyes a little and it seems like he’s just sleeping.”
During the Cretaceous period, giant theropods roamed the Earth, carnivorous dinosaurs moving on two legs.
Although the king of all dinosaurs - Tyrannosaurus rex - lived a few million years after the Borealopelt, this armoured dinosaur could have been a favorite prey of his equally horrific ancestors.
They include the Acrocanthosaurus, a 11.5-meter-long monster weighing over 6 tons.
Researchers, whose latest findings have been published in the journal Current Biology, believe that the body of the Borealoplet was floated into the sea after being mummified in mud.
Behind the discovery is Shawn Funk, who discovered the rock on March 21, 2011, while drilling in the Suncor Millenium mine near Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best-preserved armoured dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, which is also complete from chin to hip.
The animal reached a diameter of 5 meters and weighed up to 1300 kg.
Two 50 cm blades came out of his shoulders.
Scientists believe that this planter swept the territory of present-day Canada until it ended up in a river that swept it into the sea.
His underwater tomb kept the body in perfect condition.
Fossil remains of this species are also preserved to the extent that the coats of arms around the skull still cover the remains of the skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, “finding such a preserved individual can be compared to winning the lottery.
The longer I follow him, the more shocking it seems to me.
Fossil remains of this species are also preserved to the extent that the coats of arms around the skull still cover the remains of the skin.
At his side is his right front leg with his fingers pointing upwards.
I can easily count the shovels on his feet.'
How did one activist learn the answer to the question: ‘Whose Streets?’
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell shook her entire body.
The day after she arrived in New York, a cousin from St. Louis sat on the bed in an Airbnb room and browsed Facebook posts on her phone.
She then came across a contribution from a high school student.
“Police have just shot an 18-year-old boy whose body is still lying on the street,” he said.
She was surprised that no one else wrote her this post, so she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
<0x40>TheePharoah continually retweeted her wall posts.
The St. Louis rapper posted his tweets about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old who was shot dead by a white policeman in Ferguson, Missouri.
He published a photograph of Brown's body, which lies powerlessly on the street, from where no one took it even after four hours.
"That's crazy," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new for her and her community.
She put down her phone to come back to him the night she watched tweets about people gathering on Canfield Drive.
One of the men claimed to be the victim's father and held a sign in his hand with the inscription "Ferguson police killed my unarmed son"!
She was watching live news - one of the police officers stood in front of a group of protesters, holding a guide and at his other end a dog blinking.
In another video, another police officer, she said, held a gun in his hand, aimed at the crowd, and shouted, "I'll kill you all... animals."
"That's not normal," Ferrell said to herself.
“This is not the kind of murder we’re used to and can be called normal.
I felt the skin of the goose all over my body.
“I was angry and I was crying.”
She immediately booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 23:00, she picked up her six-year-old daughter from her father and decided to go to Ferguson in the morning.
The story of what happened to Ferrell and the city of Ferguson over the next three years describes a new document “Whose Streets?” that will be released in theaters on August 11.
It is a story of survival and protests, love and resistance, strength and unbreakability told from the point of view of people living in the community, who go out into the streets and demand answers.
On the way to Ferguson, Ferrell's dialogue with her daughter - dressed in a floral shirt and the same floral heads - introduced a theme that had been discussed many times before - "on the experience with blacks".
“Do you remember how I taught you how blacks had to fight for what they believed in?” he recalls from the interview.
"We're going to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old and that's not right."
"I didn't think I'd take her with me," Ferrell said later.
“Today’s events are the culmination of what happened in the past.
She had to know it and see it with her own eyes and grow up in it.
She needed to develop not only in activism and organization, but at the same time she had to know the difference between the different layers of experience with blacks and what we have to do in order to liberate ourselves.
Yet I am able to provide her with conditions in which she will not experience racism on her own, it is in no way different from any other black child-woman.
I feel that if I were to protect her from this experience, I would only harm her.”
After arriving in Ferguson, the first stop was South Florissant Road in front of the police station, which became a base for activists who were expecting the words of police officer Darren Wilson about his possible involvement in the incident.
Here Ferrell and his daughter met a local businessman who was preparing the rest of the food.
Together they prepared food in bags and helped to distribute it to the Protestants.
In Ferrell's eyes, a new type of activism was slowly born.
“My activism turned upside down after August 9,” Ferrell said, adding that while studying at the University of Missouri-St. Louis University, she was president of Minority Student Nurses Association Assn. and was striving to introduce health care and food into the Black community.
“I didn’t have any experience with the organization.
It was natural."
A few weeks later, during an evening demonstration, Ferrell met the later co-director of the documentary, Sabaah Folayan.
Folayan said he and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to “only document” the ongoing events.
But Ferrell thought, “Are you working on a document or are you trying to find a story that could be used?”
This type of skepticism permeated the community through many people, often white people, who wanted to make a profit from pain and determination.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview: “We have heard that the voices of people who are born and raised in Ferguson are very often ignored and we wanted to change that.”
Folayan has already collaborated with co-director Damon Davis, who is a renowned local artist dealing with the subject of prisoners in the cell of death.
His involvement in the project was also intercepted by Ferrell and along with six other locals who were watching the Who Streets team in the years following Brown's assassination.
“No one in this document speaks for us, but it’s our resignation,” Davis said.
"It was important to me - how these people will be represented - because in the same way I will be represented."
While the aim of the document was not to focus on Ferrell's experiences - in an effort to show that the movement "is not about the rescue leader, but about the rapprochement of the community," Folayan said - it turned out that she was the most open about taking part in filming.
The document “Whose Streets?” thus describes a very personal aspect of Ferrell’s life, such as how she fell in love with her wife.
"I felt like naked," Ferrell said with a smile on her face, thinking about the first moment she saw the final version of the document.
“But I realized that in order to do this job and polish the blacks, I have to open up.”
Ferrell’s story also highlights the role of the eccentric black woman in the broader aspect of the Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement – who formed in response to the 2012 murder of teenager Trayvon Martin on social media campaign under <0x23>BlackLivesMatter – call themselves freaks.
“Black eccentric women in leading positions ultimately stand for the preservation of the movement,” Ferrell said, “because we are constantly fighting on multiple fronts.
Black middle-aged women have to bear the burden of these events."
Folayan agrees with this statement and adds that "the movement is in fact supported by black women and a large number of eccentric black women."
She insists, however, that "this is not just an affirmative matter" and Ferrell is not the main hero of the document because of her views.
“She was the driving force and the source of energy,” she said.
"that it was she who found herself in the front lines is not a coincidence, because life on these crosses in the skin of a black bizarre woman is dangerous.
You can feel the energy in front of the screen.”
Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, the television cameras cleared their positions, but heavy racial ties between the community and the police persist.
Ferrell has been suspended for two-and-a-half years for blocking the motorway during demonstrations.
She described the socially political atmosphere in the area she called the home as a “disorder.”
Still, she continues in her quest to which she has committed herself since she took to the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
“It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We need to love and support each other.
The only thing we can lose is our chains.”
Fields burned in Cologne.
Dozens of firefighters came to the scene, and a helicopter also helped.
Near the <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> Brod in Cologne, between the towns of Bylany and Liblice, a field of approximately 15 hectares was burned from 14:00.
The fire stopped spreading around 15:15, firefighters declared the third stage of a fire alarm out of four possible.
According to firefighters spokesman Ladislav Holom<0xC4><0x8D><0xC3><0xAD>k, the fire helped to rush the helicopter from the air.
At 18:00, firefighters managed to extinguish the fire, the fire caused damage for 700000 kroner.
Dozens of professional and volunteer firefighters were fighting the flames on the spot.
The fire was caused by a technical fault in the engine room of the combine.
Hasit was also assisted by a helicopter, which carried out a total of six shoals of water.
"Instead of the intervention we handed over to the owner, until 8:00 tomorrow, he will be guarded by a unit of volunteer firefighters," Holom<0xC4><0x8D><0xC3><0xAD>k said today.
A Becoming Resembling: Artist Creates Portraits Using Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the center of one of the rooms of the New York Fridman Gallery is placed immediately several faces of different skin shades - white, black and brown - hung from the ceiling on the wires. Each of them as if out of sight of the previous one.
All 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from the mouthpieces and hair sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent her samples from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where a former analyst is serving a 35-year sentence for unauthorised disclosure of secret cables on WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which began on August 2nd, is titled A Becoming Resembling.
It is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, who combines her experience with technology, computer science and the arts, and Manning, a transgender and pioneering dissident whose sentence was reduced by Obama three days before his resignation as President of the United States.
Using an algorithmic analysis of Manning's DNA and using 30 portraits to illustrate what a person with this genotype would look like, Dewey-Hagborg created a scissors, if not an intellectual commentary on DNA's susceptibility to the identities of these, as well as on the interprets of many ways.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward Manning, spoke of being considered a woman from a young age. She was convicted in 2013 on 20 counts, including violating six espionage laws, computer fraud and theft.
All of her photographs were taken by prison staff, and only one black and white photograph of her, in which Manning, visibly concerned, sits on the driver's seat in a platinum blond wig, with which she is now connected, escaped the public.
In 2015, they still had a positive reaction to the 2012 Dewey-Hagborg project Stranger Visions.
As part of this project, Dewey-Hagborg used various forensic objects – such as cigarette butts and chewing gums – to create an image of possible images of these people.
And it was at this time that she received an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
“They missed an interview with Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted to add a portrait,” Dewey-Hagborg said on the opening of the new exhibition.
However, visits and photography were not allowed, so they turned to Chelsea asking if she would be interested in the DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse camaraderied within two years through correspondence.
They even created a comic book called Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanung, which presented a vision of what would have happened if Chelsea were favored and could attend the exhibitions in person.
President Obama actually asked for Manning’s release a few days after the comic book was released, which was a welcome change after several unbearable years spent in a Kansas military prison.
It is indeed interesting that the exhibition is taking place right at a time when Donald Trump is waging a war with people who are seeking to publicize government information and transgender soldiers while trying to find new ways to incite hatred in areas he should be dissuaded by his tweets.
In response to a question about this special timing, Dewey-Hagborg said that “everything happens for some reason.”
Under the artist's statement on one of the walls of the gallery, Manning calls with her huge signature (the letter "i" in the last name is embodied in the heart) the end of "self-serving factionism based on sex, race, sexuality and culture".
On the other side are the sequences of its mitochondrial DNA - the footer of the letters C, G and A recorded by the pencil.
By adding 200 letters (or nucleotides, according to the artist’s sophisticated scientific dictionary), Dewey-Hagborg wanted to illustrate how surprisingly similar, at least biologically, we are all.
“I hope people will take it from our genome that it doesn’t matter who we are, and that genetic data is subjective and anyone can explain it in their own way,” Dewey-Hagborg said.
"DNA tells a lot of different stories, this is 30 of them."
The last copy of the exhibition, located in a separate room, is the only page of the graphic novel mentioned above.
It depicts Manning emerging as King Kong from the United States Disciplinary Barracks prison with a megaphone in his hand.
“As soon as they stop you in the speech, they win,” it says.
“Never let yourself be silenced.”
"It's a direct copy of one of the letters," the Philadelphia artist said.
"When I think about it, my skin is swollen."
Manning has not yet personally visited the exhibition – which was predicted in the comic book – but when it does, she will be welcomed in the middle of the room with her masks, her own genomic images, arranged like a crowd of Protestants.
This was also the purpose of the exhibition, including the nearly 160 cm tall Maning statue, on which her genetic haplogroups are recorded with a pencil.
“They were placed on the walls in the past, but this time I wanted them to make a crowd feel,” Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
“I wanted to give the impression of a mass movement that takes on the form of Chelsea and liberates it.”
Professor of Northwestern University and Oxford University employee wanted for murder <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
A nationwide search is underway for a Northwestern University professor and Oxford University staff who are being sued for the murder of a man who was found stabbed to death in a luxurious Chicago apartment, police said.
On Monday, an arrest warrant was issued for the first-degree murder of a man named Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died of several stab wounds.
The Chicago Police Department said the body of the deceased was found on July 27th.
When they arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments, they found the victim in one of the apartments with several market wounds, and the police were informed by telephone.
Cornell-Duranleau has been declared dead on the scene and detectives are investigating the case as a murder. Police meanwhile are looking for both suspects, authorities said.
Lathem has been a professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the university’s vice president for public relations, said in an email statement that Lathem is now on administrative leave and was banned from entering the university’s school premises.
“The whole matter is now being investigated by the relevant authorities and the Northwest University is fully cooperating with them,” Cubbage said.
Warren is an executive financial manager at the University of Oxford.
A spokesperson for the University and Somerville College said in an emailed statement: “We were contacted by the British police and we are ready to assist the American police as well.”
The statement also states that Warren’s colleagues were shocked by the whole fact and wish him to report to the police.
Anthony Guglielmi, head of public relations at the Chicago Police Department, said he was calling on suspects to surrender to the relevant authorities.
"The police have information about their whereabouts and the search for suspects is escalating," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi added that the police are assisting local, regional and national authorities in the search for the suspects.
According to Guglielmi, the police received a call from the manager of the Grand Plaza building, who was alerted to the events that were supposed to occur in apartment No. 1008.
The police described the scene as very violent.
Guglielmi said it was not clear if the incident took place on July 27.
He added that Lathem and Warren were captured by security cameras.
"We believe that Professor Latham knew his victim," Guglielmi said.
The Grand Plaza management issued a statement for all residents: “Police are now working on compiling a timeline and victim profile and investigating various motives, including domestic violence.”
"We will finish the WADA plan in the near future" - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it would not take long to implement the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and the re-establishment of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
“At present, part of the criteria of the new plan has been completed and RUSADA has already acquired the right to plan and test in cooperation with the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
With this in mind, the WADA plan has been updated," Mutko said on Thursday.
The vice-president commented on the second part of the WADA plan aimed at complying with the code - which describes the criteria for the renewal of RUSADA - which was recently published on the organization's website.
According to Mutka, the code contains nothing that Russia should worry about.
“Everything has been announced and everything will also be implemented.
The results will be available to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added.
One of the criteria, however, calls for a public announcement of the results of the WADA investigation, which was investigated by Richard McLaren, about alleged sponsorship of Russian athletes’ doping by the government.
Mutko said: “We are conducting an investigation because our anti-doping system has obviously failed.
All of the measures have been taken.
“But there were no state programs in our country and we cannot therefore admit to something that never existed.”
Mutkov’s words were confirmed by Vitaly Smirnov, director of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
In an interview with the Russian RSport, Smirnov acknowledged the problems of the Russian anti-doping agents, but added: “We have stated on many occasions that the report contains controversial attitudes and regulations.
No one plans to accept the message completely without reservations," Smirnov concluded.
WADA suspected Russia of carrying out doping checks within Russia in November 2015 immediately ahead of the doping scandal.
The organization, however, allowed the planning and unification of testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD) in June this year.
After a visit to the organization’s Moscow headquarters in July, WADA Director-General Olivier Niggli said that RUSADA is “on the right track” to restore its validity.
Police have accused three people, one of whom is a teenager.
Police have accused three men of setting up a Wednesday fire at a rare wooden church in Tr<0xC5><0x99>inci-Gutech on Frydecko-M<0xC3><0xAD>stek.
One accused is a juvenile, all three are of Czech nationality.
They face up to 15 years in prison for a crime of general threat.
The Moravian-Silesian police director Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Ku<0xC5><0xBE>el told reporters today.
According to him, it was a deliberate crime.
"It's a very fresh issue and the police are currently working on the whole issue," Ku<0xC5><0xBE>el said.
He said the police would discuss the possibility of bringing the accused into custody.
Further information, according to the Director, is not available.
"I can't tell you yet, because it's actually the criminal police and investigative staff working on the case and the prosecutor who oversees the case," Ku<0xC5><0xBE>el said.
The wooden church of the body of God in Gutech dates back to the 16th century.
It was a valuable monument with many original equipment and paintings from the first half of the 16th century.
The material damage will go up to tens of millions of crowns according to preliminary estimates, but the historical loss is incalculable.
Soon after the fire, people began to think about rebuilding the church.
Most of the costs should be covered by the insurance, the additional costs are prepared to be shared with the Ministry of Culture and the city, a public collection is also being prepared and the owner of the monument, i.e. the local parish, is expected to contribute.
A similar wooden church of St. Catherine from the 16th century in Ostrava-Hrabov<0xC3><0xA1> also destroyed fifteen years ago by fire.
This was caused by a malfunction in the electrical installation.
An exact copy was produced in his place.
The state counts on citizens to defend the state.
It will support their training.
With financial support for associations usable in the defense of the state, with voluntary shooting training or with a team of training instructors, the objective of the law on the readiness of citizens to defend the state is counted.
The Ministry of Defence, which was given the task of processing it from the government, promises it to succeed in increasing the physical ability of the Czechs and their abilities, which could then be used by the state in crisis situations.
This is based on a proposal prepared by the Ministry.
If the law were to be passed in the future, the state would spend hundreds of millions of crowns to support the defense.
According to its authors, the main objective of the proposal is to create an effective system that would help to increase the preparedness of the inhabitants of the Czech Republic to defend the state, beyond the performance of the defence duty and on the basis of volunteering.
For example, the State would financially or materially support associations of radio amateurs, shooters or cynologists and enable the capacity of their members to be increased.
In return, it would get data on people who are willing to come to the country in times of crisis if needed, and their abilities or material equipment.
Accredited instructors may also be available to assist the associations and other interested parties in their training or training.
It also counts on organizing words with war veterans or people who have behaved heroically.
One possible option assumes that a new office would be created, which would be in charge of the administration and coordination of the project.
The authors of the proposal emphasize that the participation of people should be voluntary and the state should take advantage of their capabilities only after the state of danger has been declared.
"The whole concept must respect the gradual erasing of the previously apparent boundaries between the individual types of threats," the statement said, referring to the dangers of so-called hybrid threats.
Ministerial officials noted that it is therefore necessary to focus on supporting as wide a range of capabilities as possible, not just military ones.
"The basic objective of the intention is to create a very broad base that will enable every citizen to respond qualifiedly to situations that threaten the sovereignty of the state or the lives, health and property of persons, to protect themselves, or, if necessary, to contribute to the protection of the republican interests of others, and to commit misconduct against misconduct.
Adoption of the law would bring considerable financial demands.
According to the Ministry, their height will depend on the chosen variant.
For example, the Office envisages financial support for projects to prepare citizens for state defence up to CZK 100 million.
If an administrative and coordination centre were to be established, its operation could cost around CZK 60 million a year.
More money would go to payroll or to build an information system.
The proposal also assumes that the scope of the regional military commanders would have to be expanded, which would employ an additional 42 soldiers together.
Representatives of the Ministry said earlier that the law should also help to resolve the disagreement of some Czech politicians with the introduction of the European Union directive on the possession of weapons.
Its adoption would allow the shooters who will be part of the system to keep some of the weapons that the directive prohibits.
Startups that will help your company avoid becoming the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the employee satisfaction rate of her e-commerce startup, but did not find the appropriate survey.
The answers were often inaccurate, useless, or even misleading.
And even though she promised anonymity for the survey, some employees expressed their distrust throughout the process.
“I was looking for consistency and objectivity,” said Errett, owner of the San Francisco-based e-commerce hair care company Madison Reed, which employs 75 people.
She asked for help from the outside.
New human resources startups are constantly emerging in the market, which help companies with surveys of employee satisfaction.
By creating and licensing software with a specific intention to measure employee responsibilities, startups allow companies to carry out fast voting, target specific teams and demographic groups, also offer contacts to the contacts and contacts to inform the employees, and a hotline for submissions.
“There are tools on the market like Strava and Fitbit that monitor your health, but where is Fitbit for your company?” said Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Glint startup based in Reedwood City.
Errett said that thanks to Glint, she gained more awareness of what her employees think and how they feel in three years.
In addition to quick surveys and voting by specific teams, Glint offers a company temperature map and a current overview of the groups with the highest number of complaints, as well as an overview of low-rated managers – allowing users to work on the fix.
Companies are beginning to realize that it is necessary to take care of the culture of the workplace – in case they become another Uber – that is turning into scandals after a former employee posted on his blog a post describing the company’s environment, harassment and harassment.
For startups like Glint, the demand for corporate culture surveys is a lucrative business opportunity.
According to Let’s Talk Payments, which deals with technical and financial progress, the value of the global control, regulation and compliance industry could exceed $118.8 billion by 2020.
Startup Convercent from Denver, Colorado, which helps companies prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, saw a small increase in interest and activity earlier this year, just ahead of Uber’s scandals.
Nearly 600 of Convercent's clients include Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Recently, Uber has also taken Uber under its wing.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customizable “bright” surveys, collect confidential information in real time, and display temperature maps of problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous text hotline, which allows employees to report inappropriate behaviors.
If the Director-General is involved in the problem, the complaints are sent directly to the Management Board.
“The court of public opinion has authorized regulators,” said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent startup.
If the company is convicted of mishandling its employees or unethical behavior – and if regulators do not step in – it may face costly consequences as a result of customer boycotts, employee exhaustion, or court proceedings, Quinlan added.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant network, which employs more than 25,000 people across 500 locations, uses Convercent for more than a year to raise employees’ awareness of corporate policies and procedures and provide an easy way to contact corporate management.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report any problem, he had to look up the phone number or e-mail to the management of the company, officially file a complaint and hope for an apparent solution.
It was often a daunting and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday’s general representative, who previously said there was no reliable way to monitor employee complaints.
Now that the company is using Convercent, it is ensured to quickly detect and solve problems that have never before been reached by managers sitting in offices, miles away from the real solution of complaints - such as discrimination, harassment or unfairness.
“This is coming closer to a holistic, holistic view of employee experience,” said Vitrano, who heads Ruby Tuesday’s risk management group.
“At the same time, we protect shareholders from litigation by employees.”
The companies stopped taking ethics, values, and employee participation at light weight in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed after Enron collapsed in the case of employee ethical rights abuses, Quinlan said.
But it wasn’t until the social media “lighted on the whole thing” that companies began to realize that in the online world they simply couldn’t hide their skeletons in the closet.
“Before people started using technology to track ethics, they relied on faith,” Quinlan added.
Glint and Convercent offer their software in the form of a service for which the company pays regular fees.
It is a business model and an opportunity approved by bold capital investors who have supported both startups.
As part of his February campaign, Convercent selected companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital for a total of $10 million and eventually raised $47 million in capital.
Glint earned $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and earned $60 million throughout the campaign.
These investments are hardly surprising given the mutual nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
The growing number of researches clearly confirms that today’s employees expect more from their workplace than ever before.
And in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are not the main advantage.
Employees want to feel that they are welcomed and appreciated and that they devote their time to a company that strives for a positive mission.
“If people are happy in their work, they feel that their voice is heard and that their work is rewarding, they strive for the success of the company,” said Nina McQueen, vice president of Global Benefits and Employee Benefits at LinkedIn.
Investors make a profit if companies thrive and companies thrive if their employees are satisfied.
And when there is an analytical tool on the market that ensures employee engagement and commitment to the company, it’s no surprise that there are a lot of investors who support this effort.
According to occupational culture experts, it is important to have data on employee satisfaction.
But the data itself is pointless unless the company takes the necessary steps.
The reality is that as soon as a company requests a feedback from its employees, there can be major changes.
And if the change does not happen quickly - in the worst case at all - it can cause disappointment and disinterest in employees.
“As soon as you ask for 4,000 opinions, you need to be prepared for 4,000 conversations,” said Russell Raath, director of consulting at Kotter International, who witnessed many companies relying too much on the data themselves.
“Because once you don’t get things done, employees start asking themselves the question: ‘Did you hear me?
Are they interested in me?
And if not, why should I be interested?'"
Madison Reed, which now conducts a monthly survey of employees, is able to solve the problem in one day thanks to Glint, Errett said.
After gathering feedback from employees who were frustrated by the slow decision-making and quality of communication, Errett was able to reorganize several teams within the company and initiate communication training to apparently solve the problem.
Ruby Tuesday gains a very important view of its employees and hopes that in the long term it will achieve high employment in the industry, which is known for frequent layoffs.
“If you don’t strive to create a transparent work environment, employees won’t believe you,” Vitrano added.
“And once you start losing employees, you’ll lose customers.
And with the outflow of customers, the whole company collapses.”
Thursday has become the hottest day ever.
Thursday is the warmest day of the year in the Czech Republic, with 38.3 degrees recorded in the Watchtower in Hodon<0xC3><0xAD>n.
It surpassed Tuesday, which was originally the warmest day of the year with 37.3 degrees.
This was reported by employees of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
On Tuesday, however, there were not many temperature records.
Vedra hit mainly Moravia, in the Czech Republic it was mostly cloudy.
On Tuesday, 35 of the 145 meteorological stations measured over 30 years were broken or set records.
On Thursday, only nine long-term measuring stations recorded a record.
Today’s temperature was the same as the previous record for 2013.
In Lednice in B<0xC5><0x99>eclavsk today 37.4 degrees exceeded the original maximum by four decimal degrees and in Poho<0xC5><0x99>elice in Brno the current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three decimal degrees.
Both records, as well as the Sr<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xBE>nice, came from 2013.
High temperatures have appeared today, mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
After Str<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xBE>nica, the biggest heat in Dyj<0xC3><0xA1>kovic in Znojemsk and Brod nad Dyj<0xC3><0xAD> in B<0xC5><0x99>eclav, where the mercury climbed to 37.8 degrees, but did not exceed the record.
In contrast, in western and northwestern Bohemia, for example, according to the <0xC4><0x8C>HM<0xC3><0x9A> website, today’s highest temperatures were only around 22 degrees Celsius.
"The temperatures there started to rise until later in the afternoon," the meteorologists said.
The current heat in the Czech Republic will gradually fade, according to the Czech Republic, and more heavy rains could occur on Sunday.
In most places of Moravia, however, high temperatures will remain on Friday and in southeastern Moravia as well as on Saturday.
There's been a lot of shit going on here.
Billionaires do not have the same vote in the election as every single adult in the country.
They want to decide directly, and because not everyone is as tough as Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1>, who wants to own the state, they buy political parties.
The owner of the Penta Marek Dospiva, together with other colleagues behind the water Martin Burda and Anton<0xC3><0xAD>n Fry<0xC4><0x8D>, sponsors the Robej<0xC5><0xA1>kova Realists.
The second life of the Civic Democratic Alliance is financed by the owner of the insurance company and the real estate entrepreneur Pavel Sehnal, who is also the chairman.
The convicted corrupt and king of Czech gambling Ivo Valenta has taken over the Party of privateers.
The political movement of Agrofert, as the project of Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1> was reluctantly named by Krom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xBE> mayor Jaroslav N<0xC4><0x9B>mec, is a chapter for itself.
His billionaires have also recently been captured by the mayors.
He is Dalibor D<0xC4><0x93>dek, the owner of the Jablotron security facility.
In his own words, he enters politics in order to do good.
The entry into the mayor’s jersey, however, failed Grandpa very much.
"I never dreamed of small goals," he said at a press conference.
This means that my goal is to make the YES movement, to make the Mayor's movement win twenty percent in the election.
Leckdo laughed.
But Grandpa's resignation is rather symptomatic.
Billionaire Dalibor Grandpa is a man of strong opinions.
Although she intends to apply for voters' votes in the mayor's jersey, she continues to support Andreje Babis.
Babi<0xC5><0xA1>’s grandfather supported him in the previous parliamentary elections.
“The grandmother is not a shot speaker and will not rule the popular rhetoric of political snakes,” he wrote about him before the 2013 election.
But he certainly doesn’t go into politics because he wants to improve himself.
For me, Grandma will remain a hero.
He is willing to step out of his world that is under control and do something for all of us.
Shortly after the Mayor introduced him as a new reinforcement, he confessed again to his admiration for Babi<0xC5><0xA1>.
And he said he wanted the Mayors to learn how to imagine possible cooperation with Grandma.
Some may appreciate that Grandpa doesn’t change her mind and stands behind her no matter what jersey she’s wearing.
Others may speculate that Babi<0xC5><0xA1> is sending to the Mayors to build his beak of someone so impotent.
Others may wonder if Jablotron’s boss, for example, has gone wrong with Agrofert’s boss in the store and is not looking for another way to defend his trading rival.
Grandpa's first public performance, however, did not just revolve around Grandma.
Grandpa promised to send the Mayors ten million kroner for the campaign.
And if they need more money, they'll send more.
A few years ago, it would be hard to put a stop to such a statement.
By the way, the court-recognized gauner Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Bakala cast millions on all parties before the 2010 elections.
The political division of the security agency V<0xC3><0xAD>ta B<0xC3><0xA1>rta, TOP 09 and the civil democrats came together for almost thirty million.
But today is a different time.
The law prohibits anyone from giving more than three million dollars to a political party.
When Grandpa entered politics, he could at least study the rules of the game.
Then you may not have to ask yourself why politics has such a bad reputation.
His first days in politics, Grandpa crowned him with a proposal to tax the families with the children studied.
People with a higher education will come to us for about fifty thousand a month.
You're the one with less than 20 bases.
A man of fifty thousand is rich in the relations of this place.
The one with the 20 poor.
In Grandfather’s vision, the poor pay fair taxes and the rich enjoy the benefits of the functioning of a social state, in whose course they do not participate much.
The rich just need to be helped so that they don’t have trouble with the need.
Mayors can congratulate each other on their new acquisition and Grandma can shake their hands.
Thanks to Grandpa, we can confirm that billionaires are not good people.
Then there is the question of who to vote for.
For me, those who know the rules of the game and want to follow them.
Those who are members and members of their party or citizens of the state do not have as their employees and the country as their property.
And finally, those who want to live well in a rich land for all people, not just some.
No one wanted Trump's paradise.
The villa complex had to be reduced by 234 million.
Selling a property is sometimes not easy.
And often it won’t help him even 11 bedrooms, a wonderful view of the sea, or the fact that the property is being sold by US President Donald Trump.
When the Le Chateau des Palmiers villa complex was sold, the price went down by an incredible <0xC2><0xA3>8 million.
This website was reported by Mirror.co.uk.
The pamphlet reads, “Hello, Donald J. Trump.”
Avoid the place like no other.
But even the merger of the real estate company with the US president did not justify the extreme price tag.
Donald Trump had to cut the price of his Caribbean headquarters by an incredible <0xC2><0xA3>8 million.
The original price of the property was <0xC2><0xA3>21.5 million, the final price dropped to <0xC2><0xA3>13 million.
Even after the discount, the villa complex costs about 76 average apartments in the center of Prague.
And there's nothing to wonder about.
A stunning 5-acre residence on the Caribbean island of St. Martin has 12 full-fledged bathrooms, 11 bedrooms, many dining rooms, a gym and other rooms.
It consists of several buildings.
The property also features a swimming pool and a tennis court.
Dozens of palm trees are planted on the land.
From the terrace there is a wonderful view of the sea.
According to real estate experts, the price showed the fact that the connection with the president is not enough to attract potential buyers.
Now the property is closer to the usual prices of real estate on the island.
Trump bought the property in 2013.
Speculation is that he paid around <0xC2><0xA3>15 million.
The property was to be purchased for rental purposes.
Le Chateau des Palmiers was the most expensive property on the island of Saint Martin.
With a new price, however, it ranks second.
The property in the neighborhood was valued at <0xC2><0xA3>13.5 million.
The NCAA decided to end two workouts a day. For the Bruins there are long days
UCLA's eleven-mornings are approaching, and UCLA's American football players are poking around at the sidelines of the new school playground.
Some of them take off their jerseys and reveal a sweaty back, a harmless sign of the first day of training camp.
For most of the team members these few minutes nothingdoing adds to the lunch break.
Players enrolled in the summer semester will go to the rooms after a three-hour training session to study for the final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for a meeting that takes place the next morning at 6:30.
"For these guys, the next three days are going to be a big hit," Bruins coach Jim Mora said shortly before Monday's overheating on Tuesday.
By shutting down two practice sessions in one day, the NCAA wants to lighten players - paradoxically, the training days are even longer - at least until Friday, when the final exam ends.
That’s why the first three UCLA trainings are scheduled at 7:15 p.m. – to fit into the already crowded diaries of many students.
For the first time in six seasons that Mora has spent as a coach in Westwood, training camp Bruins starts a week earlier than last year and training is limited during the summer semester. Its impact on this also has the decision to limit the number of workouts from one to two days.
A total of eighteen training sessions are scheduled for August 20, and formal preparations for the first game against Texas A&M will begin in September.
It must have been heard that it supports the decision of the NCAA, even though it added another item to the already loaded player diary.
"Three or four days the players are under a lot of stress and it's very exhausting for them," Mora said.
"But no one gave up, everyone's trying. They're great.
I think on Saturday, when we have more time, everything will calm down."
UCLA will be closed at the end of the training camp, which will not be easy when looking at the clear lines of surrounding grounds from the adjacent parking lot and the luxury Luskin Center Hotel, which players have occupied after gathering the protective network behind the goal bar.
Bruins players are expected to play as early as this week, but Mora admits that once the rooms are cleared during the season, there could be a problem.
“The land will be guarded by the security service,” Mora added.
“Safety is taken care of, but it is not excluded that anyone can rent a room and record our trainings.
This kind of material is well traded.
Luckily, the hotel will be guarding security, as well as parking lot No. 8.
We will make the most of our resources.
I believe everything will be fine.
Everything is planned.”
Facebook plans more thorough fact-checking to limit the number of fake messages
Facebook will send more potentially fake articles to third parties to check and display the findings under the original posts in an effort to fight so-called “fake news,” the largest social network said on Thursday.
The company says in a statement on its website that it will start using updated machine learning to detect possible hoaxes, which will send to third parties for verification and potentially display the survey results under the original posts.
Facebook has been described as one of the main sources of fake news, and many believe that these unconfirmed messages have affected last year’s election of the US president.
In Europe, political debates are taking place on the whole of matters. French voters are flooded with a lava of fake news about the May presidential elections and Germany plans to impose a fine on the social media network ahead of the September elections, if they do not hurry.
Facebook on Thursday said in a further statement issued in Germany that it intends to launch testing of a new Fake News Control feature in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“In addition to displaying third-party authenticated messages, people are asking for more content to be better informed and to be able to make the right decisions about what they can share,” said Sara Su, Facebook’s product manager for news.
She added that Facebook is continuing to test the “related articles” feature and is also working on further changes to reduce the number of fake messages.
Graphic Novel: The Story of A Castle in England
The small castle of Scotney Castle recently played a leading role in the Squeeze music video, and Margaret Thatcher also took refuge in it during the 70s and 80s of the last century.
However, from his cozy spot on the Bewl River in British Kent, Scotney witnessed 700 years of stormy history, which inspired the whimsical Jamie Rhodes of York County—famous for his interest in historical documents—to create a graphic novel.
“Looking at a man’s letter 300 years after his death fascinates me,” Rhodes says with a serious face.
“When I hold a letter in my hand, I feel a personal connection.”
The graphic novel A Castle in England documents the lives of the families who lived at Castle Scotney from the Middle Ages to the Edwardian period. Each story is illustrated by a different British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
However, it is not Rhodes’ first book inspired by the archives: he is also the author of Dead Men’s Teeth and Other Stories (2014), a collection of British Library-inspired documents – a project that was very emotional for him.
"I got a fingerprint on a letter written by a double agent in the '70s who worked for the Jacobites," he said.
"That's his fingerprint!
And the letters always smell like smoke, because in those days you had to light a candle to read.
When I look at the letter now, 300 years later, it's like I'm going back in time.
I love the archives!”
For someone who is so fascinated by old papers, the support of the National Trust and Arts Council England and the possibility of staying almost four months at the castle is almost like a dream.
Rhodes spent time exploring the Victorian "new" castle, scouring the archives, and studying many treasures and curiosities, such as the head of a hyenas on the wall and bottles that have been buried for centuries in a trench.
He strolled through the land and explored the ruins of the old castle, talked to the scoundrels, gardeners and sometimes also artists who worked on illustrations for his book.
In the evening, he drank whiskey and wrote.
Scotney's confidential history is relatively unknown, as the National Trust gained access to documents only in 2006 after the death of its last heir, Elizabeth Hussey.
When Rhodes arrived at the site ten years later, the employees were only beginning to penetrate the archives, which Rhodes described in words, as if “the aristocrats of many centuries were throwing their hands out with the words: ‘Put it in the attic.’”
Diaries, letters from the time of the British Empire, maps depicting the property: "You may think the dispute over the land is boring," said Rhodes, "but I came across one case when two families were moving about the bush.
Leave the people!”
Some of the stories in the book use the castle as a reflection bridge and delve deeper into English history, including a story called The Labourer, which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the English Uprising of 1381.
"I found a record of a rebellion at the castle in 1380, which was called Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex," Rhodes said.
“The English uprising actually started in this area and I thought that the uprising was a good starting point.
Maybe it has something to do with each other.”
Other stories are closely linked to the castle's history - for example, The Priest, which tells the story of a Jesuit priest who was hidden by Darrell's family for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or The Smuggler about an 18th-century smuggler named Arthur Darrell, who allegedly staged his own funeral when he filled a rake of stones (which was discovered only a few years after the discovery of the coffin).
Rhodes' favorite family is Darrell's: "I was fascinated by the male generation - the men of that time were always indebted and spent money on things they couldn't afford.
The various generations of the Darrells have dealt with this by marrying rich or old ladies - I imagine they were handsome gentlemen who liked to motify the heads of the heirs."
With the end of his stay at the castle, Rhodes is looking for more adventures.
He recently returned from a two-week stint in the Finnish wilderness, where he inspired his next book about Eläännmäki, a former sanatorium of the early 20th century that was absorbed by nature.
But for Scotney, it's a special place.
“I was sad when I left,” he said.
“I said to myself, ‘I’m going to go back to real life now.’”
Washington is changing the terms of the green card
The media published President Donald Trump’s words about the new U.S. immigration plan, which will also change the green card.
It is expected that the number of legal immigrants will decrease by 50,000 annually as a result of stricter rules on the granting of temporary work visas and restrictions on family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and the President.
The bill will be submitted to Congress soon.
“This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and we will do so by changing the rules for issuing green cards to residents of other countries.
The law will limit the number of immigrants and replace the current scheme.
“The new application process will give priority to English-speaking applicants who are making money and will demonstrate the capabilities that will benefit our country,” Trump said in a statement.
Sex robots are on the rise - we should be on the lookout
Just when it looked like 2017 could not be more bizarre, a report on the technological development of sex robots appeared on the Internet.
Oh, yeah.
Sex robots are very popular these days.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently issued a statement on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to former Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder of FRR Noel Sharkey, it is necessary to look seriously at the rise of sex robots.
Customers can choose the color of the eyes, the shape of the nipples and the appearance of the nails of the robot.
“People are pulling out of them, but sales are growing and we need to be prepared to see them more and more often,” Sharkey said in a statement.
Modern sexual aids change from inflatable men to robotic women with silicone skin, which is pleasantly warm to the touch - of course is artificial intelligence, which mimics the behavior of a man.
The user can "edit" the robot to his image - from the color of the eyes and the shape of the nipples to the appearance and color of the nails.
However, it is very disturbing that many robots have their own “personality” that would embarrass the Stepford girl.
Modern inflatable virgins have evolved into robotic women with silicone leather.
The owner of the robot RealBotix can set his replacement wife various character traits, including shyness.
And then there's the sex robotic woman Roxxxy Gold from True Companion, who comes with pre-programmed personalities, including the "fridge Farrah", who is characterized by a shy character and the "wild Wendy" with a "adventure" character.
“The personality of Roxxxy Gold is set to suit your personality as much as possible,” the company’s website reads.
He likes what you like and vice versa.
She's even in the mood, just like people.
It can be tired, talkative, or “in the mood.”
The rise of sex robots is alarming right away for several reasons - among which there is no confusion for real interpersonal relationships. More disturbing are the subordinate feminine character traits and violent pretensions - e.g. frigid (read resistant) Farrah.
The company True Companion on its website resembles Roxxxy to a vibrator for men.
“If a woman can have a vibrator, why can’t she have a man Roxxxy?”
However, sex robots are not just fetishes or sexual aids.
Their origins and almost perfect sophistication point to something darker and deeply rooted in our culture – a departure from ideal or gender equality towards the desire for seductive sex with an optional surrogate.
Of course, most men don’t buy a robotic woman, and while FRR talks about their growing popularity, sex robots are still on the fringe of the general public’s interest.
However, this marginal interest can become a mirror set in modern times.
And most people are not bizarre or violent until the free market makes an excuse for this.
It is no coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots appear at a time when women all over the world are gaining their rights, and in the White House there is a president who often speaks very haphazardly to women.
The most terrifying aspect of the series The Story of a Maid is not what we see - hanging bodies and stuffed eyes, rather the reality of these visions.
The maid’s story is a step in the right direction, but at the moment it seems like a small step.
Sex robots should look as much as possible like real women (although with the rates of pornography).
Their creators construct them in such a way that they are pleasant to the touch and act at first glance like a real woman.
But when it comes to their “personality,” the robot can’t replace a real woman.
They can’t break up with their partner or just leave.
They have no work or history, nothing that would incite their independence or interfere with their devotion to their master.
In other words, they are pleasant slaves.
The 21st Century: Serving.
NBA star on the green pavement.
Curry's fighting in California for a cut.
Star basketball player Stephen Curry did not lose out despite the packed first burn at the premiere among professional golfers.
Double holder of the award for the most useful NBA player played at the Ellie Mae Classic lower series of the Web.com Tour in California’s Hayward first round at 74 and will fight for the cut.
The Golden State player, who won the second NBA title with the Warriors this season, started very nervous and his first shot ended up in a drink holder in a golf cart parked at the fairway.
Even after that, he wasn’t as accurate among the holes as under the basketball basket, yet he left a dozen professionals behind with a balance of four injuries over a pair.
"It wasn't the perfect way to start, having to call the referee right after the first fire, but then it got a little saddened," Curry said, with a huge tremor falling on him.
It was very nervous to fire the first shot at the tournament, but it was all I had hoped for.
"If you told me I was going to play 74 in the first round, I would take it immediately," he added.
If Curry manages to fight the cut, which is likely to be set two wounds under a pair, he will become the first representative of another sport to do so on the Web.com Tour.
“I want to play better next time, and now that I’ve got rid of the tremors, it’s probably going to work,” said the enthusiastic golfer, who has already played at celebrity tournaments and mixed competitions for amateurs and professionals in the past.
In Hayward, he starts for the first time in a tournament that falls under the PGA.
He won a sponsorship exemption to Ellie Mae Classic and retained his amateur status.
The Web.com Tour series is one category under the elite PGA Tour.
Trump's big victory?
Mitt Romney is the embodiment of common sense.
The unmistakable sign of Trump’s era is the political divide that divides American voters and, on a micro scale, disrupts entire families.
During the Christmas and Thanksgiving period, it was in the American newspapers that the advice on how to deal with relatives who voted for Trump was daunting.
We're just supposed to wait until our nerves allow us.
However, less attention is paid to Trump’s ability to stutter the family.
I’m talking about it because this week in New York, my cousin – a poet and fan of the left who lives in Chicago and who has long paid for our family as a Republican joke – visited me.
It reminded me that the tightness of the face in the face of a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
Now, with Trump in the White House, all of a sudden, the whole family — including all the Republican siblings who have been gossiping about politics for years — is on the same wave.
It’s a good thing to have dinner at the family table; but it’s striking to me that in a wider context it poses a significant risk.
Trump is strengthening the left, but the negative impact of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
If we talk about “normalization” and Trump, we are referring to the terrifying possibility that his chessrooms may one day lose their attractiveness.
But there is an even more horrific long-term scenario in which Trump “normalizes” right-wing Republicans, who, contrary to his standards, will suddenly embody what might be called rational.
In these today with nostalgia in my heart, I remember Mitt Romney and his version of crazy behavior – a dog on the roof of a car, a 14% income tax (at least we were aware of his tax confession) – both of which are examples of what Trump looks like when compared to me.
After Trump’s departure, it is enough for the next Republican candidate to be at least normal, which will be a huge improvement.
We took my niece's visits and took the kids to Central Park on the biggest boulevard running the New York Parks Department - you won't find a better use for your three dollars unless you need caffeine.
The horses are huge, the middle cylinder is covered in glass – clowns and animals are filming and looking at their own shoulders in horror – a completely cloudy look, and the zinc music is strangely reminiscent of public transport.
Many clichés will soon be omitted: the view from the high buildings, the panorama is curled up, instead of breathing the atmosphere on you and the reality of the city does not get your imagination.
Thirty-five years later, I still didn’t move over the fact that Swiss Cottage is not really a Swiss cheese – it doesn’t count as a themed pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage – but a metro station in London.
The wheel in Central Park, however, evokes a remarkably magical experience, to the extent that two two-year-olds, as well as two mature women, will have a great time on it.
If I could score a round, he would deserve a maximum of points, but luckily no one asks.
This week I had a similar experience in the store when I was asked to rate my “experience” on a scale from one to five when paying with a credit card.
In a cafe on the corner of my street it's the same, except that I can rate a 15% booze for something I buy at the counter.
Not only does it slow down the fast sale, but the waitress is thus forced to intrude into decent shoppers when it is not necessary.
The woman in the store apologised to me with a smile when I was reluctant to rate my five-star credit card transfer.
Oscar Pistorius was transferred from prison to hospital due to chest pain
This was the second time that Pistorius had to be taken to the hospital.
Last year, he was treated for cut wounds to his wrist, which, according to a prison statement, he caused himself to fall into a cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder following an appeal against the original death sentence.
He killed his girlfriend Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day in 2013 with several gunshot wounds through the door of a bathroom closet in his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed to have mistaken her for a thief.
The plaintiffs announced their intention to appeal again, this time against the six-year sentence of Pistorius, which they said was too mild.
The National Prosecuting Authority has said it will appeal to South Africa’s highest court and the trial will take place later this year.
In the event of success, Pistorius is threatened with an extension of his sentence to 15 years.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
For the first time in history, she gave birth to a captive young panda that mates in the wild.
The pand rescue program is a huge success.
The Centre is trying to expand the genofund of captive gangs.
Chang Chang-Cung told the New China Agency that the breeding of the pand is at high risk from a cross between relatives.
At the end of last year, there were only 471 pandas in captivity.
Only 2,000 of them survive in the wild.
Attempting to pair the trapped pandas with the wild ones is thus the first step in helping the breeding pand to protect this species.
The fifteen-year-old Cchao-chao was released to the nature reserve at the beginning of the mating period of March 11.
Thanks to the tracking device on the neck, the scientists were able to observe every step of hers.
She met her chosen one, Cchao-Cchao, 12 days later.
Sex with the male pandemic lasted a minute and a half and was successful.
Even this can be considered a small miracle, because male pandas are not considered the most successful lovers of the animal kingdom.
Males quite poorly estimate the time when the female is ready, and they are often confused and have no idea what to do.
The young man was born healthy and, even since Chao-chao had an extraordinary appetite during pregnancy, weighed 216 grams after giving birth.
The average weight of a newborn panda is 70 grams lower.
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the detention of two Bulgarian tourists in the territory of Greece for illegal camping, the statement quoted bTV.
A group of tourists, including two Bulhars, were arrested by Sithonian police in the early hours of August 1.
They were all released on the same day, but the investigation continues.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told bTV that Bulgarian tourists were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened the rules of free camping and impose strict fines on anyone who is caught in a place where camping is not allowed.
The checks will take place throughout the season.
The ministry said the court could impose a fine.
After the first round of the British Open, Spilkov<0xC3><0xA1> is in 50th place.
Golfer Kl<0xC3><0xA1>ra Spilkov<0xC3><0xA1> takes the 50th place after the first round of Major British Open.
The playground in Kingsbarns, Scotland, scored one hit under a pair when she played three birdies and two bogeys.
The twenty-year-old Czech player hopes that she will pass the cut for the first time on the famous major.
The entry to the $3.25 million subsidy competition was best received by American star Michelle Wieov<0xC3><0xA1>, who won the first round of the record on the grounds of 64 injuries, eight under par.
Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands are withdrawing millions of toxic eggs from the market.
The Netherlands itself has already temporarily closed 180 poultry farms due to the incident.
The Dutch Food Safety Authority (NVWA) has said it is investigating 20 percent of all Dutch poultry stores, meaning 80 percent of the eggs on the market are harmless.
The Authority underlined that the risk represents only a limited number of types of eggs recognisable by specific numbers.
According to German authorities, the amount of toxic substance in eggs is small and does not pose a danger to adults, but a potential threat to children.
Czech SVS spokesperson Petr Majer said that eggs and chickens from the Netherlands and Belgium, where the authorities have also joined the closure of the farms, have not been in the Czech Republic lately.
Veterinarians will, however, take snail samples of eggs and chicken meat originating in Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Italy, Germany and Poland, where problematic insecticide labels have appeared on the market.
Eggs from Belgium were on the Czech market for the last time in April and eggs from the Netherlands for the last time in May, according to the veterinary administration.
Chicken meat from Belgium was last discovered in the Czech Republic in June.
In the Czech Republic, however, there is a certain amount of chicken meat from the Netherlands.
Fipronil is a substance that is part of anti-fleas, everything and ticks preparations.
However, it must not be administered to animals whose meat is consumed by humans.
The World Health Organization (WHO) considers the preparation to be mildly toxic.
Its high doses lead to a feeling of nausea and dizziness.
Riga is beautiful, I will miss it, says goalkeeper Sedl<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek and is looking for engagement.
I'd like to catch another ten years.
"Maybe I'll go back there one day," said the 27-year-old Sedl<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek, who could start the season in a Zl<0xC3><0xAD>n jersey.
It depends on whether he gets the engagement before the start of the new year.
What were the four years you spent in Latvia?
If I had to grade it as a school, it would be three.
The first year I didn’t catch much, I had an experienced goalkeeper ahead of me.
I've learned.
The second year I started catching.
In season three, I thought they would give me more space.
But they brought in a new goalkeeper, with whom I alternated again.
Last year, I thought I'd catch it all the time.
But in the first ten games, we only got five points, so the coaches started to shoot.
At the end of the day, my friend caught more.
But that's how it's done.
They wanted to cheer him up for next season.
What was life like in Rize?
Awesome.
It's a little Prague.
A beautiful, European, historic city.
I'm gonna miss her.
I found a girlfriend there.
We're together for the third year, and we're getting married next year.
So I brought something in.
How challenging is the KHL for goalkeepers?
The first 10 teams are really good.
Then there are teams like us or Slavs who have to change their playing style against them.
Skill is on the other side, so you have to replace it with something.
It means playing more backwards, fighting more.
I didn't see a problem in the width of the playground.
The difference is that the Russians want to play empty.
They shoot less, and even if they have a half-empty gate in front of them, they prefer to record.
In the Czech Republic, more is being shot.
Wasn't it a problem to travel and move across seven time zones?
If you don’t have a family, that’s not a problem.
He can sleep in peace.
The program is usually done in such a way that you need to play four games outside and then you have two days off.
How do Latvians perceive their club in the KHL?
As a national team.
All of Latvia is watching hockey, along with basketball it is a national sport.
Everybody's a fan.
Even if it didn’t happen, a lot of people were there.
Did Dinam’s performance in the KHL help Latvia almost progress to the quarter-finals at this year’s World Cup?
The KHL has been playing since 2008 and Dinamo has been there since the beginning.
And since then, their World Championship results have started to go up.
At the 2014 Olympics in Sochi, they fell 1–2 in the quarter-finals with Canada.
That was an unreal outcome for them.
Thanks to the KHL, they got to a higher level.
More and more Latvian players are heading to the Czech Extraliga.
Roberts Bukarts settled in Zl<0xC3><0xAD>n and before the signing of the contract was Ralfs Freibergs.
Why do so many people come here?
They're not beekeepers, they're really good.
Local teams are looking for cheaper and younger players from abroad, Latvians are among them.
It's a natural direction.
The KHL starts in three weeks.
Why are you still uncommitted?
At the beginning of February, I knew that I would not continue in Rize.
With that, we started looking for something.
There was Sparta on the table.
But because they didn't have a budget for the goalkeeper, we didn't make a deal.
Then it was a classic.
We played with different teams, but in the final, they decided for someone else.
So I'm training at home in Zl<0xC3><0xAD>n and I'll wait for something to show up.
Aren't you nervous about that?
That's what I was four years ago when I left here and didn't know what was going to happen.
The current situation is not the best, on the other hand, I am at home for some time.
I picked up something in the KHL, so I'm taking it differently.
The only question is when and where to sign.
How real is the option to start the new year in Zl<0xC3><0xAD>n?
Anything can happen.
We'll see what happens in a month.
Now all I can do is wait for the agent to make a deal.
Do you prefer a competition?
The last season wasn't the one I could choose.
So I'm waiting for the phone.
The government's takeover of the flight continues.
In January of this year, I wrote about the camp in Lete near Orl<0xC3><0xAD>k in the article S caring for a decent farmer.
The essence of the problem remains the same, so I will allow myself to recall the main passages of the article.
There has been talk of a camp in Lete for many years.
For readers who don’t know exactly what it is, it’s probably best to check out, for example, the official cultural sites of Pietn<0xC3><0xAD> p<0xC5><0x99>eto Leta.
There, they learn at the beginning of the historical survey that the camp stood two kilometres east of the village of Lety, that from 8 August 1940 it served as a labor camp, from 1 January 1942 it was a gathering camp, and from 2 August 1942 it became a gypsy camp.
The following text describes the course of life in the camp, including inhuman conditions, until March 1943, when the first air prisoners were admitted to Auschwitz transport.
On May 4, 1943, 370 people were transported to the extermination camp.
There were 420 of them.
A very sad history of the immense suffering of human beings, which again caused them human beings and twisted ideologies.
There is no dispute that it is necessary to constantly remember these events.
There is no dispute that this commemoration should take place at a memorial in the place of the suffering of these people.
The problem is elsewhere.
After socialism, the camp was somewhat forgotten and in the 1970s it was built near and on a part of the former camp pork.
The history of the camp was accidentally discovered in 1992 by the American Paul Polansky, in 1995 a monument was unveiled in Letech.
In the mid-1990s, the government promised the purchase and demolition of pork, but this has not happened so far.
In 1998 the monument was declared a cultural monument and since 2009 its administration falls under the Lidice Monument.
In July 2013, the UN Human Rights Committee called on the Czech Republic to close the pigs.
So many brief facts about the post-war fate of the camp.
In the autumn of last year, the government approved the purchase of pork and decided to draw up an expert assessment to determine the price.
According to the Minister of Agriculture, the government will then buy pork.
According to the Minister of Culture Herman, "there are some numbers, but I would probably hate those intentions if I went public with them."
We'll see what the expert judgement brings.
According to some unofficial estimates, it can be hundreds of millions, according to others, the price can reach up to a billion.
In any case, it will not be a cheap matter.
Just a few hundred meters from the former camp stands a monument, in which the state invested almost ten million kroner in 2010.
Even if the UN Human Rights Committee financed the entire transaction, which is not likely to be at risk, it would, in my opinion, be a waste of money.
Doesn’t the government have other priorities?
A monument, a worthy place of worship, stands the will of history practically in the immediate vicinity of the tragedy that has taken place and anyone who wants can bow down to the memory of the suffering and the murdered.
I see no reason to change this!
Let it be as it is, and keep the place of worship with utmost care.
The responsible person, in this case the government of the Czech Republic, should take care of the property entrusted to him, i.e. the taxpayers’ money.
At least with the same as in your own company!
Of course, the finance minister and the deputy prime minister are not the whole government.
But even so, from the perspective of the above facts, I see the password of the leader of the YES movement only as an empty pre-election proclamation.
This year, in May, I started looking directly at the place.
Very decent arrival road, modified parking lot, replicas of wooden campers.
In one exhibition, in the other integrated toilet with running water.
A small natural amphitheater with seating and a view of its own bakery, which is made of stones located in a mild slope.
Lots of flowers and wreaths.
All attributes corresponding to the meaning of this place, as it pleases and belongs.
Archaeological research is currently underway at the site of the original camp.
It would be reasonable to consider whether it would be possible, for example, to preserve part of the open ground and to make it at least visually accessible in an appropriate way.
In this direction, the Minister of Culture, Daniel Herman, could intensify his efforts.
If he succeeds in prosecuting the purchase of pork for state money in the government, it will be just another unfortunate step in his already sufficiently problematic role as Minister of Culture.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate can alleviate symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
Red meat and dairy products can be a nightmare for your digestive system.
However, a new study suggests the exact opposite: a diet rich in animal protein and dairy products could help alleviate the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable disease, which affects up to 1.3 million U.S. residents and 300,000 patients in the UK, causes abdominal pain and bleeding diarrhea, weight loss, and extreme fatigue.
Patients are usually reminded not to consume meat and dairy products to alleviate symptoms, but researchers at the University of Washington have found that the essential amino acid tryptophan contained in the protein helps to build immune cells that promote gut resistance.
The lead author of the study, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells protect the intestines and ensure the decomposition of harmful microbes from food.
The number of inflammatory cells is balanced by the number of cells that promote tolerance and protect the body, without damaging the sensitive tissue.
Once the scales lean towards the side of the inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease can occur.
As part of the research, the researchers found the presence of immune cells that support the body's tolerance in the stomach of mice with specific bacteria.
This bacterium requires the presence of tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to make cells.
Professor Colonna said: “We have found a link between one species of bacteria – Lactobacillus reuteri – which is a common part of the gut microbiome and the development of cells that support body tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more immune cells they had.”
At the same time, he suggested that if it turns out to be the same for humans, then a combination of L. reuteri and tryptophan-rich diets would help develop a more tolerant and less inflammatory intestinal environment.
Postgraduate researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas, in a study of certain types of immune cells that support body tolerance, found that one group of test mice had these cells, while the other group of the same mice kept separate cells.
It was derived from the fact that one group of mice has a different intestinal microbiome – a community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that commonly reside in the gastrointestinal tract.
The mice’s intestines were tested by a DNA sorting method, and the researchers found six types of bacteria in mice with immune cells that were missing from the second group of mice.
The mice, who were bred in a sterile environment and lacked a gut microbiome -- they didn't develop this type of immune cells -- were given L. reuteri -- and made immune cells.
To understand how the bacteria affect the immune system, the researchers cultivated L. reuteri in a liquid, and then transferred a small amount of fluid — without bacteria — to undeveloped immune cells that were kept in isolation.
Immune cells have evolved into tolerant cells.
After the removal of the active ingredient from the liquid, it was shown to be a by-product of the tryptophan metabolism known as indolyl-3-acetic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mouse diet, the amount of these cells increased by 50 percent. After halved the doses of tryptophan, the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerant cells as mice, and most of us keep the L. reuteri bacteria in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether by-products of tryptophan from L. reuteri cause cell development in humans in the same way as in mice, but defects in tryptophan-related genes have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan added: “Each of us should probably try to develop these cells because they control the inflammation of the inner surface of the intestine.
Potentially high levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri may increase the cell population."
José Mourinho considers signing contract with Neman Mati<0xC4><0x87> and his transfer to Manchester United ‘genial’
Manchester United have won a "genius" in the form of Nemanj Matic - at least that's what José Mourinho thinks after the defending champion made his debut in Wednesday's match against Sampdoria.
Mati<0xC4><0x87>, who signed a <0xC2><0xA3>40 million contract, made his debut in the first match with a 2:1 win in Dublin - the last pre-season match before the UEFA Super Cup, where United will meet Real Madrid on Tuesday - and impressed in his role as a backup alongside Paul Pogby and Andreas Pere.
However, as he did not participate in the team's pre-season Asian tour, Mati<0xC4><0x87> did not have a form and only played 45 minutes, which Mourinha said must be worked on before the start of the next Premier League season.
“He needs time, but he’s experienced, intelligent, and he has brilliant thinking — he thinks football,” Mourinho said.
"We'll help him get in shape as soon as possible."
Like Mati<0xC4><0x87>, his new team-mates Victor Lindelöf and Romelu Lukaku also played their first match at Aviva Stadium and Mourinho is slowly starting to form his eleven for the next season.
An independent source announced this week that Mourinho still wants to sign a contract with the other three players, but insists the club has done a “fantastic job” and brought three of the four most important players to the team.
"Thank you to the club for helping me get three out of four players," he added.
“Four out of four would have liked me more, but I admit they did the best they could for me.”
The life challenge of the king of chicken skins of K<0xC3><0xA1>di Hru<0xC5><0xA1>ka.
He wants lessons from Pohlreich!
This promising picture began to be drawn thanks to a new program on TV Prima Zdenekova Academy.
The pear immediately blew up the chance.
"Dear Zdenek, I would like to enroll in your cooking academy because, hand in hand, I think I can learn a lot from you," he said in a video on the social network.
And since the two have been on top for a couple of years, Lad<0xC3><0xAD>a has not forgotten to irritate him this time.
"In return, I can teach you sweaty chicken, American cucumbers, or invite you to water and show you why fried cheese is your favorite," said Hru<0xC5><0xA1>ka.
His participation in Pohlreich’s new show is really serious.
It's time to move up the level and learn from the master.
"The question is, what's the boss?" said Bleek.
However, Pohlreich did not express himself because he was filming new parts of his next show, Yes, boss!.
Only Prima responded to Hru<0xC5><0xA1>ka’s participation in the culinary academy by taking the whole matter as his personal activity that goes outside of television.
Hru<0xC5><0xA1>ka Pohlreich made his first chef a big hit in December 2004.
Within a few days, it sold over 300,000 pieces!
The new show, which was presented yesterday by Prima at the press conference for the autumn broadcast schedule, is an unfaketed cooking school.
Pohlreich selects its pupils from the audience and in twelve works they are familiar with the twelve cooking techniques.
In the last part of his show Now, the chef cooks in November 2014, Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k has a crossed pear on the back of his shirt.
If my face was there, I'd laugh a lot.
"I just laugh at that pear - the pear is a healthy fruit and has a lot of vitamins," La<0xC4><0x8F>a replied.
He thinks about the culinary art of the lake.
"Cooking according to Lada Hru<0xC5><0xA1>ka does not take into account at home, because I will not leave a gastropunk at home," says the boss.
I really appreciate Zdenek Pohlreich, even according to him I make chicken on honey.
But his recipes will definitely not appear on my show," Khrushchev said.
He's a jerk!
He's not a chef to me, he's a TV clown.
"A gastronomic illiterate or a fool," Pohlreich said of Khrushchev in one lecture.
"I'm not twenty to be able to wave my hand over them, but I don't solve them like that anymore," Hru<0xC5><0xA1>ka said.
British inventor uses a microchip in his hand to unlock a car and a house by throwing
The British inventor became the first person in the country to have a microchip inserted into his body. By simply shaking his hand, he can unlock the door from his house and office and even start a car.
Thirty-three-year-old Steven Northam has a tiny chip implanted between his thumb and pointer and currently offers the same service through his company BioTeq to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology.
Dr. Geoff Watson, an anesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, oversees the procedure for implantation and adherence to treatment procedures.
The technology works on the same principle as microchips implanted in dogs and cats, and the entire procedure takes 30 seconds.
Northam also offers a replacement service for door locks and cars compatible with a microchip. The price of one lock is <0xC2><0xA3>300.
The married father of one child lets the technology integrate into his home and his BMW Z4 car, which starts with a simple hand gesture.
White House Revenue Costs Taxpayers Thousands of Dollars
The White House’s decision to fly a Navy helicopter to South Lawn to celebrate the U.S. manufacturing industry last month came at $24,000, according to Navy records published by TIME Weekly.
The Green White Helicopter Sikorsky VH-3D, also called Marine One in the presence of the president on board, was the culmination of the July 17 program at the White House, which was a showcase of U.S. design programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and several senior White House officials attended a product show from all 50 states.
A Connecticut helicopter was on display next to a yacht from Maine, a Wisconsin fire truck and a forklift from Mississippi.
A military officer of the White House issued a fragmentary order, or FRAGO, and requested the presence of the helicopter less than 36 hours before the helicopter landed on South Lawn as part of an "extraordinary" event, reports the Marine Helicopter Helicopter Squadron One.
“I wanted to make sure you were aware of such significant events,” the HMX-1 commander wrote in an e-mail to his superior, the Navy’s deputy commander for aviation the day before the event began.
The report indicated that the helicopter will arrive at South Lawn on July 17 at approximately 7:00 a.m. on the occasion of the show, the start of which is scheduled at 15:00 and will remain on site until the complete clearance of the entire site, which was scheduled between 18:00 and 21:00 p.m.
The e-mail also stated that if there is a delay on departure from the White House, the replacement crew will be sent for the return flight due to the working time regulations.
The original crew remained on the scene that evening, along with the helicopter and with them a unit of security personnel.
From the records - which TIME obtained - it was not clear if the second crew was sent in the end.
The Hatch Act prohibits government officials from using government property for political purposes.
Records indicate that HMX-1 is investigating possible infringements of this Regulation.
"We were wondering if it was a breach of the Hatch Act and we were assured that everything was fine," he wrote.
"It sounds like you're being blocked," the deputy commander said.
The show "Made in America" was labelled the White House as an official event and would not be covered by the Hatch Act.
But even the official events have political subtexts.
During his participation in the event, the president promoted a health reform that passed the Senate and talked about an attempt to keep the government’s regulations at bay.
The use of air vehicles such as Marine One or Air Force One for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
The presidents use them when traveling.
However, their presence for purely presentational reasons is unusual.
Trump ordered a check in February after the presidential plane set off in the background at his first meeting as part of a campaign in Melbourne, Florida. His Twitter account is dotted with complaints about the use of the presidential plane by his predecessors.
“The White House is delighted with the ‘Made in America’ show that showcased products from all 50 states that Americans make from American materials,” said Lindsay Walters, a spokeswoman for the White House.
Helicopter crews of the HMX-1 often train landings in the Washington area and on the South Lawn and train any possible arrivals with the President of the United States to the White House with maximum accuracy.
While Trump attended the G-20 summit in early July in Germany, HMX-1 conducted 58 rehearsal landings at the White House.
The flight at the Made in America parade was part of the current training of the crew, the state official said.
On the same day, the helicopter unit flew in as part of the “non-presidential support missions” for another eleven hours.
The White House has said that no additional property has been paid from taxpayers’ money.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said the company was not in any way interested in the South Lawn Helicopter Exposure negotiations.
HMX-1 does not keep budget records for presidential flights, and the exact costs associated with the survey are difficult to determine, according to the Navy.
According to the Department of Defense, the hourly price for the fiscal year 2017, the DoD expenses reimbursement for VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
The unit records the time of 30 minutes from the Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico in Virginia and back.
The White House argues that the actual operating costs of the helicopter are significantly below that amount.
“To put the taxpayers’ costs on the basis of estimates of reimbursement is very misleading,” Walters said.
“These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs, which are included in the annual costs.”
According to the 2015 RAND study, the reimbursement of DoD expenses does not include the cost of personnel, but includes the price of fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of helicopters for the purpose of the parade.
“The idea of the show that is taking place this week is to introduce products made in the US,” Spicer said.
“I am aware that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they are contributing to the defense of our state and that they are providing jobs to hundreds, if not thousands of people.
I think, like most Americans, that we are proud of helicopters and other military equipment, the production of which is attended by countless American citizens.
This fact should be recalled."
It is not clear whether Trump was also looking at the helicopter during his walk on South Lawn. With certainty, it can only be said that he was sitting behind the wheel of one of the fire trucks.
Back in the White House, Trump contacted a Sikorsky representative and joked with the media about his own fleet of products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the President, "I have three of my own."
A young woman was trapped in a pond near Lake Mach, the police boarded her.
The girl went to the beach on Sunday about two o’clock in the morning.
Instead of bathing, she remained trapped in the wetlands.
When she decided to ask a police officer for help on her mobile phone, she had the last 12 percent of the battery.
"For this reason, the police soon lost contact with her," police spokeswoman Ivana Bal<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
Several police officers went to the spot she described, but finding a young woman wasn’t easy at all.
“Some of the police officers had to roam the crustacean wetlands for hundreds of meters before they felt the solid ground under their feet again,” Bal<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
And she was also missing on that.
The police were depending on the direction in which her call for help came from.
"In order not to lose this connection at least, they agreed with her that she would count out loud," the spokeswoman said.
Police found the woman at only three quarters in five in the ponds in the locality of Born<0xC3><0xBD>.
She was on the brink of physical and mental strengths and showed signs of subcooling.
That is why an ambulance called took her to a Czecholipsk hospital.
Grandpa's connection to STAN?
The requested bride becomes a saleswoman.
That's a little irony.
With his web project searchameslunny.cz, it was as if a billionaire told voters that the STAN is suffering from a deficit of decent people.
He also asserted that a politically inseparable party of lesser-known mayors and independents, in fact, has no nationwide program for parliamentary elections.
Her electoral candidate will simply become a decent person after an interview with Grandpa, no matter what political opinion she has.
This was the beginning of V<0xC3><0xAD>t B<0xC3><0xA1>rt, and it didn’t seem too good.
With its quest for decent people and personalities, which may be replaced by some mayors on the candidates, which Gazd<0xC3><0xAD>k admitted, Grandpa also cancels the popular argument of the head of the state that the most valuable of the movements are the political checks and the experienced subordinates of the mayors.
These are now quietly replacing the quickly collected unidentified personalities.
The total separation with the people, after which STAN changed the logo and the slogan, Gazd<0xC3><0xAD>k also explained that the movement does not want to lose its identity on the candidates of the people.
But if STAN was suspected of identity by only a few at the time, after the arrival of Grandpa, even just a game of identity ends.
Not only was Gazd<0xC3><0xAD>k long opposed to ANO Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1>, but Grandfather, who publicly praises Babi<0xC5><0xA1>, stated: "My goal is for the YES movement, that is, the Mayor's movement to gain twenty percent in the upcoming elections."
Let's hope you didn't interrupt the movement.
Grandpa is a successful businessman and a billionaire is certainly not a coincidence.
He often talks about politics like Babi<0xC5><0xA1>, but unlike him, he doesn’t build his own political brand.
STAN has been reminiscent of a reality show rather than a real political party for some time now, and Grandpa’s helping hand seems to make the bride even more a sales girl.
For a while STAN went with TOP 09, then with the people and now he's looking for decent people to change.
Let's hope someone gets back to you.
Police Dogs Trained in Bridge Overflight by Helicopter
Dogs specialized in the search for explosives and search dogs today trained at Lake Most crossings by helicopter.
The police dog must not be fearful and have fear of flying, said the head of the police cynologists of the <0xC3><0x9A>stek region Petr Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1>ek.
The training of a police dog takes about two years.
At the Bridge, both adult dogs and those who are just passing through the training exercise were trained.
In addition to the standard training, in which they were supposed to detect sharp samples of explosives around the lake and look for a lost figurine, all 12 animals had to board the helicopter and fly over the lake.
The main purpose of the exercise is to test dogs in a helicopter.
In order to immediately as soon as the helicopter arrives, the dog can go to work so that he does not have a problem with the helicopter journey.
"The helicopter arrives, the dog goes and searches immediately," Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1>ek said.
A dog who is restless or is unable to start working immediately by helicopter on the way is excluded from training.
"Most of the time they leave them in the garden," Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1>ek added.
The police have 76 dogs with different specializations in <0xC3><0x9A>steck<0xC3><0xBD> kraj.
German Shepherds are predominant, but Belgian Shepherds are also growing.
The dog is taken care of by the puppy.
"He is raising it himself, preparing it for the service that the dog will do for us," Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1>ek added.
The animal undergoes repeated veterinary examinations, which may reveal any health defects.
If the dog is healthy and careless, it takes the first test in 20 months.
"A sharp intervention takes about two and a half to three years," Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1>ek added.
The length of service at the police station depends on the health of the dog.
They usually serve up to eight to ten years.
Most of the time, they live with their dogs.
Narcos Season 3 Trailer: Pablo Escobar Is Out of Game and Cali Cartel Becomes the Centerpiece of Netflix’s Hit Series
Despite the conclusion of the second season of Narcos, when the killer Pablo Escobar is revealed, the Netflix series is far from over.
Confirmation from the streaming service has already come the third and fourth season - the first mentioned has already come the first trailer and a lot of other negative characters.
In the third season, the DEA focuses on the richest drug cartel in the world: the Cali Cartel.
Under the leadership of four influential CMs, they operate “as a Fortune 500 company,” with only the difference that they escalate violent acts and hire more government agents.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) plays brain surgery, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) has a connection with Mexico, and Chepe Santacruz London (Pepe Rapazote) controls New York.
In the new trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a, the character of the American and Colombian law enforcement officers in the fight against drugs.
Other actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishé and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will premiere on September 1.
According to the United Nations, Afghan democracy relies on women in politics.
The elections can only be credible if they are attended by all members of the society, including women, the UN representative in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, the head of the U.N. Auxiliary Mission, said that hundreds of women are taking part in local elections, three women are applying for a vice president, and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overlooked," he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can be fully representative and credible only if they are attended by women, as well as all related processes related to the election.
The local and presidential elections in Afghanistan will be held on April 5.
The Taliban has issued several threats against the electoral process, which is shifting international combat activity to the second round.
In this year’s election, for the first time ever, a democratically elected government transfers its power to a peacefully succeeding government.
Haysom said the strong role of women will strengthen democracy in Afghanistan.
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission said that out of a total of 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million are women.
The unique brewery is again brewing beer.
For a good beer in a re-baptized brewery.
The enthusiasm and honesty of the new owners returned to the life of the brewery in Lob<0xC4><0x8D>a near M<0xC5><0xA1>ena a few years ago.
The brewery, first mentioned in 1586, has a renaissance core and in the nineteenth century it was rebuilt for parochial operation.
It was followed by years of blossoming, when the brewery was famous mainly for dark beers.
Unfortunately, during the Second World War, production was stopped and in 1984 the brewery was nationalized.
Since then, the buildings have served as state-owned buildings.
The work of the destruction was completed by the owners of the brewery after 1989.
The abandoned area was devastated and dismantled to build material.
In 2007, however, new hopes arose in the form of new owners, architects Jan and Pavla Prouzov<0xC3><0xA1>.
They began to repair the buildings with the utmost respect for the spirit of the building and every detail.
They have carefully devoted themselves to the study of archival materials, trying to preserve the original materials and building elements.
The brewery has the same shape as in the nineteenth century, when its golden age began.
Their work was awarded by the Ministry of Culture’s declaration of the brewery as a cultural monument, and the construction became part of the European paths of industrial heritage.
In 2015, the tradition of brewing beer was officially restored.
If you want to taste a great Lobe<0xC4><0x8D> beer in the picturesque landscape of Koko<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>nska, visit the pier in the brewery area.
When brewing beer here they use chicken water coming from the protected landscape area, malt from the Lobe<0xC4><0x8D> fields and hops.
You will taste a traditional light bed, but also dark beer and specials.
And don’t miss the brewery tour, which takes place on Saturdays and Sundays at noon and at half past noon.
The largest artillery fortress in Czechoslovakia?
One of the biggest forts of its kind on a global scale?
Such a unique building was to be the Festung Stächelberg between Trutnov and <0xC5><0xBD>aclé<0xC5><0x99>, on the top of the grounds above the village of Bab<0xC3><0xAD>.
Originally, it was supposed to consist of up to twelve bunkers connected by extensive underground.
There was to be a command, a barracks, ammunition warehouses, materials, a power plant, a machine shop and a hospital.
The construction was terminated by the Munich Agreement.
In less than a year, a single huge iron-concrete bunker was built and underground spaces were laid out.
Thanks to the enthusiasts from the Stachelberg Association, who began to reconstruct a unique building in the early 1990s, you can also take a look here.
The ground floor is now available from 75 percent!
In addition to the T-S 73 infantry crutch with an exhibition and underground, there is also an armoured object of light fortification, two infantry crutches, trenches and the learning path Upevné Trutnovsko.
Refreshment, cozy attic and breathtaking views to the countryside guaranteed!
This unique and beautiful Czech building got on the list next to such monuments as the Great Wall of China, the port of Traian near Rome or the Assyrian palace in Nineveh and Nimrud.
Chot<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xA1>ov Monastery originally dates back to the beginning of the thirteenth century, which today mainly forms a mighty four-winged convent building above a beautiful garden.
The list that he got, but unfortunately belongs to unique buildings that are threatened with extinction.
Fans, however, do not want to give up and organize a lot of events to support the monastery.
One of them is the next year’s Evening for Chot<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xA1>ov Monastery this Saturday, August 5th, where you will see Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Mi<0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xAD>k, Ivan Hlas, you will see <0xC5><0xA0>arm<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0x99> performances and look at the sites of beautiful large buildings, which are usually inaccessible.
Most of all, you will enjoy the atmosphere of this great place.

Identify the plant with a single click.
The new free app Pl<0x40>ntNet will help students with the creation of herbarians and ordinary lovers of plants.
If they are interested in what plant they just encountered on a walk, this app will advise them.
The only thing they will have to do is photograph the plant, and the application itself recognizes what kind it is.
The new application, which is available for iOS and Android, was presented on Tuesday to the representatives of the Center for Ethical and Environmental Education CEEV in Bratislava’s Mountain Park as part of the Secret Life of the City project.
Students from 50 Czech and Slovak schools were also involved in the project, who photographed and added plants from their surroundings to the application database with their teachers.
The newly created French app is free to download on the Secret Life of the City website.
The main goal of the French programmers was to make as many people as possible contribute to the application with their images, thereby increasing the number of plants that the application can recognize.
"Children who hold a tablet or mobile phone in their hands can go to the forest," said Ivana Pol<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1>, coordinator of the project.
Based on a sufficiently high-quality photo of the flower, leaf or fruit of the plant, the application can recognize its name within seconds, which it then assigns in Czech and Slovak under the photo.
The French allowed us to translate the application into Slovak and Czech for the Secret Life of the City project.
It is therefore welcome that after creating an account, users contribute to the application with a picture of a plant that is not yet present in the database.
"The French will assess whether it is beneficial and then add it to the database," Pol<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
GMB's Concerns About Investing in McVitie's Factory in Glasgow
Trade unions demand assurances from McVitie's cookie manufacturer managers about a long-term commitment to manufacturing at the Glasgow factory.
The Scottish trade union GMB stated that the company was silent for the time being regarding any investment in the Tollcross plant.
The factory employs more than 500 employees who produce, among other products, Hobnob and Rich Tea cookies.
McVitie's owner, Pladis, said it had invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in the entire area over the past few years.
She added that employees and representatives of trade unions will be “among the first informed” in the event of changes in the operation of the factory.
In a letter to the construction company, the Scottish trade unions of GMB expressed their concern that McVitie's "will not deliver on its promises to finance and modernize production lines."
GMB chief organizer Drew Duffy added: “The lack of clear responses from the construction company regarding the company’s needs and the future investment plan at Tollcross is very worrying for our members.
Generations of many families have worked here, and employees are mostly from the local community and the Glasgow area, where working in a local factory is a critical pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social exclusion.
In terms of work, wages and profitability – and despite the prospect of Brexit, rising cost of living and falling slow production – the eastern part of Glasgow needs a desperately prosperous producer like McVitie’s.”
A spokesperson for Pladis said: “Tollcross received a letter from GMB only yesterday and the company is making a statement as soon as possible, as we appreciate the continued commitment towards employees and union representatives.
The regular meeting with employees and representatives of GMB in Tollcross took place two months ago, and many problems were openly discussed at this meeting.
We talked to our employees that, like all companies operating in extremely competitive and uncertain economic conditions, we evaluate our operations on a regular basis, which applies to all our operations, so that we can continue to successfully compete with others.
She added: “In recent years, we have invested <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in the Tollcross area, especially in production lines and streamlining operations.
We appreciate the heritage of Tollcross and its localities and in case of any changes in the operation of the local factories, employees and representatives of the trade unions will be informed immediately."
Did PSG warn Barcelona of Neymar's move three years ago?
La Liga may regret its interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain won’t allow Neymar to take his side after it paid <0xC2><0xA3>189 million, the amount needed to redeem Neymar from the contract, but did this French team warn Barcelona of its record landing three years ago?
The club is ready to beat more than double the previous record amount for Paul Pogby's move to Manchester United, who paid <0xC2><0xA3>89 million for him last season.
Upon confirmation and completion of the transfer, Neymar will become the world’s most expensive player and at the same time the highest paid professional athlete in the world – after tax, he will collect over <0xC2><0xA3>500,000 per week from PSG.
Barcelona are outraged by the way Neymar has pulled out of his contract, despite the fact that a confidential source has confirmed that the club has always tried to comply with Neymar in everything since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned of this fact three years ago by the president of PSG?
When Manchester City expressed interest in Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned all the club that they would be interested in overtaking one of PSG’s top players.
"I'm not afraid because once someone tries to get one of our players, then we're definitely going to contact one of their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
“We respect all the clubs.
But if they try to get one of our players, they will face consequences.”
Barcelona seems to have crossed the imaginary boundary when she expressed interest in PSG backer Marc Verratti in the summer.
PSG has made it clear that under no circumstances will it allow the departure of the Italian representative, so it is possible that Barcelona is now swallowing a bitter pill after Neymara’s departure for his turbulent negotiations.
Who will explain the sanctions?
Does political punishment have broadly comprehensible rules?
Donald Trump called for anti-Russian sanctions.
The United States imposed sanctions on Venezuelan President Maduro.
A day earlier, Trump wrote that China is not doing anything about the North Korean threat and that it will not continue to do so.
And the idea of sanctions is as clear as straw from boots.
These things can't be thrown into one bag.
Maduro’s Venezuela has indeed embarked on a journey towards dictatorship, even totalitarianism.
China just doesn’t behave the way the US president wants.
Russia is a chapter in itself.
But if someone wanted to sum up all this so that even the ordinary voter, American, European or otherwise, understood what it is based on and what system of rules the policy of sanctions is based on, it would be an almost impossible task.
In the sanctions against Russia, President Trump only touches on what President Obama has already imposed, he has given it an implementing stamp.
Then why such a stir?
Last year, Europe feared that if Trump wins the U.S. election, we will embrace Putin and lift sanctions.
It's a terrible idea.
In practice, it is the opposite.
With Trump, sanctions are not loosened, but tightened.
But Europe is even more afraid.
German Minister Zypries says Trump’s sanctions are violating international law.
Is it like kosher being sanctioned only by the UN Security Council?
But then there are neither the Kosher nor the anti-Russian sanctions of the EU.
European Commission chief Juncker once again complains that Trump’s sanctions endanger the EU’s energy security.
It's like they're supposed to use sanctions just so weak that they don't threaten anyone?
An ordinary voter is on the line.
For three years, he heard that the fate of the anti-Russian sanctions depends only on the implementation of the Minsk ceasefire agreements in Ukraine.
Now it is clear that it is about energy security in the EU.
Voter feeds and spreads.
Sanctions are being imposed on Russia for too much mounting where it does not have.
China is swayed by the fact that little is assembled.
Venezuela’s president is being punished for building a dictatorship within his country’s borders.
All these punishments or just considerations have their rationality.
But does anyone see a system, order, or rules in it?
Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1>: I don’t think about working with Okamura.
Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1> married, crosses the republic with his visionary book and finalizes the electoral program.
In addition to the Pardubice region, all candidates are already ready.
According to his words, he did not intervene in any way.
He even agreed that Moravian-Silesian heitman and shadow education minister YES Ivo Vondr<0xC3><0xA1>k would lead it.
"But if he succeeds, he will have to choose whether he wants to be a member or a member of parliament," Babi<0xC5><0xA1> confirmed his earlier position.
Many representatives and national politicians have angered your thesis that directly elected mayors and mayors should run the towns and cities themselves, only with managers.
Is that what you mean?
It wasn't like that.
I am a supporter of direct democracy, we vote directly for the president and I am convinced that we should also vote for mayors and mayors.
In my book, I'm not talking about interfering with representatives, they can be there.
The question is how many there will be.
When I was presenting your book, what I dream about, when I was sleeping by chance, I heard with my own ears that you were talking about the cancellation of representations.
I don't remember that.
I was talking about direct election and a reduction in the number of representatives.
New York City, with a population of nine million, has five districts and 51 representatives.
Prague, with 1.2 million citizens, has 1171 representatives.
And the mayor claims that she has little to build and has not prepared large projects, but she has no competence for it.
The same is true of a government that has been ruled by only two people in our history, Klaus and Zeman.
Which I'm not saying they did it right.
The current prime minister, however, does not control anything, he only moderates the debate.
That's not how it works.
Is that why you want to implement the majority system?
It would be perfect, but it's hard to enforce.
We only have a change in the program to a one-way Senate election.
We have also proposed a sliding mandate of ministers and an amendment of the House's rules of procedure to prevent unnecessary exhibitions of Members who are to work mainly in committees and committees from presenting themselves at the House's meetings.
It is certainly not true that I want to destroy the parliamentary system.
But that's exactly what your opponents are afraid of.
That as a dictator you will rule a government, control a house of 101 deputies, abolish the regions and the Senate, and through grateful mayors and mayors you will rule the entire country.
Well, it certainly isn't.
There is nothing wrong with debating the number of Members.
French President Macron has announced the reduction of the legislature by a third, with 57,000 French on one legislature, while we have 17,000 Czechs.
Macron, of course, is not accused of threatening democracy.
Even if someone in the Czech Republic wins the elections by a majority, we have mechanisms that would prevent them from making some dramatic changes.
The jury for those who have a parliamentary majority, however, is large, just look to Poland or Hungary.
There is no such thing as a YES movement.
We just need a team that will work in government for people, not for their parties or resorts.
I do not understand why we have not been able to agree that only the salaries of teachers, cultural and social workers will be increased.
Why did they over-vote me and add 21 percent to the GIBS members who are already taking 60,000?
Would you like that as a prime minister?
The prime minister is to intervene when ministers behave uneconomically, confusingly with travel agencies, and for the money of the state they would like to do business like Marian Jure<0xC4><0x8D>ka, who wanted to buy forests in Romania and land in Africa.
Ministers in the government should not argue, disputes should be spoken outside the government.
There must be ready-made material in the cabinet, there is no room for coalition cracks, force voting and trades, there must be a decision made.
How do you want to have a cohesive team when the ministers are mostly side-by-side?
Above the parties is a constitutional law.
When it came to breaking the bread, Sobotka said that the coalition treaty was not in effect, and he kicked Babi<0xC5><0xA1> out of the government.
Any prime minister can do that.
However, if he is a personality and has management skills, such a plan gesture is not necessary.
It measures everyone equally and requires perfect performance from everyone.
Do you know who you would propose to the Minister of Finance?
I'm not thinking about it at all, because we probably won't even be in that government, no one wants to cooperate with us, even though I don't know what I've done so terrible.
So much skepticism is not in place.
The mayors have acquired the entrepreneur D<0xC4><0x9B>dk, who would like to cooperate with you, maybe the people will win the wing of your beloved Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> <0xC4><0x8C>unk.
I don't think so.
The <0xC4><0x8C>SSD is led by Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Zaor<0xC3><0xA1>lek, who does not rule out a coalition with the UN, and V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Klaus ml., who will also not be against, may be deployed in the ODS.
I'd leave it to the voters.
The Deputy Prime Minister and Vice-President of YES Richard Brabec said that you have many points in common with SPD Tomia Okamura, for example in the area of economics.
So the Okamurians are considered a coalition partner?
Mr. Brabec says he didn't say it that way.
Mr. Okamura has his political history, he ran as V<0xC3><0xAD>t B<0xC3><0xA1>rta’s puppet for VV, then he got money from Dawn for his company, there was a coup.
He is, of course, a prominent personality.
Of course, it's a little brown.
If I take his program, it has a broad involvement of people in the management of society, direct democracy, one can agree with that.
I'm not asking you that at all.
I wonder if there is a person acceptable to you who has xenophobic views, speaks at demonstrations with smugglers and wants to leave the EU?
We don't think about cooperating with Mr. Okamura, I can't imagine.
Obviously, he went into politics to profit from it.
And what about the silent support of the Communists for your minority government?
I can't imagine it, but the voters will decide.
It will be about negotiating the winner with the other in the order, but God knows who will be the winner and who will be the duo.
Of course, it is important that they are able to agree on a coalition government program.
Let's go back to your drive to become a company.
But the government just has to obey, Prime Minister Sobotka let everything go, he never decided.
Coalition issues such as <0xC4><0x8C>EB or EGAP did not work.
After all, Sobotka is his doll, and I think that was also why he kicked me out.
Once he did, <0xC4><0x8C>EZ controlled the Czech government.
After all, it is unbelievable that the Prime Minister made a resolution written by the management of the Czech Republic, which instructs the Minister of Finance how to vote at the general meeting of the Czech Republic.
If you became Prime Minister, would you change the personal conditions of the Supervisory Board and change the top management of the Czech Republic?
Jesus, if I'm prime minister, I'll see you.
I'm not him yet.
It is rumored that <0xC4><0x8C>EZ has already sent signals to you.
Good cooperation with <0xC4><0x8C>SSD would like to be exchanged for even better with YES.
After the election, everything will go on again.
I don't know anything about it.
I don’t have a lobbyist or a lobbyist, I’m a separate unit and I don’t solve this at all.
Then answer me directly.
If you become the head of the government, will you seek to exchange the leadership of the Czech Republic, Czech Television or the General Health Insurance Company, the institutions that you are criticizing?
I would like the <0xC4><0x8C>EZ to be a transparent society.
For years, he's been doing what he wanted, and that's because I'm paying for traditional political parties.
All you have to do is look at Mr. Schwarzenberg's statements.
Although he has a majority state in the Czech Republic, he never managed it, he was only there in numbers, which is wrong.
It's a trivial matter to me.
<0xC4><0x8C>EZ is to take Dukovany, value them, put them into a subsidiary, arrange financing, make a supply competition or acquire a co-investor and build a new nuclear block.
The idea that the state is to finance and build new nuclear blocs is absurd.
What about Czech TV?
Some of her shows run a permanent campaign against me, but I don’t have and won’t have any competence to throw someone out.
But to control it, yes.
I don't want to control anyone.
I'm just saying that citizens pay about 7.2 billion per year for public broadcasting and television, but they don't actually know how these institutions operate.
How come they don't know?
After all, the House approves the report on their management, which has a direct impact on the positions of the Directors-General of the Czech Republic and the Czech Republic.
See how these reports are being discussed, on that super-powerful pact Sobotka Kalousek, which has always worked.
This applies both to the current parliamentary commission on leaks from investigative files and to lex Babi<0xC5><0xA1>.
And Sobotka was so stupid that he was pressured by Kalouske to kick me out of the government, which accounted for the top 09 percent, but the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD got them.
They are afraid of disrupting their corrupt system, and so they talk about endangering democracy by Babi<0xC5><0xA1>.
No one is immune.
What do you say to the articles describing how the first vice-president of ANO, Jaroslav Falt<0xC3><0xBD>nek, builds his power by appointing his son to the Supervisory Board of Tepl<0xC3><0xA1>ren Brno and arranges for the related lawyer Kv<0xC4><0x9B>toslav Hl<0xC3><0xAD>n?
We have a permanent dispute about this.
I don't like it, and I've read it to him several times.
Falt<0xC3><0xBD>nek argues that the aforementioned lawyer works at significantly lower rates and is reliable.
I wouldn't do that.
As Minister of Finance, I had no one.
We, unlike the Socans, have never had a corrupt affair, no Pelt, Kratochvil, B<0xC5><0x99>ezina.
If there was any sign of clientelism in our country, we immediately fired such a person.
I am uncompromising in this direction.
If something like this happens, we get rid of anyone, it doesn't matter who it is.
