What's going to happen? CSSD knows neither Voldemort nor confectionery in Prague.
The new CSSD elected to the capital city hall will apparently have to overcome a real language barrier in order to understand each other at the municipal council level with their old and new ODS colleagues.
The newspaper Actualne.cz "tested" the new members of the municipal council belonging to CSSD, namely whether they know the argot that was born in the last years in the town hall, when it was the partners of the current coalition that were leading in Prague.
The coded vocabulary that the political cream of Prague launched during the previous era of Mayor Pavel Bem describes some of the personalities, situations, and causes of the metropolis.
It is with surprise that it has been discovered that the newly elected do not quite understand the known terms.
At least they say so.
"Who is Valdemort?"
"I really don't know."
"I'm a young man in Prague politics," said Lukas Kaucky, the culture-elect on the test of the vocabulary of the "parran".
And as for the political veteran, the elected Karel Brezina reacted the same way.
For example, the meaning of "golf hole".
"It's the only expression you're proposing to me that I use."
Otherwise, I don't use the argot.
From the vocabulary, of which the daily Aktualne.cz published the expressions in June of this year before the pre-election congress of the ODS, the editors selected 6 examples, primarily those that are related to the city hall of Prague.
The Socialists had to explain the meaning of "Voldemort", "the largest golf hole in Prague", go to the patisserie", "beef nerve", "treachery of the capital" and "ent<0xC3><0xB3>ler".
Three of the electors agreed for the quiz, the fourth- Antonin Weinert, who is to lead the education in Prague in the future - first promised an interview but then did not pick up the phone.
The fifth elected Petr Dolinek squarely refused the test.
"I don't care at all about these things there and how the representatives of civil democracy are having fun: I won't give my opinion."
"I'm currently dealing with how we're going to understand each other as part of our programs," he said.
As has already been heard, the elected Lukas Kaucky would not apparently recognize in the above legend, that it is Janousek's influence on the entrepreneurs and friends of the former mayor Roman Bem.
"Voldemort" does not say anything to Kaucky and the only expression he guessed in the test is "the biggest golf hole in Prague".
“It’s the Blanka Tunnel,” says Kaucky, and immediately adds, “but I know from the newspapers.”
“I’m going to have to pay for a language course,” he joked.
Not only the matador Karel Brezina but also Lukas Plachy, elected for the environment, know that the golf hole is the Blanko tunnel.
The two Social Democrats know who Voldemort really is and Lukas Plachy knows where to find the character - he thinks in the sense of "go to the patisserie".
“It’s about, I think, going into a business,” Plachy is ready to guess that this is the headquarters of Janousek companies.
In the same tone, Brezina recalls that he draws his knowledge from the newspapers rather than from any vocabulary he would use.
According to test candidates, there is no jargon lexicon in social democracy.
“I took advice from colleagues and it turns out we really don’t have anything like that.”
“We say names are sometimes used with abbreviations and symbols,” said Peter Hlinsky, president of the Social Democratic Party, which members of the Party call Hulda.
“I was called Briza at school but I don’t know if my colleagues call me that,” says Karel Brezina.
The daily News.cz has tested the name and it works.
The elected Weinert is Papy for party members or the least friendly Petit vieux, the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to him before the elections by the scams during the party sponsorship, is nicknamed "the little joke".
Surnames are also the only ones that allow social democrats to use within the party.
It seems that Hulinsky does not like to hear Hulda much, but the daily Akutel.cz recorded another nickname for this Prague president.
"Doctor in mattress law" it seems that Petr Hulinsky obtained his title of doctor in law at the police academy of bratislava.
The government wants to reduce the torture of “witches,” a brochure has been published.
In Burkina Faso, women declared witches have common traits.
They are part of the older generation, they cannot work for health reasons, they are free and have no children.
The one who becomes a “witch” is isolated so as not to threaten the rest of the village.
“Man rarely has that fate.”
“We also do not judge healthy young women because they participate in work and give birth to children,” says a sister in the West African capital, Burkina Faso, in a special institution of more than 100 women who have been rejected by the society.
The local government has decided to intervene against this unusual "social measure".
He published a brochure that should help limit the hunt for witches.
The case involves a "hic".
“More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso do not know how to read,” Die Standard newspaper warned about the drawback of written education.
Accusations of witchcraft are common in other African countries.
In Ghana, neighbouring Burkina Faso, Ammy Hemma, a 72-year-old woman died after being tortured by three women and a man and then burned with oil they had splashed on her.
It was the BBC server that transmitted this information.
The criminals say it was the wrong eye.
According to their version, the oil that serves ritual onions was inflamed in the contact of the woman.
The oil flared, it seems, when the team wanted to "cast out the bad spirit" of the woman.
The isolation of "witches" is approved by people of all levels of education.
The daily Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: “Human mind-eaters have always represented a danger,” he says.
While Burkina Faso is trying to reduce the witch hunt, the Gambia did not see the President himself participating in it any later than last year.
Gambian President Dzammi, after the death of his aunt, launched a wide-ranging witch hunt that, it seems, would have participated in his death and would have been forced by black magic to kill the President as well.
“Shamans from nearby Guinea who came to the rescue brought to the presidential farm in Kanilai, under the protection of police and the personal guard of the President, randomly chosen men and women in villages in the Gambia,” Amnesty International said in a statement.
On the farm, prisoners had to drink a plant-based potion with hallucinogenic effects that in addition to other effects on the kidneys and intestines.
Two inmates did not survive.
Under international pressure, about a thousand people were released.
The tenant of Bakal: The poolets are warming, he signed a higher rent.
An imposing old man came out by the door of the customer center of the company RPG Byty of the "baron of coal" Zdenek Bakal, the largest private owner of apartments for rent in the Czech Republic.
He was carrying a file with three new leases for three apartments: his own, his daughter’s, and his son’s, who is serving a sentence.
The deregulation has increased rent for these three people.
Instead of paying 3500 the son will have to pay from next year for an apartment 2<0x2B>1 second category 4100 crowns.
"And there is no hot water and the heating works on solid fuel," the man who has the power to sign shows with the finger on his son's new contract.
"But I signed anyway," he explains in anger and half resigned.
The citizen association of apartments BytyOKD.cz, which described the new rental conditions as "immoral and indecent", advises tenants not to sign and wait until December 7, when a notice will be published to explain the method to be followed to claim.
But man reacts to this by a hand gesture.
"One says this, the other says something else," frowning his eyebrows.
The Ostrava region becomes the laboratory of deregulation.
After the New Year, this is what most apartments in the Czech Republic expect, the rents of which do not correspond to the market price.
Aktualne.cz has therefore decided to visit the "laboratory" personally.
The RPG waiting room in Havirovska street is one of four in the Ostrava region and it is already full on Tuesday at 9 a.m.
Right next to the door stands a security guard with a device to call customers.
A special button, "lease 2011", is lit on the touch screen.
One print and one paper with a number comes out of the device.
You don't have time to read your number "157" as your number already starts to light up on the big screen under the hood of the waiting room.
In a fraction of a second, it's your turn.
After a short moment, an old couple arrives to inquire about the rent, but the new rents do not seem to concern people in the waiting room.
The majority of people have come to solve common problems like everywhere - demand for repairs, insurance events, and more.
In the Ostrava region, people from more than 44,000 apartments in the RPG portfolio have been picking up mail with new leases in their mailbox since around mid-November.
RPG Byty offers them rent increases of 15 to 38 percent.
The special shop for new rentals has been open to the public since 18 November.
"it's been running for almost a week, so it's still on trial" answers, after a moment of hesitation, the employee behind the counter when the client presents himself as a journalist.
The deragulation and the former minor apartments of Bakal are a very sensitive local subject.
The vice-president of the parliament and native of the region of Ostrava Lubomir Zaoralek of the Social Democrats made a fairly supportive statement before the elections and this now fills the local newspapers.
"Twenty years after them, I want a new floor."
"They didn't even change a put...n board in the toilets, relieves in introduction the man mentioned.
However, it is mostly, according to employees, retirees who come to be sure that they will receive a refund on the new rental price if they now sign as promised by RPG in a special offer.
This is a refund of half the amount of the rent that will be received by the other tenants who will have signed their new contract before December 15.
But the "deregulation" counter of Havirovaska street is really not overwhelmed by questions.
“Among the 360 customers who came yesterday, only 40 to 50 came to rent it,” the employee said.
And yet RPG promotes both on its website and in the showcases of individual rental interviews when needed.
If both parties do not agree on the rent, it is an independent court that will make the decision.
“It’s not about threats, it’s just about informing about the unique and legitimate way to act legally,” RPG said on its website.
"Nobody's going to court here," thinks one of Byty's RPG employees, and the man in the street in front of the customer center gives him reason.
“I have 13,000 crowns and I have 5,000 crowns left to eat, I don’t have enough to go to court,” he said.
The employee suddenly feels uneasy.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaoralek in the media asks that no one sign and therefore people wait," she said.
Rent regulation ends in the Czech Republic at the beginning of 2011 and increases, according to RPG Byty, are an economic necessity.
"And, moreover, the current rents still do not reach the necessary level for the simple maintenance of the housing fund," recalls Pavel Klimes, director of the residential portfolio of RPG Byty, that it is precisely the negligence of the housing fund that makes the tenant angry.
However, in 5 years between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able to invest with rents in 4 billion apartments, in four years from 2011 to 2014 this is expected to be 5.2 billion.
The large screen hung on the ceiling in front of the upholstered armchairs in the waiting room of Havirosvka Street, however, repeats some information indicated in red.
“The rent increase in 2011 is 15 percent and concerns no less than 31,200 apartments, or more than 90 percent of RPG apartments.”
"And it will always be a maximum of 7.50 Czech crowns per m2 per month," the screen says.
The 38 percent increase concerns only 400 apartments in the RPG portfolio.
"In these cases, this is an increase of a really very low amount of CZK 19.66 per m2," adds RPG.
Next year the rent will remain the same for 2600 apartments.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not cause a radical but gradual increase over 4 to 8 years.
It adds other commitments: all the money from the increase in rents (see the graph) is returned to the apartments in the form of heating savings - new windows and heating.
Those who sign the agreement on the increase in rent have priority.
The kindergarten is also part of the offices that included the architects.
the administrative building Avriopoint in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch. Design.
No one could have expected that it would also house a mini kindergarten with everything needed - colored walls, imaginative furniture, toys and finally a miniature playground on the terrace.
Since October last year, the children of Arch. design employees can go there.
The architectural-project company Arch. Design. whose workshops have produced a large number of constructions in Brno, has imagined its mini-business school since the first drafts of the Avriopoint building.
She employs about 90 people, mostly of childbearing age, and she cared that women architects and project managers could quickly get back to work.
At the same time as reduced-time employment contracts, the kindergarten is a bonus offered to its employees by the company Arch. Design. as part of its social program.
Builders and architects thus have the opportunity to combine a work that takes care of children.
It was the employees of Arch.Design. themselves who conceived this kindergarten and with the support of the management they were able to obtain a qualification from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The mini kindergarten is financed by the European Social Fund through the Operational Human Resources Programme and the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
They were able to purchase equipment and equipment and after two years they were able to provide qualified staff and get started thanks to funding grants (up to CZK 2.8 million).
After the use of the funding endowment (two years) the company Arch. Design. has the obligation after 3 years to run the mini kindergarten on its own funds.
The preparation of the project lasted one year and it was the Economy rating company that helped to make the application for endowment.
Children's care is provided by qualified staff, a nurse and a kindergarten teacher take care of the children throughout the day. children can go to kindergarten without age limitation but they have more than three years for most.
As it is a "mini kindergarten" there can be only 5 children present at the same time, but during the day there are more who replace themselves.
The functioning of the school is flexible according to the needs of the parents and the children of all employees have the same right to use this school regardless of the hierarchical position.
Although it is an individual care and education, the mini kindergarten program is comparable to the one for preschool education.
Children do not just play there, but quality teaching is also ensured - from the beginning to the preparation to the school benches, English is taught.
The class is equipped not only with imaginative toys and games but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children in society creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can control their child at any time and not have the stress of a delay in going to pick up the children in a school away from the parent’s workplace.
Parents use their working time in the most productive way.
It is not surprising that there is a natural relationship of loyalty between the employee and the employer.
Arch.Design.s is thus registered among companies that offer a bonus of choice for the recruitment of new employees and are family-friendly and through this program strengthens HR marketing.
The bone house still fascinates after 100 years. Take a look at Gaudi’s interiors.
The toe resembles the back of a prehistoric saurian, the staircase to a dinosaur spine, and the balconies to open fish mouths.
This is the Casa Battlo house in Barcelona by the architect Antoni Gaudi.
Due to its organic forms, the house received the nickname Maison en bon from the locals.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stones, fragments of tiles and mosaic, fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade reminiscent of scales and everywhere present of curves, this is all that is typical for Art Nouveau by Antoni Gaudi.
The front facade of the house unfolds its dream lines, its pleasant colors and textures reminiscent of nature and animals.
In the course of a more detailed observation we see the geometry, the rhythm and the order thought accurately.
At night the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade of the house becomes even more dramatic and is lit in such a way that the impression of brilliance of colors is reinforced.
The winding and twisting of the shapes also appears in the interiors with the same measure.
The wood in waves copies the window frames, balustrades, decorative elements of the doors, the eyeliner and the slats.
The Battlo house that stands in the Eixample district in the shopping street Passeig de Gracia at number 43, was born from the construction of an 1877 house by the architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
The reconstruction took place for two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, Joseph Battlo, a wealthy entrepreneur, first insisted on the demolition of the old construction and the construction of another all-new but quickly accepted Gaudi's idea of an unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
But the idea of Casa Battlo as a multi-apartment house was not thought by Gaudi alone.
The architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him.
It was precisely on his project that the decorations for an apartment representing the owner of the building and the use of the mosaic for the facade were born.
For the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade also worked other artists and creators.
The joint work on the plans of Casa Battlo began with a successful cooperation between Jujol and Gaudi.
Jujol participated in the construction of Gaudi's Casa Mila house and Guell Park in which there are other works of Gaudi.
The locals nicknamed the house hot just after its finish because of its organic shapes "the House in Bone".
Others, in view of the specific mechanism of opening the windows, called it "the down house".
It is said that at the top of the construction there is a sword similar to that of Saint George the patron of Catalonia.
Other sculptural elements of the construction contain hidden religious motifs.
Gaudi thought for the house a unique system in its central heating time, with typical ventilation vents and chimneys.
Their 45-degree inclination seems odd.
During the creation Gaudi absolutely did not comply with the construction guidelines of then and did not let himself be hindered by them.
At the beginning of the construction he obtained from the city the permit to build, knowing, of course, that the data carried on the reconstruction plans were so vague that two years later during the completion the municipal council was horrified and demanded modifications.
It did not please, for example, the members of the municipal council that the pillars of the construction are imbedded on the public sidewalk.
There was never a change, but, on the contrary, only 15 days after the call of the city Josep Battlo requested (and obtained satisfaction) permission to rent the two higher floors.
The owner moved to the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a common living room and on the third one a bedroom and a private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewellery store.
The entire six-storey house is shared by a staircase through which one accesses to an independent roof terrace.
All right angles and straight lines were cancelled by the basic elements of the reconstruction and replaced by curved walls.
Gaudi also worked on the modern concept of connecting spaces.
The common part can be completely connected by opening the salon doors and the high society can communicate comfortably or limit itself to private space for more intimate interviews.
The house with the reconstruction of Gaudi received in addition to new facades a non-traditional toy and two additional floors.
Gaudi’s play with light is also impressive, blue and white glass tiles with which the interior courtyard is decorated and with light wells.
The two-color game gives maximum light on all floors of the house.
It was simply enough to bet on the principle that white reflects more than the dark which, on the contrary, absorbs the rays of the sun.
The Casa Battlo house that was registered in 2005 in the UNESCO World Heritage Fund may be visited by everyone.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and the most beautiful apartment accessible to the public.
The owners decided to take this step in 2002 on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
They continued the visits because they found it to be a lucrative enterprise and they expanded the field of visits to the common areas and the attic including the terraces of toi.
The entrance ticket to the monument is really inexpensive and costs 16.50 euros; students, retirees, groups and tourist card holders have 20 percent discount.
The sum is still above the entry price in Gaudi's other buildings in the city.
If you want to feel the real atmosphere of the house with its fantastic turrets, you must quickly find a comrade among the inhabitants of the building and visit the house completely.
How to choose a mattress and a sombrero: women have other criteria than men.
No ostentatious frame, but rather the quality of the surface reserved for the bed, so the mattress and the attic give a real basis for a good bed.
They must of course complement each other harmoniously to please a concrete user.
During the choice several things are decisive,: weight, size, age, health status as well as the sex of the owner.
The type of interior in which you will place the mattress and the upper is also important.
A typical example?
For example, in the country house where you do not sleep continuously latex mattresses are not appropriate because they "warm up" gently.
They also have a higher weight than standard polyurethane mattresses.
It is necessary to return them frequently.
If they also do not have enough ventilation channels at the heart and if they remain, in addition, on a solid board, they retain moisture. Mould can also form there.
Habit is also decisive in the choice.
Anyone who spends the clear of time abroad where very thick mattresses are often used with a softening layer will hardly feel good on a low and hard surface.
“That’s how all the hockey players coming back from the NHL complain that they can’t sleep there.”
"For their tired shoulders, feet and ribs, they needed mattresses with a rolling layer of lazy foam."
“Such mattresses are also recommended for people suffering from diabetes who have a nervous system disorder that therefore poorly assumes “information” of the joints and skin,” says Sylva Adamczikova, who specializes in upholstered furniture.
That is why a few years ago the mattress with lazy foam conquered the hockey players as well as other customers.
"Today everything is going well, Tempur, the Italian Magnifex, but also the Czech Tropico, for example, have appropriate mattresses.
You don't need to be an NHL guy to enjoy a lazy foam.
This “miracle” simply works.
It optimises its rigidity and shape depending on the heat absorbed or adapts to the heat of your body.
Nothing puts pressure on you and you won’t come back in the night like after a tough game.
You're just sleeping better.
The muddy foam also acts as a protection against squaring.
To choose the mattress according to your size, add the length of the feet, or about 21/34 cm.
A man and a woman with a size of 180cm need a bed of 210/220cm.
The minimum width for each two-seater bed should be 90 cm or 180 cm in total.
For single beds, for example, singles, it is recommended to take at least 120 /140 cm.
It is convenient in case of visit.
'However, it is a simple rule for the width of the bed: when you are lying on your back you should put your hands comfortably with the elbows slightly folded. Helena Prokopova, President of the Association of Bourreliers-Matlassiers and decorators in a special 'similein' and decorators in the 'similein' of it's problems for several years.
For a two-seater bed each needs its own attic and mattress, so be careful during the ach<0xC3><0xA2>teau to choose the height of the mattress well.
Otherwise, you will only have to climb the attic at different heights and this is not possible on all bed frames.
Foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, spring mattresses at least 15 cm, of which count for the layer of shape and ventilation at least three centimeters.
"Touching or sitting on the mattress should not feel the springs," Helena Prokopova warns.
Each mattress requires a well-defined type of somium.
The summer bed, when the mattress and the summer bed are united like Siamese sisters, has nothing to do in the bedrooms.
The mattresses went very poorly; one should not wash it, which is commonly done today.
And since during the night you usually sweat from 0.2 to 0.75 l of sweat it is clear that after 5/7 years, the mattress begins to resemble a large (and clogged) sieve.
For this reason, specialists refuse to make a claim for a lifespan of 25 years for a mattress or a lifetime warranty.
But it's all for his own good.
And for this an experience advice from the sellers: for a mattress of 120/140cm, give up, for the mattress coating, hygiene or washing but rather add a protective mattress that you can easily remove and wash.
And even if today it is common to make zip-closed coatings for the whole set, that is, after opening you have two parts (for washing and the size of the washing machine it is very important!) otherwise the handling for the big models is very important.
Do you have a hard board in your bed instead of a bedside table?
Never, never!
Maximum for one bed intended for visitors for one night only.
However, equip the board (if there are none) with ventilation holes and use the spring mattress with a minimum height of 15cm with bag springs (from Taschenfederken Germany) and an ventilation layer.
A polyurethane mattress should not be part of a bed of this type.
For single-position lamella mattresses with 14/18 lamellas, latex mattresses or so-called sandwiches (perhaps the combination of latex and coconut), are ideal but it will always be better for you to have a mattress with more lamellas, 28 and above, where the lamellas are doubled in the bass part.
For multi-position mattresses, do not take spring mattresses because it does not respond to changes in position.
In addition to adjusting the rigidity of the blades, what is called a shoulder cradle can also be installed.
This is a special binding of the lamellas that allows to press or even tilt the lamella so that the shoulder of the dormant "integrates" well.
For men who have “shoulders as wide as their back,” it’s really an important thing.
This thing is already considered by the manufacturers of mattresses who for the "males" have started to use a softening area at the level of the shoulders.
But they also think of women - they once again offer them a softer surface at the hips.
For the most difficult customer there are wing or plate sockets with what is called a multi-force suspension.
The pressure dissipates into more points and diminates the voltage.
But of course, be careful, as soon as you use a bad pillow (large and bloated air) on good mattresses and sommier, the "plus" disappears.
The basic rule is a very simple pillow: the pillow should support the head and its tips should only reach the shoulders, so that the shoulder muscles can rest.
The recommended size is 50X60 cm which the Scandinavians prefer by example.
When lying down on the side, the pillow should level (with the shoulder cradle or the cramped area in the mattress) the height of the shoulders.
Modern mattresses still have something in common with straw and grass-based mattresses.
Manufacturers still use natural materials or mixtures.
The trend is also in organic mattresses.
The petroleum-based raw materials from which polyurethane is produced are replaced by natural oils, such as soybean oil.
Almost all known manufacturers use soybeans.
“The Bio qualifier for mattresses means that the heart is made from natural products,” explains Petr vasiek of Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used for mattress coatings; one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can add microcapsules that develop scent of forest or lavender.
There are differences between a man and a woman.
While extracting birch plants so that the coating of the mattress absorbs heat and cools the body, "cools" the man, the coatings "warms" the women.
Red pepper extract speeds up blood circulation and is therefore warmer for low sex.
The current favorites?
Mattresses made from cold foam (it has more pores with a disturbed cell structure so more breathable than standard polyurethane and has more elasticity.
The combination of different stiffnesses of cold foams gives polyzone mattresses that know exactly where the head, lower back and feet are located.
You will pay a quality mattress from 7000 kroner and more.
Those who are characterized by their health parameters have less VAT and are taken as instruments for health.
In the Czech Republic, Gumotex reached the first place.
Saving for the mattress and the top is not easy.
From time to time, there may be two mattresses for the price of one as part of special actions by manufacturers or producers.
For example, the company Magniflex that offers Duofreeze mattresses with Memory foam sewn to the coating for 11990 crowns.
Of course, you can take the second one for free.
The era of viscous or viscoelastic foams with an open cell structure and a large thickness was begun with the Tempur material at a "cosmic" rhythm.
This began as a matter for NASA because astronauts were suffering from the start of huge load factors.
The Tempur crumbles in the heat and hardens, on the contrary, in the cold.
It therefore perfectly adapts to the warm human body and distributes optimal pressure to it.
It is ideal for this against poor sleep and for an increase in comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses but also for health products, such as special foot cushions that relieve the legs and venous system.
For example, Czech manufacturers use EucathermC or Twinsaver foam or the same type.
Devices to track people are increasingly in demand by parents who want to monitor their children.
Fear for their child is causing more and more people to think about monitoring them through a GPS.
The system, set up at the beginning to search for cars, can also be used to trace the movement of people and help in some cases such as that of little Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is currently as big as a box of lights but will soon be the size of a watch.
The case of little Anicka has touched a large number of people and they have started looking for ways to better protect their children.
Even if the price is to disturb their privacy.
“We’re trying to tell everyone that this is not a spy but just another way to reduce the likelihood of another tragedy,” said Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the leading providers of tracking devices in the Czech market.
"I admit that there may be cases of misuse of such devices, such as putting it in the bag of a person who is not aware, but I have not yet encountered such cases."
“The majority of people are customers who actually buy the product for safety reasons,” adds Pilin.
According to him, children should always know for what purposes "the box" is used and how to use it in an emergency.
Child psychologist, Dana Bockova, draws attention that if the child does not want to wear something like this on him, he will get rid of it.
“And even the smallest can show great creativity when it comes to getting rid of something when they don’t want to be under control.”
“Mobile phones, which can cut off like these tracking devices, have already brought parents to long expectations,” says Bockova.
According to her, the fact that this type of device can help in the event of aggression is very questionable.
“If it’s a pre-prepared kidnapping, the author will do everything to make sure the child doesn’t have an electronic device that can locate it.”
“Currently, it’s the phone.”
“As soon as the tracking devices are developed, they will be looking for them as well because the sale will be supported by an advertising campaign.”
“In such cases, criminals will always be ahead of the police,” the psychologist said.
She admits, however, that such devices can help with an assault unprepared by a paedophile.
According to Robert Cech of the company RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both cars and people, says having this type of device can help, even if it is destroyed in the event of an attack.
"The device can be set in such a way that it is in regular emission after a certain period of time."
"In the event that the device is destroyed, it remains the last position of the person concerned."
“The more expensive devices also have an inclinometer that immediately signals the position of the person who slipped and is in the elongated position without moving,” says Cech.
According to him, so-called smartphones that are equipped with a navigation system, can offer a comparable service after formatting it with a special prologue.
The problem with current tracking systems is that it is either a device similar to those worn in pendant the size of a lighter box or to the smallest telephone devices.
We can always lose them.
According to Pilina of the company Macro Weil, that is why tests are currently being carried out to make devices that look like common digital watches.
"This will have the advantage that the potential attacker will not be able to recognize the tracking device."
"Or he'll realize it after a while, which will have given the police a little more time," he added.
Whether the tracking device is developed in the form of a bracelet or pendant, it will always use the same technology as for car tracking.
It is a combination of position acquisition systems using GPS (which is commonly used in self-navigation) and a function of a mobile phone that alerts the current position of a vehicle.
The army has so many detonating ropes that it could tour the Czech Republic with, but it can only last two years.
The army bought for 445 km of ropes used for explosives.
Last year, the Ministry of Defence bought 224 km.
The army has reserves for 225 years.
The problem is that the lifespan of the cords is a maximum of two to four years.
The military bought detonating cords from the STV Group for 40 million crowns.
The General Staff has given as a reason the ach<0xC3><0xA2>t of a huge amount of detonating ropes to MF DNES that soldiers use 60 km per year.
According to the reserve calculations to be held by the army pyrotechnicians, which MF DNES contacted, it appears that even generals, officers with command, secretaries or household staff should have an explosives exercise every year.
Alexandre Vondra, Minister of Defence and Vlastimil Picek, Commander of the Army are no exception.
Only to argue the annual consumption of the army of 60 km of detonating ropes.
This distance corresponds to 25,000 explosions.
And even if it were true, the army's reserves could subsidize it for 10 years.
If, on the contrary, it would be true that for the basic training of each of the new professionals, more than 2 m of detonating cords, as experts say, it means that the army with its new purchase has secured - with the consumption of special units and engineering - reserves for the 225 years.
However, the soldiers of the rapid intervention brigade recently complained to Minister Vondra that they barely have ammunition for their handguns and that shooting sessions are limited due to the need for money.
We are not talking about the lack of clothing.
"And I don't mind if they buy such a large amount of detonating ropes from us."
"And it's their decision and they really know what they're doing."
“For us the army is a good customer that we as merchants strive to please,” said Jan Decky, STV Group’s chief commercial officer.
Jan Pejsek, a spokesman for the Ministry of Defense, argues the ach<0xC3><0xA2>t of hundreds of kilometers of detonating ropes by the fact that the army will have these "munitions" in reserve for 10 years.
However, Jan Decky of STV Group reports only four years of life span of detonating ropes and police and army pyrotechnics of only two years.
“If they are perfectly stored in the depots, it can go up to four years,” says one of the two who doesn’t want his name to be published in light of criticism from the army.
The lifespan passed, each ammunition must be tested to see if it remains intact and does not threaten the life of the soldier.
However, these tests are not free and still cost money.
The other argument of the ministry is a reduction due to the quantity for 445 km of detonating cords.
"They cost us 60 percent less than last year's supply of 245 km," said Pejsek, a spokesman for the defense ministry's buyers.
Only to compare: the annual consumption of the detonating cords of the police pyrotechnics who neutralize the ammunition of the Second World War or those after the Soviet army, does not exceed 1500 meters.
And the police still only order the necessary amount of ammunition to be used before the end of their lifespan.
This has been established for safety reasons of pyrotechnics and in addition to being able to more flexibly obtain more modern and reliable types of detonating cords.
The Ministry of Defence today has major problems for the neutralization of dozens of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Pact when the Czechoslovak army of two hundred thousand men was preparing to move, heading for the Rhine.
What awaits in a few years this Czech army that MF DNES has contacted: neutralize hundreds of kilometers of old detonating cords that it buys today "cheaply".
To this day I benefit from the contacts that I have gained through the contests.
The franchise sale of his hotel has helped Lukas Pytloun well for the place of winner of the competition of the best individual entrepreneur.
The winner of the competition for the best individual entrepreneur for last year was Lukas Pytloun, 28-year-old entrepreneur.
Her adventure to success is like in a movie.
Lukas Pytloun loved to travel.
And abroad, he realized that in Liberia there was a lack of a quality accommodation site at a reasonable price.
From his savings on what he had earned while working abroad and with the help of a bank loan he bought a small building of 5 semi-demolition apartments.
Knowing that he was still a student in his third year of graduate studies, it was a courageous action.
“The relationship between quality and price of accommodation in our area has made me want to do something,” says Lucas Pytloun.
He began renting the first apartment rebuilt to foreign workers.
He reinvests the profit in the building that he transformed into a pension with 54 beds.
Since then, his entrepreneurial action has allowed him to open in Libérec 4 guesthouses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of almost 300 beds of all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of them was until very recently the four-star Pytloun design hotel.
This year, he received another of the same quality.
“We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrova U Tise where we sold our franchise concept and other candidates to the Pytloun hotel franchise have manifested themselves,” the number 1 entrepreneurs last year.
"And for the sale of the license for the operation of a large-scale hotel the victory in the Entrepreneur of the Year competition served well," Pytloun adds with appreciation.
The victory brought him more popularity and to be known in Liberia and its surroundings.
“People recognized me in the streets, congratulated me often and, I have to say, it was very nice,” he recalls.
He recommends participation in this contest to all those who are striving to do something.
It is not necessary to win but any opportunity to be visible is good.
He says he still uses his contacts and knowledge that he could not have obtained in any other way.
“With those I met through the contest, I started to maintain business relationships on a regular basis.
According to him, the reputation associated with success has also had an impact on employees.
And he has about 70.
“I see in their homes the loyalty and pride of being committed to something that has been generally recognized.”
“This is not, and by far, the only result of my personal work, but the result of a good work of all of us together.
“Only my name is pushed forward,” says Lucas Pytloun modestly.
I wish my successor a better year than the one we had at Farmet.
The euphoria of victory was quickly replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the winner’s goal, Farmet has the worst moments behind him.
The one who came to Slovansky for the first place of the competition for the Firm of the Year organized by Vodaphone last year is Karel Zdarsky the owner of the company Farmet.
The jury rewarded the efforts with which it transformed a tool shop in Ceska Skalice into a firm with a turnover of 100 million kroner.
“I can say that the award has not only encouraged me and my employees and increased our self-confidence to fight against competition,” said the winner of last year’s competition.
At the beginning of the history of the Farmet company there was a desire to do something useful.
And so when the state proposed to Karel Zdrasky's father to rent the small workshop as compensation after the confiscation of property by the Communists, he did not hesitate for long, refused a career in a firm where he worked in plaster at the time, and created a company with a few comrades in his surroundings.
Not very long after they began to specialize in presses for vegetable oil.
It became after eighteen years the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
The company was known even to the non-specialized public after the success achieved in the competition through the media.
“Not only have our customers started to really get to know the Farmet brand better, but also the foreign partners who started to realize that they were collaborating with a company that achieved the greatest success in their home country,” says Karel Zdarsky.
But the past year did not happen to Farmet only in the euphoria of victory.
The company's assessment was based on the economic results of 2008 and in part on 2009.
And it was 2009 that was the most difficult year for the sale of engineering machines.
At the height of the crisis, which did not really affect the citizens, companies were forced to stop their investment projects and start limiting their peaks with new materials and technologies.
“We have not escaped this situation, of course.”
“The turnover has fallen by 40 percent, and we have to limit our production and even lay off,” explains Karel Zdarsky.
A viable society must know that unpopular measures must be taken from time to time.
But they managed the situation properly and maintained beneficial results even if they were inferior to those they had before the crisis.
However, at Farmet, they continued uncompromisingly to invest in research and development.
“We built with the grants a training and research center, strengthened the company’s presentation in international exhibitions and won the main awards in national exhibitions,” Zdarsky says.
Everything makes us think that the crisis is behind them.
The numbers of affixes go up and with them the number of employees as well.
“To the new winner I wish this pleasant feeling of victory but in a calm atmosphere,” says Karel Zdarsky.
The investigation that removes senseless regulations.
The Absurdity of the Year investigation is a part of the business clan for the fourth time.
Some absurd regulations may have been removed.
The less glorious winner of this year’s Absurdity Survey of the Year was the obligation to bring in the offices documents that officials can get online.
More than a third of the 4,000 voters voted for it.
For example, the social affairs administration requested a paper extract from the trade register while the grievor can get it in two mouse clicks.
It changes thanks to the investigation.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer ask for an extract from the trade register for insurance payment checks," said Jana Buranova, spokeswoman for the Czech Social Insurance Administration (CSSZ).
To make clear all the regulations and decrees that companies and entrepreneurs must fulfill in the Czech Republic and to have those that are absurd is the meaning of this contest of the Absurdity of the Year.
This survey is again this year for the fourth time a part of the business clan organized by Hospodarske noviny and still has a greater popularity.
If last year 3,000 voters showed up, it was at least 4,000 this year who brought their vote.
And this is not surprising, there are in our country the most diverse legal obligations that only slow down the company, and, this, more and more.
“Perhaps we are in the number of documents to fill out for top-ranked tax returns in the world,” says Karel Havlicek of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
The simplification of entrepreneurial activity has become a proclaimed goal of all governments in recent years.
Compared to the rest of the world, the situation in the Czech Republic is not improving at all.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic is in 74th place in terms of conditions for the company, which is 8 places more than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year Contest was established for the first time in 2006 and continues each year according to the same scenario.
Anyone can report every year the administrative and bureaucratic absurdities from April to the end of September, the last deadline before the end of the contest.
To account there is the website www.firmaroku.cz. Then the organizer of the contest chooses seven candidates for "anti-price" and lets the public vote during the month of October on the website www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and on www.ihned.cz.
The Absurdity that received the most votes is declared winner.
Until last year's last survey, it was about a hundred, or more exactly 105 regulations and decrees that have lost their sense of existence.
The comments are sent by entrepreneurs but also by trade unions and teachers.
Among the "finalists" of the competition, for example, among the nominees is the obligation that motorway and expressway maintenance vehicles pay tolls, or that contractors with 20 employees repaint two offices and two toilets every two years.
The list of the seven proposals is published on the competition website.
The announcement of the contest, which always begins in early November on Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of an event in which political and public figures regularly take part.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodova, director of the Association for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises of the Czech Republic, or Petr Kuzel, president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, attended the climax of the competition.
“Economic prosperity cannot work when the state puts eels in the legs of entrepreneurs and for that reason my goal is to remove, every year, at least three dozen paragraphs that today only complicate the business,” said Martin Kocourek, the Minister of Industry and Commerce.
Effort to remove absurd decrees is not a sword in the water.
In 2007, what people didn't like was the entrepreneurs' obligation to report three days in advance to the office for the individual company at the location of the company, intending to go to an exhibition or pilgrimage with a stand.
This obligation was abolished with the amendment of the Individual Business Act.
The second most-pleased obligation in 2007, which was to declare to the Bureau of Labor a 30-day service trip for a foreign employee, was removed with the text of the Green Card Act.
And everything is okay until the third session of the contest.
The Absurdity of the Year 2009 was the decree for physiotherapists to have a large mirror in their cabinet, a refrigerator and two automatic scales.
This was changed by order of the Ministry of Health last year-the obligation to have a refrigerator was removed.
A new category rewards socially responsible firms.
Ecological, humanitarian, training and sporting projects are evaluated.
The novelty of this year’s Hospodarske Noviny competition, which already exists for 5 years, is the category called the Responsible Firm of the year 2010.
The aim of this competition is to support the company reasonably and fairly.
“We want to support companies that monitor their business’ environmental impacts and conduct a socially responsible business,” said Patrick Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile operator, Vodaphone, who is the guarantor and promoter of this competition year, as in the case of the contest for the rebel.
For this first year of this sub-category of the company competition of the year 2010, organized by the company Vodaphone, registered companies that have not been successful with a single long-term objective for the company.
The adventure of each of them is full of inspiration and an independent article would be to edit.
Although the object of their business is different from each other, their support and forecasting activity can be considered the denominator of their efforts.
In one case, this concerns persons with disabilities and the personal or health problems of their employees.
Among the fourteen finalists for the whole Czech Republic is not an example of the Prague Et Netera prologiels company which supports the creation of informal sports teams of their employees who then participate in numerous tournaments in different sports disciplines.
Another example of a firm responsible for the Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo, which for 17 years has been the main contributor to the endowment fund that sponsors children with disabilities.
The old Podebrad paper manufacturing plant, which employs more than 70 per cent, was named the company responsible for the Central Bohemia region and was the third largest in the region in the competition for the Fir.
In Olomouc, it is MiRyz Soft, a financial company, that has won for introducing smooth working hours and even reduced up to 35 hours per week on average and, this, without, proportionally, reduction in wages.
The jury also awarded her the title because she prefers Czech manufacturers, supports a local activity in the vicinity and cares about the environment.
“We are trying to recycle as much as possible so that our business and administration have the least impact on the environment,” says Miluse Ryznarova, the company’s executive director.
the company responsible IT Enlogit of the Region of Usti also thinks about the health of its employees and has set them up for each laptop an ergonomic chair and keyboard, encourages their work at home and uses the catering services of a local protected plant for its actions.
"We also support the Human in the Shadow Foundation that helps the local Roma community," said Ondrej Suchy, the society's representative.
At the very last rank is, also for its activities, a company of Laundry and Cleaning of the Karlovy Vary region, which participates in the retirement insurance of its employees in the form of bonuses above the standards.
“In our company we contribute to food, transportation, increasing qualifications and leisure activities,” says Joseph Strapac of the Bruntal Czasch construction company, winner for the Moravian-Silesian region.
All regional finalists for the Vodaphone Firm of the Year competition were automatically enrolled in the Responsible Company category, who had responded to the enclosed questionnaires for registration and sent it back to the organizer before August 15.
The incomplete or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were removed from the contest by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the competing firms had not answered the questions, they could not participate in the contest of the Responsible firm but were not disqualified from the "main" contest of Vodaphone's Firm of the Year."
“Independent registrations are not possible because this is a sub-category of the main competition of the Firm of the Year,” explains Karel Goldman of the organising agency Bison&Rose.
At the Lands Fund in Plzen, police made arrests during a public contest
In the building of the Lands Fund in Plzen, anti-corruption police have made arrests in recent days.
The detectives handed over the handcuffs to the local contractor and real estate dealer Lubos.
The latter had tried to precisely manipulate a public tender for the settlement of a refund application in such a way that the proposed land was obtained by a specific candidate.
He had to pay Lubos G. half a million crowns.
"For the moment I can only confirm that the police is suing a person for an offence of initiation in the context of a public tender and competition," Plzen Prosecutor General Antonie Zelena told the Pravo newspaper, knowing that it is forbidden to provide further explanations.
Police released the 46-year-old entrepreneur after 24 hours.
To find out how it could influence a public competition, one can only speculate in the light of so little official information.
On a Pravo question, Lands Fund spokeswoman Lubomira Cerna said that the police had actually made an arrest in Plzen at a separate workplace during the public competition.
“He was a customer and in no case an employee,” she said.
The public competition, according to Cerna, has as its real name "Call to propose rights for the transfer of land under the Land Act" and is set up when several right-beneficiary candidates manifest themselves.
"These persons propose, as part of the appeal, a higher value of their right to restitution which must be settled before the value of the land is announced."
"According to the proposed rights, a buyer classification is established and the Lands Fund then transfers the land to the person who proposed the highest rights," said the Fund's spokesperson.
Lubos G. had, it is clear, information about the people who had registered for the call and as he himself, also a beneficiary person because having purchased a large number of rights to refunds, he had offered to the candidates in the field not to participate in the contest.
And he probably did it by retiring.
Which would explain why he had so much money in his possession at the time of his interrogation.
Lubos G. had contacts far above the standards at the FdT (Fonds des Terrains).
It was in the case of former head of the FdT Vaclav Sankot, who was prosecuted for publishing lands for which the decision to set up a construction had already been issued.
Lubos G., for example, had obtained land for the construction of public communications, specifically in the place and place where the access artery to the industrial area of Borske Pole was to be built.
Later he exchanged it with the town hall for a building in the historic center of the city whose value is far superior.
The town hall was forced to accept because otherwise it risked putting the construction at risk by blocking the land.
Households will pay a surcharge of one hundred crowns per month for housing.
Households will have to pay a surcharge from January not only for all types of energy but also for water and sanitation, heating supplies and in some places rents will also increase.
Families will therefore have to withdraw up to one hundred kroner a month from their wallet from January onwards.
Electricity increases by 4.6 percent, gas by almost 2 percent more expensive, in some localities you will have to pay up to a tenth more for water supply and in many places central heating supplies will also be more expensive.
The increase in electricity is expected to approximate for households in apartment 100 crowns per year more than currently.
However, all suppliers have lowered electricity prices given the significant development to encourage the production of renewable energies, including photovoltaic batteries.
Gas increases moderately but of course at a time when people need it most to heat up and therefore have the most consumption.
One can therefore also count to one hundred additional crowns.
Although electricity and gas are increasing throughout the Czech Republic, the change in central heating prices varies from city to city.
It is mainly the largest municipalities that are planning to increase prices.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Kraloce will pay for central heating almost 50 crowns more per month from January, Liberec’s families will pay more than 1000 crowns annually.
For residents of Prague is preparing an increase of 9 percent for water and sanitation for the case where the city increases infrastructure rents.
If the rents do not change the pragoes will pay an additional 6.8 percent.
The price in Prague will still be one of the lowest compared to the whole country.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sanitation are up 7.4 percent.
For example, rent prices will increase significantly in the 450 thousand apartments for rent from January, that is, at the end of the regulation.
For example, CPI Byty, which owns nearly 2,500 apartments in Usti nad Labem, has decided to increase it to 100 percent.
Those who will not agree with the new increase in rents will be brought before the courts by the company.
Regulated rents paid by people in nearly 300,000 apartments could increase by 10 percent next year.
Czech children get drunk in rum and farnett. Beer is no longer fashionable and acts very gently.
The farnet, rum, vodka and exceptionally also the best brand of whisky are stolen from the parents.
These are drinks that most often bring those who get drunk, who are not yet fifteen years old, into the hands of the doctor.
Children who are treated at the hospital for relapse are no exception.
This is the result of the experience of doctors who encounter cases similar to admissions from hospital child departments.
“Beers or wines are no longer fashionable because it takes time to be drunk.”
'The trend is really strong alcohols,' says Pravo Ludek Pelikan, Head of Children's Department at Horovice Hospital in central Bohemia.
"When they manage to chip a bottle of papa in the closet, it's sometimes whisky, but it's the farnet and vodka that predominate."
“Vodka has this advantage that they can mix it with fruit juice and thus not smell it,” says the head of the department.
Eva Jurinova, a spokeswoman for Motol Hospital, is also right.
"In general, it's rum or farnet."
“It’s now fashionable alcohol, especially in elementary schools.”
"In some cases, it was slivovice that they brought home," added Jurinova.
According to Pelikan, seeing drunk children between the ages of thirteen and fourteen at hospital admissions is a normal phenomenon.
Prior to working in Horovice last year, he was in Motol where he practiced for ten years in pediatrics where ambulances brought schoolchildren from a very drunk area.
"A young girl was hospitalized like this four times.
“She began her career at the age of twelve when she was brought in with 3.5 per thousand blood alcohol plus a mixture with ecstasy,” the doctor described this particularly important case.
"She was at the Holesovice Exhibition Park at a party."
“What’s interesting is that it didn’t seem strange to the mother that her daughter was absent for 48 hours,” the Department Director said.
It is precisely the disinterestedness of parents or their extraordinary tolerance for the fact that their rejection of the drink is the main cause of the development of child alcoholism.
According to specialists, however, we are not talking about dependence, in its strict sense, on children.
“Under the alcoholic vocabulary we mean a chronic dependence on alcohol for several years with all the phenomena that result from it but that is not found in children.”
"In those who use repetitive acool, it is rather a significantly unfavorable socio-family background," Pelikan said.
According to spokeswoman Jurinova, about forty drunk children were hospitalized this year until mid-November at the pediatric clinic in Motol.
Only cases with severe intoxication requiring hospitalization are included in the statistics.
Drunk children who are after emergency care brought home by parents or the police are not counted.
In addition to the cases of children who sit and drink a bottle of alcohol after school, according to Pélikan, there are three seasonal waves with which to count: Halloween, St. Sylvester and the end of the school year.
“Either they drink after bad results, or they celebrate the beginning of the holiday.”
“Of course, I experienced on Witch’s Day an admission of 7 drunken children at once,” Pélikan said.
The drunk child who spent the night in the hospital in detox under medical supervision is paradoxically in a better position than the one who came home and suffers the next day from the “wood snail.”
Morning headaches caused by dehydration and glucose deficiency are eliminated by an infusion of glucose and nutrients that the body needs.
“They’re better off because they have a great night and then a sweet awakening and nothing hurts them.”
“They’re just amazed at where they are,” Pélikan adds, knowing that from time to time it spoils the patients’ good mood at least with the grade to pay for their care.
Ambulance transport and hospitalization on intensive care bed can go up to tens of thousands of crowns.
“From time to time, I applied this as a means of education by telling these children how much their intoxication cost and that they could spend the entire summer on seasonal work to pay back a single evening,” Pélikan added.
However, according to him, health insurance companies in their regressive management, which are expected to recover care-related expenses from parents, do not deal with cases of drunk children.
Two L-159 aircraft are in foreign hands for the first time in Spain.
Two of the five L-159s, against which the Ministry of Defence has exchanged Casa C-295M transport planes, took off on Tuesday for Seville, Spain, where the aircraft manufacturer Casa-EADS is based.
This is the first time that aircraft of this type have become the property of someone other than the Czech army.
However, they have been abroad as part of exercises or demonstration flights.
These are the two-seat versions of the L-159T1 that were in service in the Czech Army until now and were in flight.
Lestrois remaining devices are single-seat versions of the L-159.
These are currently stationed at Aéro Vodochody and the commercial intermediary - the company Omnipol - took them into account last week.
According to Jan Pejsek of the press department of the Ministry of Defense, the physical departure of the Vodochody planes is currently unknown.
"The L-159 single-seat aircraft intended for the exchange have been taken on long-stocked aircraft without causing additional charges or investments for the Department of Defense."
"The L-159 T1 two-seaters have been exchanged in the state," he told Pravo Pejsek.
He played that the army will not remain without two seats since the ministry signed in May 2009 with Aéro Vodochody an agreement worth 200 million crowns for the transformation of four unused L-159 single-seaters into two seats.
The army took delivery of the first aircraft in July, with the second scheduled for delivery at the end of this year.
According to Pejsek EADS, it has committed to introducing the aircraft into the equipment of certain Alliance countries.
“The contract clearly states that the one that takes L-159s into account is EADS and that they will be used to train pilots from NATO member countries.”
"It is therefore the case of the one who takes into account determining how to achieve this," Pejsek said.
Hospodarske noviny announced some time ago that the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 for a Casa aircraft and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns was agreed last year by the government of Mirek Topomanek.
The Department of Defense did not call for tenders and contacted EADS directly.
The defense management argued that the exchange ensured a future export of the L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought 72 aircraft from Aéro Vodochody and uses only 24, wanting to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa planes will likely have legal implications.
However, the European Commission filed a complaint against the Czech Ministry of Defence with the European Court of Justice because the aircraft should have been selected as part of a European-wide tender and in no case by contacting a manufacturer directly.
The army has already taken delivery of three Casa aircraft, the last one is expected to arrive at Prague Kbely airport in two weeks.
An index longer than the annular one is a sign of a low risk of cancer
Men who have the index longer than the annular are exposed to a lower risk of having prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published Wednesday by the British magazine Cancer.
This can depend on the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our findings show that the relative length of the finger serves as a simple test for prostate cancer risk, especially for men before the age of 60," said co-author of the study Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at Warwick University.
The finger could thus help determine which men should undergo prostate cancer test, particularly by combining with genetic risk or other aggravating factors such as family health history, said Eeles.
During the period 1994-2009 she and her colleagues in Britain followed more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and at the same time nearly 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the study participants had a shorter right-hand index than the annual one.
For them, as for 19 percent of those who had fingers of the same length, we found the same probability of prostate cancer.
In the case of those who had the index longer than the annular, however, the risk dropped to 33 percent, for men before 60 the risk reduction reached 87 percent.
The length ratio of the two fingers cited - formed during the prenatal period - indicates in particular different levels of sex hormones to which the child is exposed in the uterus.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer index.
Previous research had shown that it is testosterone that helps in the development of prostate cancer.
Professor Vacla Paces, a renowned Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, told CTK that he is aware of this study but does not appear to him that the relationship between finger length and cancer is "completely demonstrated".
The Czech Republic is in the snow, the D1 and D5 motorways are closed.
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, is this Thursday morning covered in snow.
On roads and sidewalks, there is most of the time compact snow, deflectors have worked all night in many places.
The D5 motorway is closed in the morning between the 89th and the 93rd kilometres in the direction of Rozvadov due to several truck and car accidents and the D1 motorway in the direction of Brno undergoes the same fate.
The dispatcher of the Automobile club central (UAMK) told the news
On the 91st kilometer a truck was crashed, on the 93rd two heavyweights hit each other, the accident injured.
Several cars also found themselves in the ditch.
The problems are also on the D1 highway at the 185th kilometer in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks hit each other.
Drivers should leave just after Brno at the 190th kilometer or go by Brno and then enter at the 182nd kilometer in Kyvalka.
A row of cars of several kilometers formed at this place.
Also on the D11 motorway, there is an accident and, this, just on arrival in Prague.
In Prague, there is a layer of snow several centimeters thick, the thermometers indicate - 7 degrees Celsius.
Rows of cars are created, for example, in Prosek, Sterboholska street is also clogged.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
Trams are delayed, for example, on the line between Charles Square (Karlove Namesti) and Peace Square (Namesti Miru).
At eight o'clock in the morning, Prague's crisis chiefs must meet again.
The railways and the airport are also facing problems.
The Czech Railways have already had to remove 7 rapids due to snow.
Lines such as from Prague to Kralupy or from Prague to Beroun have problems
Travellers should be in control of the current situation.
The airport of Ruzyne was closed from Wednesday 11:00 a.m. until 5 a.m.
Most roads in South Moravia are already rolling but doubling vigilance.
On the road to Vyskov, three side roads are impractical, on the road to Brno there begins to be snowfall places and on the road to Blansko the chains are mandatory to pass certain routes of communication in the places placed above.
The Vyskov region was one of the most affected places.
Up to now the axes are closed: Rousinov-Slavkov, Bohdalice-Kucerov and also Saratice-Milesovice
To clean them, you may need to send snowflakes and snow strawberries.
We can't estimate at the moment when they'll be rolling.
On the road of Hodonin caution is of rigour in the region of the White Carpathians.
On the roads that are, given the protection of nature, maintained only by the spraying of inert products, there is still a layer of 5 centimeters of snow warning CTK.
In the Czech Republic, it fell between two and 10 centimetres of snow; it fell most in northern Bohemia, with often up to 18 centimetres of snow.
In the Moravian-Silesian region, it fell as much as 15 centimeters of snow.
The snow was gradually disappearing in the Czech Republic.
Americans have a new “smart weapon”
The US military has sent a new "intelligent" weapon to Afghanistan, known only as code XM-25.
The generals think that this new automatic rifle will have an influence on the conflict there with the Taliban and "will change the game" to their advantage.
The new weapon is like a super precise gun
Its projectiles are guided by laser with a precision of a few meters.
The special ammunition of 25 mm caliber developed for this rifle and containing a highly brittle explosive, actually works like small grenades.
The ammunition can be programmed in such a way that it will explode in contact with the target but also at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
It can therefore be used against an enemy who hides behind an obstacle, a wall or a gap.
It is also not protected from above and when a deadly rain of steel splatters falls on it, it can also put it out of combat.
According to Richard Audette, who took part in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon to use "smart" technology.
"The soldier essentially uses it in such a way that he finds the target, sends him a laser beam that determines the distance, thus obtains a precise target point, according to which he corrects his target site and presses on the relaxation.
"Let's say you've been aiming at 543 meters."
"When you press the detachment, the weapon loads and fires at a distance of 543 meters more or less 1, 2, 3 meters," Audette said.
400 jobs relocated
The Fujitsu Group relocates its subsidiary from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July, 400 employees will move to Astro Park, which is currently located in the office building on the Mareinbader Square in the Bad Homburg region.
The Japanese group Fujitsu relocates its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As stated on Wednesday by the giant specializing in the manufacture and maintenance of computers, next year in July, the workplace of 400 men and women, located so far on the Marienbader square in the city of Bad Homburg, will be transferred to Astro Park, a huge office complex located on the Nie Strader street of Lyoner.
A spokeswoman for Fujitsu said that in the medium term, the group is expected to bring together 100 other jobs that have been scattered so far in the region.
The rental offer has been extremely attractive, and Astro Park’s open-air offices are better suited to the way employees work.
In Bad Homburg too, Fujitsu was just a tenant.
Bernd Wagner, CEO, said: “Frankfurt-Niederrad is a prime location for us with a remarkable infrastructure.”
He argues that connecting to the airport is just of great importance for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of a major company inside the region yesterday stirred the joy of the winners and caused the disappointment of the losers.
The head of economic affairs of the municipality of Frankfurt, Mr. Markus Frank (CDU), said that once again, a "planetary actor" had thus been conquered.
It is an "extraordinary profession of faith relative to the place of implantation".
Fujitsu is suitable for the city and its location is an important momentum for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (the Greens), regrets Fujitsu’s decision.
The management informed the municipality very early of this intention.
“It goes without saying that we have offered our help to this company,” said Mr. Korwisi.
However, the friendly relations could not have changed the difficulties of the computer manufacturer in the face of the owner of the building in Place Marienbader.
Ultimately, the economic reasons would have been decisive.
It is now a matter of avoiding such an exceptional place from being unoccupied for a long time.
"I hope that the owner and landlord of the building will be cooperative."
Ten years ago, the building of the Place de l’H<0xC3><0xB4>tel de Ville, used so far by Fujitsu company and the neighboring “little vertical” building, as well as the rest of the buildings of Place Marienbad, were part of the controversial construction project of the spa.
As a result of a joint project of the municipality and a private project developer, a new entrance of the city was created between the train station and the City Hotel. This was aroused by many criticisms, not only because of the impressive layout of the areas that used to serve in part as parking, but also because of the location.
In 2001, the investment rating and consulting company, Feri, the computer manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as Fujitsu, computer manufacturer at the time still associated with Siemens, moved into the buildings.
In 2006, the German Frankfurt-based Immobilien-Chancen Group bought the buildings occupied by Fujitsu at the same time as real estate fund Morgan Stanley. A year later, these buildings were resold to the Spanish company Falcon Real Estate Investments SA based in Madrid.
The Fujitsu Group, headquartered in Tokyo, is considered to be the world’s third-largest provider of IT products.
For example, it makes computers and servers available to businesses and also provides the essential service.
Its branch office in the Rhine-Main region is one of the largest in Germany: Fujitsu certainly has many more employees in Munich.
The subsidiary, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, leaves Bad Homburg to settle in Frankfurt-Niederrad. The other subsidiaries present on this site are Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
For this, 7000 square meters have been rented in the Astro Park building.
This 20-year-old complex, whose name recalls its star-shaped plan, is home to the headquarters of the Confederation of the Electronic and Electrotechnical Industry.
Deportation of the server by Amazon - Threats against Mr. Assange
WikiLeaks is experiencing more and more difficulties.
The Internet service provider Amazon has ejected from its servers the website specializing in the disclosure of confidential documents.
This attitude perhaps hides political pressure from the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic notes.
Wikileaks founder, Mr. Assange, is apparently staying in England.
In the United States, the Wikileaks site is being attacked with increasing force.
The group of cyber-activists “Wikileaks” no longer has access to its server hosted so far in America and is now looking for a host in Europe.
Meanwhile, prominent U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman has called on other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is wanted by Interpol, is probably staying in Britain, according to news reports.
"Wikileaks excludes Amazon server."
“Freedom of expression in the country of freedom,” the cyber-activists who originated the revelations via the social network Twitter said on Wednesday.
Shortly before, the cyber company, Amazon, had removed Wikileaks documents from its servers.
After the publication of the secret diplomatic notes, cyber-activists resorted to the Amazon Web Service (AWS) in order to reach the highest number of access to the documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks continues its revelations: “Formidable, our dollars are now spent on caring for people in Europe.”
When freedom of expression poses a problem to Amazon, “they should stop selling books.”
CNN, citing Mr. Liebermann’s office, reported that Amazon has banned Wikileaks from using its servers after an investigation by Senator Joe Lieberman’s collaborators.
The chairman of the Senate committee for the protection of the territory had threatened the Amazon site to orchestrate a boycott against him, the British newspaper, The Guardian, reported.
"I would have liked Amazon to take this step earlier in light of previous Wikileaks publications of classified information," he said.
At the same time, Liebermann called on other countries to refuse the use of the servers by the platform.
"Wikileaks acts illegally, monstrously and scrupulously, thereby endangering our national security and endangering our lives around the world," the independent senator said in a statement.
“No company aware of its responsibilities, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks disseminate the content of the stolen documents.”
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr Assange, who is wanted by the Swedish authorities because he is suspected of rape, is on the list of people sought by Interpol.
According to information released by the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian lives in Britain and Scotland Yard knows exactly where he is.
The cyber-activist has consistently described as intrigues orchestrated by his detractors the prosecutions committed against him by Sweden.
Wikileaks spokesperson Kristinn Hrafnsson told London that threats were being made against the site.
"Calls have even been made for the murder of Julian Assange."
That is why Assange is particularly concerned about his safety, Hrafnsson said.
This is also why the founder of Wikileaks continues to hide.
Hrafnsson was clearly responding to statements made in North America.
In America, former Arkansas Republican governor Mike Huckabee has demanded that Wikileaks’ revelations officer be prosecuted and executed for treason.
In Canada, Chief Executive Officer Stephen Harper told television, apparently ironically, that Mr. Assange should be “killed” and that Mr. Obama could “use a drone.”
In the meantime, there was a controversy between the White House and Mr. Assange.
U.S. President Barack Obama's spokesman Robert Gibbs called Mr Assange's resignation of Secretary of State Hilary Clinton "ridiculous and absurd" if she was responsible for the order given to diplomats, and recently disclosed that he had committed activities.
“I don’t know exactly why we need to take care of an individual’s opinion of a website owner,” Gibbs said.
“Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than the claims of a website.”
The U.S. government now passes the protection of its databases completely to the test bank.
According to a White House statement, Mr. Russell Travers, deputy director of the Centre for Counter-Terrorism, was appointed responsible for combating the leaks.
Travers is in charge of implementing the “necessary structural reforms” made indispensable after Wikileaks’ disclosure of diplomatic cables.
The White House also has the will to check the means by which the entire administration exchanges and protects information.
In addition, the U.S. government has announced that it wants to take care of the security of dissidents and activists should they ever be threatened by Wikileaks revelations.
"We've done everything we can to get in touch with them," State Department spokesman Philip Crowley said.
"We are ready to protect them if it proves necessary."
The University of the Glace
The "Gelato University" in Bologna prepares ice cream confectioners for the best seasons of the year.
The three-day introductory course for future glaciers has been very successful and has attracted visitors from all over the world.
Where does all the ice come from?
Glacier and the ice machine.
The glacier, that is, in German the somewhat outdated ice cream confectioner, manufactures the cream according to all the rules of the Italian art of making ice.
The ice turbine removes the ice cream from the refrigerated showcase using a spatula, puts it in the wafer and then starts selling it.
To know, you don't need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about ice, can not avoid "Gelato-University" of the Italian firm Carpigiani.
The ice cream maker founded the ice cream university in 2003 so that the ice creams coming out of its machines everywhere meet the high Italian ideals.
The three-day introductory course for future glaciers has been very successful and has attracted visitors from all over the world.
There are also special chocolate ice-cream classes for several days, as well as practical sessions in the private ice-cream room.
In the midst of the quarantine crisis, a number of people dream of a new career, others just risk realizing their burning desire on smooth ice.
This time, there were 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia through Hungary.
Jacky, an art education professor from California, is passionate about the Slow Food movement and wants to offer a quality European product in the industrial ice country in the future.
Anke from Berlin is an advisor in business management and she wants, after a few years, to draw something singular from this nerve-provoking profession.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening a glacier in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil would like to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars, and the Canadian housewife came because her children love Italian ice cream.
Glacier master Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal characteristics of the perfect ice.
Determining not only the right flavor, but also the silky flexibility and the right consistency.
However, Luciano does not forget during the training the cherry on the cake of the national superstructure and, in general, of the south: "Italian ice is simply the best: and then it still retains a sacred dose of romance."
The first step in manufacturing seems quite simple.
Luciano pours basic ingredients such as milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixer that heats everything to 85 degrees through an electronic program, and then immediately cools to four degrees.
It then opens a tap installed on the machine: a white pasteurized base cream comes out, foundation of all kinds of ice cream with milk.
The trainer is immediately overwhelmed with the question: Is it possible to make ice using only natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can one give free course to the personal pleasure of experimentation?
Mr. Luciano warns against being misled by the spirit of time.
Anyone who only talks about ice cream "made from natural ingredients" may have used stabilizers despite this: most often a natural product, for example, guar seed flour obtained from guar bean.
It is obviously possible to make ice without using a stabilizer, only it must be sold within 24 hours, otherwise it collapses and the customer will croak nothing but ice pellets.
Some modifications of the base mass are allowed.
This becomes more exciting with the aromas.
Master Luciano makes the difference between the ingredients that are purchased in the fruit or confectionery range of the supermarket.
In addition, there is powder and pasta.
"suppliers will all try to refill dozens of flavored ingredients."
"However, you should just try."
Either in the recipes of fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruits.
Either in ice creams made from the white base mass, which, by adding eggs to it, becomes a yellow cream and, when adding cocoa powder, forms the basis of all possible desserts to chocolate.
Now, all participants in the course must switch to the use of ice machines.
Luciano invites them from time to time to make four kinds of ice cream: vanilla, chocolate, moka and hazelnut with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural ingredients.
The different types of fruit ice cream are also subject to the same experience.
More aromatic substances, more fruit purees: from the point of view of taste, this is absolutely not better.
Hazelnut ice cream does not necessarily have the taste of walnuts, when it is composed mostly of hazelnuts.
Kiwi ice cream, very popular, is made from the group using more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
“Only a balanced mixture correctly captures the taste of an ice cream,” says Luciano.
The making of ice is a calculation exercise: if you use fish purée with a lot of sugar, you need to reduce the amount of sugar in the basic recipe.
A sugar supplement is needed for lemon ice cream.
Luciano presents a device with which he determines the sugar content of the different types of fruit (winners use it to measure the degree of Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables facilitate the calculations.
The manufacture of ice no longer requires as much physical intervention as before.
It is not only the automatic mass-making machine that helps.
There is also an apparatus in which the ice mixture is simultaneously beaten available to make it unctuous and brought back to negative temperatures.
Despite all automations, slight failures are not excluded.
The Brazilian Gustavo squirts fruit purée from head to toe and, thus, splashes his fellow students when the control of the colossal mixer bowl escapes him.
Master Luciano is of the opinion that "a similar incident may occur during each course: it is only a matter of time."
Controllers in ambiguous position
According to some sources, the industry experimenting with the cultivation of genetically modified plants has nucleated the European Food Safety Authority.
This accusation is now formulated by the Testbiotech Group of Experts which is considered an independent institute for the assessment of the consequences of biotechnology.
"This sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we've been well informed," Christoph Then, Director of Testbiotech, told Munich on Wednesday.
Some information indicates that the president of the EFSA Group of Experts for Genetically Modified Plants, Mr. Harry Kuiper, as well as other EFSA experts are under contract with the Ilsi Pressure Group.
The latter is financed by groups such as Monsanto, Nestlé or Bayer.
Mr. Kuiper has been instrumental in the development of Efsa testing requirements for genetically modified plants and is thus clearly in a conflict of interest situation, according to criticisms from Mr. Then.
The requirements elaborated correspond, by paragraphs, to the position taken by the Ilsi pressure group and thus bear the trade mark of the industry, which, in essence, would be controlled by the authorities located in Parma, Italy.
This is the second time Testbiotech has reported a conflict of interest.
A senior Efsa official recently joined the Swiss agri-food group Syngenta unconditionally or without a transitional period.
Recently, even the Central German Radio (Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk, MDR) had revealed the existence of personal relations between the European Union control authority and the industrial lobby, which aroused suspicions of both the European Federal Agency for the Environment.
However, Efsa does not acknowledge the existence of any conflict of interest.
An opinion indicates that all reliable data, including industry data, is exploited as long as it is of good professional quality.
Experts working on behalf of Efsa are not prohibited from contacting this sector of activity.
But they should make them public.
Mr. Kuiper admits that he works for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) based in the United States.
This organization considers itself as a neutral forum that brings together experts from, among others, the fields of science, industry and politics in order to assess the risks of biotechnology without being at the expense of a lobby.
In this case, independent experts such as Mr. Then disapprove of the fact that genetically modified plants are accepted without any animal feeding tests and that the impact of these plants on the environment has not been tested.
“We want to know, for example, what are the incidences of genetically modified maize cause in the field,” says Mr. Then.
The current practice is to test only the isolated proteins and not the whole genetically modified plant, which does not allow reliable results.
“If you don’t look for the risks, how can you discover them?” asks Mr. Then in an indicting tone.
That is also the view of Angelika Hilbeck.
She has been conducting research in the field of genetics since 1994 and is currently working at the Zurich Polytechnic School.
In this region as in the United States, and now also in Europe, the industry is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists.
That is why there are hardly any researchers who are not affiliated with societies.
In the opinion of the companies, the critical studies would not be published.
Ms. Hilbeck says that "the industry controls security research".
The Stone Trace
Uli Gsell took care of it, a total of about 400 kilograms.
On Monday afternoon, she was in front of Stuttgart station with her tube on her back.
There was a manifesto.
It was snowing.
The story is known: In September, the excavators had come and had begun to demolish much of the northern wing.
The world in Stuttgart was no longer the same: Thousands of people protested against the S21 project, transforming Stuttgart’s central station into a multi-billion-dollar underground station.
A large part of the wing was in ruins when the demonstrations led to a halt to construction work.
Broken into 6000, 7000 pieces.
The Muschelkalk (the shell limestone) of Crailsheim, a soft and coarse pavement badly built between 1914 and 1920.
Mr. Gsell is a 43-year-old sculptor living in Ostfildern.
He got a few fragments of it.
“These stones are relics.”
"They must not disappear."
He declares enthusiastically: "a modest and cheap rock, simple and terrestrial."
He claims that by cutting it off at the saw, he smelled the smell of cigarette smoke.
He does not yet know what he will do with this fragment.
The rocks have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
The traces of the Stuttgart stones lead to a former ammunition depot of the French army in a forest near Tübingen, where Manuel Rongen built his empire of stones.
This 44-year-old man is trading old stones.
He bought all the stones from the demolition that took place in Stuttgart.
“It would be a shame if they were crushed or if they disappeared in the landfill,” he said in his office located in a hut, which was once a guard post.
He says he was the subject of insults and threats when in September newspapers reported that he had purchased the rest of the northern wing from the demolition company.
But he negotiated for whole days with the opponents of the S21 project.
And he explained to them that he could do nothing at all to oppose the demolition.
And if it happens, then the most reasonable thing would be to continue to use the stones.
About 200 opponents of the S21 project subsequently took one of the stone parallelepipeds weighing on average 80 kilograms, the value of which is between 6.50 and 14 Euros.
Some keep it as a souvenir in while also hoping to be able to return it during a reconstruction.
Rongen had acquired 500 tons, 25 full loads of a truck.
About half is still trapped in the forest, the rest being sold for a long time.
Owners of gardens, landscape gardeners, Private.
They came from everywhere and took everything they could get into the trunk and trailers.
These Stuttgart scandal stones have long been transformed into "Mäuerle" or into restrictions on grass strips.
“In fact, this stone is nothing special,” says Mr. Rongen.
"This was not a political component."
He gets into his car all the way, going around his vast empire of 20 hectares.
He did law studies that he gave up, and later began to study biology before becoming interested in computer science and eventually becoming a carrier.
And an amateur of stones.
It stocks 40,000 tons.
He collects his treasures all over Germany.
He claims that he is the greatest merchant of ancient stones.
He's refrigerating.
Sandstones carved with art are placed on the snow.
“They used to be part of the Marienbrücke bridge in Dresden.”
Elbsandstein, yellow, warm, he says enthusiastically.
"My favorite stone."
He takes the path that goes up through the forest.
It shows a pile of the finger: Red sandstone, previously part of Karlsruhe station.
And so on.
"A nice travertine."
The parallelepiped used to be part of the Tribune of the Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow of stones and stories, the travertine of Cannstatt from the police prefecture, the reddish granite from the cathedral of Saint Blasien, the tuft from the hospital of Heilbronn.
What work, what effort, what sweat!
When Mr. Rongen thinks that the stones were once hand-carved and moved using simple levers and carts pulled by cattle, he becomes quite respectful.
"It would be a scandal if such a heritage were to be demolished."
He didn't become rich, let alone rich.
But this carrier now employs 14 people. In addition, stonecutters, a sculptor, a forger, a glass blower and a gardener settled in the forest.
“We work hard, but it’s rewarding,” says the waste recycler.
Soon he will be going to Cologne.
There are also stones to be saved there.
Struggle for talent to conquer high potentials
The counter has a vivid affluence.
16 students are struggling to buy salmon bread, tomato sauce, and white-eating.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Volkswagen invited students in design and mechanical engineering to a workshop.
As part of a kind of contest of ideas, they have to talk business about the car of the future with VW designers, and, by the way, get to know the Volkswagen company.
Nowadays, many companies do not hesitate to go to the body in competition to find better brains and to engage, like Volkswagen, in multi-faceted cooperation with universities.
Their mission: Recruit the most talented graduates as possible in amphitheaters before they reach the job market and are courted by others.
And since universities don’t publish statements about the performance of their students, we try to identify exceptional talents in practical projects and to support them.
On the second day of the workshop organized at the Technical University of Brauschweig, the car group was acclaiming the talents.
A young lady from the staff service shares pens, candy and cards featuring the Volkswagen logo.
She talks about the schedule of professional internships and student jobs to young talents; she shows them the ways to access the group’s enclosure.
Nico Selle of the Technical University of Braunschweig is responsible for the project with Volkswagen.
For him, there are reciprocal advantages for both parties: "Students come into contact with this industrial sector and gain experience."
"As for the Volkswagen Group, he can get to know students, look at serious candidates and appreciate those who come online as collaborators."
According to Mr. sade, such cooperation is unusual.
What's new is the offensive with which we're trying to attract students.
“In the past, the focus was on the professional project,” says Mr. Selle.
The struggle for the conquest of new graduates will become much more acute.
In real estate sectors, companies can no longer recruit their employees by sorting on a kyrill of candidates.
But they must boast of their reliability and, above all, courteous highly skilled workers.
It is especially the graduates from the engineering sectors who are in an excellent position to negotiate.
According to the German engineers’ association VDI, more than 40,000 engineering positions remained unoccupied in October.
And according to the VDI forecasts, the gap in engineering positions will increase further.
Roman Dykta goes on a talent hunt on behalf of KPMG, an audit, accounting and consulting firm.
It organizes expensive talent recruitment events, such as the KPMG-Race cruise race, a kind of paper rally where competitors have to find their way using GPS coordinates.
The company will thus send eight promising students next year so that they will travel through the United States in this way.
Participants can additionally visit KPMG’s subsidiaries and get to know the company.
The person who is required to participate will decide in advance after two selection procedures.
Only the cream of the many candidates will fly to the United States.
According to Dykta, the means used for the pursuit of high potentials in universities are increasingly important.
"We want to emerge from the lot thanks to the cruising race."
“For us, a simple cruise was too little.”
For the talent hunter that Mr. Dykta is, the account seems to be there.
"To date, we have remained in touch with all the people who took part in a similar action last year."
"Some of them are about to finish their studies and want to address their requests to our company soon," he said.
In addition to the direct training carried out on campus, small and medium-sized enterprises take part in the trade fairs where they engage in brain-hunting.
"We are trying to reach graduates by participating in trade shows."
“For example, at the solar technology show,” says Ms. Sitha Stübe, human resources director at Solarworld, a manufacturer of photovoltaic panels.
The Bonn-based company employs approximately 1500 people in Germany.
Ms. Stübe was aware of the problem of recession.
Currently, 35 positions are put into competition on the company’s website.
“At the moment, it is very difficult to fill vacancies.”
“It’s expensive and takes a lot of time,” he says.
Another way to establish contact is by going through the university professors.
Solarworld has established cooperation with various institutions of higher education, for example, the University of Fribourg.
"Professors indicate that the student has the opportunity to perform professional internships or to write his or her graduation project at our school."
Expensive advertising campaigns are announced by solar specialists.
This is why the company tries to advertise by highlighting other qualities: personalized atmosphere, flat hierarchy and easy communication.
“Often, a large group can’t do that,” says Ms. Stübe, chief of staff.
For a long time, money has no longer played a major role in job search.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good promotion opportunities are the other determining factors.
According to a study conducted by the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld ranks 55th among the top 100 employers in Germany.
The Institute is an annual tribute to the German employers.
To this end, it asks employees about their degree of satisfaction with their work and context while looking at employee framework conditions.
The Chief of Staff Ms. Stübe hopes that this placement will enhance the company's image among job seekers.
“I think that the candidates are mainly relying on external evaluations in terms of a potential employer,” she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the German Academy DEBA (Deutscher Employer Branding Akademie, DEBA) advises companies that want to build a good reputation as an employer by applying a long-term strategy.
He advises his clients to show more authenticity.
And, according to Kriegler, this means first of all taking internal measures.
“The best way for an employer to become attractive is to go through their own employees,” he says.
This is called, according to the jargon used in the sector, the internal image strategy, that is, the creation of the employer's brand image within its own workforce.
"satisfied employees train the best messengers."
When you treat your employees well and they identify with the company, they do the job of advertising their employer to their friends and acquaintances.
“It’s like playing in an orchestra,” says Kriegler.
Obama puts a brake on new oil drilling
There will be no new oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Florida, southeastern United States, in the coming years.
The Washington government issued an equivalent ban and thus definitively cancelled its initial plans.
Even off the Atlantic coast, new drilling is still banned for the time being.
Interior Secretary Ken Salazar made the announcement on Wednesday.
The explosion in April of the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform is the reason for this strict ban, which must remain in force for at least the next five years.
In the face of this accident, which cost the lives of eleven employees and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, subject to pressure from the opposition and this sector of activity, had indicated that he was willing to authorize the construction of new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
Supporters of this solution thus want to reduce the dependence of the United States on foreign countries in terms of oil supply.
The question of who is responsible for the devastating black tide in golf has not, to date, been definitively resolved.
The British oil group, which is facing multi-billion-dollar claims, is at the centre of the indictment.
A committee of inquiry set up by Obama is due to present its findings in December.
In October, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar lifted the freeze of the drilling decreed after the platform exploded.
As a result of this decision, various oil companies had immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With stricter controls and stricter security guidelines, Obama and Salazar want to prevent a new catastrophe.
The competent supervisory authority, which has discredited itself after numerous allegations of corruption, is currently undergoing in-depth reforms.
At the same time, Mr. Obama announced they would remove the lucrative tax niches of gas and oil groups.
Players in this sector are now publicly warning against the fact that the supply flow in the Gulf would be significantly lower than it has been so far.
"The government's goal is to put a brake on the rapid growth of the gas and oil sector," according to a recent survey conducted in the sector by the BDO audit firm, ahead of the drilling ban on Wednesday.
In addition, the American Enery Alliance deplores the uncertainty that characterizes this sector: "No one knows exactly what will change with regulation."
Investments in new support projects have been postponed to a new order, at the expense of growth.
The Ogoni country is dry
The water flowing in the rivers is oiled brown; it gives off a smell similar to that existing in the gas station: Due to a leak, billions of liters of crude oil destroyed the country of Ogoni in Nigeria.
Men live from theft, corruption and oil refining.
Celestine Akpobari has a good intention.
“Don’t be exhausted,” the environmental activist says to reporters to calm them down: “You still have enough oil mud in front of the water lens today.”
The 37-year-old Nigerian attempted to photograph a young man plunged into muddy water up to his chest, as well as the greasy sleigh that surrounds him: This scene looks almost beautiful in the glow of water in the color of the rainbow.
It is not possible to notice that the basement is full of brown sheets of crude oil.
On the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River, Esther Badom tells us that she used to collect shrimp from whole buckets here.
But in the meantime, the calm waters have completely dried up.
Five years ago, a huge amount of oil flowed out of an oil pipeline that exploded in the huge swamp.
Fishermen living in the nearby small town of Bodo now have to roam for six hours to reach the fishing waters: The country of Ogoni located in the heart of the Niger Delta is considered one of the most polluted regions in the world.
The entire extent of the devastation jumps in the eye when you pass through the mangrove swamps through streams.
Instead of clear water, the motor boat cracks a crunchy brown water. Anyone who dips his hand in it removes it all covered with oil.
The roots of small mangroves emerge from the ground like sticks of lizards. The isolated palms sadly leave their palms hanging.
In vain, we look for the clouds of birds, as is usually the case in the wetlands: As soon as the outboard engine stops, a ghostly silence comes crashing down on this paradise of old, which resembles a service station by the smell it emits.
"What's happening here is war on the environment," says Mr. Celestine Akpobari from a sad air: "Our lives are characterized by a permanent danger in terms of health."
A comparison of wars is made.
The region where the Ogoni live is a besieged battlefield for decades: more than 60 years ago, the first European explorers worked here; the first resistance was organized in the 1980s by the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa. this region was very much for the activities that were carried out in this area.
Even today, the return to the country Ogoni is forbidden to this company: While more than 2 million barrels of black gold are pumped daily thanks to more than 5000 drilling wells and 7000 kilometers of oil pipelines in the entire Delta region group, three times too large for petroleum as Switzerland, the oil fields are in the situation of the country.
Every few hundred meters stand in the water of steel trenches like strange sculptures: They very affectionately refer to "Christmas trees" the heads of drilling holes.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them are scratched by corrosion to the mark.
Akpobari estimates that a drilling head of this nature breaks into pieces from time to time, as a constant stream of crude oil flows into the water.
According to experts estimates, more than two billion liters have spilled over the ecosystem in 50 years: Each year, the amount of oil equivalent to that that flowed into the sea during the story of the super-oil tanker "Exxon Valdez" in the environment, more than 21 years ago.
Who should be responsible for persistent environmental pollution? the answer to this question divides the actors.
For the Shell Group, oil pipeline sabotage and siphoning are responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution. Environmentalists, for their part, consider the explosions of drilling heads and perforated oil pipelines as the main causes.
In 2008, U.S. researcher Richard Steiner accused the Shell group of applying substantially less stringent safety standards to Nigeria than anywhere else in the world: Only the rate of conduction failures is “much higher than flattery.”
Some forms emerge from mangroves in a place that, seen from afar, resembles an abandoned workshop, full of Cambodians and installed outdoors: They are completely naked and covered with Cambodians to the neck.
A sparkling fire under one of the many tunnels that sometimes connected to the pipes, sometimes scattered without pattern on the site must be repeated: a small clandestine refinery.
The crude oil is heated in the barrel for several hours, says Michael, the team leader.
At first, the gasoline enters a container by passing through pipes, then, at the end of the duct the kerosene drops fall and finally diesel is obtained.
That’s how Michael and his four employees produce four 300-litre diesel barrels a day: “That brings us 34,000 Naira,” about $22.
Delta residents are taking advantage of the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil-producing country in Black Africa.
There is only one refinery in Nigeria.
Illegal refiners can sell at a cheaper price than the ridiculously low of just 40 cents per litre of diesel: Because they buy their raw material for free.
This is offered by the "protectors" who drill the pipeline network throughout the country of the Ogoni. According to experts, the country loses at least 16 million liters of crude oil in the entire Niger Delta.
Only a very small portion of the provisionally stored raw material is illegally purged: The networks of organized crime, which are also among its members of politicians and high-ranking military personnel, load the lion’s share in tankers and sweep it into the world market.
The activist Akpobari believes that the debate on whether to attribute environmental catastrophe or rather subversive activities to the population or to the lax mode of production is purely academic.
“If oil companies were not perceived as intruders and if the foundations of fishermen’s life were not so deeply destroyed, there would be no sabotage, no theft and illegal refineries.”
But, in the meantime, Ogoni relations, especially with Shell, have deteriorated so much that it was no longer just a matter of withdrawing from the group. "perhaps operators with other nationalities, such as the Chinese, will turn out to be better."
So, Michael gets nervous.
“It’s high time you got rid of it,” says the sturdy oil worker.
"Soldiers can appear at any time."
If the illegal refiners are surprised by the special units of the armed forces, they will certainly not be arrested, but at most they will offer them wine pots.
Even soldiers mainly from the north of the country intend to take advantage of the raw material like all Nigerians.
“In every way, this shit has brought our country down very low,” Akpori regrets.
Investigators Discover Construction Defects in A380 Reactor
The A380 clearly suffers from a major security problem.
In examining an aircraft that made an emergency landing, investigators discovered a possible construction failure that could lead to "catastrophic reactor failure."
The Qantas airline now wants to file a complaint against the reactor manufacturer.
At the beginning of November, the passengers of the Airbus belonging to the company Quantas had been visibly more fortunate so far: During the investigation it conducted, the Australian Air Safety Authority found that against possible construction reactors of some A380 aircraft were presenting a serious safety problem.
This potential failure could lead to serious consequences: It could cause fatigue coves and leaks at the connection level of the oil pipeline, according to a statement published Thursday by the ATSB administration.
It could have led to a “catastrophic failure of the reactors.”
These are the reactors manufactured by Rolls-Royce and equipped with 20 aircraft of the A380 series.
The Airbus of the company Quantas, which had to land urgently on November 4 in Singapore, is among them.
The Australian airline has now filed a lawsuit against the British manufacturer of reactors.
She filed a legal complaint with an Australian federal court based in Sydney, which gave her the opportunity to take further legal action against the company.
Quantas’s director, Alan Joyce, said his company would claim damages in connection with the incident that occurred in early November.
Parts were detached and the bearing surface was damaged during the engine fire.
According to Rolls-Royce, it is the inflammation of oil that is causing the damage.
After this incident, at least 40 reactors now need to be replaced worldwide.
Australian investigators have announced that further safety-related tests will be carried out on superjumbos that are also equipped with the reactors in question.
The safety recommendations are the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ASTB spokesman Martin Dolan.
The security issue is considered to be important enough to inform all parties concerned.
After the emergency landing of his plane, the airline Quantas had immobilized on the ground its entire fleet of A380s for a week.
Singapore Airlines temporarily immobilized three of its 11 A380s.
Lufthansa has replaced, as a precautionary measure, the reactor of an A380.
The two-story plane is the largest airliner in the world.
The snowfall across the territory is causing chaos in the transport sector.
Germany all covered in white: In one night, snow fell on almost the whole country.
Chaos reigns on all roads, trains and planes are immobilized.
At least three people were killed in traffic accidents.
Winter makes Germany swirl: By freezing temperatures, almost the entire republic is covered with snow on Thursday night, leading to chaos in many localities.
In the north and east, the snow cover reaches 15 centimeters per place.
Traffic is severely restricted on several highways and on many roads.
On the national A7 in Flensburg, the winter service staff worked on a permanent basis, but they were unable to cope with the ever-accumulating snow.
In addition, violent raids swept the Baltic Sea coast.
The Federal Office for Maritime Navigation and Hydrography (BHD) expects that tidal waves will take place on the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein with water levels up to 1.2 m above normal.
Snow heaps on highways and federal roads have caused serious problems in Saxony.
That's why the Meteomedia bad weather alert center has announced the violet alert level has been announced in Saxon Switzerland: in fact, it's the highest level.
In places, there has fallen 30 centimeters of fresh snow that the strong and fresh winds have dispersed.
Several trucks and cars were stuck there at night.
Even in the country of Saxony-Anhalt, police authorities have announced serious disturbances on the roads.
On the A2 motorway, snow and wind caused a traffic disruption and caused plugs.
In Thuringia, snowfalls hit the A4 and A9 motorways.
According to the Deutsche Bahn, serious disruptions in rail traffic occurred in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are: snow on railways, trees falling on railways, catenaries or destroyed needles.
In Saxony, interregional transport Leipzig-Nuremberg had to be interrupted.
In Sallfeld, Thuringia, an ICE train to Munich had to interrupt its journey.
Firefighters and paramedics had to supply the train’s 165 passengers with blankets, food and drinks.
Snowstorms swept the roads.
The snowfall has resulted in numerous flight cancellations at Germany’s main airports.
According to a spokesperson for the standard and information on flights, some cancellations have already been announced in Munich.
A spokesperson for Fraport said 40 flights had already been cancelled in Frankfurt on the Main.
The winter service provides a permanent service.
It is true that there are no longer many passengers trapped at the airport, despite this, only 400 beds are available there.
Accidents occurred on many roads on Wednesday afternoon.
In the evening in Ostholstein, a truck driver lost his life in a collision with a train at a level crossing.
The driver of the train was slightly injured.
Due to the snow on the roads, a similar accident occurred not far from Nuremberg: even here, a truck was caught at a level crossing because the vehicle was immobilized there.
The driver lost his life.
Four passengers were injured on the train, which is why the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was closed until the morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died when her car made a tonnage on a slippery road in Aschaffenburg.
However, the meteorologists announce a good news: The snow will always be soft and powdery, but it will whirl in the event of slight gusts.
But, the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea will be affected by strong and fast winds.
However, it is very cold, up to at least 15 degrees per place.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers.
Deutsche Bank seeks to separate itself from its emblem: According to information reported by newspapers, this financial institution is looking for buyers for its two office buildings located at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
This building could bring in up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank has just refurbished the Group’s headquarters: The twin towers in the Business District have been modernized; in the meantime, the bankers have had to return to their former service site.
From now on, the financial group is obviously looking to recover the cost of renovations and is looking for a buyer for its two buildings, as writes the newspaper "Financial Times Deutschland", citing a spokesman.
This spokesperson did not state the reasons for the planned sale.
He said: “We will check whether it is more interesting to occupy the buildings ourselves or to sell them, and to re-rent them later.”
This is how the largest financial institution in Germany has already ceded its seat, shortly thereafter.
It was only in mid-2007 that the bank acquired the twin towers for an amount of EUR 272 million from the own funds holders and then rehabilitated them.
The transformations aimed at optimising energy have, according to some indications, absorbed around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200 million.
A sale would, of course, bring a lot of money to the bank.
According to information provided by the newspaper, experts in this sector estimate the value of the towers, now renamed "Green Towers", at about 500 million euros.
According to the spokesperson, it is currently not known whether the buildings will be re-sold to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor.
Thousands of people mourn the minors who died.
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people have had a thought for the buried miners who have been declared dead following several explosions in a mine.
The bodies had not yet been recovered because the safety of the sinister well continues to be precarious.
Just two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred at Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 minors between the ages of 17 and 62 had been buried underground.
A probe had been introduced into the sinister well, but no trace of survivors had been discovered.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and other subsequent explosions, no rescue teams were able to descend into the mine for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and the administration had considered that the minors had no chance of surviving.
Until now, the bodies could not be recovered.
Today, parents and friends have organized a celebration in memory of the dead.
Thousands of people gathered under a blazing sun in Greymouth, south of the island of New Zealand.
They observed two minutes of silence.
In memory of the 29 buried miners, 29 tables were installed on which the names, helmets and lamps could be seen.
The photos and personal effects, including clothes and surfboards, also had their place there.
The flags were placed in front of all public buildings in the country.
New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told participants at the commemorative party that New Zealand has nurtured the hope that minors will rise to the surface.
"But they never came home."
Mr. Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the trenches, said he cannot resign to accept his son's death until he has seen his remains.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the parents of the victims, several foreign diplomats took part in the commemorative celebration.
Miners of South African and British origin were also buried during the first explosion on 19 November.
Rescuers have begun to put out a fire inside the coal mine on the South Island of New Zealand.
Police Prefect Gary Knowles told reporters that when the explosive gas masses are moved, the burning temperatures inside the mine begin to drop.
Go to hell, warrior!
Is the film Splatter an artificial film?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn explores the boundaries of the ancient genre through his film, "Walhalla Rising", the epic of the fighter.
What audience did the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think of when filming "Walhalla Rising"?
A Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) possessing only one eye is made prisoner; he frees himself from his bandit and, with an almost supernatural force, eliminates his opponents one after the other. This seems ideal for the young spectators to be used as a squirrel.
On the other hand, until the end of the film, the villain does not say a word about his real name. Even the other characters let go, at most, by the detour of one or two sentences a few dreadful cries of agony.
Otherwise, nothing is said and celebrated in the incredibly beautiful mountain landscape of Scotland which is the setting of the Viking universe, about a thousand years ago.
This would be ideal for more mature filmmakers with an interest in existentialism and excellent travellers.
When a film targets several target groups, it is a pity that they exclude each other.
The director Winding Refn is considered, since the release of "Pusher", his trilogy about the drug dealer fierce and full of style, as a kind of Danish Quentin Tarantino, but he refuses to bring a little more mood to the mainstream or introduce a little less brutality to the cinema.
Most cinematographers must experience horror in the face of the brain that spreads all around and to the intestines.
Lovers of action movies die of boredom, when the burgundy embarks, for reasons that one can freely interpret, with a group of violent Christian missionaries in a ship to Jerusalem; they are drowned for an eternity by the calm and fog of your own.
It is not surprising then that "Walhalla Rising" did not find any film distributor in Germany and that it exists only in DVD format.
It is mainly because of the magnificent images of misery that deserved some attention, but also because the image of a thrilling film, from time to time, hides behind a pretentious and bloody appearance.
It is not about dialogue in this film, nor about coherent action, everything is atmosphere, a feverish dream turned into a film.
The spectator cannot escape.
Refn barely gives him a moment of relaxation and slowly cuts his throat with glacial images and a gloomy soundtrack, but above all with an inscrutable hatred that springs from the heart of the characters.
Only a young blond boy, who stands faithfully beside the burgundy, preserves a certain innocence, all the others are animated by anger.
More than anything, the Borg hero whose mobiles are never known, but who returns from hell at any time to fight enemies and temporarily allies turning himself into a warrior, is perhaps sent by the devil himself.
It represents corruption, but perhaps also, only for those who are, anyway, rotten.
"Walhalla Rising" is an enigmatic film that one can hate or admire, which is aimed at agitation, enthusiasm and surprise.
It's a traumatic experience.
Mysterious landscaping works
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has new indications regarding a nuclear program developed by Syria.
But this country refuses to take a position on this, let alone submit to the agency's controls.
On the night of 5-6 September 2007 at midnight, at least four Israeli F-15 fighter jets attacked a mysterious cubic-shaped building on Syrian territory.
It is located on the bank of the Euphrates; the largest city located nearby is 30 kilometers away: it is Dair as-Sur.
Its name appears in the IAEA documents, as it is a question of the reactor that Syria has built seems to be with the help of North Korea in a parallelepiped of stone, hidden in a valley marked by the absence of electricity.
According to a U.S. intelligence briefing, the CIA, dated late April 2008, the current reactor, known as the nearby locality, el-Kibar, would be well suited to produce plutonium, which would make atomic weapons.
However, this technique has been valid since the 1950s.
The CIA showed a presentation video featuring blurry satellite images.
Through computer-assisted animation, it indicated the probable location of each reactor component before the destruction of the plant, which represents a miniature copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
In addition, she presented the photos showing the building located nearby, or even the interior of it.
It seems that the reactor was about to be put into operation, but it was not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the Israeli bombing, there is hardly more information available than at the time, and even with time the mystery thickens more and more.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that prior to this attack, the CIA was certain Syria had built a reactor at el-Kibar, but had little indication that the country was developing “an active nuclear weapons program.”
Some intelligence agents in Europe prefer to be more cautious about it and speak only of a “presumed reactor,” even if they consider the CIA’s presentation to be “plausible.”
They lack tangible evidence, as well as the IAEA.
Asked about how he would handle a nuclear reactor, a senior United Nations diplomat gave only a laconic answer in the summer saying that the IAEA had "sufficient documents to ask questions".
The Syrians certainly hastily removed the debris from the “unused military building” and carried out a methodical clearing of the ground.
However, in June 2008, a team of IAEA experts led by former Chief Inspector Oli Heinonen discovered traces of uranium produced by men in el-Kibar.
In addition, the IAEA has received satellite images from commercial providers through a Member State showing the moment that directly followed the attack. it seems that the latter are more eloquent than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photos are not available on the market because the anonymous sponsor, perhaps Israel, acquired them exclusively.
It is therefore impossible for the IAEA to establish their authenticity objectively.
Syria has always assured that it has never carried out a secret atomic program and that it has not built a reactor.
Damascus claims that the uranium found at the site comes from the weapons used by Israel.
But the IAEA rejected this argument after analyzing the particles by calling it unlikely.
Since then, damas has refused any discussion on this, as well as on satellite images.
In addition, Syria does not allow controllers to carry out a second inspection at the site of el-Kibar and refused access to the debris of the building destroyed by the bomb.
But even Israel keeps an obstinate silence.
Confirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, then Prime Minister in office at the time of the attack, recently said: “We will never comment on this.”
This is how the investigation into this case has been dragging in length since June 2008 without a result and is "increasingly becoming a serious problem of the credibility of the Agency", as recognized by a senior Western diplomat in service at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna.
The IAEA considers that in order to make progress, it is necessary to clarify the existence of the other three facilities that must have a "functional relationship" with the alleged reactor.
So far, the inspectors have not indicated which facilities are in question, or what their function is, or what they are suspected to contain.
According to information published by the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they are known within the IAEA respectively under the names of Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah also under the name of the neighboring cities.
The Independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington identified these locations and discovered on satellite images a complex near Masyaf that would most likely be one of the suspect objects.
It may be located in a military base or directly adjacent to it; this is exactly why Syria is refusing access to the three sites to IAEA inspectors.
In Vienna, it is said that the Syrians fear that the inspection team is actually spies who would be sent on behalf of the United States by the IAEA to spy on military installations.
In fact, it is intelligence provided by U.S. secret agents that has attracted the attention of nuclear inspectors.
The IAEA has information, including satellite photos, indicating that vehicles have made shuttles between the three sites and the stone parallelepiped in order to transport substances.
A senior Western diplomat said in Vienna that at least one of the facilities could “serve for fuel production.”
There would be "no indications of sensitive activities", such as enrichment and reprocessing of uranium; processes that are essential for the production of nuclear weapons.
This type of reactor certainly works thanks to unenriched uranium.
However, there are plausible assumptions about the following fundamental issues: where the uranium should have come from and where the plutonium needed to make the bomb would have been separated later.
It is unknown whether the gravestones, which could hide traces of great value, were stored in the three sites.
When the hundreds of trucks loaded with land are gone, no one will have information on the place where the tolls are stored.
For the IAEA, it is unlikely that Syria had in 1998 examined the al-Tibni salt mine, located just a few kilometers from al-Kibar, on the other side of the Euphrates, to see if it could be suitable for storage of radioactive waste.
In analyzing recent satellite photographs taken on behalf of the renowned Jane's Intelligence Review magazine, former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley has established a link between them and the reactor in question.
However, satellite photographs show that Syria undertook grounding work at the three suspect sites and moved huge containers when the IAEA began demanding access to these sites.
It may be a coincidence, but it has not helped to dispel suspicions.
It says in the diplomatic community that the IAEA spent several months developing a plan for the inspections to be carried out, which was intended to allow Syria to preserve possible military secrets. Only time invested shows the great interest of inspectors in this matter.
Damascus, meanwhile, has also terminated this proposal.
A year ago, if the Western diplomats in Vienna had not reported the destruction of the reactor, the emergency would not be reported for this case, says, for example, Glyn Davies, the U.S. ambassador who has been in control for a few months, who has been referring to what is known as special inspections.
The IAEA Director, Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has certainly already spoken of "an option that I am open to in the future", but he still hesitates.
This means a huge risk: on the one hand, it requires a majority in the IAEA Board of Governors, and many of the 35 countries represented there have no desire to see the situation escalate.
On the other hand, like this diplomat who gives to think: "Would it serve, if in the end they find nothing"
Love in a time of war
It’s been bad since Angelina Jolie made her summer debut as a director.
She wrote the script herself: it is a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a man of Serbian origin.
Nothing more is known about this story, but it is enough to cause discomfort.
A persistent rumor indicates that the woman, a Muslim, fell in love with her Serb butcher during the Yugoslav War.
Bosnian women's federations immediately protested, and in response, certain footage planned in Sarajevo was moved to Hungary at the last minute.
Meanwhile, the film was shot in Hungary, but in the post-production phase, protests continue in Bosnia.
According to information published in a Bosnian newspaper, Bakira Hasecic of the Organization of Women Victims of War sent a correspondence to Angelina Jolie through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and she demanded to meet the actress.
She is not a diplomat. A few weeks ago, she offered these women to meet with them in Hungary, but they rejected this offer.
"The meeting must take place in Bosnia," Hasecic said.
There have been no love stories in the concentration camps, and Jolie’s script tells long enough about her attitude towards the victims.
The Guardian reports that Hasecic's organization subsequently recommended to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to withdraw the status of goodwill ambassador to Angelina Jolie.
But, by the way, what kind of script did Jolie write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which has received copies of its script, has granted permission to shoot in Sarajevo after a few hesitations, but it is not known why it did not then come despite that permission.
The young author herself assures that she does not pursue political objectives with her film, that it is by making a lot of effort that she has made herself aware of the Yugoslav conflict. She argues that she wants to highlight the terrible consequences of the war and give the opportunity to all interested parties.
However, it remains vague about the content.
This is how a second synopsis of the film circulates on the Net. It is quite different: Lovers knew each other long before the start of the war. He meet again when the woman, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported to the Serbian concentration camp where the man works as a guard.
This makes a big difference to the version "a rape victim falls in love with her perpetrator".
That Jolie’s movie started long before the war, of course.
The pressure exerted on her, Jolie says, is “unfair and based on incorrect information.”
From now on, only Hollywood fanatics can bring him peace: By illegally putting this scenario on the Net, like so many others before.
Let's shoot!
Tonight, everything's going well with the Irish again.
No sign of consternation.
This is why the local team overly dominates visitors from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
Fans shout with joy against the background of loud music, they kick their feet.
Baileyu-Pub of Cork in southern Ireland vibrates because players throw and manage to drop table tennis balls at a distance of three meters in beer cups from the opposing team.
This bizarre show is called "pong beer" and the winner earns 500 Euros plus a plane ticket to attend the World Pong Beer Championship in Las Vegas in January.
Cian Tanner is a calm individual; this subtle drinking game and the reserved computer scientist, these two behaviors really don’t go well together.
And yet, despite this, the 26-year-old man seeks to have fun, to turn away from the terrifying question, which will lead to the future.
The pleasure of playing in Las Vegas is not in his plans, and in January he will conduct interviews in New Zealand.
“I have a strange feeling, though,” he says.
“My home country is so far away and I have no job there.”
Finally: Her girlfriend is already waiting for her in Auckland, "in less than two, she got her desired job as an event project manager, maybe a good sign," the young man says smiling.
Due to the dark prospects in the country, two of Tanner’s three sisters tried their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, lives in Sydney, and his brother Colin now holds a job as an IT consultant in London.
Young people are leaving: The situation of most families living on the island is similar to that of tanners.
Experts from the Institute for Economic and Social Research indicate that 100,000 Irish people will soon leave their country.
They even forecast a number of 200,000 emigrants by 2015.
This is a huge loss for a small country of 4.5 million people.
If these predictions are made, it will be a stream of emigration comparable to that which Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of economic boom during which the Irish enjoyed great ease, the grief is now taking its place.
The economic crisis, however, mainly affects well-trained young Irish people, who have so far only experienced moments of happiness.
The loss of employment and social decay seemed absurd in the years of economic boom.
Everyone had a job, there was a lot of money.
But in the meantime, three out of every ten people under the age of thirty are unemployed.
The Irish Times publishes the letters of readers written by young emigrants, who complain: "In Ireland, everything is drifting away."
“There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but the one who has the chances goes and our country goes for a whole generation.”
"The last one to leave turns off the light."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Student Union, sees a darker future because the government just throws dust at the eyes and offers no prospects for young people.
“They’re cutting down the minimum wage, but they don’t have any strategy to create new jobs,” says the 20-year-old student.
She sees her comrades clinging from one unpaid practical internship to another.
She says her biggest concern is to emigrate herself in four years.
"It's a sad and depressing thought."
However, men like Stephen McLarnon try to approach this topic positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo" exhibition, which offers full support on the theme "Working Abroad".
"But working abroad is an extraordinary opportunity for newcomers in the profession to take the first steps in the professional hierarchy," he said.
Its website shows photos of surfers in Australia and snow surfers in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a galley, but it also guarantees freedom and pleasure.
For six months, Se<0xC3><0xA1>n O’Donovan has known what it means to be based elsewhere.
As there was nothing more to do in Ireland for this 29-year-old engineer, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction sector in Germany.
A fashion house just comes out of the ground in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he will continue to work on other projects in Hanover or Berlin.
Meanwhile, O’Donovan rarely visits his home country, as he participates in an additional job, in order to be able to complete repaying the loan contracted to build his home in his home country.
“The situation is already a bit crazy,” he says, crossing the threshold of his home for the first time in a long time.
"I'm making money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I practically don't live anymore."
He bursts out of embarrassed laughter as he crosses the cold rooms.
The small house is located in a residential area with well-maintained front gardens, expensive cars of major brands are parked on the access roads.
Four years ago, O'Donovan bought the house in common with his sister for a sum of 380,000 Euros, financed 100 percent by credit.
“There were moments of madness, without a doubt, the money was easy,” he says.
Is he afraid to see everything collapse because of the credit?
O'Donovan reflects for a moment, drinks hot tea and says, "I don't have children to entertain and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can go back to zero."
The building engineer doesn’t like the complaints he’s often heard lately.
"No one should suffer from hunger, but our situation is not as dramatic as what we once lived here on the island," he said.
“Working abroad for a while is not what can happen worse, maybe that’s what makes us feel Irish at first.
He then laughs and talks about his father who went to England during the last major economic crisis.
“He was back after spending seven years there and, in Ireland, life just went on.”
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Leave the future and find out how life is going elsewhere.
In his handbook, He already has a few years of work in London, which is why life in New Zealand should not be so easy for him and his girlfriend.
But there is one more thing that worries him well these last few days: the party to be organized on the occasion of his 27th birthday in Dublin.
He's afraid she won't be able to turn into a goodbye night.
“Just not a lot of emotion,” he says, drinking a long sip of beer.
"Good-bye, it still seems worrying."
“Let’s call it a goodbye night, all relaxed, bringing together some friends, with a few drinks and a few games.”
The Democratic Routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to increase, as does support for private enterprise.
Crime has become a bigger concern than unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States in much of the region.
These are some of the conclusions of the latest Latinobar<0xC3><0xB3>metro survey taken in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been conducted on a regular basis since 1995, it monitors changes in attitudes in the region.
Two related elements emerge from the results of this year's survey, carried out in September and early October.
The first is the rather sunny mood of Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries around the Pacific of South America (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6% per year since 2002, support for democracy has gone from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It has also increased in Mexico, where the economy has recovered after suffering a sharp decline in production last year.
But only about half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the region, are convinced Democrats, which lowers the regional average (see Table 2).
Some 44% of respondents in the region said they were satisfied with the way their country's democracy worked in practice; this was the same figure as last year, but with a sharp increase from 25% in 2001 (Chart 3)
Some 34% said they had confidence in the Parliament of their country and 45% in their government, the same as last year in both cases; but a strong increase compared to 2003 (respectively 17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, the economic problems in Latin America shook the support for democracy.
If this has held up well during the global financial crisis, it is certainly due to the fact that many countries in America suffered only a brief recession and benefited from a strong recovery.
In addition, a social security network has helped protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty increased only slightly in 2009 and fell again this year, to 32%.)
But the mood varies considerably from country to country (see graph 4).
Brazil’s good economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz In<0xC3><0xA1>cio Lula da Silva, translates into a widely shared sense of progress
This is rarer in Mexico and Central America where the recession has been more severe and violent crimes have worsened.
It is only the second time since the survey began that more respondents across Latin America as a whole have cited crime rather than unemployment as the most important problem for their country (see Table 5).
Approximately 31% say that they or a loved one of them have been the victim of a crime in the past year; however, this figure is down from 38% last year and is the lowest since 1995.
A more robust economic performance is reflected in the rise in support for private enterprise and the market economy: about 71% of respondents in the region say that private enterprise is essential for development, compared with 56% in 2007 (see Figure 6).
Some 58% believe that the market economy is the only system that will make their country developed, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela are of this opinion (and 80% support private enterprise); although their left-leaning president, Hugo Chavez, expropriates many private companies.
Brazil is the largest leader in the region, mentioned by 19% of respondents (against 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged from last year) and Venezuela (9%, down from 11% last year)
But the United States is considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and most of Central America, while Venezuela enjoys this distinction in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A polluted vote
No one expected to have a perfect general election in Haiti on November 28.
But it was far worse than the outsiders who wanted to help the sinister country and plunged into fear.
Voting boxes and a new vote were presented, ballot papers scattered across the polling stations, polling stations looted and intimidation
The polling stations were open late in the evening.
Many Haitians, including many who were displaced as a result of the January earthquake, would err in the neighborhood to find where to vote.
Some of them ended up giving up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several alleged favorites, denounced the fraud and called for the election to be cancelled.
Protests, sometimes violent, exploded across the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, a senior United Nations official in Haiti, considered the event “a pretty good election in many respects.”
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community cautiously stated that they “did not believe that these irregularities, no matter how serious, necessarily invalidated the process.”
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, whose opponents are due to René Préval, the outgoing unpopular president, and his candidate, Jude Célestin, is due to announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The second round is scheduled for January.
All hope in the election is not lost.
The two opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rap musician, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, withdrew from their initial call for the vote to be declared null.
But there may be problems if Mr. Celestin, who has little or no noticeable support among voters, is declared by the electoral authority as having reached the second toura to reach the second round.
With a cholera epidemic raging, and more than 1 million earthquake survivors still living in tents, we feared participation would be.
In this case, many Haitians wanted to vote but were prevented from doing so because of the disorganization.
Nearly 250,000 ID cards needed to vote were not yet distributed shortly before the election.
The issue is important.
Donors see the election of a legitimate and popular government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And so, of course, the Haitians do it themselves.
The tip of the feet towards the center
The weeks after she suddenly became a widow, Cristina Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, president of Argentina, benefited from a wave of public sympathy that improved her approval rate by 20 points, to more than 50%; this is her highest level since she was elected in 2007.
Yet, turning this into a successful campaign for a second term in an election next year might depend on Ms. Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez’s choice, apparently in mourning, whether or not she would abandon the intransigence of her late husband, predecessor and former political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And, in this regard, the signs remain confused.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to run economic policy even after his wife succeeded him as president, had a habit of drawing up budgets that underestimated tax revenue, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend additional income at will.
Ms. Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez’s government lost its majority in Congress last year, on paper.
But the opposition is divided, and the situation has plunged into disarray following the death of Mr. Kirchner from a heart attack on October 27.
Some of the dissident members of the Peronist movement in power joined Ms. Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez.
But after chaotic sessions (where a parliamentarian hit one of his peers in the face and where others accused the government of corruption), Congress does not have to approve the 2011 budget.
“I’m not going to argue,” the president said.
Currently, the 2010 budget will be implemented next year, leaving the president still more room for manoeuvre to spend at will.
The economy is overheating widely: it is likely to grow by almost 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is now at 11.1%, but many private estimates and union wage claims see this figure close to 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina feared an economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction a priority, rather than controlling inflation.
He refused to deal with the IMF, he harassed the private sector and purged INDEC, the statistical office, which carried out falsifications of official inflation statistics.
Can Mrs. Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez now moderate these policies?
She called for talks between private companies and trade union leaders.
And his officials say they want to limit wage increases next year to 18%.
The economy has been stimulated by high global prices of Argentina's agricultural exports.
But inflation eroded the boom in growth as a result of a strong devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps that is why Ms. Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez shows signs of wanting to restore Argentina's financial relations with the rest of the world.
This year, the government reached an agreement with bondholders who had refused a previous forced debt restructuring for which Argentina had not settled its dues in 2001.
Now Ms. Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez seems to be edging towards an agreement with creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which it owes some $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners have always insisted that this could not involve monitoring by the IMF, as is customary.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy, announced that the Fund would provide "technical assistance" to design a new national consumer price index; which resembles a prelude to the sanitation of the INDEC.
It is not clear if Ms. Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez wants to remain in politics beyond the end of her term, now that her husband is no longer with her.
If she does, she needs to gain the support of the middle class, among which kirchnerism is highly proponent.
When the Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy for her will have refluxed.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether to reject, without noise, many of her husband’s policies.
A Half-Blood for China
Taiwanese voters are gearing towards a kind of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother located on the other side of the Strait?
More than 7.5 million voters on November 27, or 70% of eligible people, came forward to elect mayors and municipal councillors in five urban districts, as part of what is considered a general assessment of the president, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma himself has become a substitute for feelings toward the continent, having established innovative business ties, including a partial free trade pact, in the largest reorganization of relations with China proper since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but just right.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) won three of the five mayors, he failed to win the majority of the votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which aimed for complete independence of Taiwan, won nearly 50% of all votes for the KMT of 45%.
If it had been a presidential election, Mr. Ma would have been in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party’s vote share has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP has attracted voters, even with the KMT in municipal councils.
The event revealed most of the main subjects of Taiwan’s elections, including tacky country trucks and mass gathering flags with girls dancing in minimal costume.
An attempted obligatory mysterious assassination was also perpetrated.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, honorary president of the KMT, held an election tour for a KMT candidate on the eve of the election.
A man from the crowd shot the young Mr. Link, purely through the face, wounding him and killing a passerby.
Bizarrely, it was not determined whether the shooter wanted to hurt Mr. Link or settle a dispute with the candidate.
Anyway, says Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PDP, the murder had consequences on the election by directing suspicion on the DPP and turning voters to the KMT.
Perhaps the biggest winner of the election was China.
It was striking to see how much the question of the continental part itself was absent.
Instead, the candidates played with plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates China’s military threat.
Thus, the KMT tends to avoid paralyzing its ties with the Beijing government.
But this time, the DPP also refrained from appeasing the anti-Chinese sentiment.
This is the response to a new awareness that Chinese companies are essential to Taiwan’s economic survival.
Mr. Ma, for his part, demanded confirmation as to whether his policy on China was acceptable to the Taiwanese majority.
It can be expected that the Beijing government will continue to provide trade facilities, in line with its strategy to lure Taiwan back to the brink.
China has not wasted time sending a negotiator to Taipei to organize a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Of course, she would also like to see political integration; but let’s start at the beginning.
It is better to wait for this after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP was reinvented anyway.
Two years ago, he was wrong: his former leader, Chen Shui-bian, had been sent to prison on corruption charges.
From 2000 to 2008, he was a provocateur of explicit independence.
But a new generation of moderators was born under the leadership of Ms. Tsai and the PDP is making every effort to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai was hailed as a DPP presidential candidate, as was Su Tseng-chang, who served under Mr. Chen.
Their party is doing its best to show that they too can engage with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai announced plans for a panel of experts to act as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided that their interviews can take place without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai told the Taiwanese public that her party presented a "trustworthy alternative" to Mr. Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems exasperated by this change.
In a statement released from his cell, he stated that PDP candidates would have achieved better results if they had insisted that Taiwan is a separate country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatist, not to fight for the presidency.
Even without Mr. Chen's intervention, the DPP will have a hard time choosing among its potential candidates.
The KMT needs to do an introspection of itself.
Mr. Ma's assessments were poor; despite dizzying economic growth, KMT candidates did not want to campaign with him.
Its unpopularity appears to be largely due to unemployment and the widening gap between rich and poor.
A KMT spokesperson said its office and local antennas will be refurbished.
The good results of the PDP suggest that Taiwan’s support for the rapprochement is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, an eminent editorialist, "the point of no return has already passed."
Grammy Awards nominations: jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise selected in the category "Best New Artist"
Perform at the request of a president, and people are required to take note of it.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer hand picked by President Obama to perform at his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, marked one of the Grammy Awards surprises this year with a major nomination in the "Best New Artist" category.
Considering Spalding is a well-known figure on the jazz scene since his 2008 album, "Esperanza", the nomination remains a bit mysterious but it is compatible with the rules of the Grammy Awards that an artist should not release more than three albums before recording; which "establishes this identity."
His ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", certainly marked a step forward and, given his slightly engaging vocal style, his skillful hand of pop and funk and his Latin influences, it is possible to draw at least a dotted line in at least this year's Spalding sprint for these years counting on the successes of A.M. in the productions of more fulminating Norah Jones in 2003.
Elsewhere, Grammy Awards voters rightly honored Vijay Iyer Trio’s “Historicity” in the “instrumental album” category, a twist on a refreshing thriller from a recording that was one of last year’s primordial favourites.
Among these Iyer, veteran saxophonist James Moody's "Moody 4B" and keyboardist John Beasley's "Positootly" will be in competition.
Trombone Shorty, a favorite of New Orleans' raucous voice and frequent guest on HBO's "Treme", was honored in the contemporary jazz category; which also leans strongly toward a certain fusion with the albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Wilder Darcy James Argue's Secret Society, familiar with steampunk, has won some well-deserved recognition in the big ensemble category; in competition with Billy Childs Ensemble's rich chamber-jazz and the eternal adventurer Dave Holland whose album "Pathways" was both a bassist and a live example of his octet's hand.
Grammy Awards nomination: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey lead in classic categories
The classic nominations for the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards feature a mix of landscapes by musicians and composers from all over the world.
At the top of the nominations are Michael Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra, with five "yes"; and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an electric orchestral work, with three "yes".
Among the nominees with links to Southern California is the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his Symphony No. 4, "Los Angeles", a work that was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra and which opened the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The Los Angeles-based composer Avner Dorman's Madolin Concerto is also competing for an award.
The classical nominations are divided into 13 categories covering orchestral, opera, choral and solo recordings.
A category for the classic producer of the year features five candidates: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Nominations for the classical album are Chicago Symphonies n<0xC2><0xB0>3 and 4 by Bruckner of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" by Daugherty of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; "Dreamhouse" by Steven Mackey and the Boston Modern Orchestra's "Cacrical Project" and "Metropolis Symphony" by Daugherty of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra.
In the opera category, the nominees are "Lulu" by Berg of the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House, "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Adolf Hasse of the Ars Lyrica Houston; "L'Amour de Far" by Kaija Saariaho of the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester, and "The Enchanted Wanderer".
Composers who are in place for the Grammy Awards for contemporary composition include Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatame Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Wanderer Enchanted".
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 in a performance recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The work of about 30 minutes is nicknamed "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" was nominated for his solo instrumental performance with an orchestra.
The Los Angeles composer said he soon wrote the 15-minute work specifically for the mandolinist Avi Avital, who played the concert with the Metropolis Ensemble, based in New York.
“I wrote it using sounds from the Middle East and a large number of North African gamuts and rhythms,” Dorman said in a telephone interview.
Orchestra conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the category of orchestral performances, for conducting the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in a recording of Stravinsky's works.
Instrumental soloists who received a nomination include pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs, violinist Julia Fischer and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
This year, there are only solo-vocalist nominees: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucie Duchonov<0xC3><0xA1>, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category of classic mixes, soprano Jessye Norman received a nomination for her recording "Roots: My Life, My Song"
The Temecula Mosque project has been approved by the Planning Commission.
A mosque project in Temecula received unanimous support from the local planning commission after more than five hours of public testimony, often passionate.
Critics took up the project by claiming that it was promoting both terrorism and traffic congestion.
But the commissioners ruled Wednesday night that the new religious center respected local laws and would be aesthetically impressive.
“A lot of people have come to support it: Christians, Jews, Baha’is, you mention it,” Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic Centre of Temecula Valley, said Thursday morning.
"I am proud of it, as an American citizen."
"It shows that justice wins it."
“The opposition is really minimal,” he added.
“They just have very loud voices.”
"We have good people in this valley."
The session began at 6 p.m. and lasted until almost midnight with, most of the time, people pronouncing for or against the center, at roughly equally distributed speaking time, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper’s website.
“There is no longer America,” wrote one speaker.
"This is another planet of monkeys with Miss Liberty dead in the sand."
"America has fallen."
Planned Islamic centres also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including at Ground Zero, the site of the September 11, 2001 attacks in New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmoush has denounced violence in the Temecula Valley.
Her congregation of about 135 families co-existed without incident in Riverside County for years but she wanted a larger and better space than the warehouse she rented on a shared property with a water filtration system manufacturer.
The new 24,943-square-foot mosque in Mediterranean-style architecture would consist of two minarets and would rise to 43 feet high.
It would occupy a 4.32-hectare site on the Nicolas road about two miles east of Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal against this project to the municipal council.
An arsenic-tolerant microbe raises the possibility of new types of life on Earth, or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange bacterium, which can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, widens the field to find new forms of life on Earth and perhaps beyond.
Although researchers have discovered the unusual bacterium here on Earth, they say it shows that life has possibilities beyond the major elements that have been considered essential.
"This organism has a double capacity."
"It can develop either with phosphorus or with arsenic."
"That's why it's very particular, even if it's far from being a really "foreign" form of life," commented Paul Davies C. W. of Arizona State University, co-author of the report featured in Thursday's online edition of the journal Science.
Six major elements have long been considered essential for life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
But researchers have found that the bacterium, discovered in Lake Mono, California, is able to continue to grow after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
“We wonder what’s still possible,” said Ariel Anbar D. of the State University of Arizona, co-author of the report.
The discovery is important in the search for life beyond Earth because researchers need to be able to recognize life, to know what life looks like, says Anbar.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the announcement of a press conference to discuss it, which did not disclose the details of the finding, has generated widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could disclose the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
That was not the case.
The discovery "shows that, in other planetary environments, organisms may be able to use other elements to actuate biochemistry and that the "standard" set of elements, which we consider absolutely necessary for life, may not be fixed," said Charles Cockell, Scythian Professor at the Opentiut.
Cockell wasn't part of the research team.
“This work is new because it shows the substitution of one element to another in fundamental biochemistry and biochemical structure,” Cockell added.
It was not a fateful discovery.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA’s Institute of Astrology, who led the study, chose Lake Mono because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar; thus, she speculated that a microbe exposed to the two substances might be able to replace each other.
"Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is really similar to that of phosphorus."
"As a result, organisms have difficulty distinguishing these elements separately."
“But arsenic is different enough that it doesn’t work exactly like phosphorus; it penetrates inside and somehow rubbers the work of our biochemical machine,” Anbar explained.
The researchers collected the bacterium known as GFAJ-1 and exposed it to increasing concentrations of arsenic to which it was able to adapt and grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus but the fact that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that a life form using arsenic can occur naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or the moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said the idea that arsenic could be replaced by phosphorus was not new; but nothing ever showed that it could work.
Arsenic was more common at the beginning of the Earth’s existence, she says; thus, researchers have hypothesized that the first forms of life could have used it.
This suggests that there could be other ways to form life, not just the way life on Earth was formed in the beginning,” said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon’s research team.
The research was funded by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Institute of Health.
The last two stolen exhibit dogs were found in Compton
The two other exhibit dogs on four burglars outside a Bellflower motel were found, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office said on Thursday.
The four exhibit dogs — two Akitas and two Welsh Pembroke Corgis — disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole the Chevrolet Express van in which they had spent the night outside a Bellflower Motel 6, authorities said.
Two of the dogs were recovered Wednesday afternoon and the other two were found late Wednesday evening, said Steve Whitmore, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
“The good news is that dogs are doing well,” Whitmore said.
"They're in good shape."
"They have been returned to their legitimate owners."
Whitmore refused to say exactly where the dogs had been found, in what neighborhood and what the circumstances of their discovery were.
"An investigation is underway."
“We don’t want to say that,” Whitmore said.
“We follow the orders.”
The owners of the dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be joined to provide a comment Thursday.
They were gathered Wednesday afternoon with their two Akitas at a county animal shelter in Downey.
The sheriff's assistants found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
The Akitas - a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old female - were healthy and safe, authorities said.
But Bunny and Peter, the corgis Rickard and Peek had planned to show at regional competitions this week, on behalf of the owners of Japanese dogs, were missing until their discovery Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend as part of Long Beach’s AKC/Eukanuba National Championship, where they were expected to introduce Trace.
The other dogs were expected to participate in competitions of other events scheduled in the days before the "AKC/Eukanuba" exhibition, Peek told the Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops of the couple's nearly a month-long dog show tour.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked into the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their van outside, right next to their bedroom window.
They took three other dogs – a Boxer puppy, a Parson Russell Terrier and a Breton Spaniel – who stayed with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and the corgis, with thicker fur, in the van where it would be cooler.
They opened the windows a bit, so the dogs could have some fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the truck's theft at 6 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek said they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the corgis, equipped with an implanted microchip to identify them.
It is unclear whether a prize was awarded on Thursday.
The lion is ready to turn red again, the restructuring of MGM no longer awaits the final green light of the court
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green light to start from scratch.
A federal bankruptcy judge in New York officially praised Thursday's "pre-packed" plan by creditors that about $5 billion in debt would be cleared; paving the way for the entertainment company, having 86 years of existence and broadcasting film, to focus its distribution and production efforts.
With the decision on Thursday that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy code, there are no longer any legal hurdles before MGM to get back under the supervision of the founders of Entertainment Spyglass, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become a direct studio.
Staff will be reduced to approximately 320 out of 400 starting.
MGM will not actually emerge from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase has completed a $500 million credit facility to fund MGM’s new operations and productions.
It is currently distributed under license by the investment bank, which itself is worth $75 million, and is expected to be financed by mid-December.
The process of restructuring the studio began in May 2009 when investment bank Moelis & Co. was hired to advise the management on how to place its finances since it did not have the means to pay interest of $300 million per year.
In August, the CEO, Harry Sloan, was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and a rectification expert known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper’s attempts to solve MGM’s financial difficulties and satisfy the studio’s more than 140 creditors took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties agreed, at the end of 2009, to put the company up for sale.
However, the auction attracted few bidders, none of whom were willing to pay the additional $2 billion that the creditors were looking for.
In the spring of this year, everything had to be reworked as the MGM team started working on a restructuring plan that, after months of internal disagreements and debates, was finally approved by the creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially leaves bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelis and Cooper receive multi-million-dollar rewards for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already earned $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper's companies, which raised $375,000 a month for their management services, will receive a "success bonus" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum are planning to relaunch production of MGM, which has released only one film this year, and set up an annual list of seven or eight films to be released from 2012.
They also intend to co-finance two films based on "The Hobbit", with Warner Bros.
The studio must make a separate loan between $265.000.000 and $275 million to finance its share in these two films, which must be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who holds about 18% of MGM’s debt, attempted to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the main shareholder.
However, the recent discussions between the two companies did not lead to an agreement.
Tech Toys to Keep Your Budget Gifts in Balance
Although the main candidate for this year’s most wonderful toy is IPAD, followed, perhaps, by Microsoft’s video game system, Kinect, both can make a major break in your gift budget.
Consider that, for the price of an iPad, you can buy five BMX bikes for $99 and a Kinect game costs the same price as 10 classic beads jumping ropes, or about 48 Play-Doh boxes.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance.
Recently, I visited three national toy sellers - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club - to see the electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
It’s clear that Moore’s Law has evolved, this year’s tech toy is likely to have more strength; while costing the same price, if not a little less, compared to last year.
In addition, while there are generally fewer new toys associated with websites, two of the best known of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And button battery toys are on the rise, as well as rechargeable battery toys.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise indicated.)
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for 3 years and older) are plumber-sized toys the size of an Indian pig that sing a note when you squeeze them on the belly.
One pressure is equal to one note, and a second makes it possible to compose a song.
If you buy several of them, they will sing in harmony.
Attention: once you start pushing, you can no longer stop.
To combine singing with dancing, Dance Mickey Star (Fisher-Price, $60 for 2 years and older) is the best choice.
Inspired by last year’s Elmo Live technology, the 14-inch animatronic doll plays turn-based role-playing games like Simon Says and can do lunar dance thanks to its innovative articulated feet with wheel locking.
The children who have tried the toy use Mickey as a dance instructor while their parents complain about a lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, you will remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
It’s back (Hasbro/Playskool, $40 for 3 years and more), with a backpack filled with questionable playing cards designed to turn a ride into a session with a self-correction and a valve booklet.
If you are distrustful when your child holds your smartphone, here are three standalone alternatives.
The VTech Mobigo ($60, for 3 to 8-year-olds) is the cheapest and easiest to use, with a qwerty keyboard, although the games don’t educate as effectively as the Explorer Leapster ($70, for 3 to 12-year-olds), it’s the first major revision of the Leapster range and more reminiscent, with a screen.
No version is compatible with the old cartridges.
The iXL from Fisher-Price ($90, for 3-7 year olds) uses an iTunes-type system to offer games and ebooks and features an SD card input that allows you to view family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for 8 years and older) is a set of five blocks barely larger than a light box, each with its own LED display.
The goal is to form words by placing the blocks online before time runs out, it is ideal for an impromptu spelling contest.
Increasingly, toys have a kind of online connection.
Based solely on their presence in toy stores, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child a Penguin Club pet online, for example, you can get a Penguin Disney Club 2"Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, for 6-12 year olds) which includes a piece marked with a hidden code.
When you purchase the code online, your child receives enough credits at the Club Penguin store for two items of choice.
It can be roller skates or a pet toy puffle.
Slightly larger than the hair at the end of your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($10, for 5 years and more) is the latest button-battering micro-robot.
The false beast moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone pastes in random directions.
It’s fun to do a maze of blocks to see if she can find her way through.
It is also solid.
Ours resisted a fall from the kitchen table and even a momentary passage in the mouth of our dog.
Bringing a softer side to maintaining order in China
Tang Shenbin ran a town square like an urban sergeant in training by strictly inspecting his nervous loads, issuing low-pitched orders with a military authority.
He wanted the female members of chengguan – imposing public order officials in China, feared and despised for their arbitrary repression and inclination for violence – to convey a certain impression to a set of spectators.
"Hold on!"
"Be piercing!"
Show them, he said, "what pretty girls look like!"
Four girls who had barely spent their adolescence in white gloves, dressed in identical olive-coloured jackets and pants, were staring at you.
Four pairs of black heeled shoes, aligned with the rule.
Four perfectly groomed hats perched at the top of hair attached by a striped knot in blue and white.
“Personally, I think they have an average appearance,” said Tang, disdainfully.
"The models are pretty."
More than one government has tried to refresh the image of China’s urban inspectors.
One city required all new recruits to have a graduate degree.
The province of Guangdong has exchanged the gray-green of the uniforms for a more engaging blue.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced the eyelashes in the strong way: in 2009, a report reported that 50 officers surrounded an uncontrollable snack cart by throwing black eyes, firmly for half an hour, until the colporteur packs his stuff and leaves.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 people in Chengdu, chose to do a large imaging operation.
Since 2003, the district has completed its street police in the urban environment of 13 women, specially chosen for their appearance, yellow and young age.
The idea is to give the police a softer, more feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson could have difficulty getting a look at this underground urban brigade of China
And for that reason, the critics will say.
Unlike the police, these officers are only allowed to enforce municipal orders by imposing fines or other administrative sanctions.
But the Chinese media are portraying the news of a different reality.
In January 2008, inspectors in Hubei province beat an observer to death after he used his cell phone to film them dispersing a protest against a waste disposal.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing inspectors, stolen and put online, describes how to effectively defeat offenders without shedding blood.
This year in Shanghai, a watermelon smuggler was abandoned with a brain injury after a fight with five officers.
A violence-ridden video game, available for online download, shows Chinese inspectors trained in assaulting street vendors.
"Chengguan has marked the government," last year's China Daily, a national publication, lamented after a second controversy over the tactics.
The newspaper called for a "true complete cleanup."
Skeptics say the approach is far from over.
After the district passed an announcement in October to find eight new female recruits, an editorial, appearing in The Beijing Evening News, wondered whether the women had real tasks or were they just a tourist entertainment.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district's announcement required female candidates, aged 18 to 22, to have a beautiful silhouette and "the five face traits in the right order."
They must have a height above average, i.e. 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 inches.
Retirement at the age of 26 is mandatory.
The officers said the work was physically too painful for women over 25.
“It’s their image that matters,” a district official told Rednet.com, a quasi-government website.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they are appropriate; they are the size, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes the temperament and the "inner qualities."
Chengguan women are like flower vases, he said, adding: "In addition to being vases, they will have other responsibilities.
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the city's district management office, does not adhere to this description.
But he noted that height requirements were the standard in many Chinese job offers for both sexes.
This is the case of the requirement relating to the order of the facial features.
That it means beautiful is a subject of debate among the Chinese.
Of course, people with disabilities or deformed should not apply.
“We can’t let a boxing person or a boss come here to serve,” Zheng said.
"It wouldn't give a good image."
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old and has cheeks doweled with a finely curved mouth.
She does not consider highlighting her appearance as being sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked for a smoky look.
Xu Yang, his 21-year-old co-founder, said: “Our job is to present the image of the city.”
They are not opposed to limiting their mandate, they said, because they feed on greater career ambitions than simply chasing sellers into the streets where they are supposed to limit their business.
Every morning, the team faces a dozen walkers who move quickly on foot or by bike, trying to sell as much bread or tofu as possible before escaping.
"Mr. Wang, you have to go."
“We’ve already told you several times!” said Ms. Xu as a salesman ran away on foot, temporarily giving up his noodle bike.
Agents describe their functions as monotonous rather than hard.
“It’s about the same thing every day,” said 20-year-old Huang Jing, who studies post-work marketing.
"Great routine."
One of the reasons is that female agents do not have the power of their male counterparts to confiscate the goods from sellers.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their male superiors.
This tends to protect them from public expositions of sudden animosity against bureaucracy that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, revolted after false rumors spread that Chengguan agents had killed a salesman.
In one night, more than a dozen Chengguan police and officers were injured, 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
Xindu has so far escaped such violence.
But calm is hardly guaranteed.
Just two blocks from the placid Baoguang Square, where female officers were patrolling that morning, more than 50 people gathered around the corner.
Officers confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk rather than in a store, as required by regulations.
The owner of the bike shouted at the scandal.
A 15-minute iron arm followed before the policemen, with a sinister face, smashed a road with elbows to their vehicle and left at full speed with the bike and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator attached to the men's team, stayed behind, his white badge returned to hide his name.
Like female officers, coordinators – men aged 40 or older – play a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not formed in order to maintain a waxy image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
“Sometimes we fight physically,” Mr. Li said in a neutral tone.
“Most of the time, it’s the audience that starts.”
Prosecutors will not charge Senator Ensign
Prosecutors at the Department of Justice have lifted the criminal charges brought against Senator John Ensign, stemming from a case related to a former campaign assistant and his efforts to get a lobbying job for the woman's husband, the senator's lawyers announced on Wednesday.
The decision ends the most serious legal threat faced by Ensign, the Nevada Republican who was considered a possible Republican candidate in the 2012 presidential election until the scandal around his case made headlines last year and damaged his career.
Mr. Ensign’s office said he was “very happy” with the decision, the result of a one-year investigation.
The senator could still be exposed to disciplinary measures taken by the Senate Ethics Committee.
Mr. Ensign’s lawyers said the Justice Department had “informed that Senator Ensign was no longer the subject of the investigation and that he had no intention of maintaining any charges against him in this case.”
The Ministry of Justice abstained from commenting on the matter.
The announcement came as a sort of surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Department of Justice, according to which there is significant evidence that Mr. Ensign has conspired to violate a federal criminal prohibition on lobbying.
Interviews, emails, and other documents, first reported in the New York Times in October 2009, indicated that Mr. Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, get a lucrative lobbying job with her husband to win the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife Cyn.
Ms. Hampton once served as a treasurer during an Ensign campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political funders to find work for Mr. Hampton and then defended their rights after they hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them; according to documents and interviews.
Since Mr. Hampton had recently been an employee of Mr. Ensign, he was prohibited by law from lobbying with his former employer or the Senate as a whole for a year.
Ethics experts have argued that the unusual agreement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were close friends before the case, seems to contradict the so-called ban on lobbying.
According to the evidence that was made public, “there appears to be prima facie evidence of a conspiracy to violate and substantial violation of the law of the revolving door,” said Stanley Brand, a Washington attorney who specializes in defending clients from a government investigation.
Although the judge of the department refused to explain the reasoning leading to the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other lawyers in ethics said that the department appeared to be disrespectful of political prosecutions after a number of reversals followed by the decision of the high-level indictment of Steve.
Federal prosecutors are clearly afraid to take up arms, said Melanie Sloan, the general director of Citizen Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a defense group that received several complaints against Ensign in the case.
"This basically says high-ranking government officials can now assume the laws don't apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, Ensign’s principal attorney, said in an interview that he had received a phone call from a prosecutor at the Department of Justice and follow-up the next day, telling him that the department was not seeking charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign’s team of lawyers had cooperated with prosecutors to try to persuade them that the senator, as his office reaffirmed in a statement Wednesday, “had acted in accordance with the law.”
Mr. Coggins declined to specify the legal arguments he had made to the prosecution.
“I’m not comfortable going into the details of my discussions with the Department of Justice, except to say that we think they’ve made the right decision,” he said.
Last month, the Federal Elections Commission decided to drop an investigation following an independent complaint by the ethics group, arguing that Mr. Ensign’s $96,000 payment to the Hamptons violated federal electoral law.
The Electoral Commission said it did not have enough evidence to prove that money was anything but a gift.
NV Energy, a major Nevada company that has long supported the senator, is a company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find lobbying jobs.
An email sent in December 2008 showed that, after the company welcomed Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensign’s chief of staff, John Lopez, contacted Mr. Hampton and told him that he was “hammering” the Department of the Interior on a matter in dispute.
Mr. Ensign also attended a lunch with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada client, Allegiant Air, and asked the Secretary of Transportation to set up a meeting on behalf of the airline after hiring Mr. Hampton to lobby.
When news of the case surfaced last year, Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned from his fourth-ranking Republican leadership position in the Senate.
After maintaining a low profile for several months, Mr. Ensign said two weeks ago that he intended to run for a third term in the Senate.
In announcing that Mr. Ensign was no longer the target of a criminal investigation, his spokesperson, Jennifer Cooper, said the senator hoped that the ethics committee would quickly follow the example of the Department of Justice and end its investigation.
Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada, she says.
Cheshire's call will point to Twitter
A half-dozen of them were typing away in the rows of the courtroom.
They were sending every minute reports of horrific testimonies via Twitter.
In the end, the defense said there were more than 140,000 messages about the rape case and the children attached to their bed in a house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, the widely followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was found guilty of the murder of three members of the Cheshire family, in Connecticut, is expected to result in an official end where the judge would impose the death penalty, voted by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already filed evidence in the court that outlines appeal arguments that could occupy the courts for years.
What is provocative is that intense reporting on the trial — as well as widespread and widespread use by Twitter journalists — has created a “cirque atmosphere”—a saturation so widespread and instantaneous with incendiary details that the jury has been badly influenced by the passions of the public.
The request could prompt appellate judges to debate whether new technologies require new rules in the courtrooms.
"I have experienced this in this trial; I think there is a real danger that the introduction of new technologies in the courtrooms is infringing on human rights in a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullmann, Mr. Hayes' attorney.
The trial judge, Jon C. Bleue of the State Superior Court, laconicly rejected the claims in the ruling last week, claiming that the media were “carefully controlled” and that there was no evidence that the jury was animated by passion.
But that does not seem to be the last word on the matter.
Courts of Appeal have recognized for decades that media coverage of notorious cases can raise questions about the fairness of a trial.
In a 1966 ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the conviction of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, arguing in his decision that there was a "carnival atmosphere at trial" because of the media.
The crime is considered by some to have been the inspiration for the television show and the film "The fugitive".
Some lawyers have stated that the appellate courts seized to reconsider Mr. Hayes' conviction half a century later may be curious given the argument that new rules may be needed to manage the means of communication in the courtrooms, unimaginable at the time of Dr. Shepp's case.
“There is a general reason to worry about the impact of new media” in large-scale trials, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that it was arbitrarily applied.
Professor Donohue argues that some appellate judges may be intrigued by the idea that limiting instant communication from courtrooms could allow for fairer trials.
The Twitter case is just one of many others described by Mr. Hayes’ lawyers, likely to be discussed for years; which delays execution.
Defense lawyers also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes would have suffered an injury when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them macabre photos of crime scenes during the jury selection.
Some of the judges said they were horrified by the photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11.
Defense lawyers claim that they will also challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and that they will argue that the judge unjustly expelled one of the jurors, who had been critical of prosecutors, and that he abusively put pressure on a verdict by making an unusual jurorial decision.
The jurors were not kidnapped.
But their arguments about the effect of the intense media coverage of the trial could be the biggest source of interest.
They noted in a protest against the verdict, filed last month, that the case dominated the media scene in Connecticut and that it was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for the governorship and the United States Senate.
They maintained that the computer media continued to ignite the flames of the emotion of the case.
“The daily gossip of the tweets of the media, cameras and journalists in front of the courthouse,” the lawyers wrote, “didn’t look like anything that had been seen here before, in New Haven, and perhaps even nationally.”
Their focus on the coverage of the Twitter system is controversial.
In the interviews, some journalists stated that the claim, that the new snapshots were more incendiary than the statements handed down more slowly, was a ludicrous view that would impair the Court’s policy governing media coverage of future trials.
But some lawyers said that the appeals courts were often attracted to the arguments that social and technological changes required adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayes' lawyers insist on this claim.
In their case, they refer to the Supreme Court decision of 1966 that overturned Dr. Sheppard's conviction because of the media coverage of the trial and they stated that they would invoke the need for new rules for the new media.
“This case,” they wrote, “represents that of Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21st century.”
Is it possible for civilization to close the gaps?
After a campaign marked by invective and negativity, a minimum of civilisation erupted in Washington this week.
Is this a precursor to true bipartisan cooperation forward or an illusory moment before the quick return to the partisan struggle in the capital?
Tuesday’s meeting between President Obama and Congressional leaders produced no breakthrough on the major issues to be addressed during the “boxy duck” session.
But obviously, there has been at least a polite discussion about the differences between the two parties as well as the recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than another episode where each camp wanted to score points.
The President’s deficit committee’s public meeting on Wednesday was equally civilized, despite the political divergences that remain between members.
It seems clear that the close interaction of several months has created mutual respect that transcends the ideological gap; but which, however, still divides the members.
This is hardly enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
The two sides are now in a period of trial and trial with a view to obtaining signs of cooperation and compromise, while attempting to assess the limits of public opinion and voters' patience for a renewed partisan war.
That's why Tuesday's meeting and subsequent comments from the participants revealed a minimum of requirements or charges.
The philosophical differences between Obama and Republicans are too big and too deep to suggest a rapid climate change that has existed over the past two years.
Whether it is taxation, expenses, health care or rights, both parties remain miles away.
However, the November election had moderated Washington, at least in the short term.
“There is no doubt that things have changed on the tone,” said Pete Wehner, an official with the Bush administration, now alongside the Ethical and Public Policy Center.
“It’s inevitable after the election.
Elections arouse partisan passions, and then they fade away.
That's good."
On some issues, including those on the agenda of the "boxy duck" session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush’s tax cuts will expire by the end of the year, and no one is in favor of it.
Both parties want to find a way to preserve some or all of them, permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, a compromise is conceivable on the extension of unemployment benefits, if only because Republicans cannot afford to give the impression that they are in favour of tax cuts for the rich, while denying unemployment benefits to unemployed workers.
After Tuesday's meeting at the White House, more optimism is being expressed about a possible agreement on the issues raised during the session on the "boxy duck", with the ratification of the "New START" pact.
But William Galston, of the Brookings Institution, warns that successful cooperation on the most pressing issues of the “lame duck” session will not necessarily lead to a better understanding between the two parties when the 112th Congress meets in January.
Instead, he says, a period of disagreement is probable, if not inevitable.
“Once the things that need to be done will be, psychology in the short term will return to one of the confrontations,” he said.
Wehner also expressed his widely shared skepticism that civilization would lead to true co-operation.
"I consider most of what's going on between today and 2012 as a pre-show or shadow-boxing compared to the main event of 2012," he said.
The reasons for this are closely related to the composition of the new Republican majority in the House and the constituents present at the tea that contributed to its creation.
However, Republican leaders are aware of the dangers if they go too far, they know that they must try to keep up with their promises of cutting public spending and repealing the new Health Care Act.
These partisan positions are already clear in the early responses to the deficit committee's recommendations, which include reforming the tax code and increasing certain taxes, pushing back the retirement age and reducing spending.
Co-chairmen Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles chose one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and, according to themselves, imposed the issue of the deficit on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the 18-member committee to issue their plan as an official recommendation, and they have had a hard time reaching that number.
The greatest resistance remains among the group's elected members, suggesting that there are, at least today, few motives or willingness to compromise on tax issues.
Galston envisaged two phases in the fighting between the White House and Republicans in Congress.
The first will come next year in the form of partisan clashes, as Republicans challenge Obama in terms of budget, taxes and health care; then be followed by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What would be the cause of the change?
The public opinion.
It is widely proven that, despite the supportive spirit of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see the two parties working together.
If the confrontation leads to a stalemate, as in 1995, then the two parties will closely observe the reaction of the public.
The one who will be judged as a loser will have to change course and find compromises.
But that would still be an optimistic viewpoint.
The partisan spirit and polarization are larger today than they were in the mid-1990s and there seems to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and Congressional Republicans than there was then between President Bill Clinton and Republicans.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as a simple prelude to a more consistent election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civilization exposed this week could be appreciated by many Americans.
But it will take much more effort on the part of both sides to find a common ground on the issues that still divide them.
Disclosed U.S. documents describe Moscow as an oasis of corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of a "Kleptocracy" and passes to the Kremlin some of the bribes and protection money it collects, the U.S. Embassy in Russia said in a note in February.
The police and the Federal Security Service are carrying out huge rackets that help explain the high cost of living in Moscow, he said.
They raise money not only from legitimate businesses but also from organized criminal groups.
Each layer of bureaucracy – what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the “vertical of power” – takes its share as money moves up the ladder.
The service note, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted Wednesday by Wikileaks on its website.
The note is based on sources whose names have been purged.
It was drafted while Yuri Loujkov was still mayor of Moscow; and he is largely responsible for corruption.
He was fired in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but there have been little cleanup marks since then.
Loujkov and his wife, Elena Batourina, who owns a leading construction company, have always denied allegations of corruption over the years; and he has won several lawsuits in defamation over those allegations.
In September, he said the following to a Russian TV channel, when asked about a documentary suggesting he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's throwing, it's anything."
The Russians believe, with an overwhelming majority, that their society is corrupt, according to polls.
But it is unusual to find the information stated in an embassy report; and it is unheard of to conceive that it would be for diplomats from a foreign country to do so.
The direct link established between the Moscow city government and crime has led some people to call it "dysfunctional" and to claim that the government acted more like a kleptocracy than a government, according to the embassy note.
"Criminal elements enjoy a "Krysha" (a term used in the criminal world/mafia which literally means "roof" or protection) that passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior (MVD) and the prosecutor's office, as well as through the entire Mo bureaucracy of the government.
"Analysts identify a three-level structure in the criminal world of Moscow."
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"The FSB, the MVD and the militias are at the second level."
"Finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
“This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill a gap in certain areas where the city does not provide certain services.”
The report indicates that the FSB is stealing money from the biggest companies and that the police are targeting the small ones.
One source, he said, "explained that Moscow business owners understood that it was better to get protection from the MVD and the FSB (rather than organized crime groups) because, not only do they have more weapons, more means and more power than criminal groups do.
“That’s why the demand for protection by criminal gangs is no longer so high.”
The note notes that, although the collection of money is extensive, protection itself may be uneven; even those who pay are sometimes subject to arrest.
Those who don’t pay quickly see their business shut down under one pretext or another.
Medvedev mentioned several times the fight against corruption but admitted little progress.
The note from the embassy reports reports of men bringing suitcases, probably filled with money, to the Kremlin.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev is dependent on bureaucrats," said Georgi Satarov, director of Moscow's "think tank Indem" in a recent interview.
“But it’s part of that bureaucracy.”
“It is not part of a political class because it does not exist in Russia.”
Without politics, without opposition, without separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
According to the Indem, the costs of corruption would amount, on the whole of Russia, to more than $300 billion per year.
The country was ranked 154th in a recent survey on the overall perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (countries are ranked at least as corrupt).
The disclosure of the note by the U.S. Embassy, which was only made yesterday, late in the evening, Moscow time, will certainly stir up discontent within the Russian government; although Loyukov may be blamed, to a certain extent, for the failures of Moscow, this may be the occasion for the Kremlin mount.
Interviewed by CNN by Larry King, Putin hypothesized that WikiLeaks documents could be a fabrication and reacted furiously to the remarks that U.S. diplomats had made by calling him Batman and bringing Medvedev closer to Robin.
"The problem lies in the fact that it is our interaction, an important factor of domestic policy in this country," he said.
“But to be honest with you, we do not suspect that this would be achieved with such arrogance, such pressure and, you know, as opposed to ethics.”
Former Khmer Rouge fighters forced to confront the past
In a poorly lit classroom with decrepit concrete walls of poor quality, the director of Anlong Veng High School mentioned the man who built it, the last leader of the Khmer Rouge, Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves your Mok."
“He was a good leader; and he cared about his people,” said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as "the butcher" for his brutality, when he was at the head of the Khmer Rouge, this commander remains popular in this isolated bastion of ancient Khmer Rouge in northwestern Cambodia where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructures; and where thousands of acres of ancient land still remain.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, long-standing loyalty is finally challenged to Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum of truth and reconciliation enabled the victims to publicly face the people who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed a high school manual that, for the first time, teaches the history of the Khmer Rouge to the children of its former soldiers.
And, in July, a Cambodian court, jointly led by the United Nations, delivered its first sentence concerning a former member of the Khmer Rouge, condemning, to 35 years in prison, the former head of the sadly famous torture center of Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, better known by his name.
In the face of this situation, anxiety increased among the former Red Khmer fighters of Anlong Veng; complicating reconciliation efforts and their willingness to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
“There is resentment and fear among the former Khmer Rouge but they are powerless to do anything,” said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodian Documentation Centre, an independent body that conducts research on the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"The situation generates divisions within families."
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, about 1.7 million people were executed or died of starvation, disease or overcrowding.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the government of Pol Pot in 1979, the rest of the regime and its army fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
There, they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last of the movements surrendered in December 1998.
While Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary were leading the guerrilla base in the mountains of Western Cambodia and in the jungle, Ta Mok was preparing a sequel to Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace deal led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to defect to the government, culminating in the capitulations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samp in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who had held head, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the mountains near Dangrek.
He died in a Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Without their benefactors, most of the former Khmer Rouge fighters have plunged into the black misery common to the rural areas of Cambodia; and many remain nostalgic to the movement.
Although some Khmer Rouge elite officers retained their positions as local leader in exchange for dropping their weapons, these are poorly trained farmers.
“These people benefited from very little follow-up after the capitulation,” said Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which organizes public forums across Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They are imbued with the agrarian utopian ideology of the regime."
“They were raised in a setting where doing business is a foreign concept.”
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling in 1998 as a poor rice grower.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Your Mok feeds everyone."
But now life is difficult because we have to feed our own needs.”
The ongoing Khmer Rouge court has also raised concerns here.
The court is expected to begin the trial of Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister, early next year.
The court's mandate is to judge senior leaders and those responsible for the crimes, but he has not said whether he was pursuing beyond these four cases.
It would take more to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
The latest media speculation turned to Im Chaem, 64, a former district chief in Banteay Meanchey province under the rule of the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Cambodian Documentation Centre that she had overseen the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project where thousands of forced workers were reportedly killed.
Recently, during a hectic evening, Im Chaem was returning from work in the field near his wooden house on pilots, on a dirt road outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun cast long shadows on the dried grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss his past within the Khmer Rouge.
If the court called her, she said, she would refuse to go.
“Cambodia is at peace and stable,” she said.
"If there are more prosecutions, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected to the Khmer Rouge in 1978, also warned several times that instability would occur if the court prosecuted several suspects; although experts and historians dispute this.
“Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past,” he said.
But facing the past is all that Cambodia has to do to move forward, says Youk Chhang, from the documentation center.
"Reconciliation in terms of Khmer is to reconnect the broken pieces," he said.
"We need to put these pieces together so we can understand."
The center produced the first government-approved manual on the Khmer Rouge, "A History of Democratic Kampuchea, composed of 75 pages."
He distributed it to Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the Ministry of Education's history manuals, designed for high schools, which contained less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As in most Cambodia, the young people of Anlong Veng know only a few details about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's ties to the regime.
Touch Valeak, a 19-year-old student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new manual helped students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted with skepticism when he returned home with the book to study.
“My family rejects many parts of the manual and the court,” he says.
“They mistrust each other because they don’t know exactly how many people the court will prosecute.”
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But public forums, the manual and the court are starting to have an impact, he said.
Yet the Khmer Rouge retains a powerful appeal here.
In the heights of the Dangrek Mountains, a path, invaded by weeds and stuffed with plastic bags, leads to a black soot rectangle, covered with a rusted sheet roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, a 31-year-old roadside cell phone salesman, said she didn’t know much about the man who was incinerated at the site.
“But he has a great spirit; and many inhabitants go there to pray,” she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later that day she planned to walk to the last resting place in Pol Pot where she would leave a bunch of ripe bananas in hopes of bringing luck.
Belarus agrees to give up its stockpile of military-grade uranium
The Belarusian government announced on Wednesday that it would abandon its highly enriched uranium stockpile, an essential component of nuclear weapons; this decision is part of a surprise victory of President Obama’s campaign to secure nuclear materials around the world.
The agreement was released in a joint statement after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met here with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov on the sidelines of a security summit.
The U.S. government had tried for years to convince Belarus to give up highly enriched uranium and appeared to have cleared the horizon last spring.
But U.S. officials told the Washington Post that some classified operations have been carried out with Belarus over the past two months to remove 187 pounds of military-grade uranium from a Belarusian research center.
This paved the way for a deal on Wednesday to eliminate the rest of the matter by about 500 pounds, according to an official who raised the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue.
The agreement appears to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit, held on the initiative of Obama; where Belarus was excluded.
Apparently, it was profitable to provide an invitation to the former Soviet republic following the summit in 2012.
“I’m really fascinated by the fact that they want a seat at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit.”
“This proves to me that this process works,” said Ken Luongo, president of the Partnership for Global Security, a nuclear security advocacy group.
Clinton called the deal a “very significant, important step” by Belarus.
Obama pledged in Prague in April 2009 to secure all vulnerable nuclear materials around the world in the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the 7th.
A dozen countries did so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of the Obama Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said the nation would never give up its uranium.
“We kept highly enriched uranium, hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially military-grade uranium and poorly enriched uranium,” said Lukachenko.
“It’s our product ... We’re not going to make dirty bombs, and we’re not going to sell it to anyone.”
"We're going to use it for research purposes, that's all."
Belarus drew closer to the United States a few months ago; however, by expressing its interest in reaching an agreement.
The first implementation to remove uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the material had been slightly irradiated, officials said.
It was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to a facility in Russia to be stored and disposed of, officials said.
The second operation was completed Monday and was carried out by plane, according to officials.
The U.S. government has spent $13 million in its efforts, largely to replace Belarus’ research facilities with poorly enriched uranium; inadequate for weapons.
“A careful coordination and organization has been put in place to strengthen confidence,” leading to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a head of the Department of Energy specializing in Global Threat Reduction.
According to estimates from the James Martin Center for the Study of Non-Proliferation, Belarus this year had at least 88 pounds of military-grade uranium, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus is seeking to eliminate its stocks by 2012, according to a joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly due to the harsh repression of human rights by Lukashenko.
But Wednesday’s statement suggested a potential renewal.
“While welcoming progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus recognized that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remained essential to improving bilateral relations; and declared indispensable for the progress of the country and its citizens,” he said.
The government has not raised any objections to the CIA's thefts
The government has not objected to the CIA’s flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners to Guantanamo Bay across Spanish territory, according to a telegram from the US ambassador to Madrid.
This is demonstrated by filtered documents (cables) by Wikileaks in the daily El Pa<0xC3><0xAD>s, which add that the first vice-president of the Government of the time, Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Teresa Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez de la Vega, had asked that the Spanish Executive be informed about who should inform them to "experience what they can demonstrate".
In June 2006, following a report by the Council of Europe accusing a dozen countries of complicity in human rights violations, including Spain, a meeting was held between former North American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez de la Vega.
The Vice-President acknowledged that the Council's report "has surprised the government of Zapatero out of play" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain has no objection to intelligence flights over the Spanish territory," he said.
“They just want to be informed” to avoid being “taken away,” says Aguirre in a cable.
Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel Moratinos, the head of the Spanish Foreign Ministry at the time, told the ambassador that the Spanish Executive “wanted to give this case the lowest possible profile, even if, as it was in the hands of judges, the Government had limited capacity of influence.”
In turn, in January 2007, prosecutor Vicente Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez transmitted to the Embassy the fact that he would not block the judge's initiative to request the declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Centre (NIC) and the CIA's Ministry of Defense on flights.
“These reports contain no incriminating elements, no sensitive information,” the embassy said after speaking with the prosecutor.
The United States has nevertheless shown concern for "the apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" more than for the declassified information of the CNI o of the Ministry of Defense.
“This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to discreetly maneuver the case between governments,” Aguirre said.
In March 2007, during a luncheon between the U.S. Ambassador and the Minister of the Interior, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he commented that "even if the Spanish judges are madly jealous of his independence and will collaborate with them in what they deem it appropriate," he had given instructions.
The Ambassador also expresses concern about the PP's action in this matter.
“Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience suggests the fact that PP will certainly take advantage of any indication that the Zapatero Government has tolerated or deliberately ignored the actions of the United States that could be interpreted as possible violations of human rights,” the statement reads.
The parricide who passed the confessions complained in a network of the "accusation" of being a mother
The girl was talking about the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror to the Galician"
M<0xC3><0xB3>nica Juanatey Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez is "Muki" in the network.
With this nickname that she used when she was a child, she communicated with a cousin and at least one friend; both of them came from Noia, the village of la Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a from which she originated.
The messages are from 2008.
To hear them, you need to know his sentimental life, which ABC builds with the help of his parents' testimonies.
The 30-year-old Galician girl had started a relationship in 1998 with Iv<0xC3><0xA1>n T<0xC3><0xBA><0xC3><0xB1>ez, an industrialist.
Their relationship lasted a year.
Shortly after they broke up, we knew she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him get a DNA test.
We found another new boyfriend shortly after that.
The chosen one was Alberto, a fasted man from Lousame, a neighbouring municipality.
She lived with him for a long time.
Caesar had lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to survey the labour market, the little boy stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her for a week in Palma.
But according to the content of his communications, it is understood that their idyll has fractured, they have separated.
In March 2008, she was in Menorca alone, writing: "Alberto is very strange and disgusted by the fact that I came to work there."
“When I told him, it seemed like a good thing to him, but of course, he now realizes what it means to be with the child all day and not have the freedom to do what he wants.”
And then, she talks about a mobile message she just received: "I want you to come home this month or you give me an address to send the child to you."
She complains, "If he doesn't like it, let him leave the kid with my mother, and I'll take it when I get home," she says.
In May, she talks about returning to her village: "This week I am leaving, but I will only stay there until 19, because on the 20th I have to show up at a job so I don't lose it."
She explains that if everything went well, she would have taken her elder with her.
“He will stay with the right person, that is, with me, and I will never leave him out of my life with another person if that person is not my mother,” he said.
In July, there is another post.
When she tapes him, it is assumed that the child, who had arrived on the island on the 1st of that month, and was supposedly murdered on the 10th, is dead.
“Caesar is happy on the one hand, but he is not happy on the other.”
"On the one hand he's with me and he likes this place a little bit, but on the other he goes to school almost every day."
She's talking about a trip to Mallorca.
"There's going to be (the child) a few hours in the summer and like that I'm saving some money from the babysitter."
The 17th, Greetings and Complaints.
"A very big kiss from Caesar, who asks me when you will come."
"Alberto says he sent you some videos to the email, you see, when he wants it, he finds me, shit."
The 30, another: "The child is fine, el goes to the summer hours to learn Catalan.
On Victor, his current partner, there is one: "He advances me money".
On the Internet she has posts in blogs dedicated to animation and manga.
She had one of her own in the MySpace universe, now blocked, where her name was "Muki the Prison Liberator."
"Terreur <0xC3><0xA0> la Galicienne (epigraphe)".
The last man who lived with her, vigilant, declares his regret to feel guilty.
He doesn’t want to think that everything had happened so that she didn’t tell him that she was a single mother.
M<0xC3><0xB3>nica entered the Palma Provincial Prison yesterday, from the Menorca Judicial Detainee Center.
The lawyer, Carlos Maceda, explained that she did not remember how the facts had happened, "and she did not intend to harm the minor either."
Before she had confessed to drowning Caesar in the bathtub and depositing his body in a suitcase.
The defense and the prosecutor have requested a psychiatric examination.
People's Party members would win 4 seats in Congress and the PSC would lose 9 seats
With the results of the 18-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the significant increase of votes and deputies recorded in the last autonomous elections, the Catalan PP has already targeted the general elections because, even if there is progress or not, the prospects are more than positive, because the number of votes that this formation gets in these elections normally doubles that in which it receives them.
Thus, the popular Catalans obtained 610.473 votes in the general elections of 2008, while in the autonomous elections of 2006, they had obtained 316.222.
Last Sunday, the PPC got 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend is maintained, desired by a diversion of votes from the PSC and the fidelity of the electorate of the PP, the analysts of this formation calculated that, if there were general elections, the PPC could increase from 8 to 12 deputies in the PSC in less than 10 perils in the Congress.
These calculations would find that the Catalan square is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to popular analysis, ERC would lose one MP - it has three now - while ICV would keep one MP or win one.
But if the electoral agenda is maintained, the next meeting would take place in May 2011 for the municipal elections, where the popular can also be decisive at the end of the socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in their relay to the head of the General Council of Barcelona 2011 - one of the more than 6 million administrations that handle.
Both nationalists and populars agree that PSC could lose the mayors of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the Socialists would not get the majority either the opportunity to resort to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Considering the Republican debacle, it would not be fanciful that this formation loses its representation in the city hall of Barcelona - it is necessary to get 5% of the votes.
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can be the protagonists of the fall in the capital of Tarragona, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP recorded only a difference of 500 votes from PSC, with the mayor, <0xC3><0x81>ngel Ros, maintaining very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the latter campaign, they met several times.
The popular have also made progress in other major municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Now, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aims to form lists in a maximum number of localities.
The Catalan cell has facilitated thousands of passports in Al Qaeda
Apart from the seven detainees in Barcelona, Thailand, there were three
The last seven Pakistanis and the Nigerian detained by agents of the General Information Commissionerate of the Barcelona Police formed a jihadist cell that, headed from Thailand, provided passports to different groups of Al Qaeda, among which the "Tigers for the Liberation of the Earth" (The Tigers for the Liberation of the Land of Tamils) died in 2008.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs has attached great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring that with "Operation Kampai" the Al Qaeda falsification apparatus at the international level and, "therefore, its operational capacity."
Investigators estimate that the cell, in the two years it was active in Catalonia, could have sent thousands of passports to Thailand, or they were falsified and then distributed to groups that were part of the Al Qaeda criminal galaxy so that its "combatants" could cross the borders of Europe and other countries.
The dismantled cell is the only one that the jihadist network was operating in Europe, which is why the investigations involved, apart from the Thai services, other European police units, which is why in the territory of the European Union there could be similar blows in the following days to the one recorded in the bar.
In coordination with this operation (we held the Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade), in Thailand we held another one, with the capture of the Pakistanis But Ehharsan and Kiharan and Siyahan.
They were the ones who led the cell based in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network - part of which was hit in 2009 - mainly flew from tourists passports that met the conditions marked by the "World Islamic Front".
That is, the documents had to be in the name of young men between the ages of 25 and 45, with a validity of several years and without stamped visas.
Investigators point out that so far no details have been found linking detainees in Catalonia to the bombing of Bombay, although the perpetrator of the attack, "Laskar e Taiba", was one of the recipient groups of passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
However, it should be remembered that a few days before this attack was committed, a few thousand dollars were sent from Catalonia through a transfer agency that were "invested" to buy mobile cards that were then used by members of the "commando" who killed 106 people.
The police have seized a lot of documentation.
PP asks Mas to suspend tax complicity
The leader of the PPC, Alicia S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally expose to Artur Mas his conditions to support his investment as president of the Generalitat, identical to those exposed during the campaign and which summed up to give priority to the economic recovery of the economy and the nationalist complicity of the lack of philo-adventures.
The president of the popular Catalans came to the meeting with Artur Mas with the certainty that he got 18 MPs in the elections last Sunday, a number more than enough to be loved, because the candidate of the CiU requires that at least one of the formations that will exercise the opposition abstains in it.
A possible agreement with the PP depends on the future alliances that the nationalists wish to maintain in Congress during the general elections, but, for the moment, the conversations that Mas has these days with the rest of the political leaders are in Catalan key.
And as for the president of the PP, in order to support an investment "it would be necessary to eliminate all sovereignist and independentist speeches", and the economic complicity - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the convergent leader wishes to submit even to the referendum.
The two leaders have in common their bet to slim down the political apparatus of a highly exaggerated autonomous administration and the elimination of the tax applied to inheritance and donations.
Details of the negotiations on Mas's investment will be handled by PC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a hard opposition - Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will do so with Joan Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatric says the deaths were not due to the "lack of measures"
Olot center owners do not rule out the possibility that their night nurse killed more than 11 elderly people
Officials of the geriatric La Caritat d'Olot (Gerona) offered a press conference yesterday to highlight the damage to the institution caused by the criminal behavior of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who killed at least eleven elderly people he was responsible for during the time he worked there.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, was accompanied by the center's lawyer, Joan Ca<0xC3><0xB1>ada, and announced that "La Caritat's desire would be to be able to exercise the charge against the perpetrator" for the dead but "the legality and responsibility oblige us to assume the procedural situation of civil perpetrators".
And apart from the social discredit that the entity may suffer because it has not detected the criminal activities of the night nurse in time, the great threat to La Charity now takes the form of a significant compensation that the legal representatives of the parents of the victims already calculate.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that the first crime dates from August 2009 and that from that day he has not stopped killing.
The judge mentioned in the sentence that he ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former geriatric patients - that he suspected that in many cases no doctor personally examined the deceased but, given the age and pathologies of the patients, the formality took place by telephone.
The Charity, through its director, categorically denied this situation yesterday and mentioned that "the lack of measures can never have been the cause of what happened".
La Caritat's lawyer added that "in this case there is only an indication of imprudence on the part of any other person other than the accused."
The person already named as the "Angel of Death" confessed earlier yesterday to 11 murders and detailed that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and a month and a half later he killed a second grandmother.
In this case, he caused his death by injecting him with an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime he had committed with a sedative pill mix.
The director of La Caritat mentioned the fact that it is difficult to control the access of the centre's staff to medicine.
Insulin injections and sedative cocktails had been the mechanism employed in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in her desire to alleviate the suffering of interns, used to kill them.
But lab analyses will clarify if Vila does not lie by saying that he sought for his first victims a less cruel death or on the contrary burned them inside by giving them laundry as he has already admitted he did with the three women he killed in the 12 - 17 October interval.
The Charity does not believe the statements of the nurse at night, nor the number of murders confessed, they do not eliminate the possibility that the number will be greater and justify their attitude by the different versions that Vila gave in his visits to the Court of First Instance.
That is why they declare that they will remain available to the judiciary to clarify the scope of the facts.
The ECB threatens
Investors reacted abruptly yesterday to the threat from Trichet that “markets should not underestimate our responsiveness.”
The differentials of the devices have closed by force and the shares of European banks have suffered more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we must not underestimate the ECB's ability to make mistakes, and the euro has barely recorded an increment, which is a worrying signal.
What happened yesterday is typical of a liquid market that just as it collapses, it recovers, but motivated by short and highly speculative position fences.
The institutional investor will take a long time to lose the fear.
A month ago, the ECB cited us today to withdraw liquidity measures and it will have to withdraw tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and the remaining ones.
The Bundesbank demanded the completion of the public debt purchase plan due to its inefficiency and the elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures in the future and leaving only unlimited access to the week.
After the Irish crisis, we hope to extend the current liquidity measures "at least until March" and maintain the quarterly auction with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to guarantee liquidity at least until June.
We hope that the bond purchase programme will continue and that the signal will be intensified.
If they fail to meet the expectations generated, they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they continue blinded to withdraw the liquidity measures, God help us!
Just as during their May meeting in which they said they had not even considered buying bonds and they collapsed markets, the story could repeat itself tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazooka Monday and Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing a new collapse in the market.
Yesterday the one-year trade auction in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury issued only $500 million at 5.28% compared to $750 million at 4.81% of the previous auction.
Even so, the types in Portugal dropped 30 basis points across the curve, and clearly reflecting a change in market sentiment after Trichet’s words.
In Ireland, the figures for Allied and Bank of Ireland were published.
The estimated figures represent $10,000 million in the short term and 15,000 potentials and they have a deadline until February to obtain private capital or they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem in July with the stress test, the figures are reasonable in the Assistance Plan and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the Government will have to obtain parliamentary approval of its new budget and it still does not have sufficient support, so Ireland remains in a focal point of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel moderated the tone of her speech to loosen tension before the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on December 14, in which it is necessary to find a political compromise that demonstrates that we are a union and that we all interpret the same partition.
The problem is that Germany wants to interpret Wagner and the rest is Beethoven's hymn of joy.
In Spain, the President had the opportunity to present yesterday the plan of measures that the Council of Ministers will approve on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous communities and financial entities, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivate employment sound to the ears of investors such as the four seasons of Vivaldi.
The double Trichet and ZP effect explains the fact that the Spanish Stock Exchange suffered 4.5%, twice as much as the rest of the European Stock Exchanges.
Unlike in February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain was quick and radical and we are enjoying the surprise effect.
Today there is a key auction of a three-year bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect, therefore we hope that this will resolve with strong demand and help to dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain, requesting a Assistance Plan would be a self-immolation.
They would give us a liquidity line that we don't need, the Treasury has more than 40,000 million in liquidity available, triple compared to March, to very expensive types, and they cut off access to sine die markets.
Nevertheless, the strategy must continue to be that of Caesar's wife, "apart from being, appearing."
Courage, we can get out!
The President of Eulen will challenge the council of Vega Sicilia requested by his sons
The storm does not stop in the open conflict within the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, founder of the group, will contest, as he considers it "zero of law", the judicial council of El Enebro next 16, requested by five of his seven sons in which they will try to assert their majority and take over the management bodies of the firm that owns Bodiaciga Siga.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez and his sons Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s David and Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a José grant their legal battery for the new chapter of their dispute for control of the group.
The founder of the larger business services holding for companies does not appear to be willing to give up in his litigation to be present in the governing bodies of El Enebro.
He was excluded from his board of directors by five of his seven sons who appointed themselves directors in the shareholders' meeting on January 18 of this year, whose dispute is registered in the Register of Commerce and Companies.
The El Enebro Judicial Council for the next 16, convened by the Commercial Magistrate Number 2 of Madrid, has reopened the box of thunderstorms within the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family.
The use of the judge to fix the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only mechanism that guarantees the convening of the assembly.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira <0xC3><0x81>lvarez Mezquiriz is described by David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez as a "desperate recourse of the applicants his five sons to try, through a procedural argument, by clearly fraudulent according to the Law and by abusing the right, by nullifying and correcting the ensemble.
This argument will be the basis for, once the assembly is held, to be challenged by considering that it is "zero of full rights".
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already tried unsuccessfully that the magistrate convenes an assembly in June.
In El Enebro, a holding company and holder of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, the sons of David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the services group, however, seeks a profit of 51% of the capital, according to familiar protocols.
This case is the substantive matter that the judge must decide after the hearing on the appeal for which there is not yet a reported date.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with a secret Siemens weapon
A software creates improvements on the cars in real time.
As soon as Red Bull entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this select world of speed was marked by surprise and success.
At first, no one took into account the options of a new team that had just arrived, despite the upward trajectory of the last seasons, last November, in the final phase of the championship they all bet on the Ferrari triumph of Fernando Alonso.
Without diminishing the skill of the champion, the German Sebastien Vette, nor the ability of the Renault engine that drives his car, in the world of Formula 1 we speak of the legend of the "secret weapon" that the multinational company Siemens has put in the hands of Red Bull to turn him into a winning team.
It is in fact a powerful process simulation software that the German company launched on the market in 2007 with objectives very far from the high automotive competition.
Named PLM, this powerful computer instrument has been used to create assembly chains from manufacturers from all over the world, power stations, high-precision instruments.
The goal is to reproduce, faithfully simulate the product or process before building it in a real way, thus avoiding avoidable defects and costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi planes or Nissan’s most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens’ industrial division, explains the fact that the use of this computer instrument in its Formula 1 plant allowed Red Bull to create and execute “in a few hours, almost in real time,” the changes, changes and improvements detected during races and trials.
Russwurm explains that the 1992 teams had an average of 10 technicians in their teams who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four vehicle improvements each season.
The Red Bull team currently employs 180 highly qualified young professionals who, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyse and project all sorts of modifications on the cars.
The Siemens manager explained that the PLM software is capable of analyzing and improving all elements of Red Bull’s cars except the engine, which is Renault’s sole responsibility.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
Changes can go from virtual reality to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
As a unique limitation of this technological development madness there is the amount of $40 million that each Formula 1 team can spend as a limit each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has deployed the high-tech plant to create and produce its cars in a locality 50 kilometers from London.
These are two buildings where visits, especially for journalists, are restricted.
Everything that happens there is considered top secret.
There are 580 people in the team, including two drivers, champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
Red Bull’s Formula 1 hero is probably Sebastian Vetell, the newest champion.
Among the immense technological resources that the brand of energy drinks has put to the service of its participation in circuits, there are other hidden protagonists, whose activity is invaluable and notoriety zero.
The factory’s chief technology officer, Steve Nevey, says that five years ago it could be said that the R&D advances in racing cars brought 50% of the wins and the drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have changed and technology accounts for 85% of success, while drivers provide 15% of added value.
Nevey admits that the Vettels or Webbers will never be replaced by computer science, because “they are unpredictable gladiators.”
HP to install 20 clean stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) has opened its first exclusive store in Barcelona in collaboration with its partner Pont Reyes.
It will be the first of a network of 20 stores between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational plans to install in Spain over the next two years.
The company will account for this initiative with the 16 zones already present in multi-brand centers such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
HP Spain Vice President Helena Herrero gave as an example the refurbished shop located on the Gran V<0xC3><0xAD>a in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with which she has been collaborating for 30 years.
The North American group has prepared a plan to deploy 200 brand sales points in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first openers were those in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, with Barcelona being the third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the next possible stores, although she admitted that Madrid could be the next destination.
The director of HM Personal Systems has ensured that the philosophy for the establishment of stores will always be the same, with the support of a local distributor with industry experience and knowledge.
The North American group advises and takes care of the design of exclusive store furniture (with products that can be touched in an interactive way), which in Europe will hold an identical image.
In addition, HP covers the training of institution staff.
Helena Herrero denied that it is a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive network of stores claims to "improve the service offered to customers and SMEs in purchase, assistance, after-sales and even packaging."
The Barcelona store includes a space with a world-class pioneering pilot program that solves possible problems with HP’s IT equipment under warranty.
An online service connects with a technical centre located in Maastricht (Netherlands).
“So in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can often take even two days.”
“This system is designed specifically for SMEs and users, as large companies have already contracted technical support services,” said Helena Herrero.
Sabadell bets on ‘stealing’ one million customers to rivals in three years
More optimistic than other leaders, Banco Sabadell’s CEO, Jaime Guardiola, thinks 2011 will be a tough year for the banking sector, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the war on liabilities.
Despite this, it envisages a collapse of interest margins, which will be partially offset by increases in commissions and credit prices.
Sabadell expects to capture a million private customers in three years, its task to accomplish.
Sabadell has found a way to operate for the next three years and thus be able to survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will launch a new management plan in 2011 that will hold a three-year maturity.
The goal, apart from surviving without having to resort to FROB's public subsidies, is to gain a market share by capturing one million new private customers - 700,000 if you deduct those who can get out of the bank - its great task to accomplish, because so far this particular company had spoiled the banks and customers more than the SMEs.
This year it has captured 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share for individuals is 3.5%, while for companies it exceeds 10%.
Another basis of the 2011-2013 plan is the bet on productivity, or the same thing, of austerity, with cost reduction as a goal, the provocations of which will be explained by the bank when presenting the results of the year.
Few banks now dare to set goals and make them public, as the financial crisis has disrupted all the plans of the global banking sector.
Sabadell, in fact, will finalize this year its management plan Optima, established four years ago, although initially the plan was for three years, but the market situation determined its extension for an additional year.
Customers who let go of savings banks will be its main objective.
During an APIE-organized breakfast, Guardiola insisted that 2011 would be a “difficult and transcendental” year.
The executive, in fact, thinks that the exit from the crisis in Spain "will be slow".
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs", which is fundamental to the survival of the banking business, he stressed.
And even if he thinks that the war of liabilities – which penalizes margins – is shrinking, the price of risk premiums that banks and cashiers pay for their issuances to obtain liquidity is already moving at the price of credit to compensate for the fall in margins.
"The liquidity and financing aspect is structural and will be a factor of pressure on credit."
“We didn’t tighten the tap, but the differentials are higher,” Guardiola said.
Banesto has already given orders to its network to limit long-term credit and increase the price of differentials - see CincoD<0xC3><0xAD>as of November 22 and 27.
He also admitted that the banking sector's trend now "is to increase commissions", but "there is a competitive framework".
Sabadell's management plan is based on organic growth, even if, as always, the group does not eliminate the possibility of corporate operations.
It is not in vain that he assures that in Spain "larger dimensions will be sought."
“Everything will move next year,” he said.
He claims that capital requirements are "extremely increasing" and some Spanish financial entity could enter the red numbers.
And he mentions that the FROB can replace the market in fund-raising in the case of new recapitalizations.
Having assured Sabadell that he can survive the temporary closure of markets, he has diminished the importance of the fact that some banks are already predicting a new liquidity crisis.
He points out that one cannot issue, but contrary to what happened in June, one can get short-term funding through rest, which mitigates the crisis.
ECSC rejects the possibility of a second wave of mergers among cash registers
The Director-General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday the possibility of a new wave of mergers of savings banks and reiterated the speed with which the sector is restructured.
When the process for the concentration of Spanish savings banks began, there were several entities that ensured that they would not participate in the first phase and that they reserved for the second phase.
Nevertheless, the Director General of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks (ECSC), José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of producing this new wave of operations.
"I think most of the mergers have been made, we can't say that the incorporation of Cajasol into the Banca C<0xC3><0xAD>vica group is a second phase, these are adjustments."
"Most of it has been done completely; it is possible that instead of 17 we go to 13 or 14, but all the major processes have already been done under the supervision of the Bank of Spain, which has collaborated a lot in this operation too," he said.
In the statements during a breakfast of the Association of Managers and Executives of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta stated that the process of concentration is carried out "at the fastest possible speed and we must be very satisfied with the way it is done now" in the way it is done in the time it has not been set in.
"The passage of 45 cash registers with an average of 28.500 million assets volume to 17 with 75.500 million is an unprecedented trial in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% so that they are much larger to conform to Basel," he stressed.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a number of rather unfortunate opinions on the slowness of the process" that demonstrate "a lack of serosity and meaning", because "what the Bank of Spain does is remind that the deadline must be respected before the end of the year".
The CEO of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in all of Europe and "probably" in the world and he attributed it to people who question it a "lack of knowledge".
The leader mentioned that given the current economic situation, “we can remain very calm” with the situation of financial entities and savings banks, a system that started a “very important” process of concentration and “goes at the highest speed possible.”
He also recalled that the Spanish banking sector was well aware of the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the German Red Line
Berlin chose to stay in the euro, but set the conditions for the entire Union.
Tensions in the markets have led to a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero announced new adjustment methods, ranging from tax reductions for SMEs, regulation of private investment agencies or the abolition of 426 euros of state aid to unemployed people without a professional contribution to the privatization of 49% of AENA and 30% of the airport management of El Bara.
On the other hand, Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez, joined the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel on her responsibility to detach the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
It should be noted that Merkel’s position is not a mistake in her communication policy.
On the contrary, this is another restriction on the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which clashes with that of maintaining the old traditions of most of its partners.
In the face of European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate on the three possible outcomes of the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by itself, Austria and Holland, among other countries, and the south would abandon the monetary zone.
The second, the recovery of the Mark, although now it seems science fiction, with a very favorable current of opinion, almost 50% of the population.
The third, a new concept of the euro, in line with Germany's proposals for greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigour, fines to countries that violate them, possible suspensions of payments from one of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and it has long been defined, so now there is no room for excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission were stimulating deficits, the German government invented a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of a divergence between what Germany thought should be done (fiscal rigor and stability of public finances) and what its European partners, including France, were doing.
The second blow to the Central European country was when Merkel hardly extended the decision to save Greece.
From that moment on, she was the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public and the published opinion were against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, towards the end of October, Merkel again expressed a clear position, calling for the reform of the EU's treaties to make it possible to rescue a country and at the same time oblige private lenders to bear a share of the cost.
This position was interpreted as anti-European, because it precipitated the Irish crisis and the rest.
But its proposal, although slightly sweetened, has been approved and in the coming months we should witness the process of reform of the Union that will make these measures possible from 2013 onwards.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not think it will cross.
And she tells us all that, even if we now have to take measures with which we can not agree too much, from that date the old operation of the euro would have ended.
2013 will mean the creation of a new monetary zone, in which countries that violate the rules will be severely sanctioned, they may be forced to declare cessation of payments and, in this case, the private sector will also bear a portion of the costs.
Germany is signaling that we must follow a strict path of growth with high savings and investment rates, moderate consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness, and positive external balances.
An alternative based on debt and construction, with huge gaps in the balance of payments, such as the one that presided over Spanish growth in the boom years, will simply not be tolerated.
The bet is clear.
And it would be hard not to hear it.
It is not just a matter of bringing the public deficit back to 3% in 2013.
What we are being asked is much harder.
And what he should absolutely not do in these circumstances is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will bring us greater peace of mind.
And let us know how to seize the opportunity we were given, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has also heard of this form and his double statement (the reforms promised after last Saturday's meeting with big companies and yesterday's announcement of new measures) suggests that, despite Merkel's criticisms, we have paved the way for the thesis to be brought to order.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and they don't seem to move it.
And one of the possibilities envisaged cannot exclude the abandonment of a monetary zone too crowded with countries that are not serious.
And in that case, Germany will always be able to tell us that it had warned us about it.
Sport and fraud of the law
The ruses similar to that of Alonso and Ramos against Ajax demonstrate ingenuity but not the willingness to escape a sanction.
The expulsion by two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the November 23 match against Ajax in the Champions League has shed a lot of ink on the anti-sports character of such behavior and whether both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As you know, a few minutes before the end of the match (which their team already clearly won), the two players deliberately wasted time when they made mistakes in determining the referee to show them the second yellow card.
Thus, and given that Real Madrid will eventually be the leader of his group, the two players will complete the regulatory sanction during the next match of the dam against Auxerre and will be able to move without cards to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA discipline committee sanctioned the team's coach José Mourinho and various economic sums to the players involved with two matches.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances like this or similar is not a new practice, if not rather common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, unwritten rules, but followed, of this sport.
Part of the debate that appeared in the related case is due to the fact that this was the protagonist of a team of the entity of Real Madrid (who in his anthem displays the nobility and the honor and who on past occasions has condemned a fine to historique <0xC3><0xA0> provostri<0xC3><0xA8>te qui <0xC3><0xA0> hist<0xC3><0xA8>s <0xC3><0xA0> plus, hi<0xC3><0xA8>stri<0xC3><0xA8>s, and his dramat-de di-orchestrestrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostrostros
In any case, the debate asks whether this type of behaviour is not expressly prohibited by the regulation contradicts the principles of sport, i.e., whether these actions commit a fraud of the law; because, in fact, they are actions that respect the sport regulation, but seem to evade its meaning.
The question is to examine the type of harm they cause to the sporting mind.
One of the assets that includes the sporting spirit is the physical integrity of the opposing players, an aspect that with these actions has not been endangered, that is, there has been no violent play.
Another of these assets that are alluded to with the correct game is to prevent the offending player team from taking unfair advantage of the opposing team, which is not the case either.
However, the paradoxical fact of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it does not conform to what is normally characterized as fraud or fraud of the law, because its violation of the rules was not carried out in secret to be possible to try to avoid the penalty, but their action was more precisely tried.
They waited and were willing to accept the sanctions.
Another issue is the type of advantage that offenders get from the intentional errors examined.
Here it seems necessary to note that one does not put in a situation of disadvantage to the rival and one does not get an advantage in the same match either, because obviously the result of the action assumes the fact of leaving their own team with fewer players.
And this is not a useful strategy for the next match either, as the club could not count on these players.
Obviously the advantage is that players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future match.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indecision, as the team could be eliminated suddenly and apart from that, with this action the players complete a penalty match and move to the second round of cards, in which the suspension due to the accumulation of the cards occurs with one less than in the first cycle.
So, grabbing the ladders, it is not so clear that this is an advantage.
Ultimately, these actions are not contrary to the sporting spirit, which nevertheless includes the making of strategic decisions that promote profit to the maximum that the rules allow.
In our case, the players have not acted to avoid the application of the sanction (this would indeed be a clear case of fraud from the law), otherwise they have chosen instead the moment when they submitted to it.
They made a strategic decision without deterring the penalty or running away from it.
Although the boundary between genius and fraud is wide open, on this occasion I think we had a clear case of genius.
The controversy, it seems to me, arises because of two factors: because there have been two self-ejections and because of the way in which the guideline is transmitted to provoke them.
The harm caused to the principles of sport by these actions is not as ethical as it is aesthetic.
Offensive offers to capture Christmas dinners for groups in NCB
The calendar dictatorship is concentrating an avalanche of reservations for days 16 and 17.
There is a proliferation of self-financed celebrations by employees who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the turkey and the lottery, when December arrives also come back the dinners of groups before Christmas that continue to be the balloon of oxygen for the restaurants and entertainment of Barcelona, but because of the crisis have resulted in an offensive you adjusted prices to be able to catch the majority of the customer.
To complete the complication of accounting, this year’s calendar (such as New Year’s Eve falls on Friday) concentrated requests in the week of December 13, resulting so far in an avalanche of dinner bookings for peak days (17 and 17) and almost nothing the previous week.
Since 2008, which is the origin of difficult times, there are many companies that have eliminated collective dinners for budgetary reasons.
To maintain the tradition, many employees organize them by paying for their own pockets.
Whatever the situation, they are all asking for battle prizes, confirms the president of Gremi de Restauraci<0xC3><0xB3>n de Barcelona, Gaiet<0xC3><0xA0> Farr<0xC3><0xA0>s.
The representative of the employer, now, does not dare to predict what the holidays will be like this month.
"People think a lot before they book."
“They want to go out but they pay a lot of attention to prices,” he says.
The deal will go well "for those who give quality at a good price and with good service", he adds, and recalls that customers tend to go down a step with the crisis, so the slice around 25 euros has become a majority in demand.
In a survey of various establishments in the centre, the number of applications for the night of the 17th collapsed.
The Soteras group says there is an authentic demand boom for that Friday, with the claim to spend less than 30 euros, to which they responded by adapting their menus to the conjuncture, with complete formulas of 25 to 35 euros.
In the case of another group of the most powerful, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the particularity of the calendar assumed more early bookings, even from the beginning of November.
“We did the impossible to maintain the same prices last year, with menus for all tastes from 19.95 to 30 euros,” they detail.
AN Grup, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQuQu and a total of 23 premises, remains optimistic after detecting a rise in billing since the second half and good, albeit concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources from the group mention that the 18th will also be a hyper-active day at the level of groups of friends who celebrate the holidays in advance.
To their six group menus they added one for Christmas, with 30 euros or more as a famous budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend 10% more than last year instead of demanding more details, such as Catalan wine made according to the Champenois method - 'cava'.
They also see the first signs of improvement in some companies inviting their employees again and the feeling that the volume of the groups has increased slightly.
On the part of the employer Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Barcelona Bars, Restaurants and Entertainment Association), its vice-president, Enric Gom<0xC3><0xA0>, confides in the possibility of starting to see the end of the tunnel and argues that overall reservations are "animated", even if customers "negotiate as much as possible".
This is true, the hope in regards to the festivities has not decreased, regardless of who pays, he says.
Pakistan’s nuclear program raises serious concern in the United States
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons at “a faster rate than any other country.”
WikiLeaks leaks confirm the connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. State Department filtered by the Wikileaks portal confirms the huge concerns that the Pakistani nuclear program is causing in Washington.
Apart from the enlightening and tasty details offered on the content of the conversations and thoughts of accredited North American diplomatic representatives in Islamabad, the documents reveal the fact that cooperation between the two countries in the field of atomic security, instead of increasing the world's imports, "decreases" more than other countries, and that Asia's established countries.
The peculiarity of Pakistan’s nuclear program – the fact that the weapons are not assembled but stored by components to make it difficult to destroy them in the event of an attack – is one of Washington’s main concerns.
This is how the Ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, lists in a report prior to the visit of former National Security Advisor, James Jones: "The proximity of certain nuclear facilities in the territory under Taliban attack, the dispersal of nuclear materials including short noise and the vulnerability of transportation."
The large number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programs is considered, not only by the United States, but also by Russia, as proliferating and a reason to keep watch.
"Pakistan has to hire personnel with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the decline in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit American people who work with sedatives during sedatives in nuclear or missile programs."
The new documentation filtered by Julian Assange's portal is the increasingly reduced cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation and Pakistan's high level of nuclear weapons production.
A letter from the Embassy in May, which described communication with Pakistan as “frustrating,” supports the following: “Transparency is often non-existent; offers of aid remain unanswered or are being eliminated.”
In another message, Peter Lavoy, an official with the National Intelligence for South Asia, notes that “despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world.”
Ambassador Patterson also asked Washington, during a visit to the head of the Army, General Ashfaq Kayani, to make "very clear" to the official that "the Pakistan Army must end with the silent support of terrorist groups."
The hunt for the Wikileaks boss
Obama will appoint a senior anti-terrorist leader to avoid further infiltrations.
Interpol is issuing a red alert to track movements and locate Assange.
All aspects related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, form a complicated labyrinth where it is difficult to be certain of the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a “red alert” to “locate and track the movements” of Assange.
It is not, however, a traditional arrest warrant.
In addition, this is not new, otherwise it is dated November 20.
And this has nothing to do with the latest filtration of more than a quarter million U.S. diplomatic documents but with the allegations of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, Wikileaks’ creator lawyer, Mark Stephens, says that “the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange.”
The 20th International Police Corps based in Lyon (France) dictated the order at the request of Sweden, but it did not make it public until yesterday, after receiving the authorization from the authorities of that country.
All 188 Interpol countries have been instructed to identify or locate Assange “to obtain his provisional arrest and extradition.”
Although Interpol cannot give the order of arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, according to the explanations of the organization, consider the red notice call a free way for the arrest -- which the national body of the police must carry out if it is the case and if it has a bilateral agreement, especially if they have a bilateral agreement.
The move angered Assange’s lawyers, who yesterday issued a letter denouncing the fact that the 39-year-old Wikileaks founder was willing to answer questions from Swedish authorities by video conference.
They also recall that Assange applied for and obtained the permit to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, which is compared to the famous Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, head of security of Stalin.
“This seems to be a hunt, not a legal persecution,” the letter said.
As the world searches for him - and in Australia his mother defends his son's innocence - Assange continues to be in an unknown place, but he does not keep quiet.
On Monday, he gave an indefinite interview to the director of Time magazine via Skype, a conversation in which he called for the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
“If one can show that she was responsible for giving orders to U.S. graduates that they spy on the United Nations by violating international treaties that the United States has signed, she should resign,” he said.
His opinion was insulted yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who called the resignation request "ridiculous and absurd".
“I’m not entirely sure why the opinion of a guy with a web page should interest us,” he told CNN.
Obama himself has tasked a senior anti-terrorist official, Russell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama’s attempt to reduce Assange’s importance contrasts with the views that conservative politicians and commentators proclaim these days.
Peter King, the congressman who will chair the National Security Committee in the lower house from January, asked the State Department to consider including Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations “to confiscate its funds and prosecute anyone who provides contributions or assistance to them.”
Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, went even further after he said Assange would have to be “killed.”
"Obama should turn it into a target and use an unmanned plane or something."
One person who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
“Whoever is in the government that leaked the information is guilty of treason and anything that is not an execution would be too kind a punishment,” he told Fox.
Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s seeks peace in ERC with eyelashes to Carod’s followers
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s seems to have found the recipe to resolve the 1st internal uprising inside ERC, without the north due to the loss of 11 MPs and half the votes.
The president of the party is aware that his threat of resignation is not enough for the supporters of the former leader Josep Llu<0xC3><0xAD>s Carod-Rovira, but at the same time he knows that the influence of this sector is now as diluted as his liar and that this can absolutely not give him any more headaches that he was with.
This is why the leader of Esquerra will try to win his new critics with eyelashes that allow him to blind himself until the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s announced yesterday that more than 200 national councillors of ERC will be able to pronounce on its continuity in secret.
By ballots, not by raising your hand.
If the carodists want to pass a certain penalty vote to the president, they will be able to do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the leader wants to avoid the image of division and submission to his person.
In several interviews, he said he would not consider himself to be ratified with half plus one of the votes, but added, without mentioning the percentages, that a result "in Bulgarian" would not be good either.
People close to Carod demand the president a little more than to make his position available to the militancy, a gesture that is not valid when Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s controls the maximum organ between congresses.
But since they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will try to approve a roadmap with the executive until May.
For this purpose, they hope to participate in the drafting of the strategic reorientation document that the management will submit to the vote of the National Council on 18.
His intention is to support Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s in exchange for his promise to schedule the congress for the fall of 2011, which the leaders see as a sure fact.
The ERC leader admitted that the "polyphony" affects stability and that its goal is to make the organization once and for all able to wash its room linen with the family.
In this line, the article that current advisor Josep Huguet signed in his blog is symptomatic.
Considered the ideologue of Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s, the owner of Innovaci<0xC3><0xB3> thought that the fact that the leader will be ratified "in exchange for various objectives" is as if it had been done.
And he listed five of them, of which he points out two.
The first is to "recompose" the executive so that it represents at least 90% of the militancy, that is, to include new figures from the Carod adept sector.
The second can be the character of great news.
Huguet proposes that liquid ERC once and for all assembly as a mechanism of operation.
Thus, it advocates a reform of the statutes that allows the realization of congresses through delegates elected by vote.
Finishing with the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, was an obsession of the Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s team, who had already struggled in this direction in the last two congresses.
In fact, the 2008 conclave convulsive tasked the leadership to revise the assembly model in a specific statute reform congress.
This meeting remains unfinished, as the internal tide of recent years did not recommend addressing this topic.
Now, without critical sectors at the forefront, the time could be good to take it back and close it forever.
23 executions in November; 290 in 2010
According to the MILENIO of the State of Mexico, there was a decrease of 4 cases compared to 2010.
In November, 23 people were executed in the State of Mexico, four less than the previous month, according to MILENIO of the State of Mexico.
Among the murders are those of three women and the discovery of two bodies cut off in Valle de México.
In the previous month of the year, there were 390 deaths in theory related to organized crime.
Among the cases is the one of a body found in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitl<0xC3><0xA1>n, municipality of Toluca.
The subject had at least three gunshots and a blow to the head, apart from the feet and hands attached with a cable.

Very early on Thursday morning, the four owners of jointly exploited land found a body with signs of torture and at least three lethal shots in the chest, on the highway near Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal, in the area that crosses the municipality of Villa Guerrero.
Near the body we found a message signed in theory by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
A day later in Nezahualc<0xC3><0xB3>yotl a 50-year-old gentleman was murdered with eight shots when he left his house to initiate the garbage collection work.
On November 7, two 30-year-olds were killed by a gunshot to the head, each in the colony of San Pedro Xaloxtoc, municipality of Ecatepec.
In Chalco, with the shot of grace in the front we found the body of a man on a lonely road from Colonia El Naranjo and under the body we found a bullet hit by a 25 calibre firearm.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found in the blackwater canal of the Plaza Golondrina colony.
The emergency corps carried out a thorough search of the rest of the body members, but they were not found.
Residents of Tepotzotl<0xC3><0xA1>n warned of the discovery of a corpse that was in Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Colorada, the hands tied behind and the eyes bandaged.
The man had an injury caused by a gunshot to the neck.
In the middle of the month we reported the execution of two men who had been wrapped in blankets and abandoned in the trunk of a vehicle in the streets of the Villas de la Hacienda department in the municipality of Atizap<0xC3><0xA1>n of Zaragoza, we discovered at the same time with the victims two death warning messages.
A day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony, in the municipality of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby colony, the rest of the body was found wrapped in a black plastic bag with a message signed by L'Incorrigible.
On the 17th, wrapped in blankets, two women were found in the hamlet of Zoquiapan in the municipality of Ixtapaluca and the next morning we located the body of a man in Huixquilucan who had been wrapped in a yellow and blue blanket next to him, being in principle identified with the name Mario R<0xC3><0xAD>os, as a result of a message.
In Ixtapuluca, with gunshots into the neck, the body of a dead woman was found in the hamlet of San Francisco Acuautla.
On the woman's skin were detected Santa Muerte tattoos and necklaces with her image.
At the end of the month, the body of a man was found on the edge of a car in the municipality of Zinacantepec with at least three bullets and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the bodies of two men with their heads wrapped and a message were found in the community of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies was a message signed in principle by a criminal organization, which said: "That's what happens to those who don't align."
In Ecatepec, with signs of torture and with hands and feet attached, two bodies were found inside an abandoned taxi behind the San Agust<0xC3><0xAD>n Colony's Justice Center.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualc<0xC3><0xB3>yotl.
The first of them had been beheaded in the colony of Cuchilla Anc<0xC3><0xB3>n and had been wrapped in black plastic bags, attached with a cinnamon ribbon and a message next to it; while the second had been tortured and found in a plastic bag in the streets of Colonia Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez.
Near him, the officers found a bristol with a message.
China Maintains Goals to Reduce Greenhouse Gas
The country’s representative in COP16 said his country has made enormous efforts to reduce the trace of coal and detailed that it maintains its offer to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by between 40 and 45 percent by 2020.
China maintains its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, said Su Wei, the country’s representative at COP16.
In his first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce the trace of coal and convert its industry.
In fact, he said, his country has spent $245 million over the past four years in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Nevertheless, he made it clear that China would not change its objectives, but would continue to work together with the international community in this area.
He noted that China's climate change strategy was divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity-building; institution-building; and support for pilot programmes.
Progress has been made in all of these areas, including the approval last year of a new Energy Act, which recognizes the targets set for the reduction of greenhouse gases, he explained.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, the federal authorities have worked in a coordinated manner with the government and local authorities to achieve the goals of energy saving, energy efficient use and emission reduction.
In addition, he said, there are various multi-year plans underway or completed, funded both by the Chinese government and by the governments of other countries.
For example, he mentioned the Energy Efficiency Program, which has been implemented over the past five years and which has received investments from the United Nations (UN), the government and the private initiative.
There is also a provincial climate change project, another for the change of incandescent lamps by economic lamps, and another for mitigation and adaptation, he said.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the government’s scientific adviser on climate change, assured that China’s efforts were greater than one might think.
For example, he explained, the per capita emissions of greenhouse gases in China is three tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9% of the historical contribution to pollution.
Similarly, it has made unprecedented efforts in the use of energy, how to increase energy efficiency by 20% in the last five years and plans to make another similar by 2020, he said.
Legal expulsion of Espino: César Nava
The national leader of PAN detailed that the former Panist leader has the right to address the National Order Commission to claim what is right.
The national leader of PAN, César Nava V<0xC3><0xA1>zquez, assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was legal and that the former Panist leader has the right to address the National Order Commission to claim what is right.
In an interview prior to Gabino Cué Monteagudo's protest as governor of the state, he said that in any case, the expulsion of Espino is a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Commission d'Ordre de Sonora."
"Mr. Espino has the right to address, if necessary, by making a claim to the Order Commission of the National Council, so that this is a decision taken within a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, he clarified that this is not the time to think about 2012 and there has never been an alliance on the negotiating table for the presidential candidacy.
Nava V<0xC3><0xA1>zquez said he was convinced that Acci<0xC3><0xB3>n Nacional would be stronger after the internal elections on December 4 and 5, where a successor should be elected.
“This (an alliance in 2012) is an aspect that has never been on the negotiating table, at least for the time being, it has been an approach for local elections that has been successful and has achieved its goal,” he said.
The Panist leader mentioned that PAN is backed by 71 years of dialogue, which is why "internal competition does not scare us; on the contrary, "we enjoy it and make us stronger," he said.
He said that the council will probably be able to elect the best leader that Acci<0xC3><0xB3>n Nacional needs for the next three years, so he would give the lead "to the person determined by the council."
"I'm completely calm and open, I'd be proud to leave the office of president of the party to any of the five."
He predicted that the party's relaunch in the July 4 election will be reflected on the next dispute, although "it's not yet time to think about 2012."
"For the moment, it is a question of accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments that emanate from the alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a reason for observation throughout the country, so there has been "a lot of hope in terms of them, and I'm sure Gabino will be up to expectations."
When asked about PRI's criticisms of President Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n over his speech during his four-year reign, César Nava asked the prime ministers to reflect on the six years of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
“If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo y Salinas have been better than those of Fox y Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n; that they start defending them; that they come out of the closet,” he said.
He stated that the holder of the Federal Executive can make expressions like those he made in his speech in the National Auditorium, because in the country there is no gossip, let alone censorship.
Obama tweets law for undocumented students
"If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to approve this legislation," the president tweeted on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama has joined the national mobilization to support the Dream Act, to legalize students without papers, with a message in his personal Twitter account.
“If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to approve this legislation,” Obama tweeted.
His short message keeps open a cybernetic link to a broader document asking the public to contact senators immediately, as the vote on the legislation is imminent.
“With a vote we’re hoping for soon, now is the time to listen to your voice,” he said.
The message was released after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote of any legislation if the extension of Bush-era tax cuts and government funding continue.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Asked about the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other projects, Presidential Spokesman Robert Gibbs said he is confident that once the tax problem is resolved we will be able to set an agenda for the rest of the projects.
"I think we have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that this tax problem must be resolved before the end of the year..."
“I think we can get an agreement at some point in that direction and then we can plan the sequence of the rest,” he said.
Senate Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid announced on Tuesday that he would request a "closing vote of debate" for the Dream Act, which is why the initiative to legalize students without papers could be voted on from next Thursday in the Senate, even if the most likely.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or the American Dream Act would legalize 800,000 young people who arrived in the United States before the age of 16, have remained in that country for the past five years and have been accepted by a higher education institution or by the Army.
But supporters need 60 votes to approve the initiative, which is why they need the support of a large number of Republicans, at a time when protagonists of the project are lobbying intensely to ensure the approval of the Act.
The Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against and only one Republican expressed his support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
That is why supporters of the Dream Act require the vote of several Republicans if other Democrats decide to vote against the initiative.
Among the most courteous Republicans are Senators Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and outgoing Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who completed the term with Senator Mel Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch, of Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson, of Texas, but they said they would not support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who supported him, John McCain, has not defined his stance so far.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the biggest obstacles to the Dream Act are in the Senate.
With the literature we put the finger on the wound
The second stage of the Pleasures of Language was a walk in which the participants exhibited the narrative
"Sex in the language, I understand it, but... the finger on the wound? what do they hope of me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second stage of the Pleasures of the language, a cycle that was explied in the other - a cycle that celebrated the literature in Spanish, and which was used this time.
The finger on the wound "...we are embarrassed", said the Argentine writer gently to the public, most of the young people, who had gathered at the International Book Fair of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this table moderated by Marisol Shultz and attended by Valenm<0xC3><0xAD>gio Raenzuela.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio that Shultz defined after as a great story, with Luisa in the first person as a protagonist looking to find out what the "pest" is, she goes from one doctor to another, without getting an answer, only clues in the same narrative thread.
From the infectiologist she comes out convinced: "Patience is not my strength, it may be my wound."
In the end, after a frustrating approach with the traumatologist who cut his breath in the middle of the hallway, but who explains that wound is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the wound is what is actually open, the symbolic is the scar".
The protagonist sighs relieved and concludes: "On the wound I could only know that it is open in reality and that it does not exist", but convinced that the pleasures and traps of the language must be very closely connected with each other.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez also exhibited a delightful narrative that he titled Praise to the Invention, where the finger on the wound is not numbered but at some point is discovered.
With a touch of magical realism, he speaks of a famous enchanting woman who touched the clouds, made people return who had gone far or repaired the virtues that a lady had lost, a narrative that turned to speak of the Americas.
"Cervantes, who invented us all (the writers) made fun of the false witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but in an apt way we would never have told the history of America with an imagination that even lacked pudding."
Nevertheless, he stressed, "the mad and the liars have the best imagination" and here the reality converges with the lie, it is no longer known what part of the narrative belongs to one or the other, where the fictional literature reaches its peak.
This is actually called the ‘Cervantes tradition’.
"It is through his legacy that we are what we are told."
In turn, the writer Mayra Montyero noted and applauded the variety of interpretations provoked by the FIL's invitation with its round table Le d'ite sur la souci<0xC3><0xB3>n.
The Cuban-Portugal has put its finger on the great wound of the social violence that its country is going through - and Latin America shares - produces disputes over the trafficking and sale of drugs.
"I think that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit commitment that is not of course premeditated," she said, after citing that the reality of literature is the communication and the dimension of the commitment that is established between the author and the readers.
The evening ended with the intervention of the Spanish poet Luis Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a Montero who also stressed "it must be on the wound of the engaged writer".
He considered that in a world that lives at high speed also with regard to intellectual habits and the control of consciousness which turns to the benefit of dogmatisms, "behind every assertion there is a small no and behind every negation there is a small yes".
"To be the masters of our own feelings and to be the masters of reality, we must shade: and nuance means many times to put a finger on the wound and disturb people who feel very comfortable thinking in caricature, in white and black, to re-sensing, in established ideas and without nuance, and to disturb it.
Romano on the hunt for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in finals he had highs and lows in his career, but he managed to reach the decisive series three times.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, there are also two different styles that confront each other, marked by their technicians, who find a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has had three defeats in the finals, he has had highs and lows in his career, but he has managed to reach the decisive series three times, although so far he has not put in the thousand and that is why this opportunity is very special for him.
The Argentine ended up consoling with the sub-champion medal, he remained a step behind the winners and curiously with the same team he played consecutive finals.
The Santist strategist reached his first final as a coach in the 2002 Open, when he held the reins of Morelia with which he lost with an overall result of 4-2 against Toluca; later against that end, in the close of 2003 he also came to the global duel with a decisive 1 with a new loss.
With Santos Laguna already, in the 2010 Bicentenary Tournament, again against the Diablos, Rubén suffered a reversal again, as his team made an equal 2-2 match against the Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the penalty shootout series he got an advantage for 3-1 and three re-takes in the rematch.
Rubén lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his rival in the tournament, so he does not want to have the same fate, he tries to break away from the curse to be able to celebrate a title for the first time, even though he claims that for him the institution is more important.
"I want to be a champion, I don't want to break any statistics, it's for a club, not for a passion that I have and therefore I will get the title, but what I mentioned before is more important," he said.
He remembers a lot of the finale last, from which he assures that he learned a lot, "the only lesson we can remember is that until the referee whistles the final, we can not celebrate, we can't prepare in the line, we can't stop the players too, because the last time, with two penalties to score we were already.
He knows that this final series could be defined by hand penalties, which does not worry him, because he confides in his players: "We never try to get to the series of penalties, we try to finish in the regular time, but sometimes we're left by us we're going to prepare, the previous tournament we've been badly prepared.
Romano now has the opportunity to no longer be a sub-champion technician and taste for the first time the glory offered by the titles.
The European Union changes the rules for obtaining a visa
Individuals must go to the Visa Applicant Service Centers before their interview in the Consular Section; the cost of waiting time will be reduced.
As of January 10, 2011, the visa processing procedure at the U.S. Embassy and Consulates will change.
With the new procedure, the majority of applicants will have to appear at the Visa Applicant Service Centers (ASC) before their interview in the Consular Section.
CSA staff will take the biometric information of the applicant, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have some benefits for applicants, including the following:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, it will no longer be necessary to make a payment to get an appointment, another payment for processing the visa and another for the postal service to deliver the document.
The applicant will make a one-time payment covering all three services.
The current rate will remain the same: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visas with application (including visas for temporary workers) and $390 for merchant and investor visas.
Individuals wishing to renew their visa will not be required to apply for an interview with the Consular Representative, they will only apply to the nearest CSA where they will present the documents and their fingerprints will be taken.
Due to the fact that biometric information will be taken in the CSA, applicants who want a second appointment to be interviewed in the Consular Section will remain there less time than before.
Similarly, visa applicants at the Consulates of Ciudad Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra service fee of $26.

NASA Announces Discovery of Extraterrestrial Life
The U.S. space agency quoted the press as presenting tomorrow a discovery that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will announce an astrobiological discovery tomorrow, which could prove the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented at a press conference Thursday at 13:00 at NASA’s headquarters in Washington for experts in astrobiology, the science that studies the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
When she cited the press, NASA assured that it would present who would have an impact on the search for extraterrestrial life,” which sparked speculation from experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures similar to us and in hostile environments that were thought uninhabited and would put on the table the possibility of becoming intelligent beings like humans if their living conditions are improved.
It seems that we are talking about a microbe discovered at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, which lives in an environment that was thought to be too poisonous for any form of life, because the lake is rich in arsenic.
In any case, the creature uses arsenic as a way of life and this ability makes us think that similar life could exist on other planets that do not have our voluntary atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, this proves that "there is another form of life, a second form of life, different from the one we know".
The space agency will communicate the true scope of the findings at tomorrow’s press conference on Thursday.
The conference will be attended by geologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (the largest satellite on Saturn), under the perspective that its chemistry is similar to that of Earth.
Germe PRD, PT, Convergencia and Opposite 'block' Pattern
With reforms to the Congress’ Organic Law, the arrival of ‘bipartisanism’ is possible, it is denounced.
The 60th arrived when an opposition bloc led by the MPs of PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Manuel Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n Montalvo appeared in Congress, which declared itself independent and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of 'bipartisanism' in the Houses.
Before initiating the installation session of the 60th Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez, of Convergencia; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of PRD; and Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n Montalvo, 'tonned' against the reform of the Organic Law, because this excluded
With this reform, they reiterated, we initiate ‘bipartism’ because now there are two people, of the same number of parties, who control Congress.
These four MEPs, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, PRD coordinator, were the only ones to vote against the Board chaired by PANiste Salvador L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Brito and Luis Antonio C<0xC3><0xA1>rdenas Fonseca, as vice-president.
Corvera Quevedo mentioned that these reforms institutionally constitute the political marginality on the part of PRI and PAN.
He mentioned that in the following days they would talk to representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme from a political will and if they do not, they will be again enslaved by both parties and thus the opposing coalition will end.
“So far [the opposition coalition] has arrived, that’s what I’m looking at, because we’re excluded from any decision, they don’t even have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest.”
Felipe Manzanarez Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez, of Convergencia mentioned that with PRD, PT and Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n there are coincidences and that is why they form a plural group.
It cannot be allowed, he continued, that Congress, after having been monopolistic, is now "duopolistic".
“It is not the spirit of law reform that there is an eternal bipartisanship in Congress.”
To begin with, this group starts with 5 legislators and they are now talking to other colleagues to make them more numerous, the Convergent said.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of PT, explained that now Congress has turned into a 'butin' between two, alluding to PAN and PRI.
“Before there was only one party, now they divide it between two.”
Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n Montalvo asked to respect the MP’s personality, to give him his place at the negotiating tables.
"If they don't leave out five, which will probably be nine MPs, now the five that we see, separated into different factions, we have decided to join together to seek a place in the negotiating table, that's the problem we are agreeing with, that in the reform that we've made, that we've decided," he said.
$200 million more for "the supplier"
The City of Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n pays another check to the owner of the electrical equipment company in question.
Another check of about 200 thousand pesos in favour of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the City Hall.
With this, the amount paid to the owner of the electrical equipment company in the second half is 1 million 200 thousand pesos.
According to the transparency page of the Municipality, this last check number 9258447 was issued on November 16 for the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, in the concept of "account liquidation suppliers".
Treasurer Luis Miguel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Moreno had said that the Municipality would pay additional amounts to this supplier, which was observed by the State Superior Audit to sell at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total debt and, therefore, how many checks will still be issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
“We didn’t buy anything, we just pay him what we owe him, like the rest of the suppliers,” he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: on September 24, two on October 15, 19, 29, and the last on November 16.
Although the provider has not yet been published in the Official Journal of the State, according to the provisions of the Act when a company is questioned by ASE, to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasurer has assured that they have not used its services again.
All this, after July 25 Northwest had published a review of the checks that the City Council issues to its suppliers, revealing that in the period March 2008 - July 2010, in the triennial of the Mayor Jorge Abel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez, the Municipality of Camacho Palazuelos paid more than 10 million pesos, 42 pesos.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, cashing checks of more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist sites need to be taken care of
Tourist entrepreneurs regret the accident of the foreign tourist due to the poor conditions of the S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Taboada roundabout in Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a cave in the S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Taboada roundabout, the tourist sector of Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n asked the authorities to pay attention to areas and sites that are in poor conditions and project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Merchants of Zona Dorada, recalled that they have repeatedly requested that the image of the destination be taken care of and new activities should replace others that tourists find bad.
He said the poor condition of the streets and sidewalks has affected as tourists come for a walk and they see the mess and avoid nearby shops.
“Politicians don’t know what it means to close a business one day and they don’t know the fortune you lose, otherwise they didn’t do the work for so long and without proper planning.”
The hotelier José Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Manguart S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez said that the fall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance on the part of the City Hall.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and prevent it from happening again, how to do it, so through a preventive interview and not just make the correction," he said.
“We want to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area you have to maintain it, but as residents who deserve a clean place to live there and the City Hall has to change its strategy to maintain the city well.”
There are other sites that are neglected and incomplete, he said, such as Escudo and Venadito de Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n.
"Today, because the tourist comes, it depends not only on the promotion, there must be a good product, a city that has cleanliness in its beaches, boulevards, permanent maintenance of tourist attractions," he said.
“We haven’t given them the attention they need and this kind of fact highlights something that’s known to everyone, maintenance is necessary.”
Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Llera Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez, Deputy Secretary of Tourism Promotion, said the recovery of Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n’s tourist sites is urgent because they are not used properly and project a bad image.
He talked about a number of places that must put themselves together with the municipality and be a priority to have the city up-to-date, clean, orderly and be attractive because it has a tourist vocation.
"Happily Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n offers a lot of historical and cultural sites and places that should be ordered first, cleaned up and put online to make them attractive so we can add them to the inventory we have to promote this destination."
IP calls for results in Congress
Eduardo D<0xC3><0xA1>valos, president of the CEC, proposed that MEPs take the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations it faces.
Mazatlan’s business sector is calling for a work-worthy Legislature that is free of agreements between the parties and the Government Executive, as Sinaloa is in a state of consternation and is facing major problems.
Yesterday we installed the 60th legislature consisting of seven political forces, 19 MPs from PRI, 13 from PAN, three from the New Alliance Party, two from PRD, one from PT, one from Convergencia and one from PVEM, a total of 40 popular representatives.
The list of expectations that the new members of the Government Congress are a clean and committed management with society and the various sectors that need responsible legislative work and that the same patterns of party spirit or paternalism do not repeat themselves.
Eduardo D<0xC3><0xA1>valos, president of the CEC, proposed that MEPs take the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations it faces.
"We hope that MPs will actually exercise their right, free of agreements between the parties because the custom is that they make pacts to guard their own interests and they turn into a carnival masquerade of rulers and leaders of parliamentary factions."
That is why I am asking them to certify their commitment to establishing the necessary bridges for the current Governor to make progress.
“We will make sure they do a decent job and are committed to society and the sectors as the people of Sinaloa have given them their vote of confidence in the past elections.
José Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Manguart S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez, president of the Three Islands Hotels Association, considered that one of the major provocations of the 40 popular representatives is to push and add forces in search of economic growth of the state, because now the economic situation is very complicated.
“The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, that they generate incentives for investment and infrastructure, and that in a way will stimulate the generation of jobs.”
With regard to tourism, he requested that the new legislators give it the importance it has in the government budget to consolidate the Government Tourism Secretariat.
"I understood that this is the second Secretariat of State with a smaller budget and it is incongruous as an important economic activity and generating currency and investment and which rivals directly with the agro-industry."
Apart from the fact that resources need to be classified into detonating tourism projects that help provide assurance to the state and update the Alcohol Act that previous legislatures have not been able to resolve.
We're looking for a mage king
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the desire of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For their parents, the next day of the Magi will be difficult to fulfill their illusions, as their home is formed by neither more nor less than 12 people and a goat.
However, Adelaide, Isabel, Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s, José Alfredo, Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchior, Balthazar and Gaspard will bring them the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a humble Colonia Salvador Allende house and they live day-to-day because their father does not have a stable job.
"Sometimes it's very difficult for us, because my husband doesn't have a job, but we sell mandarins and potatoes...and in the afternoon I go out with the 'plebe' to sell on the street," says Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Adelaide, 4, wants a doll or a bicycle, and her sister Isabel, 3, would like a Barbie doll.
In turn, 10-year-old José Alfredo has long aspired to have a 'monster truck' and for his little brother Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s, 8 months old, Cayetana suggests sized clothes for a year.
“He said to me, ‘I’d like to have this monster,’ but I told him, ‘we’ll see, my son,’ because he was very expensive,” Cayetana recalls sadly.
For older children, who were in school, clothing and shoes would be ideal.
Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Guadalupe, 11, was wearing size 12; Isaiah, 10, was wearing size 10, while Miguel, 8, was wearing size eight.
José Juan, 14, needs a pair of sports shoes, so a pair of size five and a half or six would help him a lot.
If you want to help realize the dream of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family you can participate in the campaign On Search King Mage, by giving a toy or money to the reception of Noroeste.
Fourteen suspected drug traffickers arrested
A dozen searches were carried out in Estrie on Wednesday as part of the dismantling of a cannabis production and sale network.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
The searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places that were believed to have been used for drug production.
“About 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, money and equipment used for production have been seized,” said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for S<0xC3><0xBB>reté du Québec.
In all, eleven men and three women were arrested, including the two alleged heads of the network, two Sherbrooke men.
The arrested persons were to appear at the Sherbrooke courthouse within hours of their arrest.
They could face charges of cannabis production, possession for the purpose of trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These searches took place as a result of a long-haul investigation, which lasted almost a year.
"It was information received from the public that allowed us to carry out these arrests," Ruel said.
Some 70 police officers from the regional investigative module of the Québec Security Branch, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphismagog Police Department took part in this police operation.
Illegal migration can continue without problems.
The Conservative bill, which the government says should deal with the problem of boats loaded with illegal migrants, is obviously going to be beaten as the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I strongly rely on the Charter."
"I stand with a party that created the granite under your feet," Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff said as he was surrounded by MPs after the caucus' weekly meeting.
The Liberals argue that the proposed bill, which would allow for up to a year's detention of anyone from a ship identified as carrying illegal immigrants, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The head of the Bloc Québécois, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that he could not support the bill, because he is taking it to the wrong target.
“We are against it and it seems that all opposition parties are against it, so we’ll see what the government will do,” Duceppe said.
NPD’s immigration critic, Olivia Chow, has turned back critics wanting her party not to be firm enough about illegal immigrants.
“The New Democrats agree to take action against illegal smugglers, and that’s what we do through another bill, the C-35,” Chow said.
“We do not support the Conservative Bill because it takes care of refugees and imprisons children for at least one year,” Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused opposition parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
“Canadians are massively telling MPs that they do not tolerate this kind of clandestine migration, these criminal operations that target Canada and treat the country like a straw.”
“They expect Canada to take firm action,” said Minister Kenney.
The government has not announced a vote of confidence on its bill, which could have led the country to elections that would have come to its rejection.
A conservative, however, told the QMI Agency that the government was going to ask for a vote so that every member who opposes it would then explain themselves to its voters.
The new unit does not unanimously
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a permanent unit to combat corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the creation of a public inquiry commission on the subject.
The Minister of Public Security, Robert Dutil, argues that this idea does not date from yesterday: Québec would have consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this as early as January.
The metropolis has had a permanent unit on corruption since 1870.
However, Tuesday’s announcement surprised more than one.
It should be noted that at a meeting of the Permanent Council on Québec Police Services on October 29, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
It was no longer necessary for the Pequist public safety critic, Stéphane Bergeron, to call this announcement "a rabbit out of a hat" and "a briquetted solution on the corner of a table".
Minister Dutil responded to those who fear that political power will have too much influence on possible future unity.
"You're going to see the result when we're going to announce it, he's just saying."
“We are aware of that problem.”
For CSQ President Réjean Parent, nothing can replace the setting up of a public investigation.
“The more Mr. Charest insists on not wanting to create this investigative committee, the more people like you and me think he has something to hide,” he said.
"The only way to have an investigative committee is to resign Jean Charest," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To get out of this impasse, he therefore suggested that Quebec should give a special mandate to the Auditor General to investigate collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the Auditor General," he said.
He also believes that Québec could give the auditor the same powers as a commissioner, allowing him to oblige people to testify.
The creation of a permanent squad is not the only project in the Charest government's cartons.
Quebec would also ask Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code in order to be better adapted to this type of crime.
The request would come from the Prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law is not explicit in such investigations.
Federal Minister of Public Security, Vic Toews, confirmed that his colleague for Justice, Rob Nicholson, is currently considering some amendments related to this matter.
During Operation Spring 2001, which hit groups of motorcyclists, although the Criminal Code was not appropriate, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently enacted the Gangsterism Act.
Rivers under High Surveillance
Several streams remain under high surveillance due to heavy rainfall that has hit several parts of the province since Tuesday.
A landslide occurred Wednesday afternoon in Shawinigan, Mauritius.
Two houses were evacuated in a preventive manner.
In the evening, another sliding occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudi<0xC3><0xA8>re.
A road has slowed down.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rainfall fell on several regions, i.e. 40 to 70 millimeters of rain.
An additional 20 to 40 millimeters of rain was expected by Thursday night, according to the regions.
The areas north of the river and in the Outaouais Valley were the most affected.
They could receive up to 100 millimeters of rain in total.
As these precipitations need to be added to the melting of snow already accumulated in some sectors, there is a fear of the overflow of several streams.
Flood warnings were issued Wednesday evening by the Civil Security of Quebec for the rivers Ourareu and Achigan, in Lanaudi<0xC3><0xA8>re.
The rivers of the North, in Saint-Jér<0xC3><0xB4>me, in the Laurentians, and of the Oak, in Lotbini<0xC3><0xA8>re, were the subject of flood warnings and remained under surveillance.
In the Lanaudi<0xC3><0xA8>re region, heavy rainfall has led to the overflow of some lakes in Sainte-Julianne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was taken due to heavy rains.
Ten residences had to be evacuated for preventive measures.
In Outaouais, the overflow of some lakes led to the closure of several roads, notably in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
Civil security remains on alert and monitors the situation closely, said Annik Bouchard, security adviser.
The Québec Flood Forecasting Centre on Wednesday issued warnings of heavy floods for several rivers, including Maskinongé, L'Assumption, Ourareau, Achigan, Batiscan and the Wolf.
Dupont partially blamed
Québec radio host Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial setback before the Canadian Council of Radio Television Standards (CCNR) for controversial remarks on social assistance and Haitians as well as on his gross on-air language.
The CCNR considers that Mr. Dupont and his team at CHOI 98.1 FM were entitled to express their views, but that some statements contained "inaccurate information on social assistance, improperly negative representations of Haitians and gross language that is not suitable for broadcasts during the day".
The Commission also concluded that a discussion on suicide, including the dissemination of the names of two people who had committed suicide, did not violate the broadcasting codes.
The CCNR had received several complaints about comments made during broadcasts between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made as a result of a complaint from the Québec Joint Front of Social Assistance Persons.
The group complained that the amounts quoted in the issue were inaccurate.
Animators must present solid information rather than deceptive.
With regard to suicide, animator Stéphane Dupont had considered suicide to be a cowardly gesture.
The majority of Committee members concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life's problems.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes in question of 'Dupont le Midi' have addressed a delicate subject in a fair and appropriate manner."
So no blame has been held in his place.
The latest litigation was about statements that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had then turned to a media face-to-face that had provoked a lot of reactions.
The CHOI host said he had made no donations to help Haitians because it was not possible to know for sure that people in need would really receive the money.
The Committee believes that these comments were not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an unduly negative representation of Haitians.
"I've already purged my three-day suspension on it."
"My file has been blank for a year and a half," the host said.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the dissemination of coarse language.
In each case, the broadcaster CHOI-FM collaborated "beyond its obligation".
The consequences are minimal for the station, which will, among other things, have to announce these decisions once during the hours of great listening within three days.
King of Kung Fu in Montreal
The Montréal of Algerian origin Nacereddine Zemmal has an extremely special course.
The athlete who excels in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and Thai boxing climbs the tatamis and rings of the world in search of new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts like kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria," Zemmal said, who has been in the metropolis since 2008 to evolve with professionals.
"In my case, I'm looking for fights everywhere, because for those who don't like ground play in mixed martial arts, competitions are rare in North America."
Recently, the person who works as a security agent and as a commissioner for the UPS company has just delivered bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Amateur Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) World Championship, from October 23 to 30, in Edinburgh.
"I won the categories of full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing," he explained.
"Currently, I am preparing to go to China for the San Shou World Cup."
"The fighters who finished in the top four at the last World Championship in each category were invited."
"I won bronze in 2009 in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished eighth."
"In 2007, in China, I finished the tournament in fifth place, while I finished third in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"What's interesting is that I've made progress with every competition."
"At that rate, I'll be first this time or next year!"
"San shou" or "sanda" is a discipline originating in China where hand and foot strokes, as well as ground projections, are allowed.
Duels originally take place on a platform and more rarely in a ring.
The most famous fighter from this form of combat is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, well-recognized in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal has only one event in his career, he will certainly answer his presence at the super tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of kung-fu.
"This competition is the highest and most prestigious in China," explained the friendly gaillar.
"It's a bit the equivalent of Lumpinee Stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
"It was a great experience."
Zemmal won his first game, in the semi-final of his category (80 kg), before losing in the final.
"The one who beat me was a real pro," he said.
"There are four fighters per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals face each other in the final of their category."
"Then the winners of each category face each other in order to crown one champion, the king of kung fu."
<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>450 million in contracts without tenders
Hydro-Québec has voluntarily awarded $450 million in contracts to engineering firms for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, it is a consortium formed by the firms BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor that obtained the most important, that of project management, for a sum of $295 million without a bid.
This consortium called <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance was established in 2004 in conjunction with Hydro-Québec's decision to entrust the private sector with its responsibility to manage this major $5 billion hydroelectric project.
At the beginning of 2005, the Energy Management Consortium obtained the lucrative contract without a public tender.
For the Parti Québécois, the use of business consortia poses a serious ethical problem that risks eliminating competition and causing price increases.
"It's the new way to make collusion and beat the competition."
“That is, people, instead of doing it in a secret way, now do it in an open way,” Pequean MP Sylvain Simard told a news conference yesterday.
Earlier in the morning, Mr. Simard raised the issue in the National Assembly because he said it was difficult to see how the public interest could be served in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, responded in the afternoon, strongly denying that there was collusion for the contract.
“I’m starting to have my trip,” she said, arguing that the PQ had been “dishonest” and had “lack of rigor.”
She said that "it would be the least of the things" that the PQ apologizes.
The consortium formula is a common practice around the world.
It is usually a time-limited alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their respective expertise in order to respond to a call for tenders for a complex project.
The Eastmain project has a high level of complexity given the scope of the work.
The project is currently under construction and is scheduled to be completed by 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without the game of competition acting; there was negotiation.
Also, the consortium formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Duvoir revealed last week, the formula of consortia in the consultancy sector is being investigated by the government.
A quick overhaul of the Québec business register makes it possible to count more than 200 consortia, some of which appear to be permanent.
For example, Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, including CIMA<0x2B>, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and others Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads back to one and the same legal person, Dessau.
As for the Energy Management Consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of the James Bay responds to particular labour dynamics and that Hydro-Québec has responded in a particular way since the 1970s".
The head of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, of the James Bay Energy Society (SEBJ), gave an explanation that made the project's management contract more difficult.
"If you go for bids and there are few bidders, your prices will be higher."
“You have two choices: either you take the people who are in that market and you say we’re going to negotiate a satisfactory deal at a good price.”
"But the idea is that it's not the price that matters, it's the competence of the people," Laporte said.
This contract awarded to the Energy Management Consortium is part of a long list of contracts over $50,000 obtained by the Parti Québécois.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After auditing, Le Duvoir counted 109 consulting contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to firms or their subsidiaries, including soil laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has contracted 22, Génivar has obtained 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, not including its participation in Energy Management.
All the contracts have been negotiated.
They total $449,783,344, including the $295,131,564 Energy Management contract.
Sylvain Simard suggested that the four firms that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "well known to the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau dropped the fact that the PQ is also linked to those firms that "finance" it, before specifying that it was rather its leaders.
Responsible Consumption Barometer - "Green" Label Doesn't Inspire Trust
Greener, but frankly sceptical.
The Québec consumer has little confidence in sustainable development players, but also in fair brands and environmentally friendly certifications to guide their choices.
Pis, even if he bathes in a media universe where messages in favor of more responsible consumption are pulling, he deplores a lack of credible information, which he even calls a brake on his commitment, says the Barometer of Responsible Consumption, whose first reading was delivered yesterday.
Although they increased consumption of so-called socially responsible products in 2010, Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those trying to sell them.
Two-thirds of them say they don’t believe in corporate environmental commitment as well as company green advertising, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Sherbrooke University’s Responsible Consumption Observatory.
Another finding: half of consumers doubt the reliability of official certifications applied to so-called equitable products, but also the credibility of products and brands that appear to be eco-responsible, says the Barometer.
In the same vein, the speech of politicians on this topic is taken seriously by only 14.6% of Quebecers.
However, information on responsible consumption seems essential to boost this share of consumption currently driven by nearly a third of Quebec's consumers.
Indeed, the emptiness and dubious nature of the information would calm the burns of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the Barometer, after the higher price of these products.
In addition, a third of Quebecers also say they are distrustful of the alleged performance of green products or services they are trying to put in their hands.
On another note, consumers were nearly half in 2010 to have changed their habit and especially changed the brand of one or more products to meet their belief.
At 61%, they also favored purchases from merchants in their neighborhood and preferred the purchase of food products grown in their region, the Barometer said.
Greener and responsible - the responsible consumption index has reached 64 out of a maximum of 100 for this year - , the Homo consumus of Quebec likes to present itself as the king of recycling who seeks to reduce its environmental footprint by worrying about animal protection.
But his social and ecological awareness seems to remain outside his car, the Barometer says: in 2010, only 28% of Quebecers indicated they used public transport or recommended carpooling to defend their green interests.
Walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of participants in this vast behavioral survey, which has just taken its first shot.
A government loan for the purchase of eXcentris
The Government of Québec, which was asked to commit financially to the purchase of the eXcentris cinema complex by Société Angus et le Parallele, agrees to cooperate, but only for a loan.
The Angus Development Society and the Parallel, who were hoping for a $7 million donation from the Ministry of Culture to buy Daniel Langlois the eXcentris cinema complex on Saint-Laurent Boulevard by giving him back his full kinephilic vocation, did not get what they wanted.
The government agrees to get involved in the case, but on its own terms.
Rather than the expected donation, the Government of Quebec is proposing a loan whose amount would be lower than the initial expectations, which could be a viable solution at favorable conditions, at least in the opinion of sources from the state offices.
A first action plan and a 12.8 million request had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, but the requests have since been revised downwards.
A proposal and an action plan were sent to Minister St-Pierre by the president of the Society for the Development of Cultural Enterprises (SODEC), Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Macerola, who is piloting the eXcentris dossier.
He sent him a final report about ten days ago.
But the cabinet’s counter-proposal reached the SODEC on Tuesday.
Le Parallele and Angus have until December 31 to respond.
It seems, however, that the assumption of state donation really needs to be discarded.
The Association des proprietaires de cinemas et de cineparcs du Québec opposed a direct investment by the state to support the purchase of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture does not have to finance real estate projects, which it has not done for others.
On the contrary, a number of stakeholders in the community called for substantial economic aid.
Daniel Langlois, the master of céans, has spent ten years in the building of the complex after financing the building itself, which could justify a derogation from the Treasury Board.
The lack of rooms for independent films is screaming in Montreal, and eXcentris had been able to loyalize its customers.
The Angus Society and the Parallel, headed by Christian Yaccarini, are piloting a private funding campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to push the wheel of the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one of the three screens, The Parallel, continues to broadcast films at eXcentris.
The goal of the future buyers is to reopen the three rooms on February 27 by projecting the very beautiful film of Xavier Beauvois Men and Gods.
But Christian Yaccarini has not recalled The Duty and we do not know what he and his group think of the downside proposals made to them.
The veil lifted on a complex Canada...
The new U.S. diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks shed the veil on what the U.S. considers to be the inferiority complex of Canadians to Americans, but at the same time betray their sense of superiority to Canada.
Thus, U.S. diplomats are surprised that every Canadian voter does not have Canadian-American relations in mind by going to vote and believe that President Obama’s visit has helped the Conservative government adopt its budget in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, spread out in the public square yesterday, offer more crunchy details than substantial content to put under the radar.
A cable dated September 22, 2008, in the middle of the federal election campaign, recounts how the United States is not part of the issues discussed by political leaders.
To the great amazement of the American ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins offers some explanations for this situation.
“An almost intrinsic Canadian inferiority complex may predispose Canadian political leaders to talking about domestic issues of daily life rather than making this election focus on the United States (as in the 1988 free trade campaign),” he writes.
The United States is therefore, he concludes, “the proverbial elephant of this election: ubiquitous, but potentially too threatening to talk about it.”
The ambassador understands even less this "sudden silence" that the two countries have an intense political and economic relationship.
"Logically, he believes, the ability of a candidate, a party and even more than one party leader to manage this essential relationship should be a key factor that voters have in mind when going to vote."
The other expression of this feeling of importance reads in the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, in charge of business in Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
“Your journey will help ensure the government’s survival during the confidence vote in early February on the federal budget, whereby Canada will show its first deficit in more than a decade due to a $30 to $40 billion recovery plan,” Breese writes.
Nowhere is it mentioned that the government had to extend Parliament before Christmas to avoid being overthrown by the coalition and that opposition parties made its survival conditional on the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, warns Washington of the increasingly negative image that the drama series broadcast on CBC referencing the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about the issues of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which subtle references are observed to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or the CIA's kidnappings for muscular interrogations.
Another cable reports that, during their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to welcome some prisoners from Guant<0xC3><0xA1>namo.
Mr. Kouchner answered yes, but on the basis of "case by case".
At the end of the meeting, he wrote, "he handed over a paper to the Secretary of State about Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The secretary agreed to revisit the file."
Finally, let’s note that the minds are getting warmer about the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser very close to Stephen Harper, said on CBC’s radio that the person responsible for this massive leak should be “murdered.”
It was Mike Huckabee’s echo in the United States.
A Global Plan to Renovate Lighting
The United Nations proposed in Canc<0xC3><0xBA>n yesterday a plan to renovate domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries with a view to achieving a greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction that corresponds to almost a third of the additional reduction that needs to be achieved to stabilize the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is based on the major concrete projects that the United Nations hopes to have adopted in Canc<0xC3><0xBA>n to compensate for the absence of binding reduction commitments by industrialized countries.
According to the plan filed yesterday, if the incandescent bulbs that still monopolize 50 to 70% of the market were replaced by fluocompact bulbs or, better yet, by fluorescent diodes (DEL or "LED" in English), the bulk of the 1,8 billion fluorescent fluorescent light bulbs for the fluorescent fluorescent fluorescent bulbs (Gt).
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
That’s equivalent to 70% of the global car fleet’s emissions.
In Copenhagen last year, major emitting countries, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans that are expected to increase global GHG emissions from 53 GB to 49 GB.
But it will be necessary to subtract from this balance sheet another 5 Gt to manage to stabilize the rise of the climate to 2 degrees Celsius by 2020 in order to avoid it becoming out of control.
In incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy dissipates in the form of heat and the rest, or 5%, is produced by light.
With Fluocompact bulbs, the energy consumption is reduced by 75% and with the new LED bulbs, this energy need is reduced by twice again.
Fluocompact bulbs last on average 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
The new EL bulbs, such as those launched by the manufacturer Philips this week - this company has also participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a light bulb, giving an idea of the possible economy with a replacement plan.
These brand new bulbs can also work with rheostats in addition to emit very little heat.
They do not contain any mercury.
Several specialists have posted reservations about the place of the Fluocompact bulbs because they contain mercury and that they need to be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers put in place instructions.
But, the report says, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the Fluocompact bulb, but rather coal-fired thermal power plants, which emit a lot of mercury to produce electricity wasted in incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report details the gains that each country would make through this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save one billion dollars a year in electricity purchases and eight million tons of CO2, the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants that would cost it 2.5 billion.
C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire awaits the announcement of the election results in nervousness
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called for the publication of the results of the presidential election in C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire "without delay" after the deadlines had expired.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the Independent Electoral Commission to complete its work and announce provisional results without further delay," a spokesperson for the UN chief said.
"It calls on all Ivorian parties and institutions to exercise responsibility and refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the election commission passed Wednesday midnight without publishing the results, three days after Sunday's election, on Wednesday.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the CIS president had stated on television that the commission "continued to work" to announce the results.
Calls for the CIS to finally announce the name of the winner of the second round between outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and opponent Alassane Ouattara.
But Camp Gbagbo counts on the cancellation by the Constitutional Council of "fraudulent" votes in the north, held by the former New Forces Rebellion (UN) since the failed coup d'état in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, the Ivorian president's campaign director, said the UN's intimidation of voters in the north of the country had deterred supporters of the outgoing president from going to vote.
All elections could be cancelled if Gbagbo's complaints are withheld by the Constitutional Council.
Gbagbo’s opponents believe that the country’s highest court is not neutral because it is led by Paul Yao N’Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the North who denies any ties to the former rebels, considered the delay in announcing the results "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but he did not go until he claimed the victory.
His allies claim that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows he has lost and that it would be illegal to file a complaint with the Constitutional Council after preventing the electoral commission from disseminating the results.
The second round of the presidential election, on Sunday, was supposed to crown the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country that remained split in two for years.
The U.N. warned the Ivorian political class on Wednesday that it could be held accountable for possible violence.
Laurent Gbagbo finished in the first round on 31 October, with 38% of the votes against 32% to Alassane Ouattara, who received public support from former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
Unemployment rate remained stable in France in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France within the meaning of the International Labour Office (ILO) remained stable at 9.3% in the metropolis (9.7% counting the overseas departments), show provisional seasonal variations (CVS) data published Thursday by the Insee.
The number of unemployed is 2,631 million in the metropolis.
Data for the second quarter were confirmed at 9.3% of the working population in the metropolis and 9.7% with DOMs.
Over a year, the unemployment rate is up by 0.1 points.
More broadly, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter but wanted to work, whether or not they were available within two weeks to work and whether or not they were looking for a job.
The situation of young people in the labour market has further deteriorated, with a further increase in the unemployment rate, rising to 24.2% in the metropolis (<0x2B> 0.9 points over three months, <0x2B>0.5 points over a year) and 25% including DOM.
In the third quarter, 637,000 youth between the ages of 15 and 24 were unemployed within the meaning of the ILO.
Seniors experienced a slight increase in unemployment, to 6.4% in the metropolis (<0x2B>0.2 points over three months and over a year), i.e. 482,000 people aged 50 and over, and 6.6% with DOM.
Only 25-49-year-olds enjoyed unemployment stability in the third quarter, at 8.3% in the metropolis (-0.1 point over three months, <0x2B>0.1 point over one year) and 8.8% in all France.
The Insee has not published a monthly unemployment rate since 2006, after a controversy over its calculation method.
Eurostat, the European Union's statistics agency, on the other hand, continues to do so and announced Tuesday a 9.8% rate for France (DOM included) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini examined and held in custody
Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of waste treatment companies and brother of the PS president of the General Council of the Bouches-du-Rh<0xC3><0xB4>ne, was examined and crushed at the arrest house of Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence, as part of an investigation into pre-public procurement fraux.
Alexandre Guérini has been examined for abuse of social property, diversion of funds and public property, bribery, active corruption, influence trafficking and possession of ammunition, his lawyer says.
"Alexandre Guerini is combative and wants to explain himself on all the questions that the magistrate will ask him, not ghosts."
"It's easy to prosecute him for a multitude of reprehensible leaders, it's another thing to prove them," Florence Rault, her lawyer, told AFP before her client's hearing.
Mr. Guérini, brother of the strongman of the PS in the department, Jean-Noël Guérini, had, through his lawyers, to pass on to the judge before his hearing a memo in order to explain himself.
One of his relatives, Philippe Rapezzi, was also put on trial Wednesday evening and stabbed.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, his client never did anything but run the landfills he had to manage.
As for the allocation of contracts or the destination of funds related to their operation, he has never been aware of it, said Mr Simon.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former director general of the services of the agglomeration of Aubagne, was examined Wednesday for diversion of public funds and complicity, and released under judicial control with a ban on meeting the protagonists of the case.
"My client has been able to provide explanations for the facts that are accused of him."
“The Magistrate Instructor took this into account by not depriving him of liberty,” said his lawyer, Yann Arnoux.
Four other people had been examined and released in the night from Tuesday to Wednesday, with placement under judicial control for two of them, said the Deputy Prosecutor of the Republic Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy general director of cleanliness of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is being prosecuted for "influence traffic and passive corruption".
Two officials from the agglomeration of Aubagne, Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are being examined, one for "supply and diversion of public goods by a person in charge of a public service mission", the other for "complication of diversion of public funds".
Finally, Alexandre Guérini's companion, Jeannie Peretti, was put on trial for "abuse of social property".
Among the people who were confronted with Mr. Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who was recently involved in a parallel case of fraudulent public procurement in Corsica.
Investigators suspect his companies have served to launder money from the big banditry.
The investigation is carried out in the context of several judicial information opened against X in April 2009 following anonymous mail, for alleged fraud in the procurement of public contracts, in particular in the waste sector.
From a source close to the investigation, the investigations focus in particular on the conditions for the allocation and operation of a landfill of La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne as well as from certain cities of the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss case: the Elysée exaggerated the mediation of Syria
For more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for "spying", held the opinion in France, put diplomacy on alert, and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All this under the watchful eye of U.S. diplomats.
The U.S. documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by The World reveal some of the bottoms of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée explained its strategy to the Americans, even giving them advice on how to deal with their own hostage crises in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how French officials sought to convince Washington that the release of the young French woman had not resulted in the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and sought by the U.S. justice for trafficking in materials for the benefit of the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they place under a crude light the way the French presidency sought to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad had played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
In fact, it was nothing.
A diplomatic telegram written on August 12, 2009 in Paris is titled "Iran: French comments on how to handle hostage cases".
The Elysée’s adviser for strategic affairs, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d’Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, are meeting with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain to him the French method.
They advise the Americans to do the same to repatriate their own forcibly detained nationals to Iran.
“Make the noise,” they say, “martel continuously” in the media the words “fundamental human rights”, “innocence”, “immediate liberation”.
It is necessary in order to embarrass the Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
“Do it all the more because the Iranians are asking you not to do it.”
Because, after the attempts to discuss through discrete channels, "silence will not regulate anything", the Iranians are "masters in dilatary maneuvers".
Richier added that the arrest of foreigners is “a familiar Iranian tactic: taking hostages for political blackmail.”
He announced that the release of Clotilde Reiss' prison (which will take place on August 16, the day she takes refuge in the French embassy) "will require the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians" (230,000 euros of bail).
And he says that the Elysée is anticipating other hostage crises, a phenomenon that "would get worse".
The Iranians could “in the near future arrest another of the some 1,800 French citizens living in Iran,” he said.
August 28, 2009.
Clotilde Reiss has been released from prison for 12 days, but remains stuck in Iran.
Iran’s Majid Kakavand, whose U.S. claims to be extradited for illegal trafficking of sensitive electronic equipment to Iran, is being released in Paris on a judge’s decision.
The U.S. Embassy, like many observers, is questioning this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, which tracks Iran’s clandestine networks of acquisition of nuclear program equipment, Majid Khakavand’s expansion is bad news.
Is France Accepting a Trade?
Liberation of the Iranian against that of the French?
In a new interview with Kathleen Allegrone on September 4, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he says, not only "has been completely taken by surprise by the judge's decision", but has sought to oppose it.
"There have been vivid exchanges between the French presidency and the guard of seals" (at the time, Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot return to the judicial decision," he observes.
Mr. Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remains under the "close" supervision of the French intelligence services.
The adviser of the Elysée dials a phone number, hangs, and then informs the US diplomat that the Iranian “is currently located in buildings in Paris run by the Iranian embassy.”
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée does not make its efforts, through press releases and "flights" organized in the media, to make it believe that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad plays an "important" and "influential" role as a "mediator".
Americans observe this activity not without irony, and note that the manipulation bears fruit since several press articles repercuss the official French version.
A telegram dated August 25, 2009 mentions "the media 'blitz' of French officials".
On which is based so much "gratitude" expressed to Mr. Assad, the embassy in Paris is asked.
“Despite their laudable statements, French officials privately acknowledge that they have only a vague notion of what the Syrians have actually done.”
The document then looks at the reasons that prompted the Elysée to pour into this fiction.
The intense communication effort “seeks to validate Sarkozy’s policy of openness to Syria,” he analyzes.
A policy launched in 2008, which "was then perceived by many critical voices in France and abroad as premature and immerited".
By “exaggerating the Syrian role,” Paris seeks to “demonstrate to Syria what praise it can draw by playing a constructive role in the region.”
The goal is also to “seed seeds of discord between Syria and Iran.”
The U.S. Embassy knows this from a good source.
On August 11, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier told him: "Of course, we don't know if the Syrians did anything."
"But we thanked them anyway."
“This should at least sow confusion among the Iranians.”
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives it at the Elysée.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal, and Syria for their "active role in the liberation of our country".
No online games for young Koreans past midnight
The South Korean government will adopt a so-called "Cendrillon" law that will ban teens from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials said.
A bill will be submitted to parliament in December to ask online gaming companies to block access to these games after midnight, young people under the age of 16, officials from the ministries of culture and family said.
“A lot of kids play these games all night and then have trouble studying at school and having a normal life during the day.”
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," Jo Rin, the ministerial official in charge of the bill, told AFP.
Online games will be available again at 6 a.m.
Companies will have one year to prepare for the law’s enforcement, he said.
The government also plans to ask companies to limit the daily access time to these games for young people whose parents request it, the official added.
It will also make available to people who demand it free software that allows to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly report various facts related to the intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion of global online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, against 58 other nations.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA appoints the organising countries
In full turmoil over suspicions of corruption, the FIFA Executive Committee on Thursday designated the host countries of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, an eminently political choice where influence struggles and lobbying risk taking a step on technical criteria.
One thing is for sure, the 2018 edition of the FIFA competition will take place in Europe, the traditional bastion of the discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
That of 2022 will be much more exotic, with the International Federation hoping to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a first on the African continent in 2010, or to continue its deployment in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities in the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch heads of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) measures the economic and political challenges of a World.
Therefore, behind-the-scenes treatments may last until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy between the candidates.
According to the FIFA assessment report, English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) files have better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not be very heavy for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the vote.
The Sunday Times, which was responsible for the revelations that led to the suspension for corruption of two CE members (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), may have ruined the chances of his country, the cradle of football that hosted the World Cup only once, in 1966.
On Monday, the BBC released a documentary that pinned three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
What to be dissatisfied with and embarrassed by the British officials, who have embarked on intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron in the front line.
The head of government hopes to re-edit the successful coup by his predecessor, Tony Blair, who had won the Olympic Games for London in 2005.
Will this intense activity suffice to bring the coat of arms of England back to the EC?
Nothing is less certain because the Spain-Portugal duo is not lacking with its stadiums already ready, its expertise (World-82 in Spain, JO-92 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the dark economic and financial prospects of the two countries could undermine their ambitions.
Possible reprisals against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only increase the rank of Russia, which has become an outsider of weight despite the gaps in its record (stadiums, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to make the move to Zurich and denounced "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote", in a barely veiled allusion to the accusations of the English press against members of the EC.
“We cover them with mud, we try to compromise them,” Putin said.
By 2022, the United States, strong from the 1994 experience, appears as the logical favorites.
As the world’s first economic power, home to the main sponsors of FIFA, the country seems to have a long way ahead of Japan and South Korea, who have built a very beautiful project separately.
But these new applications appear premature for two countries that co-organized the test in 2002.
Another threat: the granting of the 2026 World Cup to China, ardently desired by FIFA, which would in fact make Asian chances for 2022 obsolete.
With Qatar, which came out the big game by proposing futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue to expand to new countries, but these two countries present more risks than certainties.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also suffer from the weakness of TV rights acquitted (due to the time shift) by European countries, the nerve of the war for FIFA.
Second Mandate: Evidence
De Gaulle really hesitated.
Mitterrand had made him think he was hesitant.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not hesitate.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than them.
A mandate at the Elysée calls for another.
So the current head of state will be a candidate in 2012.
But the obvious does not do well with the part of mystery attached to the presidential function.
So we have to act as if there is always doubt.
In one sense as in the other.
In 2006, even without believing it, Jacques Chirac's friends claimed that a third term was not excluded.
On November 15, Nicolas Sarkozy assured that he would make his decision "somewhere in the fall of 2011".
Speaking in front of UMP parliamentarians on Tuesday night at the Elysée, the prospect of "two terms" sowing a bit of feverish.
Was this the official announcement of his candidacy?
We were a long way from here.
The President merely recalled that the 2008 constitutional revision limited the number of five-year terms to two.
He made a statement, not an announcement.
This is not the first time he has mentioned the presidential, in the tone of humor, at such meetings.
“At worst, or at best, you still have seven and a half years with me,” he told them in July 2009.
Rebel in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not thinking about the next step."
His words before yesterday don’t make him any more candidate than the day before; they don’t make him any less.
If they make comments, it's for a double reason.
The acceleration of the race for the PS candidacy, on the one hand.
But it is not the entry into competition of Ségol<0xC3><0xA8>ne Royal that pushes Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
On the contrary, because his candidacy in 2012 is clear that many in the PS are demanding an earlier order of battle than expected.
The bad polls, on the other hand.
For the first time, right-wing voters would prefer the candidacy of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% vs. 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion at the UMP about it," the Prime Minister's entourage reacted immediately and cautiously.
"If he believes defeat is possible, he will not be a candidate," said Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always think he can win," corrects Alain Juppé, resigned.
Euro: the ECB forced to maintain its purchases of government bonds
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) this year was to be an opportunity to clarify the procedures for exiting the crisis, or at least to announce the cessation of many of the non-conventional monetary policy operations to be completed at the end of the year.
The crisis of the European sovereign debt is imperative, and the Frankfurt Issuing Institute will probably not be able to afford to be so resilient as to aggravate a situation more than tense today in the European bond markets.
The political cost would be all the higher.
Yesterday, at a press conference, the French Minister of Finance, Christine Lagarde, thus welcomed the active role played by the ECB in resolving the state debt crisis in Europe.
She did not want to say whether she felt the central bank should do more, for example by increasing its sovereign bond purchase program.
"I reserve my reflection to my European partners (...)."
The day before, in Brussels, during his hearing by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not show any more discrepancies regarding his intentions, merely stating that the program of purchase of government securities "will be reunited as we see it "continue" in the secondary market.
The only certainty is that the ECB will keep its main policy rate unchanged at 1%, its lowest historical level since May 2009.
In fact, the ECB’s purchases of Treasury bonds doubled last week to nearly <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.35 billion.
And, according to the indiscretions of market operators, it would have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese securities yesterday.
In total, the central banks of the Eurosystem have purchased for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>67 billion since May 2010.
Among market operators, there is no doubt about the expectation of a continuation of purchases (see page 29).
Nor do economists expect a noticeable change of direction.
Although loans to more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB’s arsenal, the ECB still makes unlimited liquidity allocations on generous terms and for durations ranging from one week to three months.
Economists are now expecting this system to be extended by a few months.
"I can't imagine that she's significantly changing her program."
“Otherwise, it would be taking the risk of causing further tensions in the short term,” said Michael Schubert, an economist at Commerzbank.
“A progressive exit announced in the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely,” forecasts Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In terms of its interventions in the public debt market, "the ECB should maintain a purchase volume of these bonds to animate a smooth market," adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the importance of European banks' exposures to sovereign debt markets in the euro area, the issuing institution has no choice but to maintain its market presence.
“It has to replace itself at all costs with the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent a packing of returns paid by the most fragile states,” said a senior bond manager yesterday.
For if interest rates fly away, the States will be all the more embarrassed to reduce their debt, if not to stabilize it.
The protection of the euro is at this price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government is turning its back
After a worrying start to the week for Italy, the situation relaxed a bit yesterday, with the reflux of bond rates to 10 years.
A return to precarious calm.
After leaving a meeting with the Minister of Economy, the regional presidents said they had heard Giulio Tremonti call the situation "indecipherable" and expect an "unpredictable" weekend, which the interested party then denied.
On Tuesday, however, the gap with German long-term interest rates had reached a record 210 basis points and the price of hedge contracts against bankruptcy risk (CDS) had flown to 263 points, leading to some crowding in Rome.
At the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain, the gap with German rates was greater than 400 basis points.
But his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, said he was "strongly concerned" by "market turbulence" and possible contagion from Ireland.
“The good news is that Italy, the eurozone’s third-largest economy, is not like Greece or Ireland.”
“The bad news is that it’s like Portugal,” says Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly, its problem is the lack of growth and the atom of tax revenues that goes with, causing the state to run the risk of being no longer able to cover its financing needs.
The latest forecasts from Brussels were a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is now expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget under review in the Senate stands at 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, the European Commission estimates that the public deficit will still account for 4.3% of GDP next year (versus 3.9% projected by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumor of a new budget collective that could be set up after the holidays, for an amount of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, further austerity measures will have to be taken," said Commissioner for Economic Affairs Olli Rehn.
For the time being, Italy is receiving the support of international institutions.
"The fundamentals of its economy are in order and its accounts are good, we have been repeating it for a long time," said Arrigo Sadun, director of the Italian International Monetary Fund at the IMF.
"There is no problem in the immediate, short or long term, because despite its significant debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization efforts demanded in Italy are less than those demanded in other countries," notes Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist at OCDE.
The question of political instability remains.
On December 14, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censorship in the House of Representatives, following which early elections could be held at the end of March.
This would open up a period that would be unfavourable for decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans Reflect on Strengthening Anti-Crisis Devices
Christine Lagarde also hammered it yesterday at a press conference in Paris: "The Europeans, I believe that we have shown it again on Sunday in the day and in the night, are of course solidary, determined, committed to defending their currency and their monetary zone."
Although relative, yesterday's relaxation on the rates of European government bonds brought water to the mill of governments and the ECB.
But we cannot yet speak of a start of normalization.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's has announced that it could degrade Portugal's debt rating, the target most targeted today by speculation.
“As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, which weighs heavily on the banking systems,” say economists at Exane BNP Paribas.
“Political time is much slower than market time.”
Aware of this hiatus and the dangers it poses, European countries are intensifying discussions to strengthen existing anti-crisis arrangements.
Informal consultations between the finance ministers most directly concerned and, more broadly, with their G20 counterparts are going well.
This is also in view of the meetings of the Eurogroup and the Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the menu, the fate of the non-conventional support measures for euro area countries in the market collimator (see above).
As for the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, began a tour of Asia in Singapore on Tuesday to inform far-eastern investors about the developments of the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, it certainly prepares the ground.
The first ESF securities issuances are scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, an official U.S. representative told Reuters that the United States would support a possible increase in funds mobilized by an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
The leading countries, Portugal and Spain, are in the process of adopting structural reforms, particularly in terms of labour market organisation.
Reforms that are in addition to austerity measures with a closer effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to take a different path from those of Greece and Ireland.
They are both at all costs to avoid asking for international assistance before implementing their own budgetary corrections and deciding on the structural reforms necessary to restore trust in a sustainable way.
Finally, European donors are discussing the options available to speed up the process of standardisation of sovereign bond markets.
Moving to Paris on November 24, Axel Weber first advanced the idea that if the 750 billion euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to hand over the portfolio.
Economists at Barclays Capital, a leading player in the European sovereign debt market, say an extension of around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 billion would suffice, "preferably" in the form of a direct liquidity injection.
The vehicle exists: it is the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism, which has so far provided <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 billion.
A council that has every chance of being carefully examined in European capitals.
Especially if the market conditions get worse.
Snow and ice: 24 departments in orange vigilance
The snowy episodes still cause traffic difficulties, particularly on the secondary network in Brittany, and may disrupt some economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now on orange alert due to the risk of snow and frost.
L’Eure, L’Eure-et-Loir, Les Deux-S<0xC3><0xA8>vres and La Vienne have joined the 20 departments already in orange vigilance, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, later in the night.
According to Météo France, sustained snowfalls affect the north of the Gironde and Charentes and it snows weakly on the Ile-de-France.
Snow layers ranging from 2 to 5 cm, occasionally from 7 to 10 cm, are expected for the affected departments, and from 1 to 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm for the Paris region.
The departments concerned are those of the Charente, Charente-Maritime, C<0xC3><0xB4>tes d'Armor, Finist<0xC3><0xA8>re, Gironde, Dordogne, du Poitou and those of the regions of Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
The snowy episodes are noticeable enough to cause traffic difficulties and disrupt certain economic activities, warns Metéo France.
In the C<0xC3><0xB4>tes d'Armor, several departmentals were banned from carrying heavy weights of more than 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes.
Traffic on the secondary network in Brittany is very difficult according to the gendarmes who recommend to take his vehicle only in case of need and the traffic of some TER cars has been suspended for the day.
School transportation was banned for Thursday in Picardie.
No specific measures were envisaged on Wednesday night to restrict the movement of heavy weights.
The prefecture “invites all motorists to exercise the utmost caution on the roads and to adapt their driving accordingly.”
The General Directorate of Civil Aviation (DGAC) has asked airlines to cancel 25% of their flights at Paris Roissy airport and 10% at Orly on Thursday due to upcoming snowfalls.
The DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
In Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Métro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate over the modernization of transport in Ile-de-France is in full swing, billions have been raining.
In the discussion at least.
In particular, we are talking about $23 billion for the Grand Paris metro to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
To start this SGP, the State announced a capital endowment of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, it is this sum that will then allow the SGP to borrow on the markets a share of the financing of its double loop.
Today, we finally get to the first additions.
The 2010 Finance Corrigendum Act, considered by the Finance Committee of the National Assembly this morning, contains the arrangements for finding the beginning of this money.
There are two: the creation of a special equipment tax and an increase in the tax on offices in Ile-de-France.
The first, read in the text of the bill, article 15, is "for the benefit of the public establishment Société du Grand Paris".
It is encrypted: "The proceeds of this tax are 117 million euros per year".
The second is a redevelopment of a tax on offices that already exists "in order to modernize it, increase its product and assign this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that cost?
Mystery.
It is not encrypted in the text.
We're far from 4 billion.
"It is specified that these tax resources are in addition to the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4 billion of capital allocation that will be mobilized by the State and brought to the Société du Grand Paris as the project progresses," the statement reads.
At the SGP, we do not find this system shocking.
“From the moment we create revenues (both taxes, etc.), we can cover the studies over three years and then tap into the 4 billion after that,” it explains.
"This will be included in the budget and taken as time goes by."
The GSP estimates that the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4 billion will begin to be entered in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This arrangement, in which the 4 billion promised are still for the absent subscribers, is likely to provoke a somewhat agitated parliamentary discussion.
First public meeting on December 7.
Avengers Hackers and Spy in Diligence
The WikiLeaks case has a double value.
On the one hand, it reveals an apparent scandal, a scandal that appears as a scandal only in the face of the hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at the international level, and foreshadows a future dominated by regression.
But let's proceed by order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation that each file constituted by a secret service (of any nation) is composed exclusively of press cuts.
The “extraordinary” American revelations about Berlusconi’s sexual habits only report what could have been read in any newspaper for months (except those that Berlusconi owns), and Gaddafi’s sinisterly caricatured profile has long been for sketch cabaret artists.
The rule that secret files should only be composed of new ones already known is essential to the dynamics of the secret services, and not just in this century.
If you go to a library dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each work repeats (on the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Ch<0xC3><0xA2>teau, the Templars or the Rose-Croix) exactly what was already written in the previous works.
And this not only because the author of occult texts does not like to do unpublished research (nor know where to look for news about the non-existent), but because those who devote themselves to occultism believe only in what they already know, and who reconfirms what they had already learned.
This is Dan Brown’s success story.
I'll go for the secret files.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or of limited mind) the head of the secret services (otherwise he could be, as I know, a Liberation writer), who holds as true only what he acknowledges.
The top secret information about Berlusconi that the U.S. Embassy in Rome sent to the State Department was the same as that published by Newsweek the week before.
So why did the revelations on these files make so much noise?
On the one hand, they say what every cultivated person already knows, namely that embassies, at least since the end of World War II, and since heads of state can call or take a plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small transformational exercises in representation, have become
Any viewer of investigative films knows this very well, and it is only by hypocrisy that we pretend to ignore it.
However, repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy, and serves to place American diplomacy in a bad light.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can capture the most secret of the most powerful country in the world brings a noteworthy blow to the prestige of the State Department.
So the scandal does not put the victims as much into crisis as the "criminals".
But let’s get to the deep nature of what happened.
In Orwell's time, all power could be conceived as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
The Orwellian prophecy had proven itself completely since, being able to control every movement through the telephone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the highway borrowed and so on, the citizen became the total victim of the eye of power.
But when it is demonstrated, as it is now, that even the crypts of the secrets of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control report ceases to be unidirectional and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker – elected as the citizen’s avenger – can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that no longer has the ability to keep its own secrets hold?
It is true, Georg Simmel already said, that a true secret is an empty secret (and empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true, that all knowing about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is indeed an empty secret secret, because it belongs to the public domain; but it was all about power; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks did, the empty secrets of Clivery Hill.
WikiLeaks has done no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but has done too much to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this injury inflicted on a very powerful power?
It is clear that in the future, states will no longer be able to put online any reserved information - this would be to publish it on a poster glued to the corner of the street.
But it is just as obvious as with current technologies, it is in vain to hope to be able to maintain confidential reports over the phone.
Nothing is easier than finding out if and when a head of state moved on a plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How can private and reserved reports be maintained in the future?
I know that, for the moment, my prediction belongs to science fiction and is therefore romantic, but I am obliged to imagine government agents moving discreetly in diligences on uncontrollable itineraries, carrying only messages learned by heart or, at most, by heart.
The information will be kept as a single copy in key-closed drawers: at the bottom, the Watergate espionage attempt has been less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is now advancing in crabs, that is, backwards.
A century after wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet restored a wired telegraph (telephones).
Video cassettes (analogous) had allowed film researchers to explore a film step by step, going forward and backward and discovering all the secrets of editing, while now CDs (digital) only allow to jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. by macroports.
With high-speed trains, we go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while by plane, and the trips it includes, it takes three and a half hours.
Therefore, it is not surprising that the policy and communication techniques come back to the cars on horseback.
One last observation.
In the past, the press was trying to understand what was going on in the secret of the embassies.
Now, it is the embassies that ask for confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France delivers on its funding promises
One year after the Copenhagen Accord, it is time to examine whether the pledges of fast-start financing (so-called early-stage financing) made by developed countries are being met.
And the great French bidouillages are revealed.
In the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries pledged to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union pledged <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.2 billion over three years and France pledged <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.26 billion (or 420 million per year).
At the opening of COP16, the EU launched the big game to convince its partners of the reality of its commitment to fast-start funding: report detailing the action of its member states, press conference, large side event, distribution of brochures...
Transparency is appreciable and appreciated at its fair value: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same with the same level of precision.
The EU announced a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion commitment in 2010, putting it on track to meet its <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.2 billion commitment in 2012.
But when you look in detail, things are more complicated.
This money must be, according to the Copenhagen Agreement, "new and additional", in order to ensure that an additional effort is made without being at the expense of public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission had proposed harmonisation, some Member States whose France has blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that best suits them.
For example, the European Commission considered 2009 as a reference year: international funding is maintained, and it adds 150 million over three years under fast start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references in terms of year or level of public development assistance.
On the contrary, France believes that the funding of "all new projects" of the year 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to expenditure in previous years or to the overall level of public development assistance.
Concretely, the total amount of France’s support to developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease), it claims to respect its commitment to “new and additional” financing...
Another crucial element is the distribution between donations and loans.
Again, there is no rule and everyone chooses their own calculation method.
Some, like France, consider that 1<0xE2><0x82><0xAC> loan equals 1<0xE2><0x82><0xAC> given.
Obviously, this is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often projects related to the mitigation of emissions that are based on more efficient technologies), it is necessary to present a euro loan that will be borrowed as a loan equivalent to a euro that is given to you).
But France has only to make such a reasoning: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by making 91.5% of loans (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% of donations (36.1 million euros) - see the EU document to check for yourself.
It is the only EU country to use the loan so massively.
Germany requires 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (in others) respect their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union spends <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1 to meet its commitment, France only spends 10 cents and considers the effort comparable.
Nice pass-through tour!
In short, in its quick start financing, France operates a double scam: on the one hand on the evolution of the action over time and on the other hand on the reality of the financial effort.
Spending only <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>36.1 million, she manages to make it believe that she spends <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>420 million "new and additional" in line with her promises.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (for it seems that it was Bercy who carried out the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why would the other member states continue to give if it is enough to lend?) and in the negotiations since the developing countries are not complete...
The chapter on early funding is only a small, relatively short-term issue in relation to all the climate discussions.
But it could be one more grain of sand in the immense machine that is UNFCCC.
Let's hope that won't be the case.
In any case, it is essential to learn from this first year of early funding.
First, France could announce a change in its way of accounting for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and fairness with the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France could advance discussions on the issues of long-term financing (another crucial chapter currently discussed): the issue of "additionality" or the way of accounting for loans will not be avoided.
France could change its position to become as progressive on these issues as it is on others.
The hope therefore rests on the new Minister of the Environment, Ms Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement about France’s rapid start and its vision of “additionality” and the use of loans would be of a nature to increase the level of international confidence needed to move forward in the discussions.
Warning to pesticides ingested by children
A 10-year-old child ingests 81 different chemicals in a day, according to a study published Wednesday by the Future Generations Association (ex- Movement for the Rights and Respect of Future Generations).
The association, which warns that its results "do not have significant statistical value in relation to the low number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problem dealt with", bought between July and September the foods generally consumed in four meals and one snack in a day by a child of a dozen.
These types of meals, including official recommendations - five fresh fruits and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 liters of water per day - as well as treats, have been examined by laboratories looking for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The scale of the plate is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, of which 42 are classified as possible or probable carcinogens and five classified as certain carcinogens, as well as 37 substances that may act as endocrine disruptors (PE), according to studies from several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
“Although, in almost all cases, the legal limits for each chemical taken individually are not exceeded, our investigation clearly shows that the reality of consumer exposure to potentially carcinogenic and/or PE contaminants is of concern,” the association notes.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogen residues and three proven as certain carcinogens as well as nearly twenty residues that may disrupt the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, planned as a snack by the study, has traces of six chemical substances, but a fungicide is banned in France.
The same goes for the green beans of Kenya, included in the lunch, on which the study detected traces of a powerful insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, chopped steak, boxed tuna, and even breadstick and chewing gum were stuffed with pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water, analyses revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
For dinner, salmon steak was the most "rich" with 34 chemical residues detected and even examining the plastic plate used to heat the meal in the microwave was not exempt.
The final risk for the consumer of these "contaminant cocktails" is probably underestimated, according to the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecologie-Les Verts (EE-LV), for its part, proposed "in the face of the urgency of the situation" to establish a moratorium on the use of pesticides, in order to stop "the increase of civilisation diseases".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) reported the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruits and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
