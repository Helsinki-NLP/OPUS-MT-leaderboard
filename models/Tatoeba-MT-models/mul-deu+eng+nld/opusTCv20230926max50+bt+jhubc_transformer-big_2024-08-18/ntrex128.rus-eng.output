Members of the Welsh Assembly do not want to “come on mappets”
Some members of the National Assembly are dissatisfied with the proposal to adopt the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament) for their appointment.
The problematic decision relates to plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Assembly from different political parties are concerned about possible jokes with this abbreviation.
One of the laborers, expressing the opinion of his party, expressed concern that the new abbreviation “rhymed Twp and Pwp.”
For our readers not from Wales: in Welsh twp means "tupice", and pwp means "cacasca".
According to an Assembly member of the Welsh Party, his organization as a whole “has remained dissatisfied” and has proposed other options.
Conservative party representatives “do not object” to the new abbreviation, but note that the MWP is close to the word Muppet.
In this context, the letter w in Welsh is pronounced roughly like the letter u in the Yorkshire dialect of English.
The Committee of the Assembly, currently working on a draft law on renaming, made the following statement: “The final decision on how the Members of the Assembly will be named, of course, will remain behind them.”
The Welsh Governance Act, 2017, authorizes the National Assembly of Wales to change its name.
In June, the Committee published the results of a public opinion poll on the proposed options, according to which the “Parliament of Wales” option found broad support among the local population instead of the “Assembly”.
With regard to the appointment of members of the Assembly, the Committee expressed its preference for the Welsh Parliament Members (WMP) option, while the MWP option received the most public support.
It appears that the members of the Assembly are proposing other options, but it would be difficult for the Chairperson, Elin Jones, to find a solution that would suit everyone. Recall that the draft law on amendments should be submitted in a few weeks' time.
The Reform Acts will include other amendments to the Assembly ' s working process, including new rules on disqualification of Assembly members and the arrangement of the Committee ' s system.
Members of the Assembly shall vote in favour of the final version of their appointment in the course of the debate on the draft law.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on changing the name of their country
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia will vote on the renaming of the country to the “Republic of North Macedonia”.
The referendum is aimed at resolving a long-standing dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province of Macedonia.
The Greek government has long insisted that the name “Republic of Macedonia” implies territorial claims to the Greek province, and has repeatedly voiced opposition to its northern neighbor’s accession to the European Union and NATO.
Macedonian President George Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the change of name, said he was not going to admit his results.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, note that changing the name of the country is just the price of joining the EU and NATO.
Crisis in Harlem arrivals: St. Martin’s bells are forever silenced
“The elders of the area with which I spoke said that there had been a bar and a church on every corner before,” says Adams.
“Now there is nothing else left.”
The disappearance of the bars can still be understood:
“The format of communication has changed.”
“The bar has ceased to be a kind of living room in the whole area where they came regularly.”
But as far as churches are concerned, it is worrying that the funds received from the sale of assets are short-lived, no matter what their leaders have hoped for.
On the site of the church, he added, a multi-apartment house will appear, whose residents are unlikely to support the remaining incomes in the area.
“Most buyers of these apartments will be white,” Adams says, “and that’s about the day when such churches will finally close, because new neighbors will never become their parishioners.”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black area: the Metropolitan Communion in 1870, and St. Martin's Church 10 years later.
The first parishioners of the Methodist church left the parish in the 30s of the last century.
Their building was purchased by a black mansion located in the neighborhood.
When St. Martin's church passed into the hands of the black community, it was headed by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who organized a shop boycott on 125th Street, the main commercial artery of Harlem, where they refused to take up work or raise it for the black service.
In 1939, as a result of the fire, the building received significant damage, and during the restoration work, Johnson's father ordered the installation of the carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson, who replaced him at the head of St. Martin's Church, proudly called the carillon "bells for the poor".
But the expert, who tried the carillon in July, called it a “cultural heritage” and a “unique historical tool”.
An expert from the University of Michigan Tiffany Ng also noted that it was the carillon from St. Martin's Church that was the first instrument of its kind in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind. 18 years ago it was invited to play a larger carillon in the Röntgen.
According to Merriuezer, St. Martin's church has not yet found a replacement for him.
The last few months around St. Martin’s Church have been a difficult situation with architects and contractors, some of whom were invited by secular church leaders, others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The congregation of parishioners, the governing body of the parish, which includes secular leaders, turned to the diocese in July, expressing concern that the diocese “will try to transfer the cost of the works” to the congregation of parishioners, although the latter had nothing to do with the choice of sub-architect.
Some parishioners expressed dissatisfaction with the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
In California, a shark injured a 13-year-old diver who industrialized lobsters.
According to official sources, on Saturday, the first day of the lobster hunting season, a 13-year-old divers in California was attacked by a shark and suffered bodily harm.
The attack occurred around 7 a.m. near Bicon Beach Beach in Encinitas.
As Chad Hammel told in an interview with KSWB-TV (San Diego), on Saturday morning he dived with friends and about half an hour later heard the boy screams for help. Together with friends they sailed on the boat to the site of the attack and takeoff.
According to Hammel, at first he decided that the boy was very happy to catch the lobster, but quickly “he realized that he was screaming ‘I was bitten!
“I was bitten!”
As he approached the diver, Hammel noticed that “he had completely torn skin around the keychain.”
“I yelled for everyone to come out of the water, ‘Here’s the shark!’” Hammel said.
The boy was transported by helicopter to Radi Children's Hospital (San Diego); his condition is assessed as critical.
The type of shark that attacked a teenager is unknown.
Captain Larry Giles' rescuer told a news briefing that a shark was spotted at the site a few weeks ago, but it was not considered a dangerous species.
Giles also added that the victim of the attack was injured in the upper part of the body.
Authorities blocked the area from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami Beach in Encinitas for 48 hours to conduct an investigation and ensure the safety of the population.
Giles noted that there are 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sinesbury Plans to Conquer the Perfume and Cosmetics Market in the UK
Sinesbury is going to set up cosmetics and perfumery departments in the stores of Boots, Superdrag and Debenhams with consultants-cosmetologists, on the model of luxury department stores.
The parfum and cosmetics market of the United Kingdom is estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion and continues to expand, while in the sphere of fashion and home goods sales are falling. To capture their share in the year and in the future will be a significant share of the desired market.
Supermarket owners are looking more than to fill the shelves that have previously been placed under TVs, microwaves, household goods, and investments in the perfume and cosmetics market are a good solution.
According to the representatives of Sinesbury, it is planned to double the range of cosmetic products to 3,000 names; including for the first time such brands as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw will be offered.
The existing assortment from L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will be presented on a larger scale, in specially designated locations, by the type of organization of goods in Boots stores.
In addition, the company will reorganize the line of products “Boutique-cosmetic” with the transition to products for vegans to meet the requests of young buyers.
The two Sinesbury stores will feature fragrance maker Fragrance Shop kiosks: the first one was opened in Craydon in southern London last week, and the second one is expected to open in Sally Oak, Birmingham, this year.
Internet shopping and the tendency to buy a small volume of products for every day in small shops near home have led to the fact that supermarkets are forced to attract buyers in other ways.
Mike Coop, President of Sinesbury, says outlets will gradually turn into department stores, and his chain of supermarkets is fighting for buyers in a competitive fight with cheap stores like Aldi and Liddle, offering more services and non-food goods.
In hundreds of Sinesbury supermarkets, Argos outlets are housed, and in some of them you can now find Habitats stores since the network acquired both brands two years ago. This led to an increase in food sales and revenues due to these acquisitions.
Previous attempts by the supermarket to give a new life to its cosmetic and pharmacy departments have not been successful.
In the early 2000s, the Sinesbury and Boots Joint Venture was organized, but later there were disagreements between the participants on the division of income from the sale of pharmacy goods in supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed after Selesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmaceuticals network, sold the Sinesbury Pharmaceuticals business (a total of 281 stores), for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years earlier.
Lloyds is expected to support the implementation of the plan by adding a wide range of luxury skincare products La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sinesbury, said: “We have completely transformed the look and feel of our perfume and cosmetics departments to create a more favorable environment for our customers.
We have also invited specially trained consultants who will always be ready to help with the advice.
Our range of brands for any taste, pleasant design and convenient location of shops will attract many visitors in search of cosmetics and perfumery. This will be a completely new concept of shopping.”
Peter Jones “angryly” reacted to Holly Willowby’s exit from a <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
The star of the show "The Dragon's Logo" Peter Jones is "angry" about the release of television presenter Holly Willowby from the deal for <0xC2><0xA3>11 million, which she intended to make with the lifestyle TV brand Peter, but instead preferred the new "I and M contracts"
Willowby doesn’t have time for their shared brand of truly homewear and accessories.
The couple’s business was compared to Goop by actress Guinette Paltrow.
The 37-year-old star of “This Morning” announced her decision on Instagram.
Holly Willowby’s decision to leave their lucrative lifestyle brand to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV has angered Peter Jones, the Dragon Logo star.
According to our sources, Jones was “angry” when a TV viewer’s favorite during a tense meeting held on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted that after the signing of new contracts worth up to 1.5 million dollars, the company’s business empire in Trudeau, Buckinghamshire, had been left behind by the time.
Their brand was compared to the child of actress Guinette Paltrow by the brand Goop, and its sales were expected to double Willowby's worth of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
The 37-year-old leader announced her departure from Instagram, and Jones himself left the UK on a private jet in the direction of one of her villas.
According to one source, “The truly brand was Holly’s top priority.
It was a long-term investment that would ensure her carefree existence for the next couple of decades.
Its decision led to the downfall of all the participants in the transaction.
Everyone was stunned by what happened on Tuesday, because there were only a few weeks left before the launch of the brand.
At the headquarters in Marlow, there was a whole warehouse filled with ready-to-sell goods.
Experts believe that leaving the leading "This Morning", one of the UK's most popular stars, could cost the firm millions of pounds due to significant investments in goods: from pillows and candles to clothing, as well as potential delays.
In addition, we are talking about the breakup of long-standing friendships.
Raising three children, Willowby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Willowby created the truly brand together with Tara Cape in 2016, and Tara’s husband, 52-year-old Peter Jones, headed the company’s board in March.
Both couples often spend vacations together, and in addition, Jones owns 40% of the shares of the television production company Dan Baldwin.
Willowby will become M&S brand ambassador and replace Anthony McPartlin in the lead role of ITV’s “I’m a Celebrity.”
A source from nearby Jones said last night: “We can’t comment on his commercial affairs.”
It was a difficult conversation, and then we loved each other.
He joked about the criticism that the media would have against him because of the “unworthy president” commentary and the positive assessment of the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give up so many of his claims?
Trump said, imitating the voice of the news leader.
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He noted that Kim Jong-un was interested in a reunion after Trump called their first summit, held in Singapore in June, a significant step on the way to reducing nuclear weapons stockpiles in North Korea.
But the denuclearization negotiations have come to a standstill.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, the high-ranking North Korean diplomat, Li Yong Ho, spoke to world leaders at a meeting of the UN General Assembly on Saturday with a statement to the United Nations that the United States is still awaiting a “reply” to the United Nations.
Instead, the U.S., the diplomat noted, continues to use sanctions as a lever of pressure.
During the meeting of his supporters, President Trump expressed a much more optimistic assessment.
“With North Korea things are going well,” he said.
“We were on the brink of war with North Korea.
Millions of people could have died.
And now we have a good relationship.”
According to Trump, his efforts to establish relations with Kim Jong-un have been fruitful: missile tests have been put to an end, hostages have been released, and the remaining U.S. military personnel have also returned home.
Speaking about his relationship with Kim Jong-un, Trump stressed that there is nothing strange about his unusual approach to diplomacy.
“Behaving like the president is so easy, but then instead of the 10,000 people on the street who break into this completely sealed room, there would be only 200 people here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd gathered in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: catastrophic devastation recorded, victims counted by hundreds
In the first days after the earthquake that hit Lombok, foreign NGOs said they did not need help.
Despite the loss of more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok, the Government did not consider it necessary to declare a national natural disaster, which was a obligatory condition for international assistance.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they made it clear that they don’t need international support, so it was not easy,” says Selina Sambung.
The organization “Save the Children” prepares the team to send to Pal, but we do not yet know if the foreign group will be able to work on the spot.
According to Mr. Sutopo, the official representative of the National Office for Disaster Relief, the Indonesian leadership is conducting an assessment of the situation in Palu in order to determine the appropriateness of the involvement of international organizations.
Given the constant seismic instability in Indonesia, the country is still terribly ill-prepared for natural disasters.
Although shelters were built in Aceh from the tsunami, they can rarely be found on other coastlines.
Despite the warning of the tsunami threat, no siren was included in Palu to alert the population, which most likely led to so many casualties.
The transport between the numerous Indonesian islands is quite problematic, even in good weather.
Natural disasters make it even more difficult for logistics.
The floating hospital, which was previously besieged in Lombok to assist the victims of the earthquake, is headed to Palo, but the road to the site of the new disaster will take at least three days.
President Joko Vidodo has made the strengthening of Indonesia’s old infrastructure the main point of his election campaign and has spent considerable money on improving roads and railways.
However, the administration of President Joko, who is running for a new term next year, has been plagued by funding problems.
The president is also criticised for exacerbating interfaith hostility between the conservative Muslim majority in Indonesia and the rest of the population.
More than a thousand people have been killed, and tens of thousands more have lost blood as a result of clashes between Christians and Muslims, armed with machetes, bows with arrows and other self-propelled shots.

Police Arrest 32-Year-Old Man Suspected of Deadly Knife Injuries to Woman
A woman's body was found this morning in the town of Birkenhead, Merciaside County, and a murder investigation is underway.
The body of a 44-year-old woman with a stab wound was found at 7:55 a.m. at the Grayson Museum on John Street. A 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are looking for possible witnesses to the murder among locals.
O’Haygen, the police inspector, said: “The investigation is in its early stages, but I strongly ask anyone who was in the John Street area of Birkenhead and could have observed or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I am also addressing everyone, especially taxi drivers, who could capture something on the video recorder. Please contact us with any information that may help the investigation.”
A police official confirmed that the victim was living in Birkenhead and her body was found on the grounds of the complex.
Today, supposedly familiar victims arrived at the scene of the incident to ask their questions about where she was discovered this morning.
An investigation is underway and police are preparing to report the tragedy of the victim’s closest relatives.
The taxi driver, who lives in the Grayson Muse complex, tried to walk into his apartment, but the police told him that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
Upon learning of what had happened, he lost the gift of speech.
The residents of the house were told that they would not be able to get home for at least a few hours.
One of the police officers told the tenant that the entire adjacent territory was considered the scene of the crime.
One woman was crying.
“What a horror!” she repeated.
Two police buses arrived at the scene at 2 a.m. and another one was left outside the fenced area.
Several police officers were placed inside the fence to monitor the apartment complex.
Anyone who has any information is asked to send a personal message to the <0x40>MerPolCC subscriber on Twitter, call 101, or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 (case 247 of September 30).
Kromvel monument in front of the parliament building sparked a fierce discussion about the “overwrite of history”
Cromwell's expulsion would be a worthy retaliation for the barbaric destruction of England's numerous cultural and religious artifacts by his followers, puritanical fanatics.
However, the Cromwell Memory Society called Mr. Crick’s proposal “a madness” and “an attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Memorial Society, said: “As part of the ongoing debate on the demolition of historic monuments, the question of the statue of Oliver Cromwell in front of Westminster Palace inevitably arose.
Cromwell has nothing to do with the iconoclast movement during the English Civil Wars.
It is likely that Oliver Cromwell is suffering for the sins of his ancestor, Thomas, who lived a century earlier.
The magnificent statue of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Tornikroft reflects the opinion of his contemporaries in the 19th century and the historical achievements of a man whom many still consider worthy of respect.
In an interview with The Sunday Telegraph, John Goldsmith said: “Many people, especially in the late 19th century, considered Cromwell a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case, the monarchy.
Whether such an opinion can be considered historically accurate remains the subject of debate by experts.
But it is safe to say that the conflict that arose in the mid-17th century affected the further development of our country, and Cromwell was a significant historical figure who represented one side of this section.
His achievements as a Lord Protector also deserve high esteem and respect.”
Chinese farmer stabbed to death by a pig-killer
In one of the markets of southwestern China, the farmer has become a victim of pigs, local media reports.
The bloody body of the victim (in the media only his surname, "Yuan") with a broken artery was found near a market in Lupanshui province of Guijou in southern China. This was reported by the Morning Post on Sunday.
The pig farm is preparing to introduce vaccinations to pigs on the pig farm, May 30, 2005, in Xinin District of the Chinese province of Qinhai.
Yuan and his cousin came from neighbouring Yunnan province on Wednesday and brought 15 pigs for sale.
The next morning, the cousin discovered Yuan's breathless body, and the door to the neighboring pigstore was opened.
There was a huge snail with blood on its wing.
In the course of a forensic medical examination, it was found that a pig weighing 250 kilograms had stabbed the farmer to death.
“My brother’s legs were bleeded and bruised,” Wu, a relative of the deceased, told Guiyang Evening News.
A video from the surveillance cameras showed that Yuan came to the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his animals.
The body was found about an hour later.
The pig-killer did not belong to the brothers.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig was isolated in a separate unit during the investigation, in order to avoid repeated attacks.
It is reported that the Yuan family is negotiating with the market administration on compensation for the death of the farmer.
Incidents of swine attacks on humans occur rarely.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in the U.S. state of Massachusetts, severely injuring a man.
Ten years ago, a 300-kilogram animal nailed a Welsh peasant to a tractor and let go, only in fear of his accomplice wife.
In 2012, there was a case where a farmer from Oregon in the United States was eaten by his own pigs. As one Canadian farmer told CBC News, pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act on their hidden aggression as a "release mechanism".
Pigs are playful,
They are biting and very curious, but they have no intention of offending you.
You just have to bring a sense of measure and respect to your animals,” he explained.
Hurricane Rosa will bring rains to a significant part of the southwest of the United States
According to the forecast, Hurricane Rosa is losing power as it moves through a cooler-water zone to Mexico’s northern coast.
However, in the next few days it will bring rains and floods to the territory of northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
As of Saturday, 5 a.m. on New York City, the cyclone reached Category 1 with winds of up to 135 km/h, 360 km southwest of the city of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The storm is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a low-pressure zone begins to form over the Pacific Ocean, which will move east to the west coast of the United States. As it approaches the coast of the State of Lower California, the storm will bring tropical humidity north of Mexico, to the territory of the United States.
More than 25 cm of rainfall is expected in Mexico on Monday.
Under the influence of tropical humidity that has entered the forming low-pressure zone, heavy rainfall is expected in the South-West in the coming days.
Rainfall of 2.5 to 10 cm will cause dangerous flooding, mudslides, and possible landslides in the desert.
In some areas, especially in the southern states of Nevada and Arizona, due to the high tropical humidity of the air, the rate of precipitation can reach 5 to 8 cm per hour.
In some areas of the southwestern United States, mostly in most of Arizona, precipitation is expected to reach 5–10 cm.
The risk of sudden rapid flooding due to the uneven distribution of tropical rains is not excluded.
With the existing risk of tropical showers, walking in the desert is fraught with serious consequences.
Swallows can turn canyons into stormy rivers, and thunder can cause gusts of winds and lift clouds of dust.
With the emergence of a low-pressure zone, places on the coast of southern California will collapse.
It is possible to fall up to 1.5 cm of rainfall, which can cause small muddy streams and create slippery surfaces on roads.
This is the first rainfall since the beginning of the rainy season in the region.
On Sunday evenings and Monday mornings in Arizona places will be tropical rains, which will spread to other territories by the evening of Monday and the morning of Tuesday.
On Tuesday, the rains will take place in the area of Four Corners and will last until Wednesday evening.
In October, there will be sharp temperature fluctuations throughout the United States, due to the low air temperature in the Arctic at sufficiently high temperatures in the tropics.
Sometimes such a combination leads to strong temperature fluctuations in a small area.
Such sharp temperature fluctuations will be especially noticeable in the central U.S. on Sunday.
Between temperatures in Kansas City (Missouri) and Omaha (Nebraska), as well as between St. Louis and De Moines (Iowa) there is a difference of almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the summer heat will accumulate and spread to other territories.
In most of the central and eastern territories of the United States in early October warm weather is expected, the temperature will reach 27 degrees in the space from the South Plains to the North-East of the country.
In New York City on Tuesday, the air temperature can rise to 27 degrees, which is 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term weather forecast promises with great probability an unusually high temperature on the east coast of the United States by mid-October.
Senate hearings in the case of Judge Brett Kavanaugh watched more than 20 million spectators
The testimony of Brett Kavanaugh and Christina Blazy Ford, who accuses Kavanaugh of attempted rape in the 1980s, on Thursday attracted the attention of more than 20 million viewers of six TV channels.
The political confrontation surrounding Cavano’s candidacy received an unexpected continuation. On Friday, an urgent message was sent to the media: Republican Jeff Flake put forward a condition that the charges against the lawyer within one week of the investigation.
According to Ford at a hearing before the Senate Legal Committee, she was “100 percent confident” that Cavano had attacked her in a drunken state and tried to break her up at a school party.
Kavanaugh gave emotional testimony, stating that he was 100 percent sure it wasn’t there.
According to research agency Nielsen, the Friday debate was watched by more than 20.4 million viewers.
The agency took into account average data from CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Audience data from other channels, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, are not yet available.
In addition, the Nielsen rating does not always take into account viewers watching TV at work.
For comparison: this is the average audience watching an American football match in the playoffs or the Oscars award ceremony.
The largest audience was the Fox News Channel, whose leaders warmly supported the appointment of Kavanaugh: Senate hearings, which lasted all day, watched an average of 5.69 million viewers, Nielsen reported.
In second place is ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
The CBS audience was 3.1 million, NBC — 2.94 million, MSNBC watched 2.89 million, while CNN had 2.52 million views, reports Nielsen.
After the hearing, the interest in the case has not diminished.
On Friday, a real drama was played with the participation of Jeff Flake.
After the Arizona senator, who is considered a moderate Republican, announced his intention to support Cavano's candidacy, CNN and CBS TV channels managed to capture a cameraman, as an active member of the group was on Friday morning on the way to a meeting of the Legal Committee, Flake Table.
The whole world has seen him dropping his eyes and getting a sneeze from angry women live on CNN.
“I’m standing in front of you,” said one of them.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?”
“Behind you, while so many women are powerless,” the women tried to explain their position.
Flake replied to the activists that his office had already prepared a statement and he will address the issue at the committee meeting. The elevator doors were closed, hiding the senator from the ubiquitous chambers.
When, a few hours later, the Legal Committee was preparing to approve Cavano's candidacy as a judge and send her to the Senate for a general vote, all the channels broadcast the meeting live.
However, Flake set one condition — to conduct an FBI investigation into the allegations against the candidate by next week, as was achieved by a democratic minority.
Flake claims he changed his mind thanks to the intervention of a friend, Democrat Senator Chris Kuns.
He made the final decision, speaking with Kuns and several other senators.
Flick's decision took effect, as it was obvious that Republicans lacked the votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
By order of President Trump, the FBI opened an investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May Accuses Her Critics of “Political Games” Around Brexit Situation
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused politicians criticizing her plan to leave the European Union of putting narrow-party interests above societal interests.
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom attends a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In another interview published on the same band with May’s interview, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson criticized her so-called “Shashki” plan within Brexit, saying she believes the introduction of tariffs between the UK and the EU is “absolutely not.”
Wade Sims' Death in Shooting: Police Arrested Daityon Simpson on Suspected Assassination of University of Louisiana Forward
Police have arrested a man suspected of murder as a result of the shooting of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player who played for the University of Louisiana.
According to the Baton Rouge police, 20-year-old Daityon Simpson was arrested and placed under arrest on second-degree murder charges.
Police released a video of a fight involving Sims and Simpson, in which Sims lost his points.
According to WAFB, the CBS regional channel, police found Simpson's DNA on the glasses found at the crime scene.
During the interrogation, Simpson admitted to having fatally injured Wade.
According to Advocate, a $350,000 security deposit has been set for Simpson.
The coroner of the eastern district of Baton Rouge on Friday published a preliminary conclusion: the death was caused by a combined gunshot wound to the neck and head.
The Department is grateful to the Louisiana State Police Criminal Investigation Department, the State Police forensic Laboratory, the Southern University Police and the local residents who assisted in carrying out the search and investigation activities that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, director of sports at the University of Louisiana, thanked the law enforcement for their “good faith work in capturing a criminal.”
Sims was only 20 years old.
The two-metre Forward was a native of Baton Rouge; his father Wayne also played in the University of Louisiana team.
Sims scored 5.6 points last season and made an average of 2.6 rebounds per game.
Team coach Will Wade made a statement Friday morning, saying the tragic death of Wade Sims caused a “shock” and “true grief” to all players.
“That’s what I’ve always been afraid of,” the coach added.
Volcano covered with ash Mexico
Volcano Popocatepetl has slumbered the southern surroundings of the Mexican capital.
On Saturday, Mexico’s National Center for Natural Disaster Prevention recommended that the population do not approach the volcano: its crater recorded activity and produced 183 gas emissions per day.
According to the Center's observations, near the volcano, thunder was often distributed and a tremor was felt.
In some areas of Mexico, such as Sochimilko, social media users have posted photos of the windshields of cars covered in a thin layer of ash.
After the 7.1 Mw earthquake, which struck central Mexico in September 2017, geophysicists recorded participating volcanic activity at 72 km southeast of the capital.
The Popocatepetl volcano (or, for its part, "Don Goyo") has been an active volcano since 1994.
Police clashes with Catalan separatists on the eve of the first anniversary of the independence referendum
On Saturday in Barcelona held a multi-thousands rally dedicated to the first anniversary of the referendum on the withdrawal of Catalonia from Spain, which divided the country into two camps. It did not go without clashes between supporters of independence of the autonomy and the police.
Police officers repressed the protesters, while the latter, dressed in black masks, threw the guards with eggs and powder paint, raising a cloud of dark dust in the very center of Barcelona.
After the police launched the dungeon to deter the crowd, the riots resumed with new force.
For several hours, the supporters of independence chanted: “We will not forget, we will not forgive!” and their opponents replied with the slogan: “Goodbye Spain!”
According to local press reports, fourteen participants of the action were hospitalized with lung injuries.
On 1 October last year, a referendum was held on Catalonia's withdrawal from Spain. It was recognized as illegal by the Spanish government, but became an important milestone for the separatists. A year later, tensions persisted in the region seeking sovereignty.
Catalonia voted overwhelmingly in favour of leaving Spain, but the turnout was low because opponents of the exit were mostly boycotting the referendum.
According to Catalan official sources, in an attempt by the police to block the holding of a referendum in the constituencies of the country last year, almost 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes.
On Friday, the separatists spent the night on the declared path of following a demonstration in support of the Spanish police to prevent its conduct.
The demonstration still took place, but went on a different route.
The 68-year-old electrician, Narcissus Termes, who attended a separatist rally in the company of his wife, hints that the hope of acquiring sovereignty by Catalonia is becoming increasingly blurry.
“Last year was one of the most important events in our lives.
“My parents were crying out of happiness, given the opportunity to vote in the referendum, and today we are in a suspended state,” he said.
In the recent December elections to the local governing bodies, the Catalan parties, who are in favour of separating from Spain, won an important victory, albeit with a small gap. However, this year, their movement is not losing its supporters, as many of the well-known leaders of the movement are gaining momentum.
Hoan Puch, a 42-year-old mechanic recording a police-supported telephone rally, said the conflict was being heated by both sides of the political spectrum.
“There’s growing tension,” he added.
On Saturday, Oriol Junkeras, one of nine leaders of Catalan separatists, since the end of last year in the preliminary detention chamber, announced his intention to vote in the European Parliament next year.
“Participating in the next elections to the European Parliament as a candidate is the best way to condemn the loss of democratic values and repression by the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: A car crashed into the house, all three partners arrested
One of the houses in Londonbury was hit by a car several times; men aged 33, 34 and 39 years old were arrested.
The ride was made on Thursday around 7:30 p.m. local time in the area of Ballinagard Kresent.
As a result of the crash, the gate and the building itself were damaged, police inspector Bob Blemmings said.
There are reports that the car may have been fired from the bow.
Livingstone wins over Rangers thanks to Menghi's goal
Dolly Menge's First Goal Brings a Guaranteed Victory to Livingstone
With the ball scored, Livingstone won an unexpected victory over the Rangers. For the head coach of the Scottish club, Steven Gerrard, this is only the second defeat in 18 games.
Dolly Menge's exact shot equalized Gary Holt's team with the Hibernian in the scoreboard, where they shared second place.
Gerrard's club has been left without a win in the Premier League exit this season. On Sunday they will have a meeting with the leaders of the group, the Harts, from which the Rangers are behind by eight points.
On Thursday, the Rangers will play a Europa League match with Austrian club Rapid (Vienna) on their field.
Livingstone continues its winless series in the division, having already played six games and not suffered a single defeat since Holt replaced Kenny Miller as the team's head coach.
Missing moments for Livingston in a fight with intimidated guests
Holt's assistant coaches had to keep an eye on him from the start - the Rangers clearly did not cope with their effort.
Scott Robinson managed to break through the line of defense, but the goal did not come out of his weak attempt. Then the defender Alan Litgow, turning too wide, could not prevent the ball from falling into the net.
The receiving side allowed the Rangers to play in front of their line of defense, relying on dangerous moments when resuming the game.
That’s how they missed this important goal.
The Rangers gave up the free kick, and Livingstone took advantage of the opportunity: Declan Gallagher and Robinson made the transfer to Menge, who scored from the central position.
At the time, the Rangers had the upper hand in possession of the ball, but the defense of the receiving team was undefeated, so goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not worried.
The second time continued on the same schedule, although Kelly still had to beat Alfredo Morelos.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor kicked the ball off Scott Pittman's leg, and Litgow made a wide pass from the standard position.
The balls constantly fell into the penalty box of Livingston, but all the attacks were reflected, and the two demands of the penalty — one for provoking backup player Glenn Middleton Halkett and the second for the game by hand — were not satisfied.
"Phenomenal" game "Livingstone" - analysis
From BBC Scotland — Alasder Lamont, reporting from Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal game and a great result for the Livingston team.
“Absolutely all the players were great and once again exceeded all expectations, continuing their ascent to the football Olympics.
Their playing style and composition have barely changed since their rise to the top of the rankings, and Holt's great credit is that he has mobilized this team from the start.
There were a lot of real heroes in his team.
Captain Halkett led a magnificently organized defense, and Menga did not let Connor Goldson and Joe Warall relax.
The Rangers couldn’t get into the rhythm.
“Although they had good moments with coach Gerrard, this time they didn’t meet our expectations.
In the last minutes of the match they did not have enough possession of the ball, but they managed to pass the defense of the receiving team only once. "Rangers", dropped to the middle of the table, there is something to think about.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an's cold reception during his visit to Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast, the weather was fine, and the two superiors were in a great mood.
This was the last day of President Erdogan’s visit to Germany in order to establish relations between the two NATO-participating countries – a visit, already associated with some conflicts.
The heads of state have failed to find an understanding on such issues as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
After that, Erdogan went to Cologne to take part in the ceremony of opening a huge new mosque.
Cologne is home to the largest Turkish diaspora outside of Turkey.
For security reasons, the police did not allow the 25,000 crowd to enter the mosque, but many supporters of Erdogan were located nearby to see their president.
In the same place, opponents of Erdogan’s regime, including Kurds, gathered to condemn both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to invite him to visit Germany.
The presence of radically opposite views at the meeting reflects the ambiguous nature of this figure: many Germans with Turkish roots outnumber Erdogan, while others consider him a tyrant.
Deptford Road Accident: Car Crash Leads to Bicyclist Death
In London, the car collided with a cyclist who died at the scene of the accident.
The accident occurred near Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a bustling intersection in the southeastern part of Deffort, at about 10:15 local time.
The driver of the car and the on-site sanitizers tried to help the cyclist, but the man died without coming to his senses.
This is not the only fatal accident in the area: just one and a half miles from the scene, on Childers Street, another cyclist was hit by a car whose driver was hiding.
According to the London police, work is currently underway to identify the deceased and to inform his closest relatives.
Meanwhile, roads have been blocked at the scene and the bus route has been changed: motorists are asked not to enter the area.
Long-Lartin prison riots: six policemen injured
According to reports by the Long-Lartin administration, six police officers were injured in the riots committed in a male prison of strict regime.
The men's Long-Lartin prison in Worcestershire has been in a state of turmoil since Sunday, which started at around 9:30 a.m. local time.
To suppress the riots involving eight prisoners from one wing, the Tornado opera group was called.
The police suffered minor damage to the soft tissues of the face; they were provided with medical care on the spot.
According to a prison official, “specially trained staff were involved in the Long-Lartin Correctional Facility to resolve the incident.
Six of them were injured.
We categorically deny the use of physical force in our institution, and it is obvious that the perpetrators will be handed over to the police and their restraint may be altered for a longer period of time.”
There are currently more than 500 inmates in Long Lartine, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the media reported that the prison manager had been hospitalized after being attacked by one of the prisoners.
And in October last year, the prison’s leadership was forced to recruit special-purpose units to reassure the inmates who threw billiard balls at the guards.
Hurricane Rose could flood Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City (which will benefit dry areas)
Arizona rarely gets into the zone of passing an intense tropical cyclone, but this time it is “lucky”: at the beginning of next week, Hurricane Rosa, making the last rush, must pass over the desert part of the Southwest and bring with it the risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already warned of the threat of flooding on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and the southern and eastern part of Nevada, in southeastern California and Utah, including in cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff and Flagstaff.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to cross a straight line over the Phoenix on Tuesday and rain on Monday evening.
The National Meteorological Service’s office in Phoenix said on Twitter that “only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of a tropical storm or depression, located within a radius of 320 km from Phoenix, since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (in 1967) passed 65 km from the Arizona border.
According to the latest forecasts of the National Meteorological Service, it will fall from 5 to 10 cm of precipitation, with places reaching 15 cm on the plateau of the Mugello-Rome region.
In other desert regions of the South-West, such as the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, precipitation is possible up to 2.5–5 cm, with rainfall sites up to 10 cm.
For zones that will be flooded by the side, the rain brought by Hurricane Rosa can be a real blessing, as the region has long been suffering from drought.
While rainfall may pose a danger, heavy rains can ease the dry season that does not occur in the Southwestern United States.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor maps, more than 40 percent of Arizona’s territory is experiencing at least severe drought (the second most severe category).”
Hurricane Rosa will crash into the Mexican state of Lower California.
As of Sunday morning, the hurricane, whose maximum speed is 137 km/h, is located 360 km south of the city of Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and moves north with a speed of 19 km/h.
The hurricane has been in a cooler-water zone on the Pacific coast and is thus losing its power.
In the second half of the day, the hurricane will reach Mexico in the category of “tropical storm”.
It is expected that there will be heavy floods in some parts of Mexico, with flood threats.
“On the territory from Lower California to the northwest of Sonora, it can fall up to 7–10 cm of rainfall, up to 25 cm of rainfall,” the website weather.com reports.
Next, Hurricane Rosa will head north through Mexico’s territory and reach the tropical cyclone-grade Arizona border early on Tuesday morning. From Arizona it will reach the southern part of Utah by Tuesday evening.
“The main potential risk associated with Hurricane Rose and its remnants is due to heavy rains in Lower California, in the northwestern part of Sonora, and in desert areas of the southwestern United States,” the National Weather Service said in a statement.
Precipitation is expected to cause dangerous flooding, mudslides in the desert, and possible landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Suspects Arrested in Assassination Attempt
In Somerset, a 16-year-old teenager suffered severe knife injuries. Three teenagers and a 20-year-old teenager were arrested on suspicion of attempting to murder.
The victim of the attack with serious injuries was found in the area of Excelsior Terraces in Midsomer Norton at about 4 a.m. on Saturday.
After hospitalization, his condition is assessed as “stable”.
On the same night, four suspects aged 17, 18 and 20 were arrested in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset County Police said.
Police are looking for possible witnesses to the crime that have any video footage of what happened on a mobile phone.
Donald Trump: “All the hatred, all the evil, of the Democrats has broken down on Cavano”
“The vote for Judge Cavano is a vote against the ruthless and outrageous tactics used by Democrats,” Trump said at a rally in Willingham, West Virginia.
In Trump’s view, in the process of approving Cavano’s nomination for the candidate “all hatred, all malice” of the Democratic Party was violated.
On Thursday, Cavanaugh testified in the U.S. Congress, in his emotional address, categorically rejecting the accusation of Christina Blazy Ford that he sexually harassed her more than 30 years ago, when both were teenagers.
Dr. Ford also testified during the hearing on her indictment.
On Saturday, the U.S. president said that on that day, “the American people saw the brilliant mind, class and courage” of Cavano.
“The vote for the endorsement of Judge Cavano is the vote for the endorsement of one of the most outstanding lawyers of our time, with an uncontaminated state service list,” the president said in a statement to the crowd of his associates in the state of West Virginia.
In his speech, the president indirectly touched on the issue of the nomination of Kavanaugh, talking about the importance of Republicans coming to the elections to Congress and the House of Representatives.
“There are only five weeks left to the most important elections in our lives.
I don’t participate in them, but I participate in the race in a different way,” he said.
“I’m wearing like a burn and I’m fighting for our great candidates.”
Trump believes that the Democrats have set themselves the task of “with all their might to resist us.”
According to the rules, the first key vote in the Senate on the approval of Kavanaugh's candidacy should take place no later than Friday, an assistant to the high-ranking representative of the Republican Party said.
Earthquake in Indonesia has killed hundreds, and the total number of victims continues to grow
On Saturday, Indonesian authorities announced that at least 384 people had been killed, many of whom were killed by giant waves hitting the beaches of the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, which was hit by an incredible tsunami and earthquake.
The first victims of the plot were hundreds of guests of the beach festival in the city of Palu. On Friday at sunset, waves of almost six meters high reached the coast, which dared everyone on their way and led to the immediate death of many of those present.
The tsunami followed an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
“When a storm warning was issued yesterday, people continued their beach vacation, instead of immediately fleeing to the shelter, and because of this they lost their lives,” Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, the official representative of the Indonesian National Administration for Post-Liquidity, said in a statement.
“There was not one tsunami, there were cars, logs, whole houses, the element destroyed everything in its path,” Nugroho explained, adding that the tsunami crossed the ocean at a speed of 497 km/h and crashed into the coast with all its force.
Some of those present were taken to the trees, which saved their lives.
Approximately 16,700 local residents were evacuated to 24 shelters in Palu.
On the aerial photographs of the management to eliminate the consequences of natural disasters are seen destroyed houses, shops, collapsed bridges and flooded mosque.
On Saturday, the coastal city was still shaken by underground shocks.
A series of earthquakes occurred in the territory with a population of 2.4 million people.
According to a statement by the Agency for the Evaluation and Use of Technology of the Republic of Indonesia (BPPT), the energy emissions caused by the earthquake were about 200 times greater than those caused by the atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima.
Perhaps the tsunami was stronger than expected, due to the geographic location of the city located at the end of the long narrow bay.
Nugroho called the damage “scalar,” adding that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were destroyed.
Under the ruins of the collapsed buildings were found the bodies of the dead; in total, 540 people were injured, and another 29 are missing.
Nugroho added that the casualties and destruction could be even more significant along the coast at 300 km from Palu, in the village of Dongala, which was closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications with Dongala were “completely disrupted, no information was received.”
“More than 300,000 people live in the Dongala area,” the International Committee of the Red Cross, whose staff and volunteers have already been sent to the disaster zone, said in its communiqué.
“There has been a tragedy, but it is not yet the limit,” the statement said.
On Saturday, the Department was severely criticized for not reporting on the arrival of the tsunami in Palu in time. The authorities, however, believe that the waves reached the coast at the time when the initial warning was still in effect.
On social media, there was an amateur video in which a man on the upper floor of the building shouts about an upcoming tsunami, desperately trying to attract the attention of people on the street.
After a few minutes, a wall of water falls on the shore, carrying whole houses and cars.
Reuters has not yet been able to confirm the authorship of the video.
Earthquakes and tsunami led to a major depletion of electrical lines, which caused the loss of communication in Palu. This made it very difficult for the rescue operations of the services.
Military transport planes with humanitarian aid were dispatched from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated population still lacks food and essentials, government sources say.
The city’s airport was only open for humanitarian assistance; it will be closed for other flights until October.
On Sunday, President Joko Vidodo will visit the evacuation centers in Palu.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia exceeds 800.
The situation is very bad.
Volunteers of the World Vision charity arrived safely from Dongala to Palu, where employees found shelter in tarpaulin tents broken down in the courtyard of their office building. According to Doseba Sinai, along the way, their eyes appeared a horrifying picture of complete destruction.
“They’ve seen a lot of destroyed houses,” he says.
The situation is very bad.
Charitable organizations have begun to implement humanitarian aid mechanisms, but many complain that specialists from international NGOs have not been able to get to Palu.
Indonesian law permits the recruitment of funding, humanitarian aid and staff of foreign organizations only after the announcement of a place where the element has struck, the zone of national natural disaster.
It hasn't happened yet.
“It is believed that this is a local disaster,” said Aulia Ariani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government declares a natural disaster to be national, we will be able to accept foreign aid, but so far the status remains unchanged.”
On the second day after the natural disaster, which shocked Palu, friends and relatives of people who were missing are still hoping for their miraculous salvation, which will return the population to faith in the best.
On Saturday, a little boy was rescued, who fell into a sewer shed.
On Sunday, rescuers pulled a woman from under the rubble of the building, who spent two days there, next to her mother's breathless body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesia national team for paragliding, has prepared two of the missing pilots for the recently held Asian Games in Indonesia.
Among other people trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel were his students, including Mandagi.
“I’m not the last person in this sport and it’s emotionally difficult to survive,” he said.
Hendon recalls how, after learning about the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel from other paragliders, during the next hours he desperately tried to contact his colleagues from Palo who were resting at the beach festival via WhatsApp.
However, his messages were displayed with one gray tick, not two blue ones.
“This means that the messages were not delivered,” he said.
Theft of $26,750 during the service of an ATM in Newport-on-Livi
On Friday morning, the attackers kidnapped $26,750 from the cashier Brink's, who refuels one of the ATMs in the city of Newport-on-Livi, according to a press release from the Newport police.
According to investigator Dennis McCarthy, the driver of the armored minibus took cash from the ATM located in the entertainment complex and was going to fill it with new banknotes.
At this time, "an employee of Brink's ran away from the back by an attacker" and stole a bag of banknotes to refuel the ATM.
According to witnesses of the incident, several suspects fled the scene, but the police did not specify the number of potential participants.
Citizens who have any information about these individuals are requested to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changed his name to Jee
Rapper Kanye West invented a new name for himself: Yee.
On Saturday, he tweeted: “A personality formerly known as Kanye West.”
The 41-year-old West has been wearing this pseudonym for a long time and even named it his eighth album, which was released in June.
The news came ahead of Kanye's appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he plans to release his new album Yandhi.
Kanye West will act as a conductor instead of singer Ariana, who canceled her participation due to “emotional experiences,” the broadcaster reports.
West has previously stated that the pseudonym is not only an abbreviated version of his name, but also carries a religious meaning.
“Ye is the most common word in the Bible, it means ‘you’, ‘you’,” West explained the name of his album in one of the recent interviews with radio broadcaster Big Boy.
“That’s me, that’s you, that’s us.
At first there was Kanye, which means “the only one”, and now I am only Ye, that is, the reflection of all the good, the bad, the incomprehensible in us, all at once.
And the album is an attempt to figure out who we are.”
Kanye was not the first rapper to change his name.
Sean Combs, formerly known as Puff Diddy, P. Diddy or simply Diddy, this year asked to call himself Love (“Love”) or Braza Love (“Brother Love” or “Brother Love”).
The rapper Jay-Z, who performed with West, also changed the spelling of his name several times: with a spelling and without, spelling letters or lines.
President of Mexico solemnly promises not to use military force against the civilian population
Mexican President Andrés Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador vowed never to resort to military force against the civilian population ahead of the 50th anniversary of a student demonstration that ended in a bloody clash.
Speaking on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square, President L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador promised “never resort to the help of the army to repress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, during a peaceful demonstration of the students, the first shots were fired at the crowd and a massacre began, killing 300 people. This occurred against the background of the intensification of the leftist student movements in Latin America.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador also pledged to support Mexican youth in the form of a monthly scholarship to study and open up more free public universities.
According to him, unemployment and the lack of prospects for education lead young people directly into the criminal world.
U.S. needs to double funding for AI development
China and its artificial intelligence (AI) efforts should not be underestimated – the U.S. should double its investment in its scientific development, said Lee Kaifu, an investor and entrepreneur in AI development with experience at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Several U.S. ministries have previously made statements on AI, although the U.S. generally does not have a clear strategy for developing AI.
At the same time, China presented its own plan last year: its goal is to be the first in AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the U.S., and we expect the next breakthrough in AI,” Li said.
Increasing funding could double the chances that the next big AI achievement will be made in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “Superpowers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of FaCE<0x2B>, which has invested in one of the most outstanding companies.
In the 1980s at the University of Carnegie-Mellon, he worked on a system of artificial intelligence that outperformed the highest player in the American Othello, and then he was head of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee mentioned previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects’ Robotics Challenge, and wondered when the next competition would take place to help find people with unconventional thinking.
According to Lee, researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to get government grants.
“It’s not China that absorbs academic leaders, it’s corporations,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have been hiring lights from universities in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee is convinced that changes in immigration policy can also help the U.S. develop artificial intelligence.
“I think green cards should automatically be offered to candidates in the field of artificial intelligence,” he says.
In July 2017, the State Council of China published a plan for the development of the next generation of artificial intelligence.
China’s National Science Foundation allocates funding to scientists similar to how the National Science Foundation and other government organizations allocate money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of scientific work in China is lower, Li says.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense created a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, in which industry and scientific partners should participate, and the White House announced the creation of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in a program called AI Next.
As far as the NSF is concerned, it is currently investing more than $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation, which sought to establish the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, has not taken any action in this direction for several months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on whether to change the name of the country
The people of Macedonia on Sunday voted in a referendum on whether to change the name of their country to “Republic of North Macedonia”, which would allow to settle a long-standing dispute with Greece, which blocked its applications for membership in the European Union.
Greece, which is part of the province of Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor is a claim to its territory, and has vetoed its accession to NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments reached an agreement based on a proposal for a new name, but nationalist opponents say the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of Macedonia’s population.
President George Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign questioned whether the turnout of voters would correspond to the minimum of 50 percent required to hold the referendum.
The question put to the referendum was as follows: “Do you support NATO and EU membership, provided that a treaty with Greece is adopted?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the collapse of Yugoslavia, should pay this price for joining organizations such as the EU and NATO.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that it can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” says Olivera Georgievskaya, a 79-year-old resident of Skopje.
A sufficient number of Members of Parliament have said they will comply with the results of the vote to make it decisive, although it does not have binding legal force.
The change of name will require a two-thirds majority of the members of the Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission said there were no reports of violations by 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
“I came to vote for my children, our place in Europe,” says 62-year-old Jose Tanevski, a voter from the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in favour of a referendum in Macedonia on the question of changing the name of the country, which will pave the way for its accession to NATO and the European Union in Strumice, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
Before the parliament building in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage, placing the chairs in front of the tents set up by those citizens who are going to boycott the referendum.
“We are in favour of membership in NATO and the EU, but we want to unite with a high head, rather than covering the thresholds of official cabinets,” Kavadarkov said.
“Yes, we are citizens of a poor country, but we also have a sense of self-worth.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Euro-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring investment to Macedonia, which is so necessary for this country, where the unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
“I believe the overwhelming majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after the vote.
He believes that the positive response will be “a pledge of our prosperous future.”
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Studies showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the referendum, but this is below the required turnout.
In another survey conducted by the Macedonian channel Telecom-TV, it was found that 57 percent of respondents are planning to vote on Sunday.
Seventy per cent of that number said they would vote in favour.
In order for the referendum to take place, the turnout must be 50 per cent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum will be the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since it came to power in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguaro of Manchester City bypasses the defense of Brighton to score a goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling clashed with Brighton's defense, leading Manchester City to a 2-0 victory on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
When Aguero scored the goal in the 65th minute, it seemed like it was no trouble for him.
At the beginning of the episode, the Argentine striker received a pass in the center of the field.
He ran between three of Brighton’s defenders before breaking out into the open.
Aguero was surrounded by four rivals in green T-shirts.
He bypassed one defender and bypassed several more along the edge of the Brighton penalty area.
He then handed the ball to Sterling on the left.
The English striker, in the penalty area, returned the Aguero ball in one touch, which punctured Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan with his right foot into the right corner of the goal.
"Aguero is having some problems with his legs," Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We agreed that he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored the goal at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Heavenly Blue the original advantage in the Premier League fight.
The goal was scored in the 29th minute.
In this game Aguero got the ball, being deep in the territory of Brighton
He gave an excellent cut-off on the left flank of Leroy San.
Sane made a few touches before handing over Sterling's transmission to the long bar.
The attacker “Heavenly Blues” hit the ball in the goal just before flying outside the field.
Manchester City clashed with Hoffenheim in the Champions League group on Tuesday at 12:55 at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Zinsheim, Germany.
Sherzer is going to pick up the glasses from Colorado Rockies.
After the Washington Nashionals were out of the battle for the playoffs, there was no particular reason to force events.
But the tireless Sherzer hopes to take the lead in the fight against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if the Rockies, ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western Division, will have problems in the playoffs.
With a 5-2 victory over the Nashionals on Friday night, the Rockies have already won at least 7 or 8 places, but they are still hoping to secure a title in the first division.
“And while we’re just playing like that, at least we can hold positions knowing the tremendous importance of the atmosphere in Denver in the presence of the spectators and the other team, probably unprecedented this year.
How can I miss that?”
The Nashionals have not yet announced a pitcher on Sunday, but according to the latest data, in the current situation tend to put Scherzer on that role.
Sherzer, who is going to play for the 34th game, threw the ball on the pitch on Thursday, and on Sunday, on his weekend, will be a pitcher.
The statistics of the right-hand picker "Washington" — 18-7 with an ERA rating of 2.53 and 300 cars in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump is running an election race in West Virginia.
Speaking about the importance of the Republicans coming to the midterm elections, the president indirectly referred to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, the candidacy put forward by the president to the Supreme Court.
“Everything we did was put on the map in November.
There are five weeks left to one of the most important choices of our lives.
It's very, very important. I don't run, although I really run, everywhere fighting for good candidates," he said.
Trump continued, “You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see that it’s happening right now.
And they are determined to take back power by any means necessary, and we are watching the laziness and the disgust.
They don’t care who they insult, through whom they have to go to get power and control, and that’s what they want to get – power and control, but we’re not going to give them to them.”
The Democrats, he claims, set themselves the goal of “resisting and hindering.”
“And you’ve been watching it for the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “evil, ugly, cowardly and lying.”
He referred to the Senate Legal Committee, citing Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, which sparked loud outcry from the room.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you allow the contents of this document to be leaked?
Mmm... mmm... what document?
No, no. The language of the body has delivered it, I have never seen the language of the body so refuted words.”
The Labour Party is no longer an organization that adheres to different views.
It does not show tolerance to those who express their opinion.
When Momentum activists in my local party made a motion for a vote of no confidence in me, it was no surprise.
After all, I am the last in a line of Members of Parliament from the Labour Party who have not yet been told that we are not welcomed for expressing our opinion.
A similar attitude to my colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, because she was resolutely opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, with a vote of no confidence, I was criticized for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe – ironically, these are issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
In a statement to the Nottingham Eastern Labour Assembly on Friday, it said that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of the eight years of my tenure as a local member of parliament from the Labour Party, the GC’s Friday evening meetings were just that.
Unfortunately, today’s tone does not correspond to those many meetings, and the promise of a “more humane and softer” policy has long been forgotten, if it has ever been so.
The fact that differences of opinion are not allowed in the Labour Party is becoming more and more evident, and each opinion is assessed on the subject of whether it is acceptable to the leadership of the Party.
It began shortly after Jeremy became the leader; colleagues whose political perspective I previously thought was similar to my own, began to expect me to radically change my views and take an ESI position that I would never agree with, or a security that I would never agree with — regardless of nationality.
Every time after my public speech – and it doesn’t matter what I’m saying – there is a tyranny of insults on social media calling for the abolition of elections, condemning the politics of the center, or claiming that I shouldn’t be a member of the Labour Party.
And it's not just me.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, as the comments in my address still tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those of my colleagues who face a daily stream of attacks on sexual or racist grounds, but never step back.
What is most disappointing about this policy is that the number of insults has become the norm.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said that the Labour Party should develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer the “wide church,” and with every vote of distrust or change in the rules of the party’s election, the party is already becoming.
Over the past two years, I’ve received a lot of recommendations urging me to sit down calmer and cut to speak, and then I’ll be fine.
But that's not why I'm in politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, as a school pupil, outraged by the disrespectful attitude of the Thatcher government, which has caused my school class to literally disintegrate, I have sought to stand up for the highest standard of public service for those who want to be a part of the government.
I have never concealed my political views, nor have I done so in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could misinterpret my political positions and spheres in which I disagree with the current leadership.
To those who supported this vote on Friday, I would like to say the following: our country is so hard working towards a Brexit that is guaranteed to cause economic, industrial and state damage, and I do not understand the desire of some to waste their time and energy on the question of my lot.
But in fact, the only audience I would like to address is not Nottingham Momentum, but my voters, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise you that I am in your best interest, no threat to the cancellation of the results of the elections, no threat to the election or to the election.
Chris Leslie, Member of Parliament from Nottingham County East
Er 38 - 17 Melrose: The Invincible "Er" comes first
Two late attempts may have slightly distorted the final result, but without a doubt, “Er” deserved a triumph in this surprisingly interesting Premier League match of Tennant.
Now they are leading the table, the only invincible team of the dozen.
After all, all thanks to their excellent defense, as well as the ability to choose the right moment, which gave the receiving team and coach Peter Merci the full right to be satisfied.
“We’ve been tested for strength all this time and we’re still invincible, so I have no reason to be sad,” said Peter Mercci.
Robin Christy, Melrose: “We should pay tribute to Er, they tried better than us.”
Anderson's 14-minute attempt by Fraser Clima brought the "Air" forward, but the yellow card released for the "Warriors" Scottish player Rory Hughes allowed the "Meltic" to move forward, and Jason Baggott did not.
Klimo increased the gap of the "Er" from the penalty, before, right in the middle of the game, earning a point, and then in the break realized a single attempt, making an account 17-5 in favor of the "Er".
But the Melroses started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson’s attempt by Buggott reduced the gap to five points.
Then there was a long pause due to Ruarid Knott's severe injury, which was stretched, and after the re-release, "Era" advanced further thanks to Stafford McDowell's attempt by Klimo.
Acting Air Captain Blair Macferson then received a yellow card, and again Melrose forced rivals to pay another player for Bruce Colvin's unrealized attempt at the end of a period of fierce pressure.
However, the hosts returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for intercepting Klimo without the ball from the penalty line, Macferson made a touchdown behind the incoming Air mill.
Klimo realised the advantage without stopping almost from the very rebound, after Kyle Rowe received a blow from David Armstrong and sent the attacking extreme Gregor Henry on the fifth attempt of the field owners.
Star Still Game is about to start a new career in the restaurant business
Still Game star Ford Kiran is about to start working in the hotel industry: it has become known that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays the role of Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, a script he writes for, and is filming alongside longtime comedy partner Greg Hemfield.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the last on the show, and it looks like Kirnan is planning a life after Craigling.
According to official information, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the information, although a source from the Scottish Sun suggested that Kirnan plans to participate in a “bright restaurant business” in Glasgow.
"Our Sea": no way out to the Bolivian sea hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific Ocean
Marines are patrolling the naval headquarters in La Paz.
Blue flags are displayed on public buildings.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are outlined with the slogan: “The sea is right.
It is our duty to return it.”
Throughout Bolivia, with no access to the sea, the memory of the coastline lost in favor of Chile as a result of the bloody conflict of the 19th century due to resources is still alive and eager to sail the Pacific Ocean again.
These hopes have perhaps become the most daring in recent decades, as Bolivia is awaiting a decision by an international court that will take place on October 1 as a result of five years of debate.
“Bolivia has the energy, the spirit of unity and the mental balance and, of course, they are waiting for a positive result here,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will watch the International Court of Justice’s decision on large screens across the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will be able to support Bolivia’s statement that after decades of tense negotiations Chile is obliged to negotiate the extradition of Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia’s indigenous peoples, who is leading a difficult battle for re-election next year, is also looking forward to Monday’s decision.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he said at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to make a decision in favor of Bolivia, and if it does, it will change little.
The UN body in the Netherlands has no authority to dispose of Chilean territory and has already stated that it will not affect the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the International Court of Justice’s decision was made only six months after the latest arguments were heard suggests that the case was “not complicated,” said Pas Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
In the last four years, Bolivia’s case has not progressed, on the contrary, it has been postponed all the time.
“The current Bolivian administration has taken advantage of the problem of access to the sea for criminal purposes,” Zarate said.
According to her, Morales’ warlike rhetoric destroyed the last Chilean benevolence.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but after that it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions.
The two countries have not had diplomatic relations since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Velce, the representative of Bolivia in The Hague, disagreed that the court’s decision was delivered too quickly.
Monday will bring Bolivia “an exceptional opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance to “end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefit,” he says.
Calzadilla also disagrees that Morales, still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, is using the naval issue as a political goat.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific,” he said.
“The court’s decision is an opportunity to once again make sure that we have to move through our past.”
North Korea Says There Will Be No Nuclear Disarmament Until It Can Trust The U.S.
North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never go to the destruction of its nuclear weapons if it can’t trust Washington.
On Saturday, Ri spoke at a meeting of the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to deliver on the promises made at the Singapore summit between the leaders of its countries.
His comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is gradually returning to the path of resumption of nuke diplomacy more than three months after a meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri argues that the dream that long-term sanctions and U.S. objection to the declaration of the end of the Korean War will ever put the North on its knees is utopia.
Washington is afraid to endorse this declaration if Pyongyang does not take any significant steps to disarm it.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want to hold a second summit.
But skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning the arsenal, which the country is probably considering as the only way to guarantee its security, is widespread.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows showcasing the latest line of massive headwear that promise to appear in mass sales, and they will be worn right next to you
If you want to add a hat to your collection or completely protect yourself from the sun’s rays, there’s no need to look for anything else.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a mass of unusual headwear that is part of their SS19 collection and blinded visitors to Fashion Week in Paris.
This summer, extremely impractical hats won the popularity of Instagram followers, and designers decided to send their dreamy creations to the podium.
Valentino's distinguished specimen: the head beige cleaner, decorated with wide fields, similar to feathers, was painted on the heads of the models.
Other massive accessories included jeweled peas, a wizard’s hat, and even pineapple, but all these headwear are not designed to warm your head in cold weather.
Tom Brown also showed the world a collection of strange masks, which had to happen very much the day before Halloween.
Many of these razor-sharp masks were sewn together, and they resembled a portrait of Hannibal Lector rather than a creation from cutlery.
One of the specimens resembled the equipment for underwater swimming with a tube and protective glasses, and the other - melted ice.
If you are a fan of high fashion, you are in luck.
Fashion critics predict that these huge hats have all the chances of breaking into mass sales — right to you.
Huge-sized hats go on the heels of "La Bomba", a straw hat with fields two feet wide, which was already worn by everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratakovsky.
The iconic label, which released this extremely impractical hat, which gained such widespread popularity on social networks, gave birth and sent to walk on the podium another huge accessory - a straw-like suit in a beach bag, almost as big as the one.
The orange bag in burnt shelf with a white leather handle and shelf rim has become a bright copy of the Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection at Fashion Week in Paris.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitazh tells FEMAIL: “I think big hats and beach bags will appear in the mass sale next summer. Since the designer has produced such a furore with his works, it would be extremely difficult to ignore the demand for akhog.
John Edward: Knowledge of languages is of great importance to the citizens of the world
Scotland’s independent schools continue the tradition of brilliant education, which was once again confirmed in 2018: outstanding exam results have demonstrated individual and collective successes in sports, art, music and other societally important disciplines.
These schools are part of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), where more than 30,000 students are trained across Scotland, and where they aim to provide the highest level of service for students and their parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their pupils for further higher education, their chosen careers, as well as for the status of citizens of the world.
As part of the education sector that is responsible for the development and implementation of an individual school program, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you call to his mind.
If you speak to him in his native language, you turn to his heart.”
This is a compelling proof that we cannot rely solely on the English language if we want to build relationships with citizens of other countries and be able to trust them.
According to the results of the last exams this year, we see that languages occupy the leading positions in the league tables and have the highest scores in independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received the highest grade of “A”.
Data from 74 SCIS-member schools showed that 72 percent of students received an “A” in Mandarin (a Chinese term), while 72 percent of students studied German, 69 percent also received a “A” in French, and 63 percent received a “A” in French.
This proves that in independent schools in Scotland, foreign languages are undoubtedly considered vital for children and young people in the future.
Currently, language subjects are in the same demand as natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics in the curricula of independent schools and in other educational institutions.
A survey conducted by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that 17 per cent of the reasons for employers’ difficulties in filling vacancies were due to a lack of language skills.
Thus, language skills are increasingly becoming the backbone of a successful future career for young people.
Given that more forward-looking jobs require language skills, these skills are necessary in a globalized world.
No matter what profession the student chooses, if he learns a second language, in the future he will gain a real advantage by mastering another additional skill that will benefit him throughout his further life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a person who knows several foreign languages a competitive advantage.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were not able to speak a foreign language well enough to support a conversation, and French was the only language with a double-digit percentage.
That’s why investing in language education is so relevant right now.
Knowledge of several languages, especially the languages of developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding a good job.
In schools in Scotland there is quite a large spread in terms of languages that are taught – each school has its own set of languages.
Some schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered to be the most important for the UK in light of the country’s future development by 2020 — such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interests, in independent schools there will always be a choice of several languages with a teaching staff whose members are specialists in these languages.
Scotland’s independent schools strive to create a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, regardless of what the future holds for them.
At present, it cannot be denied that in a global business environment, languages remain vital to the future development of the country, and that this should be reflected accordingly in education.
In fact, modern languages really need to be seen as “skills of international communication.”
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, which will provide diversity and benefits to the youth of Scotland.
We have to do it right.
John Edwards, Director of the Council of Independent Schools of Scotland
Lebron to make his debut as the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
Fans’ huge expectation to see LeBron James perform in the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in a pre-season Sunday match against the Denver Naggets in San Diego.
But he still has to figure out how much time he has to play.
“More than one and less than forty-eight,” Walton said on the Lakers website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell wrote on Twitter that James is likely to play a limited amount of time.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six pre-season games in the Lakers schedule.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need pre-season games to prepare for the season,” he said.
Trump's election race in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is beginning a wave of election meetings tonight in Willingham, West Virginia.
It’s the first of five scheduled meetings Trump will have next week, including a visit to friendly Tennessee and the Mississippi.
As the vote on the candidacy proposed by him for the post of supreme judge has been postponed, Trump is seeking to gain support in the upcoming midterm elections, because Republicans risk losing control of Congress if the vote is held in November.
What time will Trump’s meeting take place in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
The meeting with Trump in Willingdon, West Virginia, will take place at 19:00 Eastern Time today, on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s meeting with voters in West Virginia online live on YouTube.
Trump is likely to speak at the hearings that will take place this week, on the subject of the nomination of his candidate Brett Cavano to the post of supreme judge. The proposal by Trump of this candidacy will have caused a lot of negative responses to the case, and Floho has been accused of sexual assault.
But the main goal of this campaign is to help Republicans, who are going to the November elections, increase the election rate.
Thus, President Trump’s campaign is aimed at making these five meetings, which are due to take place next week, help “activate the activities of volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“Control over Congress is so important to his agenda that the president must visit as many states as possible, because we are entering a season of tense campaign agitation,” Trump’s campaign spokesman said in a statement.
The action planned today at Wesbanco Arena in Willingdon could attract supporters from “...Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract the attention of the Pittsburgh media,” — reports West Virginia Metro News.
Trump’s visit to West Virginia this Saturday is already the second visit to the state in the last month, because it was here that he gained an advantage of more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Senate candidate Patrick Morrisi, who is behind the polls.
“The fact that in order for Morrisi to get ahead of competitors in the polls, the president must come — it’s a bad sign for Morrisi himself,” said Simon Heather, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Rider Cup 2018: U.S. team shows readiness to fight and fuels hope by going to pairs on Sunday
After three unilateral sessions, Saturday's two-by-two game may have been exactly what Ryder's Cup needed.
A transitional initiative is an exceptionally inventive sporting concept, but it is the players believe in it, and in such competitions it is particularly pronounced.
So who has the initiative?
“They had an advantage in six points, and now four, so I think it’s a small initiative for us,” said Jordan Sleep.
Of course, Europe has an advantage in four points, and another twelve points.
The Americans, according to Spit, feel the “wind in the sails,” and they have reasons to keep the spirit high, not least thanks to Spit and Justin Thomas’ form, who played together all day, and each can boast three out of four points.
Sleep was inconsistent from you to the grin, rather than a personal example.
The winning voices became louder as his round continued, pushing the decisive ball into the hole, closing the match when they and Thomas relegated two by two.
His blow, which gave them a victory in the game on the 15th hole, was met with a similar voice, one of those that speak of his belief in a chance for the American team.
“We need to get together with all we can and focus only on our own game,” Spit said.
That’s all that’s left for the players.
Go 18 months and become the winners.
The only players who have earned more points in the last two days than Sleep and Thomas are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who have undoubtedly entered the history of the Ryder Cup.
A strange but charming couple from Europe knocked out four out of four, and they don’t seem to know the mistakes.
Mollywood was the only couple not to pick up the bogs on Saturday afternoons, but they also avoided the bogs on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons, and, again, Friday mornings.
Such a series and how their energy seems to circulate between them and non-realist fans, strengthens the belief that they will not be defeated on Sunday, and when the sun is hidden behind the horizon of the “Le Golf National” field, there will be no more famous player in Europe.
It would be great if both were in different holes at the same time.
However, it is too early to talk about the glory of Europe.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly clashed with Sergio Garcia, the morning hero of the four-ball game when he was in pairs with Alex Noren.
The Gods and the two double Gods in the first nine holes threw out a Spanish and a Swedish hole from which they could never get out.
So on Sunday, no one will help you get out of your pit.
It’s so exciting to watch the game in four balls and four players because of the interaction between the pairs, the tips they exchange, and the intentional silence, and how the strategy can change in an instant.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and made a significant breakthrough on the last day, but this four-day session also showed that the U.S. team has all the strength to fight in which some, especially in America, have doubted.
On the final day of the Ryder Cup Europe leads with an account of 10-6
Europe will receive a tangible advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup after finishing Saturday’s four-ball and four-ball games with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the fight with two victories over the struggling Tiger Woods to bring the score to Le Golf National by four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, wishing to regain the trophies lost in Hazeline two years ago, dominated the American team’s mistake in the morning games in four balls, winning 3-1.
The U.S. had more resistance in the quarterfinals, winning two games, but they were unable to narrow the account gap.
Jim Ferrick’s team needs eight points out of 12 Sunday matches to save the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novice to win four points in a row, while he and the Mollinari, who received the nickname "Mollwood" after the sensational weekend, became only the second pair to win four points in the first four games in the history of the Rah Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in four balls, they then brilliantly teamed up to win over the fallen spirit Woods and American newcomer Bryson Decebmo with an even stronger 5/4.
Woods, who went through two Saturday matches, showed periodic brilliance, but now he lost 19 of 29 games in four balls, and four - seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested in front of the morning game in four balls, returned to partner Henry Stanson in the fourth, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kepku with a 2/1 account, taking first and third place in the world.
For Europe, the game did not become an easy and pleasant walk refreshing day to the southwest of Paris.
The two points earned by three-time champion Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas on Saturday became a benchmark for the Americans.
They won a decisive 2-1 victory over the Spaniards John Ram and Ian Polter in a four-ball game and later returned to beat Poltera and Rory McIlroy with 4/3 in the fours, losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, the team got out of the back in four points, going out alone, considering that the team of Ferrica, as the hosts, had to play outside to hold the trophy.
However, after two days of holding second place, Sunday’s counterattack looks like it’s beyond their capabilities.
North Korea says it will not “categorically” disarm unilaterally without trust
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the ongoing sanctions are heightening distrust of the United States and that its country will under no circumstances give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yong Ho said at the annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken “substantial measures of goodwill” last year, such as the cessation of nuclear and missile tests, the dismantling of nuclear facilities and the commitment not to increase nuclear and non-nuclear stockpiles.
“However, we do not observe a symmetrical reaction from the United States,” he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances, we will not be the first to unilaterally take action on disarmament.”
While Ri reiterated the already-sounding North Korean complaints about Washington’s resistance to the “stage” approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea will be rewarded for its gradual steps in the past, his statement seemed important in the sense that it did not deny.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit in history between the current US president and the North Korean leader, which took place in Singapore on June 12; then Kim promised to start the movement towards “the diary.”
North Korea is seeking to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington is also opposed to calls for a weakening of tough international sanctions against North Korea.
“The U.S. insists that ‘denuclearization must be done first,’ and raises the level of pressure through sanctions in order to enforce its goal, and even opposes ‘the declaration of an end to the war,’” Ri says.
“The idea that sanctions can put us on our knees is a utopian dream of people who don’t know us.
But the real problem is that the ongoing sanctions are intensifying our distrust.”
Ri did not mention the plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader mentioned at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister drew attention to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Zhe Yin over the past five months, adding: “If South Korea, not the United States, were the denuclearization side of the denuclearization issue.”
However, the tone of Ri’s speech differed sharply from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting North Korea’s missiles on the U.S. mainland was inevitable after “Mr. President Evil” Trump called Kim “a suicide bomber.”
This year at the UN, Trump, who last year threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his bravery in taking disarmament measures, but said there was still much more to be done and sanctions should remain in place until North Korea disbands.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not specify any timelines for the process: “Whether it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should encourage Pyongyang to take the steps that have been taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “The Security Council’s imposition of sanctions must continue actively and obligatoryly until we see a complete, definitive and confirmed denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously tightened sanctions against North Korea since 2006, with a view to curtailing the funding of Pyongyang ' s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly summit and said after that meeting that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was unsuccessful.
In July, he left Pyongyang, saying progress had been made, but within hours of that visit, North Korea condemned him for “bandit demands.”
North Korea has pledged at a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle the missile complex as well as the nuclear complex if the United States takes “appropriate action” on its part.
According to him, Kim told him that the “appropriate measures” he was talking about were security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore, as well as actions aimed at normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn to relax on special courses.
The new course, introduced this year at Harvard University, helped all beginners learn more to sleep and fight the chauvinistic culture of continuous caffeine consumption in order to wake up “night in the spring.”
One of the academics found that the most successful students in the world often have no idea how to take care of themselves.
Charles Chassler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed a course that he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
After his discovery, he came up with the idea of introducing such a course, giving a preliminary report on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning processes.
“At the end of my report, a girl approached me and said, ‘I’m so sorry I only learned about it now that I’m almost done with my studies.’
She said that no one ever told her about the importance of sleep — which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, first offered to students this year, talks about how the habit of healthy sleep contributes to academic and athletic performance, as well as how it improves a person’s overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University’s Health Service, says the university has decided to introduce this course after it was found that students are experiencing severe sleep deprivation during non-education.
The lesson lasts one hour, students perform a number of interactive tasks.
In one of the sections of the class is offered an image of the room in the dormitory, where students, by clicking on coffee cups, curtains, gymnastics and books, receive information about how each of these actions and substances are important to the effect of the results of the consumption of coffee, light, and sleep deprivation.
In another section, participants will learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The interactive map of the campus encourages course participants to think about their daily lives.
“We understand that these classes will not change the behavior of students right away.
But we believe that they have the right to know, just like any other person has the right to know about, for example, how smoking affects his health,” added Professor Chaisler.
According to him, the false sense of pride that a person can “smell all night” is still quite common, and modern technologies, as well as increasing pressure on students, mean that deprivation of sleep becomes a problem.
According to him, a sufficient amount of good quality sleep is a student’s “secret weapon” to fight stress, nervous exhaustion and anxiety, and even to fight overweight, as sleep deprivation puts the brain into a state of hunger, causing it to starve.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chasler develop the course by attending one of last year’s classes during his first year of Harvard study.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to spread this information across the campus.
He hopes that the next step is to ask all graduate students to pass a similar curriculum before entering a competitive educational institution.
Professor Chassler advises students to set up an alarm clock warning that they need to go to bed and wake up, as well as remember the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED lamps, which disrupts the human biorhythm and leads to problems.
Livingstone 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal brings victory over Gerrard's team
The Rangers experienced another sad outing as Dolly Menga's goal led the undefeated team of Steven Gerrard to a 1–0 loss at Livingstone.
The Ibrox team hoped to win their first away win after a 4:1 victory in February at St. Johnston, but the team of Gary Holt only inflicted a second defeat to Gerrard of 18 games, the team's prelude to the team as a manager, leaving his team for eight times.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers, who lost their spirit power, did not appear to be going to equalize the score.
While the Rangers have now dropped to sixth place, Livingstone has risen to third place, and only given up the Hibernian in the ratio of goals scored.
And Rangers may have additional problems after linear judge Kaluma Spencer had to heal a head wound after some item was thrown out of the guest sector.
Gerrard made eight replacements in the team that went through the Er in the semi-finals for the Scottish League Cup.
Holt, in turn, went with the same Livy 11 strategy, which increased the gap with Harts last week, and he would be delighted with how his well-forced squad narrowed opponents at every step.
The Rangers may have led the way in possession of the sword, but Livingston squeezed far more when the ball hit them.
They were supposed to score in just two minutes when Meng Scott Pittman's first transmission was stopped by Allan McGregor, but the defender took advantage of the chance.
Kigan Jacobs had a penalty kick on team captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Litgow, was only able to send the ball to the side of the further bar.
The Rangers took control, but in the last third there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos was confident he should have hit a penalty kick at the forty-fifth minute when he and Steven Lawless clashed, but Judge Steven Thomson disagreed with the Colombian statement.
The Rangers made only two strikes in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was barely concerned about Lassan Kulibali's head-strike and Ovi Ejaria's weak blow.
Although Livi’s first goal, scored in the 34th minute, may not have matched the game, no one can deny that they deserved it exclusively with their own hard work.
But again, Rangers failed to cope with the Jacobs game from the standard position.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher handed the ball over to Scott Robinson, who tried his best to hand the ball over to Meng for completion.
Gerrard began to act in a break when he replaced Kulibali for Ryan Kent, and such a replacement almost immediately resulted when the extreme midfielder gave the pass to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly swerved from his line to the interception.
But Livingstone continued to draw guests into the game they devised involving Litgow and Halkett, constantly making long broadcasts.
Holt's team tried to increase the gap in the final stages, but McGregor was able to block Jacobs before Litgow gave the transmission from the corner of the field.
Rangers backup player Glenn Middleton once again demanded a penalty kick after he clashed with Jacobs, but Thomson refused again.
Almanac: Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now the page of our almanac “Sunday Morning”: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago on this day in Germany was born the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Gans” Geiger.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity — an invention that eventually led to the creation of a device known as the Geiger counter.
Becoming one of the foundations of science, Geiger's counter also became one of the foundations of popular culture, and this was reflected in the 1950s film The Coronado Bell, with cowboy-like Roy Rogers and Dale Evans — the likes of which do not seem to resemble the chief scientists.
Man: “What kind of piece is that?”
Rogers: “This Geiger counter is used to detect radioactive minerals such as uranium.
“When you wear these headphones, you can really hear the influence of atoms generated by radioactivity in minerals.”
Evans: “Here, you can hear it right now!”
Gans Geiger died in 1945, not living just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But his invention, named after its author, is still widely used.
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach the Immune System to “See” Abnormal Cells
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to “see” abnormally growing cells and kill them
Part of the vaccine’s therapeutic action is to teach the immune system to recognize abnormal cells.
The method is to extract immune cells from the patient and change them in laboratory conditions.
As a result of this change, the cells get the ability to “see” the type of protein characteristic of many cancers, then the cells need to be reset.
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
In one patient who was given this vaccine and whose immune system learned to recognize abnormal cells, ovarian cancer has been in remission for more than 18 months.
The method is to extract the immune cells in a patient and change them in laboratory conditions, after which the modified cells can “see” the HER2 protein, which is characteristic of many types of cancer, then the modified cells are re-injected to the patient.
Professor Jay Berzoffski, U.S. National Cancer Research Institute, Wifezda, Maryland, says: “The results we’ve obtained suggest we’ve got a very promising vaccine.”
Professor Berzofski explains that HER2 “stimulates the growth of several cancers,” including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer.
A similar method was successfully used in the treatment of leukemia. It consisted in the enclosing of immune cells in patients and their "training" as to how to affect cancer cells.
Kanye West defended Trump in the MAGA cap after his appearance in SNL.
It's all gone bad.
Kanye West was cast in the studio during a Saturday concert at which he spoke in support of U.S. President Donald Trump, claiming he would retake the position in 2020.
After performing his third song, “Ghost City,” which he wore with the cap “Let’s make America great again,” the performer spoke out against the Democrats and supported Trump.
“I talk to white people a lot, and they ask me, ‘How can you support Trump, he’s a racist?’
“Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL channel made a parody show with Matt Damon in the lead role, in which the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Cavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on statements by Christina Blaise Ford about sexual harassment.
They didn’t show how the crowd was outraged by West’s remarks, but the video was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It’s unclear if Rock tried to make West laugh with this move.
In addition, West complained to the public that his hat was being ridiculed behind the scenes.
“They were standing next to me on the stage.
They say don't go out in that hat.
They were really pissed at me!
The Washington Examiner quoted him as saying, “And they also said that my position is not cool.”
West continues, “Do you want to know what’s not cool? Wear a superman’s coat so no one can tell you what to do. Do you want the world to continue to evolve?
Then you need love.”
His comments, at least twice, attracted the attention of the audience, members of the cast of SNL seemed lost, and one man told the publication: “The whole studio was plunged into silence.”
West was invited at the last minute to replace singer Ariane Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
Many were puzzled by West's performance of the song "I Love It" in the Perrier bottle suit.
West received the support of TPUSA’s conservative group leader Candis Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “To one of the bravest people: A SPACE FOR THE PARTICIPATION OF MANY.”
Talk show host Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West was just “who he is, and that’s absolutely wonderful.”
“However, I don’t want to support anyone (buying their music, clothing or otherwise supporting their creativity) who, in my view, shares and disseminates an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He is a free man.
Just like us,” she said.
Before the show's opening, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, stating that he is now "formally known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Duddy, Puffy and P. Diddy.
His colleague, rapper Snoop Dogg, originally had the name Snoop Lion, and as another example, of course, you can refer to the performer, who recently became a legend, the Prince, who changed his name to a symbol, and then to the name of the artist, formerly known as "Prince".
Attempt to Accusate Murder for Slaughter at Belfast Restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after one of his visitors died of a knife wound in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballihacamore, police said.
It is expected that the defendant will appear before the Belfast World Court on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the State Prosecutor’s Office.
Game of Thrones star Keith Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Keith Harington is known for his role as John Snow's swaying sword in the brutal medieval fantasy HBO series Game of Thrones.
However, a recent 31-year-old actor has hotly criticized the hero-mother stereotype, saying that such characters often inspire young people to think that in order to be respected, it is necessary to be cruel.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Keith said he believed “something went wrong” and asked how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married his “Game of Thrones” colleague, Rose Leslie, to his wife, has admitted that he is “very indifferent” to the problem.
“Personally, I take this question quite seriously: where did we go wrong with the perception of courage?” the actor asks.
“What do we teach teenagers that we have such a problem today?”
Keith believes that television may be partly to blame for this surge of toxic masculinity due to over-muscle characters.
The actor continues: “What is innate, and what is acquired?
What are they teaching on television and on the streets, which makes young men feel that they should show only one certain aspect of masculinity?
I think this is really one of the biggest problems of our time, and the question is how can we change that?
Because today with young people, there's really something wrong.
In an interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in any prequels or sequels to Game of Thrones, after the series ended next summer, saying that he had “finished the battles and horses.”
From November, Keith will play the lead role in Sam Shepard’s remake of “The True West,” which tells the story of the film’s producer and his brother, the robber.
The actor recently announced that he believes meeting his wife Rose is the best Game of Thrones finale for him.
“I met my wife on this show, so he gave me my family and my next life,” he said.
Rose played The Gamer — the passion object of the character of Kit John Snow in the fantasy series, awarded the Emmy Award.
The couple celebrated their wedding in June 2018 at the family estate of Leslie in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14 per cent increase in new cases
China has announced a 14 percent increase in the number of its citizens with HIV and AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people in the country are suffering from these diseases.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, there were about 40,000 new cases.
In the vast majority of new cases, the disease was transmitted sexually, which indicates a change in the trends of the past.
HIV has traditionally spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
However, it was this way that the number of HIV infections was reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
The number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China is increasing every year by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is an acute problem in the LGBT community of China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but LGBT discrimination is still widespread.
Studies confirm that because of the country’s conservative values, 70-90% of men who have sexual contact with men eventually marry women.
In many cases, the transmission of diseases is due to the insufficient protection of these sexual minorities.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to address this problem.
Maxin Waters denies leaking information about Republican Senators’ guilt, complaining of “dangerous lie” and “conspiracy theories”
U.S. House Member Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that one of her employees had posted the personal information of three U.S. Republican senators on the Legislature's Wikipedia pages.
A Los Angeles Democrat claims that the lawsuits were forged by “extreme-right” experts and websites.
“Lies, lies, and even more vicious lies,” Waters said on Twitter.
It is reported that the published information includes home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators. Lindsay Graham, Southern California, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday and was published by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a hearing in the Senate commission on charges of sexual harassment brought against the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred some time after three senators interviewed Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the messages was linked to the Waters office, and released information about Waters employees, Hill reports.
“This unfounded claim is absolutely false,” Waters said in a statement.
“A member of my staff whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these fraudulent actions was in no way responsible for the leakage of this information.
This unfounded claim is a complete lie.”
The Waters statement immediately sparked criticism on the Internet, including by former White House press secretary Ari Fleisher.
“This is an angry denial,” Fleecher writes.
“This means that the author has a temperament that is not suitable for work in Congress.
When you're accused of something you didn't do, why be angry?
There is no need to justify either.
There is no need to dig into the motives of the defendants.
We need to stay calm and cool.”
Fleisher appeared to have compared Waters’ reaction to Democrats’ criticism of Judge Cavano, who critics accused him of being too angry during Thursday’s hearings.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is running for Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
“If it’s true, it’s very important,” he writes.
In a statement, Waters wrote that her office had warned “relevant authorities and law enforcement authorities about these fraudulent actions.
“We will make sure that the perpetrators are found and that they take legal responsibility for all their actions, which can be destructive and dangerous to everyone and every one of my employees,” she wrote.
Johnny English strikes again — weak parody of spy Rowan Atkinson
Today, it has become a tradition to look for the meanings of Brexit in any new film in which the UK appears in some way; this also applies to the new parody spy franchise “Agent Johnny English”, the production of which began in 2003 and continued in 2011.
Will a self-ironic painting with the leitmotif “obviously we’re all shit” become a new attempt at national exports?
In any case, eye-opener Johnny English with a rubber face got his right to chaos a second time—this is his name that most clearly suggests that he is a wide-screen comic creation designed for a non-English cinema audience.
The hero, of course, is a stupid secret agent, who, despite his bizarre claims for glamorous smoothie, got a little Clouseau, features of Mr. Bin and a portion of this guy, Olpiyama, who made a single note in this year's 2012 Chariots of Fire melody in Lon.
Originally, this character was created based on the identity of the traveler and mysterious “international” Atkinson, who once played in the now-forgotten TV commercial Barclaycard, in which the character leaves behind a complete chaos.
In this latest issue, there are one or two pleasant moments.
I really liked the scene when Johnny English approached the helicopter, dressed in medieval armour, and the blades slid down his helmet.
Yes, it demonstrates Atkinson’s gift of physical performance of comedy scenes, but the humor itself seems rather weak and strangely redundant, especially because such “serious” films as “Agent 007” and “Mission Impossible” are now being offered.
The sense that humor is meant for children, not adults, and for me Johnny Inglesh’s bizarre crimes are not as inventive and appropriate as Atkinson’s jokes in Mr. Bine’s films.
The constant message now is that the UK is in serious trouble.
The cyber-hacker broke into a super-secret British spy network, revealing the identity of all British agents on the ground, to the horror of the duty agent – Kevin Eldon here, unfortunately, got an episodic role.
It’s the last drop for the prime minister, a poignant and poignant figure already suffering from huge political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does everything she can for the character of Quasi-Theresa-May, but there’s nothing to work with in the script.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that, since every active spy has been compromised, she will have to take someone out of her resignation.
And here on the stage is the sleazy Johnny English himself, who now works as a school teacher in some pontifical institution, but also gives unofficial lessons of secret operative work: there are a few good jokes in the sleek.
The Englishman returns to Whitehall for emergency instruction and reunites with his former unsuccessful friend Buff, who is also played by Ben Miller.
Buff is now a married man, subordinate to the commander of the submarine - the role of "joyful hockey dolls", in which Vicky Pepperdine is a little lost.
So, Batman and Robin are back in the game due to the fact that terrible mistakes have been made in the secret service of Her Majesty. They face a beautiful rock woman Ophelia Bulletova in the performance of Olga Kurilenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister dangerously falls under the spell of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer problems – the villainous Jason Volt, played by Jake Lacey.
Inglesh and Buff begin their odyssey of farce jokes: disguised as waiters, they set a French restaurant on fire; they create chaos by smuggling themselves on a luxurious Volta yacht; Inglesh generates a complete anarchy by trying to reuse the good.
All these scenes, of course, are cute and sleazy fiction, but in all of this there is something quite childish.
Quite moderate things.
And, as with Johnny Inglisher’s other films, I couldn’t help but think: Can the British film industry not give Rowan Atkinson a role that really proportionate to his talent?
Laborists Deny They’re Developing a Plan to Reduce the UK’s Working Week to Four Days for a Five-Day Salary
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is going to consider a radical plan that says the British will work four days a week, but will get paid in five days.
The party is reported to want company leaders to give the savings obtained as a result of the revolution in the field of artificial intelligence to the workers, giving them an extra weekend.
This would allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend for the same salary.
Sources said the idea “fits” into the economic agenda of the party and will help the population of the country to become on the side of workers.
The Congress of Trade Unions approved the transition to a four-day working week so workers could benefit from the benefits of a changing economy.
A senior Labour party source told The Sunday Times: It is expected that a policy review will be announced by the end of the year.
“This will not happen overnight, but a four-day working week is our goal, which is in line with the Party’s approach to changing the balance in the economy in favor of the workers, as well as the Party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party is not the first to support this idea, as the Greens have promised a four-day working week yet during their 2017 election campaign.
However, this aspiration is currently not endorsed by the majority of the Labour Party.
A representative of the Labour Party said: “The four-day working week is not a party policy and is not considered by the party.”
Shadow Chancellor John MacDonnell used last week’s Labour Conference to concretize his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. Macdonnell said he was determined to take power from “undifferentiated directors” and “speculators” of communal firms.
The shadow chancellor’s plans also mean that current vodka shareholders may not get their full share back, as the Labour government may make “counts” on the basis of alleged misdemeanors.
He also confirmed plans to include workers on the boards of directors of companies and create Inclusive Ownership Funds to transfer 10% of private-sector firm capital to workers who will be able to receive annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy Tell '60 Minutes': Could the FBI Investigation into Kavanaugh Change Their Minds?
The FBI’s investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his appointment to the post of supreme judge for at least a week and raises the question of whether the agency’s findings can encourage any of the Republican senators to support Kavanaugh.
In an interview shown on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelly interviewed Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could find anything that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
“Of course,” Kennedy replied.
“When I went to the hearing, I said I was talking to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, this information popped up, and I asked, “Did you do this?”
His response was decisive, definite and unambiguous.”
But Graham’s opinion during the vote remained inviolable.
“I’m firmly determined about Brett Cavano, and my opinion can only be changed by arguments, by the force of action comparable except with dynamite,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know one thing for sure: Brett strongly denied all this,” Graham added, addressing Christine Blaise Ford.
“None of the witnesses she brought in as witnesses could confirm these facts either.
This story has been going on for 36 years.
I didn’t notice anything new in it.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce the level of poverty?
This Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival will be held in New York City, an annual music event featuring an impressive star cast with an equally impressive mission – the end of poverty around the world.
For the seventh year in the framework of the Festival of the citizens of the world as tens of thousands of people flock to the great lawn of Central Park, but not only to enjoy the performances of such performers as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Niro's 30th anniversary, as well as to tell about this reality.
The World Citizens’ Festival, which opened in 2012, is a continuation of a global project to combat poverty conducted by an international group of human rights defenders hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to get a free event ticket (if you are not willing to pay for a VIP ticket), you should have taken part in volunteer activities or sent an email to the world leader, made a phone call or made a bell-to-be to do any other or other significant actions aimed at doing so.
But how successful has the Festival of World Citizens in 12 years in terms of achieving its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people a free visit to a concert to really convince a fellow citizen to demand a call to action, or is it just another case of so-called “clittivism” when people believe they are making real changes by signing an online petition or e-mail?
Global Citizen organizers say that since 2011, the festival has registered more than 19 million “actions” conducted by its supporters, who pursue many different goals.
It is noted that thanks to these actions, world leaders have promised to allocate funds of more than $37 billion, which is expected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group voiced 390 commitments and announcements that were made as a result of its actions, at least $10 billion of which had already been paid out or collected.
According to the group’s estimates, the funds allocated have provided direct assistance to nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One of the most significant commitments of Global is called The Power of Nutrition: the British partnership of investors and implementation specialists committed to “helping children to fully discover their potential was more than a half-doubt,” promised to give Rwanda $35 million in cash, so that it could not.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments, and Global Citizens like you, we can make social injustice to under-nutrition past history,” Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracy Ullman said in a press release.
The Group also stated that after more than 5,000 actions calling for the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the Government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will cover 5 million women and children through measures to improve nutrition.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the festival’s website: “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”
The organizers of Global Citizen said: “It will be a long and difficult journey that we will stumble upon and fall upon from time to time.
But as in the great movements of the struggle for civil rights and against apartheid, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Jeanel Monet — these are some of the artists who will perform at this year’s event in New York, and his lead will be Deborah-Lee Fernance and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. may use naval fleet for the purpose of “blockade” to prevent exports of Russian energy: Interior Minister
U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinke said Washington could “if necessary” resort to the help of its navy to prevent Russian energy carriers from entering the markets, including in the Middle East.
Zinke argues that Russia’s presence in Syria, especially where it operates at the invitation of a legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to trade in energy in the same way they do in Eastern Europe, in southern Europe,” he said.
And, according to the official, there are certain ways and means to solve this problem.
“The United States, together with our fleet, has the opportunity to ensure open seaways and, if necessary, blockades so that their energy does not enter the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that positions itself as the “voice of the energy consumer” in the United States.
He further compares Washington’s approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are actually the same.
“The economic strategy of Iran and Russia is more or less efficient use and replacement of fuel,” the minister said, calling Russia a “single trick” whose economy depends on fossil fuels.
The announcements were due to the fact that the Trump administration has set the task of increasing exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which offers a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to exit the “inappropriate” pipeline project “Northern Stream 2,” which, according to Trump, made Berlin a “prisoner” of Moscow.
In Moscow, it was repeatedly stressed that the project “North Stream 2” worth 11 billion dollars, which should double the existing capacity of the pipeline up to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s fierce resistance to the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I stress that we share the view that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry in Seneca.
The U.S. position triggered a negative reaction from Germany, which confirmed its commitment to the project.
German industrialists on behalf of the Federation of German Industry (BDI) called on the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“When a third country interferes in our energy supplies, it creates a serious problem,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Federation of Industry (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren Will Carefully Investigate Possibilities to Vote for President in 2020
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would carefully consider the possibility of running for president after the midterm elections.
At a meeting of the City Duma in Hollywood, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider taking part in the election race.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and ‘fix’ our broken government, and for that ‘up’ you need a woman,” Warren told The Hill.
“After November 6th, I will carefully consider the possibility of running for president.”
Warren said President Donald Trump’s activities during the meeting were “running this district in the wrong direction.”
“I’m very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren is an open critic of both Trump himself and his candidate for the post of Supreme Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted: “Of course, we need to conduct an FBI investigation before we start voting.”
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that most of Warren’s own voters do not think she should vote in 2020.
According to a poll by the University of Suffolk’s Center for Political Studies/Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts’ “probable” voters said the senator should not vote.
Thirty-two percent of respondents, on the contrary, support her plans.
The poll showed that the population is more supportive of former governor Deval Patrick: 38 percent support his possible participation in the election, and 48 percent oppose it.
Other well-known names of Democrats that were discussed in connection with the 2020 outlook include former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden says he will make the official decision by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin told about Trac Palin's post-traumatic stress disorder at a meeting with Donald Trump voters
Track Palin, 26, serving in the army in September, spent a year in Iraq.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday evening.
“My son, who has returned home, is now experiencing the same thing as other family members who are experiencing the effects of PTSD and who have been injured, and our soldiers are returning with the injuries,” she said at a meeting with Donald Trump in Talsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "a bell on the eye" and said of her son and other war veterans: "They're coming back by other, hard-on, asking if they have the same respect for their comrades, soldiers, pilots, and any other military that they've given them."
Trac Pailin was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, interfering with violence and the storage of weapons in a state of alcoholic intoxication, according to Dana Bennett, a representative of the Watsil police department.
18 States, District of Columbia, Support the Challenge of a New Asylum Policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the legal challenge of the new U.S. policy, which prohibits the provision of asylum to victims of escape or domestic violence.
According to NBC News, representatives of 18 states and districts filed an analytical note in Washington on Friday of a court consultant’s support for an asylum seeker challenging the policy.
The plaintiff’s full name in the Grace vs. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy is not disclosed.
The woman claims that her civilian husband “and his sons, who are part of a criminal group,” subjected her to cruel treatment, but on July 20, U.S. officials rejected her request for asylum.
She was arrested in Texas.
Attorneys for states that support Grace say El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala are filing a large number of asylum applications in the United States, such as countries facing widespread problems with criminal groups and domestic violence.
The new U.S. policy on asylum has reversed a 2014 decision by the Immigrant Appeals Council that allowed immigrants without documents rescuing from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The District Attorney General of Colombia, Carl Rasin, said in a statement Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of application of state, federal and international law.”
“Federal law requires that all asylum applications be considered on the basis of specific facts and circumstances of the case, and such a ban violates this principle,” the judicial advisor said in a statement.
Lawyers also argue that a policy banning immigrants is detrimental to the U.S. economy, stressing that it is this category of citizens who are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary workforce.”
In June, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sachs ordered immigration judges to stop providing asylum to victims of domestic or gang-raped violence.
“Refugee will be granted to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political beliefs,” Sashns said in a June 11 statement.
This tool has never been designed to solve absolutely all the problems, even the most serious ones that people face every day in the world.
Desperate efforts to save people in Palu: the number of dead doubles in search of survivors
For the survivors, the situation became more and more difficult.
“It’s very difficult now,” says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, comforting her sick baby in the evacuation center of the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute, ambulances bring in the wounded.
“Clean water is in great deficiency.”
Residents return to their destroyed homes, dig in wet things, and try to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals affected by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake were overloaded.
Some of the injured, including Dwight Harris, who had a fracture of the spine and shoulder, rested near the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated in the open air because they were forced to leave the room due to continued strong pressures.
He cries, recalling how a powerful earthquake destroyed a room in a hotel on the fifth floor that he shot with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time for salvation.
I think I was pushed into the rubble of the wall,” Harris told the Associated Press, explaining that his family had come to town for the wedding.
“I heard my wife yelling, asking for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and our baby.
I hope they survived and now they're all right."
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of “Attacks” Performed by “Propaganda”
A week after one of the official Chinese newspapers published a four-page ad in the daily American publication, telling of the mutual benefits of U.S. and China’s trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread the news.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the payroll supplement Des Moines Register China Daily, Iowa’s largest commercial newspaper, accusing China of trying to interfere in the U.S. Congressional elections, which will take place on Wednesday.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the U.S. election is a confirmation of the fact that U.S. officials have told Reuters: a new stage is underway in Washington’s growing campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in a state of escalation of a trade war, as a result of which they equate tariffs on their countries’ imports.
China's retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were aimed at hitting exporters in states such as Iowa who supported Trump's Republican party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former long-term governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, claims that Beijing has harmed U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, writes Branstad in an article published in the Sunday magazine Des Moines Register, “is now doubling this travesty by placing propaganda advertising in our own free press.”
“By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of our dear American tradition of freedom of speech and the free press, paying for and placing advertising in the Des Moines Register,” writes Branstad.
“However, in the newsstands here, on the streets of Beijing, you are unlikely to hear dissenting voices and not see the true diversity of opinions that the Chinese could get acquainted with when they learn about China’s disturbing economic policy,” he said, according to the report.
He also added that one of China’s most famous newspapers had “smartly waived” the offer to publish his article, although it did not include the exact title of the publication.
Analysts warn: with the diversity of Cavano Republicans reject women voters on the eve of the interim period
Many high-ranking Republicans prefer to stay sidelines and defend the candidacy of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, despite several allegations of sexual violence. Analysts warn that there may be a negative reaction here, especially by women.
Emotions around this situation have erupted to the extreme, and most Republicans have officially declared that they want to continue voting.
You can’t go back to these things later,” writes Grant Rier, a professor of political science at Maxwell School at Syracuse University, in an article published Saturday.
Rier doubts that Senator Jeff Flake’s (R-Arizona) attempts to conduct a last-minute FBI investigation will be enough to reassure angry voters.
“Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday. They will not forget about it either tomorrow or in November,” Karin Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national representative of the progressive group MoveOn, told the Washington, D.C. newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted “November ahead!” in front of the Senate, when Republicans overseeing the Judiciary Committee decided to run for Cavano, despite Dr. Christine Blaise Ford’s testimony, Mic reports.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go beyond that,” party-free politician Stu Rotenberg said on the news website.
“People say the situation has already gotten worse, and that’s true.
But things can get worse, especially in terms of women voters in the suburbs and young voters, aged 18 to 29, who, although they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford publicly testified against the candidate for the top judge’s post, accusing him of sexual harassment, analysts had suggested that if Republicans confirmed the nomination, the move could trigger a reaction.
“It’s already a mess for the Republican Party,” said Michael Styl, former chairman of the Republican National Committee earlier this week, as reported by NBC News.
“It’s not just about voting on the committee or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh sat on the bench of the defendants, but also about how Republicans deal with it, how they treat it,” said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps.
However, the Americans seem to have split a bit on who to trust — Ford or Cavano — and lean a little more toward the latter.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents believe Ford’s testimony to be accurate or likely, while 35 percent say they believe Kavanaugh to be accurate or likely to be accurate.
In addition, 38 percent believe that Cavano was most or definitely lying while giving his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
According to Flake, the FBI is currently investigating Ford’s indictments, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford under oath testified to the Senate Legal Committee that Cavano, being intoxicated, attacked her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the post of supreme judge showed her his genitals at a party while studying at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Spine plans to launch a new Internet for Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Spider, launches a startup that claims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the open platform Berners-Lee Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and what people to give access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt’s goal was to achieve “world domination.”
“We have to do it now,” he says of his start.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid technology, which allows people to create their own “personal online data repositories” or PODs.
It can contain contact lists, business, as well as a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools for working with data.
The app works on the same principle as Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify — all can be used in one browser and at the same time.
The uniqueness of the personal online data repository is that it is fully managed by the user, who can access any necessary information.
The company calls this a “personal expansion of rights and opportunities through data.”
According to John Bruce, the company’s CEO, Inrupt’s idea is that the company has provided the resources, processes, and relevant skills to make Solid available to everyone.
Currently, the company includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several full-time developers who have signed a contract to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not in talks with Facebook and Google about whether his company should make major changes, resulting in all of their business models changing in a single hour.
“We don’t ask for permission.”
In a post on Medium, published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that “the mission of Inrupt is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating a consortium of the World Wide Web at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee’s voice has sounded quite influential in debates about net neutrality.
Even launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Internet Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this next era of the Internet,” says Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: a clergyman awarded the Victoria Cross during the First World War
In the history of the Anglican Church, only one warrior priest was awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I, and this event was celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lt. Col. Bernard Vann was awarded this award on 29 September 1918 for his participation in the attack on Bellenglish and Loucourt.
Unfortunately, he was killed by a sniper four days later, so never knowing that he received the highest British military award.
The monument in honor of this event was solemnly unveiled by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was “very symbolic” that the monument was opened exactly 100 years after his grandfather received the award.
According to the London Newspaper of September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann conducted his battalion through the Saint-Canten canal “in a very thick fog and under strong fire of field guns and machine guns.”
Later he threw himself on the line of fire and with the "greatest courage" led the group forward, and then with one hand dropped the field rifle, shooting down three soldiers of the unit.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
The 72-year-old grandson of the hero, Michael Vann, said that “he would hardly have been able to do the same heroically, but that’s humiliating.”
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid the wreath at the end of the parade, which was led by the Imperial Brentwood Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann said that “it is a great honor for him to take part in the parade” and added that “the bravery of a true hero is confirmed by the support that will be provided by many people.”
MMA fans didn’t sleep all night to watch the Bellator 206, but instead showed them Peppa’s pig.
Imagine that you didn’t sleep all night to watch the full Bellator 206, but you weren’t allowed to see the main event.
The San Jose table contained 13 battles, including six of the main program, and the battles were broadcast live throughout the night on the UK's 5th television channel.
At six o’clock in the morning, when Gegard Musassi and Rory McDonald were preparing for the meeting, fans in the UK were stunned to see the Peppa Pig on screen.
Some fans were not impressed at all, because they did not sleep until the morning just to watch the fights.
One of the fans on Twitter called this change of broadcast to a children's cartoon "some sick joke."
“There was a state decree that this content was inappropriate for 6 a.m., so they had to switch to children’s programs,” said Dave Schwarz, senior vice president of Bellator marketing and communications, when asked why it happened.
"Yes, "Peppa Pig."
Bellator President Scott Cocker said they plan to make a schedule so that viewers from the UK can also watch the fight in the future.
“As for the replay, I think we’ll be able to resolve this issue,” Cocker said.
“But there is Sunday, six o’clock in the morning, and we will not be able to resolve this issue until Sunday at our own time, and for them it will be Monday.
But we will make the most of it.
Believe me, when the broadcast was changed, a bunch of text messages burst, and all of them were far from friendly.
We tried to solve this problem right away, thought it was some kind of technical failure.
It turned out that no, it was a matter of state importance.
I promise I won't do that next time.
We’re going to reduce the number of fights to five instead of six, as we usually do, and for the fans we’re trying to increase that number, but it’s overrun.
Yes, it didn’t work well.”
Previous articleDesert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feeling Imperfection Due to His Sexual Orientation
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling worse because of his sexuality, but that’s what gave him the motivation to be successful.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize that “not everyone is like him” until he went to high school.
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs program, led by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about gay rights to give others “hope.”
He also said that winning the Olympics began to worry him less after he had a child.
Kirsty Young, the show’s long-runner, took a few months off due to illness.
Dale, who played the lead guest on Laverne's show, said he felt "more worthless than any of his peers" because his sexual orientation was considered unacceptable to society for both boys and girls.
“To this day, these feelings of nothingness and insignificance were quite real, but they gave me strength, and I was able to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was "something" so as not to disappoint everyone when they finally learn about his sexual orientation.
The two-time bronze Olympic medalist became a well-known LGBT activist and at his speech at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year called on countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he expressed his opinion because he was lucky that he was able to live an open life without consequences and wanted to give others “hope.”
The three-time world champion said feelings for the man, American director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, “were a surprise to him.”
Last year, Daley married an Oscar winner who is 20 years older than him, but claims that the age difference was never a problem.
“If so much is happening in your life at such a young age,” he went to his first Olympics at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later, “it is difficult to find a peer who would have the same cardinally opposite life experience.
The couple became parents in June, they had a son named Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Daley said that “his whole worldview” had changed.
“If you asked me last year, it would be all about ‘I need to win a gold medal,’” he said.
“But you know what, there are things and more importantly the Olympic gold medals.
“My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not want to accept the fact that he was dying, and one of his last requests was for first-row tickets to the London 2012 competition.
“I couldn’t say to him, ‘Dad, you won’t be around then, and you won’t be able to sit there in the first row,’” Daley says.
“I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing, and it was only when he actually stopped breathing that I finally realized that he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year Daley participated in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
“I just knew that it was what I had dreamed of all my life — diving in front of a crowd of compatriots at the Olympics, there was no better feeling,” he said.
It also inspired him to choose his first favorite song — Proud by Heather Small — which helped him prepare for the Olympics and he still likes it so much.

Michaelson, not in shape, spent this Saturday's Ryder Cup on the bench
American Phil Michaelson will set a record on Sunday, playing his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to lift his form to avoid an unpleasant hurdle.
Michaelson, who played at the Biennale for the record 12th time, was sent by Captain Jim Furick on Saturday for four balls and fours.
Instead of being at the center of events, as was often the case in the United States, a five-time big winner divided his day between watching the game and working on his own game on the field in hopes of fixing what bothers him.
Never having the most direct hit, even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old athlete is not the perfect candidate for the tough Le Golf National, where a long rack usually punishes for inaccurate hits.
And if the course itself isn’t scary enough, Michaelson will meet the exact British Open champion Francesco Molinari in the ninth game on Sunday, who teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans, who lost four points in 12 and singles games, make a fierce start, Michaelson’s game could be decisive.
Ferrick expressed confidence in his partner, though what else he could have said.
“He fully understood the role that was put on him today, stabbed me in the back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Ferric said.
“He’s pretty confident in himself.
He's a walking Hall of Fame, and he's done so much for these teams, both last week and this week.
I didn’t think he would play two games.
I was hoping for more, but it was, and that's how we decided to go.
He wants to be there with everyone.”
On Sunday, Michelson will beat Nick Foldo's record for the number of games in the Rider Cup.
This could mark the end of his career in the Ryder Cup, which never matched the heights of his individual record.
Michaelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats, and seven zeros, though Ferrick said his presence has brought the team a great deal of benefit.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, smart, likes to start people, and he’s a great guy that’s interesting,” he explained.
“I think this week the young players were having fun with him, and it was interesting to see.
His game is much more than just a game.”
The captain of the European team, Thomas Bjorn, knows that the big advantage could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from his experience that significant leadership in the singles in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an unfavorable one.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrame, where the team led by Severiano Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but overcame the finish line just a little bit ahead of 14-2 with the lowest 13-point difference.
“You keep reminding yourself that we had a big advantage at Walderram; we had a big advantage at Brooklyn, where we lost, and at Walderram, where we just won, but just so far,” Bjorn said in a photo of the “Golf”, after viewing the “Le 3” class of 2018.
So the story will prove to me and the whole team that it's not over yet.
You'll be in full tomorrow.
Go and do everything right.
As long as the glasses are not on the board – nothing is finished yet.
We have a goal, and that’s a chance to win a trophy, and that’s what we need to focus on.
I said quietly, focusing on the 12 players of our team, but we know so well that what we stand against is against the greatest players in the world.”
Satisfied with how his players performed on an inconvenient golf course for them, Bjorn added: “I would never have surpassed myself in that.
We have another test tomorrow.
Tomorrow is the beginning of individual speeches, and this is a completely different matter.
It’s always nice to be around your partner when things are going well, but when you’re there alone, you experience all your strengths as a professional golfer.
This is exactly what the players need to think about, so that tomorrow will be full.
Now the partner is behind, and he has to do his best.”
Unlike Bjorn, his rival, Jim Ferrick, believes that his players will perform better individually than with their partners, except for Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Ferric himself has gone through all this carousel of the last few days, becoming part of the winning team in Brooklyn before finally losing when Europe held the Miracle in the Medina.
“I remember every damn word about it,” he said in response to a question about how Ben Cranshaw, captain in 1999, put his players together before the last day.
“We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you’d like to finish it faster, both in Brooklyn and in Medina.
When the initiative moves in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the matches in the middle.
We’ve built our game plan accordingly and set the guys up the way we thought they were right, you know? Tomorrow we’ll try to do a miracle.”
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the resistance by meeting Rory McIlroy in the top-match with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Polter, as well as other European top-tier players.
“I chose that kind of group of guys, and in that order, because I believe that this way they will cover all possible drawbacks,” Bjorn said, commenting on his selection of individual players.
The commissioning of a new German warship has been postponed.
The newest frigate of the German navy was to be put into operation in 2014 to replace the aging warships of the Cold War era, but this will not happen any less next year due to faulty systems and avalanche-like growth in costs.
The entry into service of Rheinland-Pfalz, the main ship of the completely new frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, reports Die Zeit newspaper citing a military representative.
The ship was due to join the fleet in 2014, but the problems that arose after the delivery complicated the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships ordered by the navy in 2007 will be replaced by the old Bremen-class frigates.
As far as we know, they will have a powerful gun, a lot of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technologies — such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer service periods – it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years away from home ports.
However, the constant postponement of entry into service means that the most modern warships, which are said to allow Germany to spread its power abroad, are already outdated by the time they come into service, Die Zeit notes.
The unfortunate F125 frigate hit the headlines last year when the German navy officially refused to enter service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the fleet returned the ship to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but the German media referred to a number of critical "software and hardware defects" that made the warship useless when used in combat.
The shortcomings of the software were particularly critical, as the Baden-Württemberg-class ships would be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors — only half of the workforce on the old Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it turned out that the ship is too heavy, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the Navy to implement upgrades in the future.
It is believed that the 7000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is twice as heavy as ships of a similar class, which were used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty equipment, the cost of the entire project, including team training, is also becoming a problem.
It is said to have reached an astonishing 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) compared to the original 2.2 billion euros.
The problems of holding the newest frigates are becoming especially important in the light of recent warnings about the reduction of Germany’s naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German parliament’s defense committee, admitted that the navy is actually “ending stock of ships capable of deployment.”
The official said the problem over time had escalated because the old ships had been withdrawn from operation, but they had no replacement ships.
He possessed that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class could ever be taken up by the navy.
The National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
A new study, conducted in one of the Scottish Hills, aims to show how bats use the landscape in search of food.
It should be hoped that the data obtained will allow a new look at the behavior of unique winged mammals and help in further activities to preserve the species.
The study, organized by scientists from the National Foundation of Scotland, will study ordinary non-powder, non-powder soprano, as well as brown long-haired bats and Dobanton nights inhabiting Inverewe Gardens, Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be installed at some points around the site to track the actions of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile field surveys using handheld detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of screams, as well as the types of activities for which different groups of these animals are responsible.
A habitat map will then be drawn up and a report will be prepared to create a detailed picture of their behavior on a landscape scale.
Rob Dewear, an NTS Nature Conservation Advisor, hopes these results will show which habitats are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the main areas of work on habitat management, such as meadow formation, as well as ways to maintain the forest massifs in a state optimal for bats and other related species.
Populations of bats in Scotland and across the UK have declined significantly over the past century.
They are at risk of disappearance due to construction and development work, which affect their habitat and the loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting installations can pose a danger as well as adhesive tape for flies, chemical processing of building materials and hunting of domestic cats.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, their night hunting habits are such that their ears are more useful than the eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use complex echo-location techniques to accurately identify obstacles in the way of flight.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, is very serious about bat population issues.
The organization employs ten trained experts, who regularly conduct surveys, outbound checks, and sometimes rescue work.
The organization even created Scotland’s first and only reservation of bats at the Thrave estate in Damfries and Galloway, home to eight of the ten species of Scottish bats.
Real estate manager David Thompson says the property is the perfect territory for them.
“Here in Thrave, it’s a great place for bats,” he says.
“There are old buildings, many old trees and all the elements of a good living environment.
But much remains unknown about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need for a healthy existence.”
It recalls the importance of checking the presence of bats before carrying out maintenance within private property, since the accidental destruction of one nest can lead to the death of up to 400 females and young individuals, and possibly even the destruction of the entire local population.
Flying mice are protected by law, their destruction, harassment or destruction of their habitat is illegal.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish officer at the Flea Conservation Foundation, is calling on the public to help.
She says: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we just don’t know how many of their individual species live.”
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape, and his lawyers are going to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo denies accusations of rape against him, calling them “fake news,” and claiming that people simply “want to spy” using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German news magazine "Spiegel", which published the accusations against the footballer.
Forward of Portugal and Juventus was accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Majorga, who allegedly took place in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to talk about the incident, Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking in an Instagram video in which the footballer has 142 million followers, hours after the allegations were reported, 33-year-old Ronaldo called the information “fake news.”
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is all fake news, claims the five-time winner of the Ballon d’Or on camera.
“They just want to be pissed off using my name.
That's okay.
They want to be famous, my name says, but that's just part of their job.
I’m a happy person, and I have everything great,” adds the athlete with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue the Spiegel for charges they have called “inadmissible information about suspicions of confidentiality,” according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player intends to seek compensation for “moral damages in the amount corresponding to the seriousness of the legal violation, which is likely to be one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years.”
It is alleged that the alleged incident occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
Having met at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga reportedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her in anal form, according to documents filed in Clark County Court in Nevada.
Majorga claims that after the alleged incident, Ronaldo fell to her knees in front of her and told her that he was “a 99 percent good guy, but he fell by one percent.”
The documents say that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but it was by mutual agreement.
Mayorga also claims that she turned to the police and the hospital took pictures of her injuries, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt “fear of revenge” and was afraid of “public humiliation.”
A 34-year-old woman says she is now trying to change her place of residence as she continues to experience the traumatic feelings caused by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United during the alleged attack, but this summer he switched to Italian giants Juve in a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal.
Brexit: Britain 'will regret the car makers who have been lost forever'
Business and Entrepreneurial Affairs Minister Greg Clark said the UK would "forever regret it" if it lost its status as a world leader in automotive manufacturing after Brexit.
He also commented on the information that Toyota UK informed the BBC that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, it will temporarily stop production at its plant in Bernaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” says Mr. Clark.
The Japanese automaker said the consequences of delays at the border in the absence of a Brexit deal could lead to a loss of jobs.
The factory in Bernastone produces Toyota Auris and Avensis, and last year it produced almost 150,000 cars, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I believe that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our factory will be stopped,” said Marvin Cook, CEO of Toyota in Bernaston.
Other carmakers in the UK have voiced concerns about leaving the EU without an international trade agreement, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini production plant in Oxford within a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are that, according to automakers, in the absence of a deal within the Brexit supply chain will be put at great risk.
Toyota’s production line is launched “exactly on time” and parts for custom-made cars are supplied by UK and EU suppliers every 37 minutes.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be breakdowns at the border, which, according to industry representatives, could lead to delays and a shortage of spare parts.
According to the company, Toyota will not be able to store supplies at its plant in Derbyshire for more than one day, and therefore production will be stopped.
Mr Clark said Theresa May’s plan for future relations with the EU, voiced in Chequers, was “exactly calibrated to avoid these border checks.”
“We need a deal. We want to make a better deal that will allow, I repeat, not only to succeed now, but also to take advantage of this opportunity in the future,” he told BBC Radio 4 Today.
“Not only Toyota, but also other manufacturers say that we must be absolutely able to continue successful supply chains.”
Toyota has not been able to specify how long the production will be halted, but has warned in the longer term that additional costs will reduce the plant’s competitiveness and ultimately lead to job cuts.
Peter Tsuvallaris, who has worked in Bernaston for 24 years and is the head of the trade union of the plant, says, the concern of the members of the organization is growing: “In my experience, if we lose these jobs, we will no longer be able to get them back.”
The government representative said: “We have developed a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU.”
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, according to the White House
Donald Trump’s responsible meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “transferred to another week” as the fight for Brett Kavanaugh’s candidacy for the post of top judge continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Müller, who is investigating Russia’s interference in the election, the ties between Trump and Russia’s aides and potential obstacles to justice by the president.
Whether Trump would fire the deputy attorney general, thereby jeopardizing Mueller’s independence, has sparked a lot of speculation in Washington for many months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the use of wires to record talks with Trump and the possibility of impeachment of the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein disproves this information.
However, on Monday, he went to the White House allegedly in order to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the UN in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he "would prefer not" to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid clashes with the Senate Judiciary Committee, which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christina, Blaise Flaherty.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weekly investigation into FBI complaints about Kavanaugh, which further delayed the full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, spoke on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about a meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The date of this meeting has not yet been set, perhaps this week, and perhaps it will be postponed for another week, taking into account all the other events taking place in the Supreme Court.”
But let’s see, and I always prefer to keep the press informed.”
Some journalists dispute this claim: Sanders has not held briefings at the White House since September 10.
The leader, Chris Wallace, wondered why.
Sanders says the absence of briefings is not caused by “disregard to the community” of television reporters, although she added: “I won’t deny that they play in public.”
She proposed to increase the number of direct contacts between Trump and the press.
“The president holds more meetings answering questions from journalists than any other president before him,” she added, adding, however, “we have these numbers.”
Sanders assured that the briefings would still be held, but “if the press has the opportunity to directly ask questions to the President of the United States, it’s much better than talking to me.”
“We’re trying to do this as often as possible, and you know how many meetings we’ve had over the last few weeks, and if you can talk directly to the President of the United States, it’s a worthy replacement for press briefings.”
Trump regularly answers questions by leaving the White House, taking part in open meetings or press conferences with high-ranking officials.
Conferences exclusively for the press are a rarity.
The free-willed, and sometimes strange, behavior of the president in front of journalists gathered this week in New York may be the answer to why it is so.
The Minister of Health addresses EU workers in Scotland with a letter on concerns about Brexit <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The health minister appealed to EU officials working in the Scottish GSZ to express gratitude from the country’s estate and wish them to remain in their posts after Brexit.
Gene Freeman, MSP, addressed the letter to staff less than six months before Britain’s exit from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already undertaken to cover the cost of filing status applications for EU citizens working in its public services.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman writes: “During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the issue of exit have continued, and an expected decision should be made this fall.
However, the UK government is also stepping up its preparations for a possible scenario with no deals.
I know this must be a very alarming time for all of you.
That is why I want to emphasize once again how much I appreciate the contribution of each employee, regardless of his or her nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the healthcare service and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home, and we really want you to stay here.”
Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery for head injury
Michael Organ of Tennessee reported that the Tennessee State Tigers midfielder Christian Abercrombie underwent an emergency operation, having suffered a head injury on Saturday after a 31–27 defeat to Vanderbilt Commodores.
Tennessee head coach Rod Reid told reporters that the injury was sustained shortly before the break.
“He went out to the sideline and just collapsed there,” Reid said.
Trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sidelines before putting it on the carriers and taking it for medical examination.
A Tennessee state official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been operated on at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “there is no details about the type/degree of the injury,” and in Tennessee they are trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
For Abercrombie, who only came in second grade, it was the first season of Tennessee State after moving out of Illinois.
On Saturday, before leaving the game, he successfully intercepted five balls, a total of 18 balls per season.
Foreign buyers will pay a higher coat of arms fee when buying a property in the UK.
According to Tori’s new plans, foreign buyers will be charged a higher coat of arms fee when buying real estate in the UK, and the additional funds earned will be used to help the homeless.
This step will reduce the results of Corbyn’s attempts to attract young voters
The increased coat of arms fee will be charged to those who do not pay tax in the UK
The Treasury expects it to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year in favor of the homeless
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher coat of arms fee when buying real estate in the UK, and the extra money raised will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May announced today.
This move will reduce the results of Corbyn’s attempts to attract young voters, who promise to make housing more accessible and increase citizens’ incomes.
The increase in the coat of arms will be charged to individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the additional funds thus made should stimulate the government’s efforts to provide assistance to homeless citizens.
The addition to the existing coat of arms fee, including the increase introduced two years ago for the purchase of secondary housing and housing for rent, could amount to up to three per cent.
The Treasury expects this move to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of new London properties are purchased by non-British residents, which leads to price increases and complicates the task for buyers who purchase their first home to improve their housing conditions subsequently.
Many of the country’s elite areas, especially in the capital, have become “ghost cities” because of the large number of foreign buyers who, buying housing here, spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy was developed weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the coat of arms collection to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction firms of staggering property prices by acquiring land but not actually using it, and called on Ms. May to abandon quotas for affordable housing in order to correct the “shameful housing situation” in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn announced a number of proposed positive housing reforms, which would include controlling rents and ending unwarranted evictions.
It also wants to give local self-government authorities more powers to build new homes.
May said: “Last year, I said that I had dedicated my premiere to fulfilling the British dream – that life would be better with every new generation.
And this, among other things, means solving problems in our housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build life here.
However, it is unfair that for people who are not UK citizens, as well as for foreign companies, the acquisition of real estate is as affordable as it is for hardworking British people.
For too many people, the dream of buying their own home has become too far away, and the threat to some to be on the street is too real.
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to run Scotland"
Sunderland club boss Jack Ross says his “final goal” is to become Scotland’s manager at a certain stage.
The 42-year-old Scot enjoys a revival of the Northeastern club, which currently takes third place in the first league, separating from the championship by three points.
This summer he moved to the Stadium of Light after returning St Mirren to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to fight for my country as a player.
I got a B hat, and that's all," Ross Sportsound told BBC Scotland.
“But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampshire as a child with my father, and that always drew me back.
However, this opportunity will only come if I can become a successful manager of the club.”
Ross' predecessors, Sunderland's managers were also Dick Lawyer, David Moyes, Sam Allardyes, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keen, Gas Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic manager says he has not experienced a tremor before such reputable names in such large clubs, having previously declined offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“For me, success at the moment will depend on whether I can bring this club back to the Premier League.
In terms of its structure and capabilities, this club undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League,” says the coach.
“It’s not an easy task to get him there, but I’m going to think he’s done his job, only if I can get the club back.”
Ross worked as a manager for just three years, first becoming an assistant manager at Dumbarton, then spending 15 months at the Hearts coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa climb from the third level and the following season brought St Mirren out of the bottom positions in the championship winners.
Ross claims he feels more comfortable today than ever during his playing careers at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“It was probably a real crossroads,” he recalls his responsible work at Alloa.
“I truly believed that management was more appropriate for me than a game.
It sounds strange because I did everything well, made good money in this position and achieved certain successes.
But the game is more complicated.
There are a lot of things that need to be done weekly.
I still feel stressful at work, but I feel good at the managerial position.
I’ve always wanted to lead, and now, by doing so, I feel most comfortable like a fish in the water throughout my adult life.”
You can listen to the full interview on Sportsound on Sunday, September 30, on Scotland Radio from 12:00 to 13:00 English Summer Time.
According to the results of the survey, 17:30 is the perfect time for a pint of beer
The summer heat has led to increased sales of British pubs, but has lowered sales in restaurant chains.
According to statistics, sales in pubs and bars in July increased by 2.7%, and in restaurants fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin of the business consulting company CGA, which received this statistic, says: “Long-term solar activity, as well as longer than expected, England’s participation in the World Cup is a rebound of 8% in the rebounds in July, followed the trend of the previous month, in June, when sales.
The June decline in revenues in restaurant trade by 1.8% continued also in July.
Pubs and bars selling alcohol showed much higher results comparable to those in restaurants.
Pubs selling only food also suffered from the heat of the sun, although not as much as restaurants.
There is a feeling that people want to jump out on the street just to miss a glass.
Sales of beverages in pubs and bars increased by 6.6% per month, and food by 3%.
Paul Newman, RSM’s leisure and hotel business analyst, said: “These results continue the trend we’ve been following since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of large social or sporting events remain the most important factors when it comes to sales in the non-profit market.
It is not surprising that restaurant networks continue to experience difficulties, especially since a 4.8 percent annual drop in sales will be particularly painful due to the ongoing price pressure.
A long, hot summer has never been the case for operators working with food, and it is not yet the fact that August, bringing more moderate temperatures, will give the much-needed rest.”
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including reopenings, in July was 2.7 percent, reflecting a slowdown in brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker’s industry sales monitoring across the UK pubs, bars and restaurants sector collects and analyzes performance data from 47 networks with a total turnover of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion and is a recognized industry benchmark.
One in five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
According to the results of the survey, one in five children — some of them just 11 years old — have secret social media accounts that they hide from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the growth of the pages of “fake insta”
This news has heightened concerns about sexual content.
Twenty percent of students say they have a “basic” account that their parents know about.
However, one in five children — some of them just 11 years old — create social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in the number of fake accounts «insta» — i.e. Instagram, a website for sharing photos.
This news has heightened concerns about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a basic, “clean” account that their parents had access to, but there were also secret accounts.
One mother, who accidentally accessed her 13-year-old daughter’s secret account, ran into a teenager who called on others to “rape him.”
A study by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Independent Directors of Schools (HMC) found that 40 percent of children between the ages of 11 and 18 have two profiles on social networks, with half of them admitting that one of them is usually secret.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, said: “Many teens are trying to create online spaces that are inaccessible to their parents and teachers, and that’s a worrying fact.”
Elyde Doyle will become the voice of Scottish athletics athletes
At the annual general meeting of the governing body, Eilid Doyle was elected to the board of directors of Scottish Athletics as an observer member of the board of directors.
Doyle is Scotland’s most titled athlete in light athletics. Chairman Ian Bitty claims that this step is a great opportunity for those who lead the sport to take advantage of the extensive experience of the athlete at the international level over the past decade.
"Elyde has great respect in the Scottish, British and global athletic community, and we are confident that her participation will bring tremendous benefits to lightweight athletics in Scotland," said Betty.
Doyle says: “I strive to be the voice of the athletes, and I hope that I can make a really good contribution and contribute to the development of the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Games in Atlanta, has a total of four gold Olympic medals, and now works as a regular commentator on the BBC after a stroke he lost his ability to walk.
He tweeted: “I had a stroke a month ago.
I lost the ability to move.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I'm going to fix it, and if so, to what extent.
It was exhausting work, but I was completely healed, I learned to walk again and today I do exercises for agility!
Thank you so much for your support!”
The advertisement of milk suction, in which feeding mothers compared to cows, divided the opinions of Internet users
The dairy company has sparked controversy on the Internet by posting an advertisement there, in which feeding mothers are compared to dairy cows.
Released on the market, as they say, “the world’s first noiseless milksucker to be worn on the chest,” consumer technology company Elvie has released an advertising music video demonstrating the freedom that the new milksucker provides to the breasts.
Four real moms dance in a haystack under a music track with the words: “Yes, I feed my own milk, but you won’t see my tail” and “If you haven’t noticed it, it’s my breast.”
And then the choir goes on to say, “We suck, we suck, we suck, we suck, we suck, we suck, we suck, we suck, we suck, we suck, we suck, we suck, we suck, we suck, we suck, we suck, we suck, we suck, we suck, we suck, we suck, we suck, we suck, we suck, we suck, we suck, we suck, we suck.”
This promotional video, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, sparked controversy on the Internet.
77,000 views and hundreds of comments: The video received ambiguous response from viewers, with many saying it sheds light on the “horror” of the dairy industry.
“It’s a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are taken from them within a few days after birth,” writes one user.
Milk Sauce Elvie is dressed directly under a special bra (Elvie/Mother)
But another comment: “Obviously, it’s just as traumatic for both mothers and children.
But yes, why not use them to advertise milk soda for mothers who leave their children to themselves? "
Another user adds: “Advertising is detached from reality.”
Others, on the contrary, defended the film, and one woman even wrote that the song was “just great.”
“I think it’s a great idea.
If I were to feed the baby, I would definitely buy one.
Breastfeeding actually made me feel like a cow.
Advertisement, of course, is a bit shaky, but that’s about how it feels.
It’s a great product,” one user wrote.
And another comment: “Funny advertising designed for moms who breastfeed (often they do it right in their workplaces or in the toilets) and who, indeed, feel a little bit “cows.”
“This advertising is not to praise or insult our dairy industry,” he said.
At the end of the video, a group of women showed that they were all dancing with these imperceptible milk suckers hidden under their bras.
The concept of this advertising campaign is based on the fact that many breastfeeding women say they feel like cows.
In fact, Elvie's milk sauce is absolutely intact, has no wires or tubes, is freely placed in the breastfeeding bra, and at the same time inconspicuous, allowing women to move around, keep babies and even go out during feeding.
Ana Ballarin, partner and early childhood development specialist at Mother, comments: “Elvie’s milk sauce is such a revolutionary product that it deserves bold and provocative advertising.
In parallel between women and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on breastfeeding and all its problems, while demonstrating in a funny and fun way the incredible sense of freedom that gives the new milk sauce.
This isn’t the first time Elvie’s milk sauce gets into the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the podium of designer Martha Yakubovskaya, using this product for the intended purpose.
Hundreds of migrant children move unhindered to tent camp on Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has risen sharply, although the number of monthly border crossings remained relatively unchanged, in part because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to place children in the hands of contractors.
Usually, most sponsors themselves are the same immigrants who do not have documents and are afraid to endanger their stay in the country by taking over the custody of the child.
The risk rose in June, when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their families would have to provide fingerprints and that this data would be passed on to the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Olbens, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Service, testified in Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had asked to take care of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had not been convicted before.
“About 80 per cent of persons who are either guardians or members of their families are in the country illegally, and a significant proportion of them are foreigners who have committed a crime.
That’s why we continue to persecute these people,” Albens said.
According to shelter workers, in an effort to speed up the process of children’s registration, officials have introduced new rules that require some of them to appear in court within a month of detention rather than 60 days as before.
To declare their legal status as an immigration judge, many of them are present on video, not in person.
Those who are deemed to have no right to help will be deported quickly.
According to shelter workers and information workers who have appeared in the system in recent months, the longer children remain in detention, the more likely they are to develop anxiety or depression, which can lead to outbreaks of violence or attempts to escape.
Lawyers say these problems are aggravating in larger institutions such as Tornillo, where signs that the child is experiencing difficulties are more likely to be ignored due to the size of the institution.
They add that if you move children to tent camps without giving them time to emotionally prepare for it or say goodbye to friends, it can exacerbate the injury that many of them are already struggling with.
Syria orders U.S., France, and Turkey to withdraw troops immediately
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid al-Mualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the country’s eighth year of war.
Mualem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and would “be treated accordingly.”
“They have to leave immediately and without any conditions,” he told the gathering.
Mualem insists that in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have been driven out of their homes, “the war on terrorism is almost over.”
He said Damascus would continue to “lead this sacred battle until we clear all Syrian territories” from terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has deployed some 2,000 troops in Syria, which mainly train and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
The French contingent has more than 1,000 soldiers in the war-torn country.
As for the refugees, Mualem said that good conditions had been created for their return, and accused “some Western countries” of “spreading irrational fears” that prompted refugees to stay outside the country.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to promote the return of citizens,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union are warning that Syria will not be assisted in the recovery until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a buffer zone in the last major siege of the rebels in Idlib provided an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
However, Mualem stressed that the agreement had “clear deadlines” and expressed hope that military action would be directed against jihadists, including against militants from the Al-Qaeda-linked Nusra front, who “will be destroyed.”
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee, which will include government and opposition representatives, in order to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Mualem set out the terms of the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, saying that the Commission’s work should be limited by “reviewing the articles of the current constitution” and warnings against interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
Following this logic, Mr. Trump will win the re-election in 2020, if the impeachment and scandal do not prematurely end his presidency, and that is what many liberal viewers are probably hoping for.
And this will undoubtedly be “the most dramatic end of the presidency in history!”
At the moment, there are no signs of tiredness of viewers.
Since 2014, the prime-time ratings have more than doubled – to 1.05 million on CNN and almost tripled – to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and the MSNBC show "The Rachel Maddow Show" surpassed the ratings of cable channels, collecting 3.5 million viewers from the screens.
“It’s a fire that people are drawn to because it’s outside of our understanding,” said Neil Burer, director of ABC’s Nominated Survivor, about a cabinet member who becomes president after the Capitol is destroyed as a result of the attack.
Nell Scowell, long-published comedy writer and author of “Just Funny: Some Unpleasant Truths About Penetrating the Hollywood Boys’ Club,” offers another theory.
She recalls how she once drove a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The taxi driver told her he would vote for Mr. Trump.
“Why?” she asked.
He said, “Yes, because he’s funny!” said Mrs. Scowell.
In all this chaos there is something valuable - it's fun.
Of course, unlike all the other content broadcast on television, the storylines on the events of Washington can determine the future of “Roy vs. Wade” and answer questions about the possibility of reunification of immigrant families and the health of the world economy.
Exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, when you've been writing for the sixth hour in a row, you see a group of experts discussing Bob Woodward's use of a "deep background" for his book "Fear," or about Paul Manafort's jacket for $15,000, it's a stroller, a stroller (clothes, insulated pride), or a stroller.
I’ll never look at Super Mario again with the same eyes.
“Partly his job is to make us feel like the reality show is that he feeds you something every night,” says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the N.P.A.P.L. show.
You can’t afford to miss a single episode, or you’re hopelessly lagging behind.
When I contacted Mr. Flays this week, there was 27 degrees of warmth on the north coast of Kauai, the sun was shining, but he was hiding inside his house and watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn’t get off the screen, at least not exactly when they show Brett Kavanaugh standing before the Senate Legal Committee and deciding the Supreme Court’s future.
“I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows, people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Mr. Flays said.
“Then I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Outsourcing money is pouring into the harshest midterm elections that the White House is running
Not surprisingly, the 17th District of Pennsylvania is getting a cash flow thanks to a change in the congressional districts in which two officials compete in the race for the same place.
This suburban area of Pittsburgh, whose geography has not been changed so long ago, is backed by a Democrat, a member of the House of Representatives, Conor Lamb, who won a seat in another district in an emergency election last spring.
Lamb opposes another current official, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who is currently representing the old 12th District of Pennsylvania, which is significantly intersecting with the new 17th.
The maps were revised after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that, as a result of pre-election machinations, the old areas were in violation of the Constitution.
The race in the new 17th district has sparked a heated discussion about funding campaigns between the main party’s financial forces — the Congressional Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamba's name came to prominence in Pennsylvania after a small victory in the March special election in Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
This place has been occupied by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the county by 20 points.
Politicians have given Democrats a small advantage.
The United States punished El Salvador for its support of China, but then resigned
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, which has triggered a negative reaction from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump held a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela. His property was also in Panama until the partners evacuated the Trump organization’s management team.
Representatives of the State Department have decided to withdraw U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to “recent decisions on Taiwan’s non-recognition,” the department’s spokeswoman said earlier this month.
However, the possibility of punishment was only considered for El Salvador, which received about $140 million in US aid in 2017, including for drug control, economic development, and support.
The proposed sanctions, including reductions in financial assistance and targeted restrictions on visa issuance, would be painful for the Central American country with its high levels of unemployment and murder.
Against the background of the regular internal meetings, representatives of North and Central America postponed the high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which was to be held in front of the meeting in order to present the results of a similar meeting, which took place last year.
However, by mid-September, senior administration officials had made it clear that they wanted the preparation of the conference to continue, and had effectively discontinued consideration of the issue of the punishment of El Salvador.
According to diplomats, the conference is scheduled for mid-October, and Vice President Mike Pence will address it as a sign that the administration attaches real importance to this meeting.
Three U.S. diplomatic representatives have safely returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without carrying any new tough messages or sanctions from Washington, D.C.
The representative of the White House, Mr. Bolton, declined to comment on the details of the debates told by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss domestic issues subject to anonymity.
Their reports are confirmed by a third-party analyst, who entered the administration’s circle, but also spoke on conditions of anonymity.
Learn the history.
The next step could be the message of Special Adviser Robert Müller about the possible impediment of Mr. Trump’s justice, of which there is currently very substantial evidence in the public reports.
Mr. Mueller is also reportedly beginning an investigation into the facts of the Trump campaign’s conspiracy with Russia and its attacks in the past elections.
If Congress changes the host, Mr. Trump will be held accountable in this body, just as he is preparing to speak again to the voters, and perhaps ultimately to the jury from among his colleagues.
But there is a lot of “if”; I don’t want to say that Mr. Trump’s fall is inevitable, as well as the fall of his equivalents in Europe.
We will all make a choice on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect the duration of the struggle.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup d'état and overthrow Hitler, and this would have happened if the West had resisted him and supported Czechoslovak troops in Munich.
However, we did not do so, and thus missed the opportunity to avoid the following years of bloodshed.
The course of history unfolds precisely at such points, and the unrelenting march of democracy is accelerating or delaying.
Americans are experiencing some of these moments of change now.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult situation since, according to the newspaper, last year he offered to make secret records of the president’s activities and discussed his unfitness for office.
Mr. Rosenstein argues that the Times' data is inaccurate.
“How will we respond if the FBI’s recently requested investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or true, or if he is still confirmed to be a senior judge despite the credible allegations of sexual harassment and lying?”
And first of all, are we going to vote in the medium term for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we do not pass these tests properly, this winter will be too long for democracy.
But I believe that we will be able to pass them with dignity thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew, sent to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime whose officials once occupied the embassy in which I lived many years later.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later led me to light Saturday candles on a table with a swastika symbol.
With a family past like this, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is optimistic ahead of a clash with the Viennese football club Rapid.
The Rangers take on the Vienna Rapid on Thursday, knowing that a victory over the Austrians, after an impressive draw in Spain over the Villarreal earlier this month, will allow them to take strong positions in the Group G of the Europa League.
The knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his debut for the first time in the season with a 2–2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers could use the result as a tramp to achieve great results.
“It was a good moment for us because Villarreal is a good team,” said the 31-year-old.
“We got into the game thinking we could get something, and we left with nothing.
Maybe in the end, we could do it, but overall, nobody was probably a fair result.
They probably played better in the first half, and our success came in the second half, where we showed ourselves better.
There will be another big European night on Thursday.
“I hope we can get three points, but it’s going to be a tough game because they showed a good result in their last game, but given the support of the fans, I’m sure we’ll be able to move forward and get a positive result.
“Last year was definitely tough, given everything that has to do with my injuries and the replacements at the club itself, but now there is a good factor in this place.
The composition is perfectly selected, and the guys really enjoy it; the workouts went on the “hura”.
I hope we can move forward, leave the past season behind, and achieve success.”
Women Lose Sleep for Fear of Their Retirement Savings
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few spoke about it with their family members.
About half of the people who participated in the nationwide study said they discussed with their spouses the cost of long-term care.
However, only 10 percent said they talked about it with their children.
“People want to be taken care of by some family member, but they’re not trying to talk to them about it,” says Holly Snyder, Vice President of Life Insurance Nationwide.
And we have to start with that.
Talk to your spouse and children: you can’t prepare your family for what they’ll probably have to take care of you if you don’t voice your wishes in advance.
Discuss with your counselor and family where and how you will receive medical care, as this choice can be an important cost factor.
Consult with your financial advisor: he will help you develop a plan to pay for these expenses.
Your choice of financing for long-term care may be covered by a traditional long-term care insurance policy or a mixed life insurance policy that will help cover these expenses or self-insurance with the help of your own property provided you have a day.
Put your legal documents in order: Get rid of the legal battles.
Build trust in medical care and appoint a trusted person who will monitor your medical care and make sure that the specialists fulfill your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
It is also recommended to consider the possibility of establishing a financial trust.
You should choose a trusted person who will help you make financial decisions and monitor the payment of your accounts in case you become incapacitated.
Don’t forget about the little things: imagine that your older parent needed urgent medical attention, and he’s on his way to the hospital.
In this case, will you be able to provide information about what medications he is taking and what he is allergic to?
Write down all of these details on paper so that you can prepare for each case.
Martin adds: “It is important not only to have finances, but also to choose doctors.”
“What medications are you taking?
Who will take care of your dog?
Write down and write down this plan.”
In Ilfracombe, a man shot several times from a pneumatic rifle.
A man fired several shots from a pneumatic rifle while returning home from a stroller.
The victim, whose chest, abdomen and arm were hit by bullets, aged 40, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon.
Police described the shooting, which occurred at approximately 2:30 a.m. English Summer Time, as an “accident.”
The victim did not see the attacker.
Wounds are not life-threatening, at the moment the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia
Officials said at least 384 people were killed as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, and the death toll is expected to increase.
Due to the outage of communications, the rescuers are unable to obtain any information from Donggala, an area north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-point earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu as a result of the natural disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 people (data for 2017).
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when an earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a district stretching along the 300 km (180 miles) coastline on the northwestern island of Sulawesi.
The district, which is the administrative district of the province, had 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the basis of the economy of the Central Sulawesi Province, and in particular the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important for the province's economy, but is mainly concentrated in Morovali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Agency for the Elimination of the Consequences of Natural Disasters, the tsunami has caused destruction in Palu and Donggala several times over the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
The tsunami also occurred in the western part of Donggala in 1996, resulting in the deaths of nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Volcanic Ring of Fire and suffers from earthquakes on a regular basis.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunami in recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia’s most populous island, causing a tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing some 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake occurred in the city of Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-point earthquake occurred on one of the Mentavai Islands near Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake struck Pidi Jai district in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as people remembered the devastating 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died as a result of the destruction of the buildings.
2018: Heavy earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists temporarily stayed under the ruins.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence charges
Trac Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, a 29-year-old from Wasilla, Alaska, has been arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a situation where domestic violence took place, and for resisting arrest, according to a report published Saturday by the Alaska State Police.
According to a police report, when one of his acquaintances tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he picked up her phone.
According to KTUU, Pailin is in the Mat-Su investigative insulation and will be issued with a $500 bail.
He appeared in court on Saturday, and when asked if he was guilty, he declared his “unambiguous innocence.”
Peylin is threatened with three minor Class A offences, which means he could be deprived of liberty for up to one year and fined $250,000.
He was also charged with a Class B offence, punishable by imprisonment of up to one day and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Peylin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police, reporting the alleged attack.
The case is currently under consideration by the Alaska Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, forgery of a report on domestic violence and the storage of weapons in a state of alcoholic intoxication in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed that he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticised by veterans groups in 2016 after she explained her son’s cruel behavior to a post-traumatic stress disorder allegedly caused by his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds Killed
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-point earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications are not working, and the number of victims will increase in the coming days.
The quake occurred near central Sulawesi, which is north-east of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Video footage of the incident appears on social media.
Hundreds of people were at a beach festival in the city of Palu when a tsunami hit the shore.
The federal prosecutor’s office wants to give the suspect in the terrorist attack in New York a rare death sentence
The federal prosecutor’s office in New York is seeking the death penalty for Saifullo Saipov, who is suspected of carrying out the attack in New York, which resulted in the deaths of eight people — a rare one-year sentence for a federal crime that has not been applied.
In October, Saipov, 30, allegedly hired a Home Depot truck to carry out an attack on a bike lane on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, killing pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed eight people and “intentionally” inflicted serious bodily harm, according to a statement of intent to achieve the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York.
According to the court document, both charges may result in the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, a large federal jury read out Saipov’s 22-point indictment, which included eight counts of murder for the purpose of racketeering, commonly used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, as well as indictments.
According to prosecutors, the attack was “carefully planned and deliberate,” Saipov carried out it, as described, “in a disgusting, cruel and criminal way.”
“Saifullo Habibullaevich Saipov caused injuries, harm and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, Ann-Laura Decadta, Darren Drayk, Ukho, Alyelia Erlia, Ernana Ferrucci, and Ernana.
Five of the dead were tourists from Argentina.
It has been ten years since the prosecutor demanded the death penalty in the Southern District of New York for a crime.
In September 2009, the accused Khalid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was ultimately sentenced to life in prison.
The last time the death penalty for the federal case in New York was applied in 1953 to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed for conspiracy to spy in favor of the Soviet Union during the Cold War for two years.
Rosenberg was executed with the use of an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, demonstrated a lack of remorse after the attack.
According to police, he told investigators that he was glad that he did it.
According to the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that the attack was inspired by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked to hang the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He denies his guilt in all 22 indictments.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders on Saipov’s side, said they were “clearly disappointed” by the prosecutor’s decision.
“We believe that the decision to impose the death penalty, not life imprisonment without the possibility of release, will only exacerbate the pain of these events for all of their participants,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense had previously appealed to prosecutors with a request not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP Says NIJEL FARAZ Should Not Be Responsible for Brexit Negotiations
Today, during a protest at the Tori Nigel Farage conference, he vowed to “mobilize the People’s Army.”
Former Ukip leader said politicians should “feel the rush” of Eurosceptics, as one member of parliament Theresa May suggested he should be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
Conservative Party member Peter Bowen said at a rally in Birmingham that the UK would have been “out” if Mr Farage was Brexit secretary.
However, the problem that Ms. May faces as she tries to reconcile her deeply divided lines is exacerbated by the fact that members of the Tori party, who are opposed to leaving the EU, are joining a separate protest against Brexit, which is taking place in the city.
The prime minister is trying to maintain his compromise plan, voiced in Chequers in the midst of attacks by Brexit supporters, its opponents and the EU.
The Allies insist that she continue to try to make a deal with Brussels, despite the negative reaction, and thus force Eurosceptics and laborers to choose between her package and “chaos.”
Mr. Bowen said at a Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to “overwhelm the Chequers.”
He proposed that Mr. Faraj be levelled and placed in charge of the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was responsible, we would have already left,” he said.
Wellingboro added: “I will continue to stand for Brexit, but we need to beat the Chequers.”
Speaking against the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be dependent.
We want to establish our laws in our country.”
Mr Bowen rejected the assumption that public opinion had changed after the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British have changed their mind and want to stay is completely inconsistent with reality.”
Tory party Brexit proponent Andrea Jenkins was also at the rally, commenting to reporters: “I’m saying, Prime Minister, just listen to the people.”
Chekers is unpopular among the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for this plan, it is unpopular also among our party members and our activists, who are actually storming the streets and electing us first and foremost.
Please put the checkers aside and start listening to what they’re saying to you.”
In her sharp address to Ms. May, she added: “Prime Ministers remain at work if they remain true to their promises.”
Mr Farage said that if politicians are going to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum, it means they need to be forced to “feel the rush.”
“It’s now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he says.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and we’re here today to tell them, ‘We’re not going to let this go of your hands.’”
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want our political class, which is on the brink of Brexit betrayal, to feel hot.
“We are mobilizing this country’s people’s army, which has given us victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we become an independent, independent and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, opponents of Brexit held a demonstration in Birmingham, then held a two-hour rally in the city center.
Several activists waved “Tories against Brexit” posters this weekend.
At the opening of the conference, a Labour Party member, Lord Adonis, criticized the Conservatives for security issues in their party’s mobile app.
“And these people claim that they can customize Canada plus IT systems and technology, to work at borders, to free trade without borders with Ireland,” he added.
“This is a complete farce.
A good Brexit doesn’t exist in principle,” he says.
Warren plans to “carefully study” the possibilities of participating in the presidential race
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the November election, she will “examine carefully the possibility of running for president.”
The Boston Globe reports that a Democrat from Massachusetts on Saturday spoke about his future at a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Jeff Dyle, who was the co-chairman of the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
Talks are going on that she has a chance to take the post of Trump in 2020.
On Saturday afternoon, she held another meeting with voters in Holioka; since Trump took office, it has been her 36th meeting with voters in the format of a town hall meeting.
One of the participants asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren said it was time for “women to go to Washington to “fix” our broken government, and for that, there needs to be a woman on the top.”
In the aftermath of Sims’ murder, LSU player was arrested.
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on Saturday announced that the suspect in the murder (shooting) of LSU basketball player Wade Sims, which took place on Friday, was arrested.
At 11 a.m. English time at a press conference, Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dayton Simpson.
On Friday, the police department released a video of the shooting with a request to help identify the person who was able to take the video.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot dead near the campus of Southern University on Friday morning.
“Wayd Sims received a gunshot wound to the head that resulted in his death,” Murphy J. Paul, the police chief, told reporters on Saturday.
Wade stepped in for his friend, and was shot by the Simpsons.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to having been involved in the incident, carrying a gun and shooting Wade Sims.
During the arrest, Simpson did not resist and was taken into custody in the East Baton Rouge County Police Department.
The young man, 1 m 82 cm tall, grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 starts last season and scored an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 sets per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the title of World Champion after team tactics gave him victory over Sebastian Fettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas passed the qualifying on Saturday, surpassing Lewis Hamilton, it became clear that the Mercedes team tactics would play a major role in the race.
From the pole position, Bottas started well and almost hung on Hamilton when he defended his position in the first two laps, and invited Fattel to attack his teammate.
Fattel was the first to go to the pit stop, leaving Hamilton to knit in the tail of the entire group – a choice that became decisive.
Mercedes went to the pit-stop one round later, and then came out behind Fattella, but Hamilton, after some struggle "wheel to wheel", came forward, which led to the driver of the Ferrari's rear for the rear-end for the rear-end.
On his 21st birthday, Max Ferstappen started from the back row of the net and was in seventh place by the end of the first round.
He then led most of the race, holding on to his home tires, in order to finish quickly, bringing Kimi Rykkonen to fourth place.
In the end, he went to the pit stop in the 44th round, but was unable to increase the pace in the remaining eight rounds, as Raikkonen took fourth place.
The day turned out to be difficult because Valtteri did a fantastic job on the weekends and showed a real nobility by sharing it with me.
The team did such an exceptional job to have a couple of tricks in stock,” Hamilton said.
Betrayal language of gestures
President Donald Trump criticised Senator Diane Feinstein at a meeting with voters on Saturday for her claim that she had not made public a letter from Christina Blaise Ford, the indictment of Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention the testimony given by Ford to the Senate Legal Committee, saying what was happening in the Senate showed that the participants in these events were “cowardly, ugly, and lying people.”
“The only possible response to all of this, and what’s happening in the last few days in the Senate, is great, it’s anger, anger, disgust and lies,” he said.
“You see all these leaks, and then they say, ‘No, I didn’t do that.
I didn’t do that.”
You remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you "slaughter" the information?
Remember her answer... did you “hide” the information of the document? – “what, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't.
Okay, stop.
“No, we didn’t,” he added, with the senator’s intonation.
In July, Feinstein sent a letter detailing Ford's charges against Cavano, and in early September it was illegally released, but Feinstein denies the leak occurred in her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s statements, but I didn’t merge her information,” Feinstein told The Hill.
“She asked me to keep this information a secret, and I did as she asked.”
However, the manner in which she denied allegations of leakage seems to have disliked the president, who commented on it during Saturday’s rally: “Here’s what I’m telling you: body language has tricked her.
She may not have “smiled,” but her body language was the worst I’ve ever seen.
Continuing to defend his candidate for the post of supreme judge, whom three women have been accused of sexual harassment, the president suggested that Democrats use these accusations for their own purposes.
“They are definitely trying to regain power in all available ways.
“We are watching foreboding, foreboding, they don’t care who they insult, who they have to step through to gain power and control,” he said.
British elite hockey league: Dandy Stars 5-3 Belfast Jayants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the "Jayants" in a game against "Dandy"
In the Elite Hockey League game, the Dandy Stars paid for Friday's defeat against the Belfast Jayants, winning a return game on Saturday with a 5-3 in favor of Dandy.
The Jayants gained an early two-goal lead thanks to the hits of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Boviller.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney raised the level of the home team before Dwyer put the Jayants in the lead.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bouchard compared Dandy's score before Lucas Lundwald Nielsen's two goals secured their victory.
For the people of Adam Kif, who won the Dandy with a 2–1 draw in Belfast on Friday night, it was the third defeat in the Elite League season.
It was the fourth meeting between the two sides in the season when the Giants won the previous three games.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 after a Kendall McFoll pass with David Racerford's backing, after which Boviller doubled the lead four minutes later.
During the initial period, Sullivan returned the hosts to the game at 13:10, before Matt Markward helped Cooney level the account at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Jayants intercepted the lead in the first break when he scored the second goal for the evening at the end of the first period.
The hosts were regrouped, and Bushar again leveled the score, scoring the goal with a number of transfers at 27:37.
Cooney and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen give Dandy the chance to take the lead for the first time in the match at the end of the second period, after which he and his team consolidated the victory, holding the opponents in the middle of the field until the end of the final period.
The Jayants, currently losing four of the last five games, are heading to Milton Keynes for the next game to be played on Friday.
The pilot was killed in order that hundreds of people on board the plane could avoid an earthquake.
The Indonesian air traffic controller was posthumously assigned the title of a hero after he consciously went to death in order for the plane with hundreds of passengers to be able to take off safely.
More than 800 people were killed and many were missing as a result of a severe earthquake on the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong underground shocks continue to destroy this area, many residents of the city of Palu found themselves under the rubble of buildings.
Despite his colleagues escaping to save his life, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the hovering management tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport, the city of Palu.
He remained in place to make sure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, was able to take off safely.
Then, when he thought the ridge was falling, he jumped off it.
He later died in the hospital.
Indonesia’s aviation spokesperson Johannes Sirait said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australian news agency ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to deliver it to a large hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, the dispatcher died before the helicopter was able to land in Palu.
“We are very sorry for this loss,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll from the earthquake could reach thousands of people, as according to the agency to eliminate the effects of natural disasters, access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Butong is limited.
“The number of victims is likely to increase as a large number of people are still under the rubble, and many have never been able to get out of there,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
The waves, which reached a height of six meters, devastated the city of Palu, in which a mass burial of the dead will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are delivering humanitarian aid to the affected city.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Emergency assistance brings victims every minute.
There is not enough clean water.
Mini-markets have been looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The staff of the Indonesian Red Cross are already in a hurry to help the survivors, but we do not know that they will stay there.
The tragedy has already taken quite a serious scale, but everything can be much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Vidodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country’s armed forces, in particular, saying: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
“Are you ready?” he told CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia suffered an earthquake in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now reports one person missing after plane crash in lagoon
The airline, which carried out the flight that crashed in the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia, now reports that one person was missing, while it was previously said that all 47 passengers and crew had safely left the sinking plane.
According to Air Niugini, as of Saturday afternoon, it does not have any information about a single male passenger.
The airline said it was cooperating with local authorities, hospitals and police in an attempt to find the man.
The airline was unable to immediately respond to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as his or her age or nationality.
The local sailors helped save other passengers and the crew of the plane after it crashed into the water while trying to land at the Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline also reported that on Saturday, six passengers were hospitalized, and all of them are in stable condition.
The causes of the plane crash and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy claim that the plane landed in a lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses claim that the plane was not able to land on the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Janes says the plane has started getting on the runway too low.
“And it’s very good,” Janes adds.
Janes said that he and other passengers were able to pass to the emergency exits on the sinking plane, as the water level was around the belt.
He also said that the stewardesses panicked and yelled on board, and that he had a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that sailors who repaired nearby boats also helped rescue by using an inflatable boat on which they carried people ashore before the plane sank by about 30 meters (100 ft).
Flight Safety Network data shows that over the past two decades, 111 people have been killed in plane crashes with airlines registered in PNG, but none of these crashes were related to Air Niugini.
Analyst on intelligence managed to prove the fact of burning a woman alive
On Saturday, the indictment brought a case against a man accused of burning a Mississippi resident in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Roulett gave long-time testimony as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told department members how he used his cell phone footage to draw a general picture of the actions of 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers the night she died.
Roulet said he received data on the location of these people from several mobile phones; according to this data, that evening, Tellis spent time with Chambers, which contradicts his previous testimony, reports The Clarion Ledger.
He said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, but according to the data obtained his cell phone was near Chambers; when the circumstance was discovered, the police questioned Sanford.
In his testimony, Sanford stated that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked Sanford if Tellis was telling the truth, claiming that he was in a Sanford truck that night, Sanford said that “it was a lie because my truck was in Nashville.”
Another discrepancy was that Tellis said he met Chambers two weeks before her death.
However, according to the records of phone calls, they were called only for one week.
Rowlett also showed that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted her text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
“He’s taking her out of his life,” Hale says.
The defence is due to begin the presentation of its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to be handed over to the jury later the same day.
The High Breed: What is “Conscious Hip-Hop”?
The hip-hop trio is going to fight a negative attitude towards this genre, filling their music with positive content.
The High Breed group in Bristol argues that the content of hip-hop has changed, leaving behind the original political and social issues.
The band members want to go back to their roots and make “conscious” hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently witnessed a revival in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
New York nannies sue couple for racist texting
A New York nanny has sued a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a report from a woman complaining that the nanny turned out to be “another black” that the woman mistakenly sent to the nanny instead of her husband.
The spouses deny that they are racists, claiming that the lawsuit was filed with “the purpose of extortion.”
Lance Plasco-Flexman, the mother of two children, expressed concern when she learned that the new babysitter proposed by the childcare service, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived with her family on her first working day in 2016.
“It’s just not that, it’s another black one,” Ms. Plasco-Flexman wrote in a text message to her husband.
However, instead of texting her husband, she mistakenly sent him to Miss Morris twice.
Realizing her innocence, Plasco-Flexman fired Morris, stating in the service that the nanny, who turned out to be an African-American, was doing her job badly, and in general that they were expecting a Filipino, not an African-American, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for one day of work and then sent home on Uber.
Morris is now suing the couple and demanding compensation for a $ 350 a day six-month leave — under the terms of the original oral agreement, which, however, were not stipulated by any contract.
“I want them to understand that such things are unacceptable,” she told Post on Friday, adding, “And I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple disagreed with the allegation of racism, and claimed that the dismissal of Maurice could be considered a reasonable step, because by insulting her, they could no longer trust her.
“My wife sent her a message that she didn’t really mean.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,” her husband, Joe Plasco, told the Post.
“But would you trust your children with someone you were rude with, even if you were rude, not wanting to?
Would you trust your newborn child?
Come on, you guys!"
Calling the lawsuit “rape,” Plasco said his wife gave birth just two months ago and was in a “very difficult situation.”
“And are you ready to persecute a man who is in such a position?
It’s not very nice on your part,” added a bank employee who specializes in investing.
The trial is still ongoing, but public opinion has already given its verdict on social media, accusing the couple of unacceptable behavior and problems with logic.
Publishers of Paddington feared that readers would not understand the move with the talking bear, says in a new letter
Bond’s daughter, Karen Yankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted by the publisher, responded to the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the work for the first time, even before it’s published.
It’s funny to know that Paddington is a huge success.”
She also said that her father, before he decided to write a children's book about a bear bear, worked as an operator on the BBC, and would deal with the refusal to publish with optimism, and also added that the 60th anniversary of his book's auto-release was "not a happy and bitter year" because it was not the year of publication.
As for Paddington’s own bear, she refers to him as a “very important member of our family,” and that her father was quietly proud that his character eventually gained fame.
“He was a quiet and humble man,” says his daughter.
After all, Paddington was so real to him, and for his father it was almost as if his own child had achieved success: he was proud of them, although in reality he did not consider this success his own merit.
I think he treated Paddington's success that way.
Paddington was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, but he also always paid tribute to the bear herself.”
I was forced to say good-bye to my dying daughter on the phone.
After the plane landed, her daughter was taken to the Nice Hospital Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“I called him regularly and said that everything was really bad, that something was wrong,” says Mrs. Ednan-Laperusa.
“Then he called again and said that she would die within the next two minutes and that we had to say goodbye.
That's what I did.
I said, "Daddy, I love you so much, darling.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The medications that doctors gave her, causing her heart to work, gradually ceased to work, leaving her body.
She died sooner than expected.
I had to just sit back and wait, knowing it was coming to an end.
I couldn’t cry, cry or cry because there were other people around me, other families.
I had to hold myself tightly in my hands.”
In the end, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, saddened by the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with other passengers, resolving the enormous loss that she had just had to endure.
“Nobody around knew what was going on,” she says.
“My head fell off, and I kept crying.
It’s hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I experienced this all-encompassing feeling of compassion for Nadu.
He needed my love and support so much.
I know how much he loved her.”
Women who survived the loss of loved ones prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones who committed suicide are trying to prevent others from doing so.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey place on the Welsh Bridge cards with comforting words and phone numbers that people can ask for support.
Mrs. Davis Tyler's son was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression, and at the age of 18 he committed suicide.
“I don’t want other parents to experience what I experience every day,” she says.
45-year-old Davis, who lives in Lidney, says her son was a great cook and had a damn charming smile.
“Everyone loved his smile.
Everyone said that when he smiles, the light in the room is on.”
However, before he died, he quit his job because he was really having a terrible time.”
This happened in 2014, and Tyler was found dead by his brother-in-law, who was then 11 years old.
Mrs. Davis says, “I’m not afraid that a chain reaction will go away.”
“Mrs. Davis came up with these cards so that people would know that there is someone you can turn to and tell everyone, even if it’s your friend.
You can’t sit down and keep quiet, you have to talk to people.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davis for many years, has lost Mark, her husband, with whom she lived for 15 years — he did not become soon after his mother’s death.
“He didn’t say he felt depressed, upset or anything like that,” she says.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his mood.
It was especially bad for him at Christmas: he didn’t even look at the kids when they opened their presents.”
She says his death was a huge trauma for them, but they have to go through this, this event has shocked our family.
It ripped it apart.
But we must continue to live and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs on the shelves: FBI starts investigation
“I thought that if we could get something like what he asked for — an investigation limited in time and volume, we could bring at least a little unity,” Mr. Flake said Saturday, adding that he fears that the committee is “breaking apart” in the background.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Time is the cause of their hesitation.
The midterm elections will be held in just five weeks, on November 6, and if, as expected, all goes well for the Republicans, they will be seriously weakened in their attempts to get the man they want and elect him to the position of the country’s supreme judge.
George W. Bush will call the senators, lobbying for the support of Mr. Kavanaugh, who in his time worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, and who, thanks to Bush, met his future wife, Ashley, who was then Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI releases its report?
A vote will be held in the Senate, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to address the issue of equality of votes and confirm his candidacy for the post of supreme judge.
North Korea's Number of Refugees Declined by Kim
Since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, the number of North Korean fugitives to South Korea has declined, the South Korean lawmaker said.
Pak Byong Seug, referring to data from the Ministry of the South, said that compared to the 2,706 cases of escape recorded in 2011, last year that figure fell to 1,127.
Mr. Pak said that the key factors were tightening border controls between North Korea and China, as well as higher rates levied by smugglers exporting people.
Pyongyang does not make public comments.
The vast majority of North Korean fugitives are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul claims that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally.
Most people are fleeing through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than a reliably protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China views migrants as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often repatriates them forcibly.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still at war, have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to resume the stalled nuclear disarmament negotiations.
This came after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, at which they reached common agreements on the disarmament of the Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yun Ho accused the United States of impeding progress on the issue with its sanctions.
“If we don’t have at least the slightest confidence in the United States, we won’t have confidence in our national security either, and in such circumstances we will in no way be able to start disarmament unilaterally,” Mr. Ri said in a speech to the General Assembly.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Cavanaugh "hysterical" and claims he is not fit for Supreme Court work
The minority leader in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called Bretta Cavano, a candidate for the post of supreme judge, "hysterical" and said he was unfit for work in the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi made this comment in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t help but think that if a woman ever allowed herself to behave in this way, she would immediately be called ‘hysterical,’” Pelosi said of his reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony to the Senate Legal Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied Dr. Christine Blaise Ford's accusations of sexual harassment that allegedly took place when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh spoke quite emotionally, sometimes even burst into screams and suffocated, telling about his family and school years.
He also unequivocally denounced the committee’s Democrats, calling the charges against him a “grotesque and clearly planned assassination of an active person,” organized by liberals, angry that Hillary Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi also said that, in her opinion, with her testimony, Kavanaugh only confirmed that she could not serve in the Supreme Court, since she had a biased attitude towards the Democrats.
“I think he’s disqualifying himself with his assertions, as well as with how he’s being thrown at the Clintons and Democrats,” she says.
Pelosi was outraged when asked if she would try to hold Cavano accountable if his guilt was confirmed and if Democrats would get a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’m going to say this: if he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he’s not only good for the Supreme Court, but also for the court he’s in right now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the District Court of Appeals in D.C.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about possible decisions made by Cavano regarding the Affordable Care Act or Row v. Wade, as he is considered a representative of conservative justice.
At the hearings on his candidacy, Cavano bypassed the question of whether he would annul some decisions of the Supreme Court.
“Now is not the time to let a hysterical and presumptuous man take the post of supreme judge and, at the same time, to shout: ‘How wonderful!’” says Pelosi.
And women have to have that.
It’s just anger, months and years of anger, she can’t go through it without tears.
“When we get angry, we cry,” Ms. Stein told me 45 later.
“I don’t think it’s that unusual anymore, do you think?”
She continued, “I was very helped by a woman who was working somewhere in a managerial position. She told me that she was also crying when she got angry, but she developed a technique that she explained to her interviewer: “You might think I’m crying because I’m upset.
I’m actually angry.”
And then she just kept talking.
I was very impressed with this approach.”
Tears are allowed as an outlet for anger in part because they are incorrectly treated at the root.
One of my most painful memories of my first job in the office, where men dominated, was that one day I cried out in anger, but I was caught behind the lace by an elderly woman, a soulless manager, whom I was always terribly afraid of, and I called out to the crowd.
“Never let them see you cry,” she told me.
“They don’t know you’re crying out of anger.
They think you’re upset, and they’re happy to think they’ve finally brought you in.”
Patricia Schröder, then a Democratic congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during his presidential election.
In 1987, Mr. Hart was caught in some serious intrigue and came out of the race, Ms. Schröder, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason to interfere with her running for president.
“This decision was not as thoughtful,” she admitted to me with a smile 30 years later.
“There were seven other candidates in the race at the time, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the case "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
The campaign had already come to an end, it was very late in raising funds, and so she vowed not to participate in the race unless she raised $2 million.
It seemed like it was a totally loser option.
She found that some of her supporters, who gave $1,000 to men, offered her only 250.
“I’m a valuable commodity to them, aren’t I?” she asked.
When she gave a speech announcing that she was not going to run an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions — gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it so hard for her to collect money and gain access to voters, as well as anger over dice.
“You’d think I had a nervous breakdown,” Mrs. Schröder recalls how the press reacted to her.
“You could have thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I was still thinking, what would they write on my monument?
“She was crying all the time?”
How a trade war with the United States could be beneficial to Beijing
Experts believe the first wave of a trade war between the US and China has been dazzling, and while the battle is still far from over, a split between the countries could benefit Beijing in the long run.
US President Donald Trump made the first warning earlier this year by taxing major Chinese export goods, including solar panels, steel, and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week, when new tariffs affected goods worth $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), effectively taxing half of all goods coming into the U.S. from China.
Beijing has repeatedly carried out equivalent retaliatory strikes, recently imposing tariffs on U.S. goods worth $60 billion, ranging from five percent to ten percent.
China has promised that retaliatory measures against the United States will be equivalent each time, and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to begin experiencing at least the slightest difficulties in the near future.
Forcing Washington to step down means giving up the demands, but publicly giving up the U.S. would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, according to experts, if Beijing is able to play its cards correctly, the pressure of the U.S. trade war could provide long-term support to China, reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a short-lived political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that would lead to economic turmoil in any of these countries is actually far more dangerous than the New Yorker’s Special Observer,” says Abigail Grace, an American Research Associate at the Analytical Center.
Foreign Minister Says Syria Is ‘Ready’ to Return Refugees
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is seeking assistance in the reconstruction of the country, which has been devastated by a war that has lasted more than seven years.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid al-Mualem said conditions in the country are improving.
“Today the situation on the ground has become more stable and safe thanks to the successes in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rebuild areas destroyed by terrorists so that people can live there peacefully.
At present, all conditions have been created for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorist attacks and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people, still living in the country, are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said the Syrian regime would be grateful for helping in the reconstruction of the destroyed country.
But he stressed that the country would not accept aid under any conditions or assistance from countries that sponsor terrorism.
Europe confirms victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the U.S. team with a score of 16.5-10.5 at Le Golf National in the suburbs of Paris, France.
The United States has already lost six times in a row on European soil, and the European Ryder Cup has not been won since 1993.
Europe regained the crown thanks to the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn, who scored 14.5 points to win over the United States.
American star Phil Michelson, who fought hard for most of the tournament, made his first long-distance shot in the water at the 16th hole par-3, giving up his match Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari won in all his rounds, becoming 1-x-4 players who ever went 5-0-0, since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
The American Jordan Sleep suffered a 5:4 defeat to the lowest-ranked player in the European team, Turbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen from Denmark.
One of the best players in the world, Dustin Johnson, conceded 2-1 to Jan Polter from England, who may have competed in the Ryder Cup for the last time.
Spanish Sergio Garcia, a veteran of the eight Ryder Cups, became the winner of the tournament for the entire history of Europe with 25.5 points in his career.
“I usually don’t cry, but I can’t hold back today.
It was a difficult year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am very happy to have the cup again.
It’s all about the team, and I’m glad I was able to help,” says emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He handed the torch to his compatriot John Ram, who on Sunday won over American golf legend Tiger Woods with a 2–1 score in a single game.
“I’m incredibly proud of this victory — I grew up watching Tiger Woods play,” said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now his career record is 13-21-3.
These figures are quite odd for one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles, giving up only Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team struggled throughout the weekend, trying in vain to succeed. The exception consisted of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who showed top-class golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furrick said after an unsatisfying performance by his team: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning, we managed to hit Europe a little bit.
It didn't work.
We take off our hats in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players played very well.
We will regroup, I will work with PGA America and our Rider Cup Committee, and we will move forward with success.
I love all 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to be able to lose.
We've lost."
Red tide: news Concentration of microorganisms decreased in Pinellas, Manati and Sarasota
The latest report of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission reflects a general decrease in the concentration of red tides in some parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, the districts of Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier have reported abundant flowering, suggesting a decrease in the concentration of microorganisms.
The Red Tide extends approximately 130 miles of coastline from northern Pinell to southern Li counties.
Whales can be seen about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but compared to last week, their number has decreased significantly.
The red tide is also observed in Pasco County.
Last week, an average concentration in and around Pinellas County was reported, from low to high concentration in the coastal area of Hillsborough County, a high concentration in the Li<0xC3><0xA8>ge and O<0xC3><0xBB>nge districts of Manati and Sarasota, and a high concentration in the coastal zones.
In the districts of Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Lee and Collier, there is still a possibility of respiratory irritation.
In Northwest Florida, no such possibility was reported last week.
