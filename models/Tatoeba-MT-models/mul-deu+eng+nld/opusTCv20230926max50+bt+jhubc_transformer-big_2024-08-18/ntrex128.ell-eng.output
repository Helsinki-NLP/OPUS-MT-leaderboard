Welsh MPs worry they will be confused with the "mapets"
Some MEPs expressed their concern about the proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament – Member of the Parliament of Wales).
This concern has arisen in relation to the plans to change the name of the Assembly of the Parliament of Wales.
MEPs across the political spectrum are concerned that such a thing will sound ridiculous to them.
A member of the Labour Party said his party was concerned that "it would end up with the words Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, the word "twp" means "stupid" and the word "pwp" means "detached".
A member of the Pledge of Allegiance said the group was "not satisfied" at all and suggested alternative solutions.
A Welsh conservative said his own party was "open-minded" about changing the name, but noted that the word MWP is not far away from the word "mopet".
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced similarly to the English pronunciation of Yorkshire of the letter u.
The Parliamentary Committee, which is currently drafting the bill to introduce the name change, said: "The final decision on any name by which MEPs will be appointed will, of course, be a matter for the MEPs themselves."
The Welsh Government’s Law of 2017 gave the Welsh Parliament the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on the proposals, which were widely accepted for the designation of the Parliament as the Parliament of Wales.
With regard to the title of MEPs, the Commission voted in favour of the name "Member of the Parliament of Wales" or WMP, but the MWP option was the one that received the most support during the public consultation.
MEPs are obviously proposing alternative options, but trying to reach a consensus can be a difficult matter for the Speaker of the Parliament, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a bill to change the name of the House.
The Reforms Act will also include other changes to the way the parliament operates, including rules on deductions from the mandate of the member and the design of the committee system.
In the final vote, MEPs will decide on the issue of their names when discussing the legislation.
The citizens of the Republic of Macedonia are coming to the polls for the referendum on the change of the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday on the change of the name of the country to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The vote of the people was called for in an effort to resolve a decades-long conflict with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens claims that the name of its northern neighbor hides territorial views and has repeatedly opposed its requests for membership in the EU and NATO, according to the report.
Giorge Ivanov, the president of the Republic of Macedonia, a fighter in the referendum on the change of name, said he would not take the vote into account.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, argue that the change is simply the price they have to pay for their membership in the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells have been silent as churches in Harlem disappear
“The older people I’ve spoken to say that there used to be a bar and a church in every corner,” Adams said.
Today, there is none of the two.”
He said he understands why the bars went missing.
“The world is socializing in a different way today,” he said.
“The bars are no longer the ‘salon’ of the neighborhood where people regularly frequent.”
As for the churches, he worries that the money from the sale of the assets will not hold as long as the authorities hope "and sooner or later they will return to where they started."
The churches, he added, may be replaced by mansions filled with people who will not be willing to help the places of worship that have remained in the neighborhood.
"The overwhelming majority of people who will buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "and therefore will hasten the day when all these churches will shut down completely, because it is unlikely that all those people who will move in will be able to make themselves slums."
Both churches were built by white churches before Harlem became the capital of blacks – the Metropolitan Community was built in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original ecclesiastical Methodist church left in the 1930s.
A church of blacks that was in the vicinity took over the possession of the building.
In possession of the St. Martin's building he took over a black church under His Excellency John Howard Johnson, who went on a boycott of the shops of the 125th Avenue or Naonnou prefecture, a major shopping street in Harlem.
A fire in 1939 caused serious damage to the building, but Father Johnson's parishioners took over the reconstruction and ordered the caricature.
His Excellency David Johnson, the son and successor of Father Johnson in St. Martin's Church, proudly called the carigion "the bells of the poor".
The expert who played the cartoon in July described it in a different way: "a cultural treasure" and "a substitute instrument of historical significance".
The expert, Tiffany In of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first cartoon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionysos A. Leeds, who was converted to a larger cartoon at the River Church for 18 years.
Mr. Meriwader said St. Martin's church didn't replace him.
What’s happening in St. Martin in recent months is a complex story between architects and contractors, some of whom were hired by the church’s popular leaders, while others by the bishopric.
The commissioners - the administrative body of the parish, consisting of the popular leaders - sent to the bishopric in July a letter on their concerns that the bishopric "should have sought to take to the office of the bishops what they had to pay" to the body of the commissioners.
Some mayors have expressed complaints about the lack of transparency on the part of the bishops.
13-Year-Old Shark Attacked in California Dive for Snakes
Sharks attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday during scuba diving in California on the first day of the ash season, according to authorities.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Bikon Beach in the town of Encinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with his friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the cries of the child asking for help and approached him with a sneeze.
Hamel said at first he thought it was just screams of excitement because he caught a snail, but then realized that he was shouting, "Something bit me!
“Something bit me!”
His whole lock had been opened,” Hamel remarked when he reached the place where the boy was.
"I called on everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the sea!'" added Hamel.
The boy was airlifted to the Randy Children's Hospital in San Diego and his condition is critical.
The type of shark responsible for the attack remains unknown.
Sailor Larry Giles said in a press release that the shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but was deemed not to belong to any dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim was carrying serious injuries to the upper part of the body.
Authorities banned access to the beach from Pointe Bis in Casablanca to Suamis in Encinitas for 48 hours for research and security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans put pressure on the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's handles Boots, Superdrug, and Debenhams by placing cosmetics shelves respectively with those of supermarkets, staffed by specialty employees.
In the context of the significant rise in the UK cosmetics market of <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion, which is still developing while the sales of clothing and household items are falling, the largest shelves of cosmetics will be put to trial in 11 trials.
The investment in the cosmetics sector comes as supermarkets are looking for ways to fill the space on the shelves that once occupied televisions, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury's said it would double the size of its cosmetics supply to 3,000 products, including companies such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
In the existing series of L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also be given more shelves with the company’s logo, similar to those of stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is once again launching its own makeup line so that most of the products are vegan – something that is increasingly in demand by younger consumers.
In addition, fragrance company The Fragrance Shop will try to dispose of its products at two Sainsbury's stores, one that opened in Croydon, South London, last week and the other in Shelley Oak, Bermichham, England.
The e-markets and the tendency to buy small amounts of food daily in local mini-markets, means that supermarkets will have to make greater efforts to make the world visit them.
Mike Coop, CEO of Sainsbury's, said outlet stores will look more and more like supermarkets, as supermarket chains are trying to compete with discounted Aldi and Lidl outlets, according to a press release.
Sainsbury's put Argos outlet stores in hundreds of stores, and also introduced some Habitats as they bought both chains two years ago, a fact that backed grocery sales and made them more profitable.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to renovate the parts of cosmetics and pharmacy has resulted in a failure.
Sainsbury's tried a consortium with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration came to an end after a dispute over how to distribute profits from pharmacy stores to supermarkets in the chain.
The new strategy was designed after Sainsbury's sold the pharmacy business it owns with 281 stores in Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million, three years ago.
She said Lloyds would play its part in the project, adding an expanded range of luxury care companies, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s Chief Commercial Officer, said: “We have transformed the look and feel of our shelves in order to improve the environment for our consumers.
We have also invested in specially trained staff who will be available to offer advice.
The range of our companies has been designed to meet every need, while the attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now a strong destination for cosmetics that challenges the traditional way of shopping. "
Peter Jones: Exasperated after Holly Willoby's resignation from <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
The protagonist of the Dragons Den series, Peter Jones, is upset after the resignation of television presenter Holly Willoby from the <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with the company, which he owns, MarkTV, and its lifestyle business, to commit to its ventures.
Willobi doesn't have time for truly's clothing and accessories company.
Their business was similar to the Goop company of Guinette Paltrow.
The 37-year-old presenter of "This Morning" announced on Instagram her decision to resign.
Holly Willoby has exasperated the protagonist of the Dragons Den series, Peter Jones, leaving their lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute, in order to commit to her new huge contract with Marks & Specer.
According to sources, Jones became angry when the golden girl of television admitted during a meeting full of tensions on Tuesday at the headquarters of his empire in Marlowe, in Buckinghamshire, that he would not have had time to go to the headquarters of his empire.
The company resembled Gwinnett Paltrow’s Goop and appears to have doubled Willobi’s assets, which are estimated to amount to <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
After Willoby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was about to leave Truly, Jones flew out of the UK to one of his holiday homes.
According to one source, “Truely was far from Holly Willoby’s top priorities.
It was about her long-term future, her source of income for the coming decades.
Her decision to resign surprised everyone who was involved in the business.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the presentation.
There is a warehouse full of products at the headquarters in Marlowe ready to be put up for sale."
Experts estimate that the departure of the presenter of the show "This Morning", which is among the most commercial celebrities in the UK, could cost the company millions of dollars in cash as a result of its huge investment in products from pillows and candles.
And this can mean the end of a long friendship.
Holly Willoby, mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been in close friendship with Jones and his wife, Tara Cap, for ten years.
Willobi founded Truly with the CAP in 2016 and 52-year-old Jones joined as president in March.
The couple spend their holidays together, and Jones maintains a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoby is set to become the main character in M&S’s campaigns and to replace Ad McCartlin in the ITV show “I’m A Celebrity.”
A source from Jones's close environment said last night, "We wouldn't want to comment on his professional affairs."
We were tough, and then we fell in love.
He joked about the criticism he received from the media for a remark some would consider unsuitable for a president, as well as his so positive attitude towards the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump make so many concessions?
Trump said he was mimicking the style of a television presenter.
"I didn't compromise anything."
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting, after the initial meeting in Singapore in June was welcomed by Trump as a major step towards North Korea’s de-nuclearization.
However, negotiations on de-nuclearisation have been delayed.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat, Ray Yong-Ho, told the world’s leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the UN General Assembly had “received” the UN Security Council.
Instead, he stressed, the United States continues to impose sanctions that aim to exert pressure on the United States.
Trump held a much more optimistic stance in his speech.
"We're doing very well with North Korea," he said.
“We’re almost at war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have their lives.
“Now we’ve built up this excellent relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve his relations with Kim have yielded positive results — ending missile tests, releasing hostages, and returning the rest of the U.S. soldiers to their homes.
While he supported his unusual stance in the statements about his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to have 'presidential' style, but instead of having 10,000 people sitting outside the room because they couldn't get in, we'd only have 200 people here," Trump said, pointing to his crowd.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia sweep an entire island, leaving thousands of dead on the way.
In the wake of the earthquake in Lombok, for example, it was announced that there would be no need for the assistance of foreign non-governmental organizations.
Despite the fact that more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population was displaced, no national disaster was declared, a necessary prerequisite for making use of international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, it has become clear that they are not asking for international help, so it is quite difficult," Subung said.
While Save the Children is preparing a team to travel to Palo Alto, it is not yet certain whether the foreign staff will be able to work on site.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Natural Disaster Service, said Indonesian authorities were evaluating the situation in Palo Alto to ascertain whether international organisations would be allowed to contribute aid.
Given the seismic fluctuations that often affect Indonesia, the country remains highly unprepared for the anger of nature.
While tsunami shelters have been built in Ace, the same is not the case on other coasts.
The apparent lack of a tsunami alarm siren in Palo Alto, even after a warning, is likely to have contributed to the loss of so many lives.
In the best case scenario, moving between the many islands of Indonesia is difficult to do.
Natural disasters complicate administrative care even more in the first place.
A floating hospital that had been parked in Lombok to care for the victims of the earthquake is heading to Palo Alto, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widdo had at the centre of his campaign to improve Indonesia’s disorganized infrastructure and had a mere amount of money to build roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding stifles Mr. Joko's administration, before re-election next year.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure from sustained fanatical tendencies in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people lost their lives and tens of thousands were displaced as groups of Christians and Muslims fought in the streets, using swords, arrows and arrows, as well as other improvised weapons.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Steritz is playing against Chelsea in a draw against Chelsea
Daniel Steriz saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat against Chelsea by scoring in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday.
Sterides received a pass from Serdan Shakiri about 27 meters away from Chelsea's finish with his team losing 1-0.
He hit the ball on his left and swerved to the back bar.
His effort was driven very high from the large area and ended up on the right in the nets.
The ball finally fell over Kepa Arizabalaga who jumped to deflect it and got into the net.
“I was trying to take this position, get to the ball and players like Shakir are always playing as much forward as possible, so I tried to win as much time as possible,” Sterith told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kande approaching, I made a direct switch, I didn't think much about it and I did the shot."
Chelsea had a 1-0 lead in the semi-final after the goal in the 25th minute by Belgian star Eden Azar.
The blue forward gave a heel pass to Mateo Kovatsic in this game, before kicking a kick near the center of the field and running on the side of Liverpool.
Kovacic did one to two in the center of the field.
Then he gave a deep ball, leading Azar to the large area.
Azar ran in front of the defender and completed by sending the ball to the grids in the back bar with a left shot in front of Allison Becker of Liverpool.
Liverpool will play against Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton at the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The tragic death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia is 832.
The death toll after the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia is 832, according to the country's natural disaster service, early on Sunday.
Many people were trapped in the debris of buildings that collapsed after the 7.5-degree earthquake that hit the area on Friday and created waves of 6 meters high, a spokesperson for the service, Sutopo Puruo Nung, said in a statement.
The city of Palou, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered by the debris of the collapsed buildings.
Police Arrest a 32-year-old Suspect After Murdering a Woman With a Knife
A murder investigation began after a woman's body was discovered in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 a.m. with stab wounds at Grayson Mioze in John Street, while a 32-year-old man was arrested as a suspect in the murder.
The police asked the residents who had seen or heard something about it to file it with the police.
Officer Brian Ohioan said: “The investigation is in its initial stages, but I would like to address an appeal to anyone who was in the neighborhood around John Street and saw or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to address an appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something in the footage from the dashcam cameras to contact us as they may have in their possession information that is vital to our investigation.”
A police spokesperson confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and was found inside a building.
This afternoon, friends who think they may know the woman came to the scene of the crime to ask questions about the location where she was found this morning.
Investigations are underway as the police say they are in the process of informing their closest relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mioze, in an attempt to return to his apartment, was informed by the police that no one is allowed to enter or exit the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
The tenants were informed that it may take hours before they are allowed to return to their homes.
A police officer reportedly told a man that the entire area is being treated as a crime scene at the moment.
A woman showed up with tears on the scene.
He kept repeating, "It's terrible."
At 2 p.m., two police vans were inside the police ribbon and one outside.
The policemen were standing outside the ribbon and were watching the mansion.
Anyone with any information is asked to send a message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 for the September 30th 247 case.
Cromwell's statue in Parliament becomes the last monument to be hit by the philony for the "rewriting of history"
His extortion would be a poetic justice for the Taliban’s destruction of England’s numerous cultural and religious works by his fanatical Puritan supporters.
However, the Cromwell Association described Mr. Crick's proposal as "an insensitivity" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "In this debate on the removal of statues, it was inevitable that the form of Oliver Cromwell would not be targeted outside of the Actor's Office.
The iconoclasm of England's civil wars was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Possibly, a wrong member of the Cromwell family was sacrificed for the actions of Thomas’ ancestor during the previous century.
Cromwell’s outstanding portrayal of Sir William Hamo Thorncroft is characteristic of his 19th-century image and part of the historiography of a personality that many believe is worthy of tribute.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is still considered by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressures, in his case, of course, by the United States.
Whether or not this is an absolutely accurate case is the subject of an open-ended historical debate.
The only thing that is certain is that the conflicts in the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable personality that represents one side of the divide.
His achievements as Lord Prostituee are also commendable and memorable.”
Swine-smuggler Injures Deadly Chinese Farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local news bulletins.
The man, only known as "Yuan," was found with a broken artery in a blood lake near a pig farm on the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, South China, the Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farm employee is preparing to vaccinate pigs on May 30, 2005 in Xinjiang, Qinhai Province, China.
He is reported to have traveled with his cousin from the neighbouring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered the door of a neighbor's piggy bank open.
He said there was a large male pig with blood in its mouth in the pork yard.
The doctor’s examination confirmed that the pig weighing 227 kilograms had fatally injured the farmer, according to his report.
“My cousin’s legs were bleeded and bruised,” said the cousin, known by his nickname “Gu,” according to Guiyang’s evening news bulletin.
The security camera footage shows Wyatt entering the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man doesn't belong to Wyatt or his cousin.
A market official told the evening news bulletin that the pig had been placed in a cage so that no one else would be attacked, while the police collected the evidence at the scene of the attack.
Wyan's family and market officials are reportedly negotiating some sort of compensation for his death, according to the report.
Although rarely, cases of swine attacks on humans have been reported in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, seriously injuring the man, according to the report.
Ten years ago, a 295-pound pig threw a farmer in Wales on his tractor until the farmer’s wife scared the animal to get away.
After the incident in which a farmer from Oregon was devastated by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as an “animation.”
“They’re just in a playful mood.
They're small, very strange creatures... they don't want to hurt.
We just have to show them the proper respect,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa are expected to bring extensive rainfall to the southwestern United States.
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the cooler water masses of Mexico’s northern coast.
However, Hurricane Rosa will bring catastrophic rainfall to North Mexico and the Southwestern United States in the coming days.
The winds of Hurricane Rosa reached 85 mph, forming a Category 1 hurricane at 5 a.m. Eastern time on Sunday and was detected 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, in Mexico.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, an area of low wind pressure has begun to form over the Pacific Ocean and moves eastwards to the West Coast of the United States.As the Hurricane Rosa in the summer approaches the Southern California peninsula on Tuesday.
Hurricane Rosa will bring 25 centimeters of rainfall to areas of Mexico on Monday.
Subsequently, tropical humidity combined with the region of low wind pressures that is approaching will create extensive heavy rainfall in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 centimeters of rainfall will cause dangerous flooding, debris flows, and possibly landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity will lead to rainfall rates approaching 5 to 7.5 centimetres per hour per place, especially in parts of South Nevada and Arizona, according to the report.
Clusters of 5 to 10 centimetres are expected locally in the southwest, especially in much of Arizona.
Floods are likely with a rapid deterioration of the phenomena due to the scattered nature of tropical rainfall.
It is recommended to avoid any movement on foot in the desert in view of the threat of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rainfall can turn the canyons into turbulent rivers, and storms will cause locally strong winds and sandstorms.
The low-wind zone will create some locally strong rainfall per place on the coast of Southern California, according to the report.
Total rainfall of more than 1 centimeter is likely, which can cause small streams of debris and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainfall of the wet season in the area.
Some scattered tropics will begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early in the morning on Monday, before the phenomenon expands late on Monday and Tuesday. (more...)
Heavy rainfall will spread to the For Corners area on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
In October, some severe temperature changes will be observed throughout the U.S. as temperatures in the Arctic fall, but in the tropics they remain quite high.
Sometimes, this fact leads to very intense changes in the temperature at close ranges.
A characteristic example of the intense temperature differences between the central U.S. was observed on Sunday.
There was a nearly 10-degree difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and De Moyne, Iowa.
Over the next few days, persistently high summer temperatures will be observed and will spread again.
In much of the Central and Eastern United States, October is expected to start with high temperatures at 27 <0xC2><0xB0>C from the Eastern Plains to parts of the Southeast.
The temperature in New York City can reach 27 <0xC2><0xB0>C on Tuesday, about 5 degrees above the average.
According to our long-term weather forecast, there are quite a few chances that temperatures will be observed above the average in the Eastern U.S. by the first half of October.
More than 20 million viewers watched Bret Kavanaugh’s rehearsal.
More than 20 million viewers watched the defamatory testimony of the candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court, Bret Kavanaugh, on Thursday, and the woman who accused him of sexual assault in 1980, who is reported to have committed sexual assault.
In the meantime, the political impasse continued, with the television networks interrupting the normal flow of the program for the overthrow of the last moment on Friday: the agreement by the deputy senator of the Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to conduct an investigation.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure how at a party while she was a high school student, Kavanaugh attacked her while she was drunk and tried to take her clothes off.
Kavanaugh, in a charged statement, said he was 100 percent sure that no such thing had happened.
According to Nielsen’s measurements, more than 20.4 million viewers are likely to have watched the hearing on Friday.
The company calculated the average television coverage on the networks CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers did not immediately become available for other networks that broadcast the audition, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
While also, Nielsen usually finds it difficult to calculate the number of viewers watching a broadcast from office spaces.
To see this television in its correct dimensions, it is a common size similar to that of watching a football match of the playoffs or the ceremony of awarding the Oscars.
Fox News, whose journalists strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, preceded an average of 5.69 million viewers during the full-day hearing, according to Nielsen.
In second place is the ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
They followed CBS with 3.1 million, NBC with 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million and CNN with 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest remained high, even after the hearing.
Flake appeared as a protagonist in Friday's drama.
After the Republican moderate's statement that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras recorded on Friday morning protesters disapproving of him as she tried to get into the elevator for the hearing by the Commission.
He was staring down for a few minutes as he was being denied, live on TV on CNN.
"I'm standing here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth in the country?
He said, "You have power when so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office had made statements and, before the elevator doors were closed, that he would have more to say at the Commission hearing.
All the cable television and broadcasting networks were covered live a few hours later, the vote of the Senate Justice Committee on the promotion of Kavanaugh's candidacy in the plenary of the Senate for the vote.
However, Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations against the candidate next week, which was requested by a minority of Democrats.
Flake was convinced in part after discussions with his friend, Democratic Party Senator Chris Cohns, who was a member of the House of Commons.
After discussions with Kuns and a number of other senators thereafter, Flake made a decision.
Flake's choice was valid, because it was obvious that Republicans would not convene votes for approval of Kavanaugh without conducting an investigation.
President Trump has asked the FBI to conduct an investigation into the allegations made against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May Accuses Her Critics of Playing Games with Brexit <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of plans to leave the European Union of “playing political games” with Britain’s future and undermining the national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.

Wyatt Simms Shooting: Police Arrested Suspect Daedeon Simson for LSU Player's Murder
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting of Wade Simms, a 20-year-old LSU basketball team player.
Diane Simpson, 20, was arrested and held in prison on second-degree murder charges, according to Batton Rose's police department.
The authorities have in their hands a video of Sims's complication with Simpson and according to the police, Sims lost his glasses during the conflict.
Police spotted the glasses at the crime scene and said they had spotted traces of Simpson's DNA, according to the WAFB, which works with CBS.
After Simpson's interrogation, the police said they had admitted to having fatally injured Wade.
His bail was set at $350,000, according to his lawyer.
According to the preliminary report of the Eastern Medical Judge Batton Rouge released on Friday, the cause of death is a bullet wound to the head and neck.
The Ministry has put at the disposal of the Louisiana Police Special Task Force, the police forensic laboratory, the police forces of the Southern University and the citizens of the area to assist in the investigation for the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joey Aleva thanked local law enforcement authorities for “established investigations and the pursuit of justice’s performance.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1.98-metre-high Forward raised Batton Rose, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball team coach Will Owaid said the team was “stripped” and “in a state of shock” from Wade’s death.
“We’re always worried about incidents like this,” Owen said.
Volcanic ash emissions in Mexico City <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Emissions of volcanic ash from the Popocatepetl Volcano reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico’s capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned residents of Mexico on Sunday to stay away from the volcano, after the activity in the crater reached its 24th peak, with a record of 183 emissions of gases and gases.
The Center monitored various indications and small seismic vibrations.
Images on social media show a car windshield covered with thin layers of ash in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Sotsimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in the activity of the volcano located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since the time of its 7.1-magnitude earthquake in central Mexico Sept 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police Forces Conflict with Catalan Autonomists in Front of the Anniversary of the Independence Vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protesters clashed in favor of independence with the class's restoration units, as thousands took part in the protests for the first anniversary of the vote on the abstention of the group.
A group of masked demonstrators in favor of independence, which was held by the class's restoration units, threw eggs and powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that are usually flooded by tourists.
Complications were also noted later in the day with the policemen using their clubs to suppress the complications.
For hours, groups of supporters of Catalonia's independence shouted the slogan "We don't forgive, we don't forget" against groups of protesters in favor of the unity of the country who shouted "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people were hospitalized with micro-injuries that were recorded during the protests, according to the local press.
Tensions remain high in the region that supports independence a year after the October 1 referendum was declared illegal by Madrid, which is still being celebrated by the Catalan autocrats.
The overwhelming majority of voters opted for independence, although attendance was low with those who were opposed to independence boycotting the referendum, according to Reuters.
According to the Catalan authorities, about 1,000 people were injured last year, after police authorities tried to stop the vote at the polling stations in the area where violent complications were taking place.
Groups in favor of independence slowly camped out on Friday to prevent a demonstration of support for the national police, according to Reuters.
The demonstration took place but was forced to take a different turn.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who took part in the protests in favor of independence with his wife, said he no longer had hopes for Catalonia’s prospects of gaining independence.
“Last year, we had one of our brightest moments.
“I saw my parents with tears of joy who managed to vote, but now the situation is stagnant,” he said.
In addition to the fact that the Catalan parties in favour of their independence have not been able to achieve a decisive victory in the regional elections in December of this year, the Catalan parties in favour of their independence have also struggled to maintain their momentum this year, with many of them
Joan Poots, a 42-year-old engineer who recorded the protests on his mobile phone in favor of the police, said the clashes were fueled by politicians from both camps.
“The tension is escalating more and more,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Zunkeras, one of nine Catalan leaders who were incarcerated last year, announced his candidacy for the European elections for next year.
"My candidacy in the European elections is the best way to denounce the insurgency of democratic values and the repression we have received from the Spanish Government," he said.
Londoner: Man Arrested After Car Accident at Home
Three men, ages 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a repeated car crash at a home in London, England.
The incident took place at Bolinagard Crested on Thursday at about 19:30 BST.
Inspector Bob Blamings said damage was caused to the gates and to the building itself.
There may have been a gunshot to the car at some point.
Menga's strike gave Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers.
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secures victory
The incumbent Livingston overtook the Rangers by giving Steven Gerard his second defeat in the 18 games as the manager of the Ibrox team.
Dolly Menga's hit made a difference as Gary Holt's side changed level with Hibernian in second place.
Gerard's team remains without a homeless win in the championship this season and is facing the Harts, who have the lead by eight points, on the following Sunday.
Prior to this match, the Rangers will host Rapind Wiens in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, continues its six-game run unbeaten in its category, with head coach Holt having not yet tasted any defeats since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
<0xE2><0x86><0x90> Libingston Loses Opportunities in Relation to Visitors
Holt's team should have taken the lead long before scoring, with its immediate ability to get the Rangers into a difficult position.
Scott Robinson took a lead and scored to reach just before the finish, but Allan Lithgow thwarted his attempt by sliding Craig Halket's head away from the finish.
The pitchers were willing to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could zoom in on the free kicks and the corners.
And this is how the important goal came.
The Rangers were unable to prevent a free kick, and Livingston made the opening, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson collaborating to send the ball off the field to Menga, who took the entire stage.
By that point, the Rangers had dominated the possession of the ball but found the pitchers' defense impassable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not face any difficult situations.
This form continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morellos smashed the ball from Kelly.
Scott Pittman's ball was repulsed by Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor's feet and Lithgow's entire pass came out in another free kick for Livingston.
There were many vertical passes in the area of Livingston and they were constantly repulsed, while two penalties were requested - after Halket demanded the ball against substitute Glenn Middleton and one on hand - which were rejected.
"Excellent game" by Livingston - analysis
Alder Lamond from the BBC Scotland at the Toni Makaroni Arena
Spectacular performances and results for Livingston.
All in all, they were excellent, exceeding the expectations in this upward course.
Their playing style and personality changed little after their return to top form, but the credits would also have to be given to Holt for the boost he gave the team with his arrival.
His team had so many heroes.
Halket was outstanding, returning an exceptionally organized defense, while Menga kept Conor Golson and Joey Warrel on alert throughout the game.
The Rangers, on the other hand, had no inspiration.
No matter how good they were in the past under Gerard's guidance, they did not meet these standards.
Their last game was incomplete - only once they managed to pass the defense of the stadiums and this is a warning bell for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the rankings.
Mixed emotions at Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an’s reception in Cologne
The climate was good on Saturday (September 29th) at the meeting of the heads of state of Turkey and Germany for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an’s controversial visit to Germany, which was aimed at restoring relations with NATO allies.
They had come to a breach in relation to issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an then went to Cologne to inaugurate a new, huge mosque.
The city is home to the largest community of Turks outside of Turkey.
Police ruled out the gathering of the crowd of 25,000 people in front of the mosque for security reasons, but many supporters managed to get close enough to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan - many of them of Kurdish origin - also gave the present, condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The division of the protesters reflects the controversial nature of a visitor who is treated by some Turko-Germans as a hero and by others as a dictator.
Detford Accident: Biker's Death After Car Accident
A cyclist lost his life in a car crash in London, England.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Detford, southeast of the city, at about 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and ambulance rescuers tried to help, but the man lost his life on the spot.
The collision took place a few months after a similar incident in which a driver hit and left a cyclist, who lost his life on Chillers Street, about 1 mile (1.6 km) from Saturday's accident.
The Metropolitan Police said that the authorities are making efforts to identify the man and to inform their closest relatives of the man's identity.
Roads have been closed and bus routes have been excavated, while drivers have been instructed to avoid the area.
Long Lartine Prisons: Six Police Officers Injured in Complications
Six police officers were injured in riots that broke out in the prisons of high-security men, according to statements from the Directorate of Prisons.
Riots erupted in Her Majesty’s Long Lartin prisons in Watersair at about 09:30 BST on Sunday and are still in progress.
Special police forces “Tornado” have been deployed to confront the riots, which involve eight detainees and which have been demonstrated in one wing.
The police officers were hospitalized with micro-injuries to the face during the complications.
A spokesman for the prisons said: “Specially trained personnel have taken on the task of dealing with the incident in the prisons of Her Majesty Long Lartin.
Six members of the staff were hospitalized with injuries.
“We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we make it clear that those responsible will be referred to the police authorities and may face more punishment.”
In the prisons of His Majesty Long Lartin are detained more than 500 inmates, some of them the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the Director of Prisons was hospitalized after being attacked by a detainee.
In October of last year, the class restoration units were called to the prison to suppress serious incidents that broke out, during which staff members were attacked with billiards balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (dry areas may be benefiting) <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
It's rare a tropical recession to hit Arizona, but that's exactly what's likely to happen early next week, as the remnants of Hurricane Rosa will cross the southwestern portions of the desert, bringing rain.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued emergency flood warning bulletins for Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to the south and east of Fethiye, Fethiye, South-Eastern California, and Ghouta.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to pass just above Phoenix on Tuesday, where it will arrive late on Monday with rain.
The National Meteorological Service of Phoenix noted in its tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have remained in a tropical storm or low barometric state at a distance of less than 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane less than 40 miles from the border of Arizona.
The latest models of the U.S. National Typhoon Center predict rainfall of 2 to 4 inches in height, with individual rain volumes of up to 6 inches in the Mongol Rim of Arizona.
In other areas of the Southwestern States, including the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, it is likely to experience rainfall of 1 to 2 inches in height, with a probability of individual total volumes of up to 4 volumes.
For areas that are not at risk of flooding, the rain that the Rose brings can be a blessing, as the area is hit by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious issue, a part of this rainfall is expected to be beneficial, as the Southwestern States are currently experiencing drought conditions.
“According to the U.S. Drought Observatory, more than 40 percent of Arizona is facing at least extreme drought, which is the second-highest category of drought,” weather.com reported.
First, Hurricane Rosa will land on the Baha California peninsula in Mexico.
Maintaining the intensity of the hurricane, on Sunday morning, Rosa will be 385 miles south of Mexico’s Punta Eugenia with maximum winds of 85 miles per hour and will move north at a speed of 12 miles per hour.
The storm will meet cooler waters in the Pacific and, therefore, will weaken.
Therefore, it is expected to reach the land in Mexico with a tropical storm intensity in the afternoon or evening of Monday.
There may be heavy rainfall in areas of Mexico, which will pose a significant risk of flooding.
"Total volumes of rainfall in the range of 3 to 6 inches from Baha California to northwestern Sonora are expected, which are likely to reach up to 10 inches," according to weather.com.
Subsequently, Rosa will head north across Mexico as a tropical storm and will reach the border of Arizona early on Tuesday morning as a tropical low-lying trout in the Barometric Range, which will then pass through Arizona.
“The main risk expected by Hurricane Rosa or its remnants is the very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the southwestern states of the United States,” the National Center for Reconstruction and Reconstruction said in a statement.
These rains are expected to cause dangerous heavy floods and mudslides in the deserts and landslides in the mountainous terrains.
Assault on Mintsomer Northon: Four Arrests for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old were arrested on suspicion of attempted homicide after the discovery of a 16-year-old man who was carrying knife wounds to Somerset.
The boy was found injured in the Exxelcior Tera area of Mintsomer Northon, about 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was transferred to the hospital, where he remains in a "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested overnight in the Randstock area, police in Avon and Somerset said.
The police are calling for anyone who may have recorded in a video on his mobile phone to be presented with what happened.
Trump says Kavanaugh has “lived the evil and anger” of the Democratic Party.
“The vote in favor of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote of rejection of the Democratic Party’s reckless and outrageous tactics,” Trump said at a rally in Willing, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "lived the evil and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the process of nominating him as a candidate.
Kavanaugh testified in Congress on Thursday, strongly denied and with apparent emotion the allegations of Christine Blaise Ford that she was sexually assaulted decades ago when she was a teenager.
Ford also filed a case in front of an audience for her allegations.
The president said on Saturday that the “American people saw the greatness, quality, and courage” of Kavanaugh that day.
"The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh's candidacy is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an excellent public service course," he said in a statement to the crowd of supporters.
The President indirectly referred to Kavanaugh’s candidacy, while speaking about the importance of the Republicans’ participation in the midterm elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I’m not a candidate, but it’s actually like I am,” he said.
"That's why I'm traveling everywhere, supporting excellent candidates."
Trump said the Democrats were on a "resistance and obstruction" mission.
The first major procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh’s candidacy is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior assistant staff member of the Republican Party’s leadership told CNN.
Hundreds of people were killed by earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia and the total number of casualties is expected to increase
At least 384 people were killed, many of whom were lured by the gigantic waves sweeping the coasts when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Sunday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a festival on the beach of the city of Palou on Friday, when waves of six meters high hit the land in the south, luring many to death and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami occurred after a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
"When the threat of a tsunami came out yesterday, the world was still on the beach and didn't run immediately, so it was hit by it," Sutopo Purgou Nugroho, a spokesman for the BNPB disaster management service in India, said in a statement.
"The tsunami didn't come by itself, it dragged cars, wood, houses, it hit everything on land," Nugrocho said, adding that the tsunami had traveled to the ocean at speeds of 800 km/h before it hit.
Some people climbed the trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were transported to 24 centres in Palo.
Aerial photographs published by the Disaster Management Service show many damaged buildings and shops, bridges that have collapsed and collapsed, and a dam surrounded by water.
Flooding continued to hit the coastal town on Saturday, according to Reuters.
Earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia’s BPPT, the Indonesian Technology Assessment and Implementation Service (BPPT), said in a statement that the energy released from Friday’s massive earthquake was about 200 times more powerful than the atomic bomb that fell on the island.
The geography of the city, which is at the end of a narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugrocho described the damage as "extended" and said hundreds of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He reported that piles of victims were found trapped under the debris of buildings that collapsed, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage may be greater along the coastline 300 km north of Pula, in an area called Dongala, which is closer to the quake's centre.
The communication systems "are completely out of place and there is no information" from Dongala, he said.
"More than 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading for the areas that were affected.
“It’s already a tragedy and it can get even worse,” he said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not reporting that a tsunami had hit the island, although officials said the waves had arrived by the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video posted on social media, a man on the top floor of a building is heard screaming in a panic trying to warn people down the road about the coming tsunami.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water hits the coast, dragging houses and cars.
The Reuters news agency was unable to immediately verify the authenticity of the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage, which also disrupted communications in the wider area of the island, making it difficult to coordinate rescue efforts by the authorities.
The army has begun to send cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the deportees still need desperate food and other basic types of first aid.
The city’s airport has been reopened only to contribute to relief efforts and will remain closed until October, according to Reuters.
President Joe Biden’s visit to the evacuation centres in Palo Alto is scheduled for Sunday.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia exceeds 800.
The situation is very bad.
Although the staff of the World Vision organization from Dongala managed to reach the city of Palou safely, where the workers found shelter in shelters from murals built in the lobby of their office, they went through scenes of disaster on their way.
“They told me they saw a lot of damaged houses,” he said.
The situation is very bad.
While some relief groups have taken on the sad task of starting the process of relief of the wounded, some complain that it has not been sent to foreigners, especially experienced workers in the field of providing assistance to the victims of the disease.
According to the regulations of Indonesia, the flow of funding, supplies and personnel from abroad can only begin if the site of a disaster is declared a zone of national disaster. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
That hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government says it’s a national disaster, we can address a request for international assistance, but there’s no relevant decision yet.”
As the second day in Palo passed after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday, friends and family of those still missing still hope that their loved ones will be the miracle that will make the story of these natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under rubble for two days, next to her mother’s dead body.
Genton Subadno, head coach of Indonesia's national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paratroopers for the Asian Games, which were completed earlier this year in the year.
Other people who were trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mantaghi, were his pupils.
"As an elder in the sport of sliding parachute, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Ghent told how, when news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel in the sloped climbing community was released, he began to send desperate messages to his rivals in Palo Alto.
However, the mark next to his messages was a gray symbol "n", instead of two blues.
"I think that means the messages weren't delivered," he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 during the delivery of an automatic pick-up machine in Newport de Levi.
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from an employee of Brink who was supplying an ATM machine to Newport de Levy, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the vehicle had evacuated an ATM machine at the entertainment complex and was preparing to deliver more money, police officer Dennis McCarthy said in a statement.
While he was busy, another man "came running after Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money destined for delivery.
Witnesses saw many suspects flee the scene, according to the statement, but the police did not specify the number of those involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identity should contact the Newport Police Department by calling 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper Changes His Name to Yee
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Yee.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “The being that is officially known as Kanye West.”
West, 41, has been listening to the hysterical Jee for a long time and used this pseudonym as a title on his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change preceded his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album titled Yandhi.
She replaces singer Ariana Grande on the show, who canceled her appearance for "emotional reasons," as the show's creator said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of the professional name he uses today, West had stated in the past that the word has religious significance for him.
"I believe that the word 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, where it means 'you', West said earlier this year, in a discussion about the title of his album with radio producer Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm us, I'm us.
My name changes from Kanye, which means "the one" to Yee, which is just a reflection of the good, the evil, the confused self, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.”
He is one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sin Cobbs is known by various names, such as Pope Dundee, P. Dindy or Dedee, but this year announced that he prefers the names Lav and Brader Lav.
A former West associate, ZEI-ZI, is also satisfied with the use of his name with or without captions and capital letters.
Mexico's President-elect vows not to use the military against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andrés Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military violence against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody student repression.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador promised on Saturday in the Plaza de Toledo that he would “never use the military to oppress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, troops fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people, in a period when the left-wing student movements were gaining roots throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to those who are studying and by opening more free public universities to the public.
He said that unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities are driving young people towards the criminal gangs.
U.S. Should Double Funding for Artificial Intelligence <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
As China is more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. will have to double the amount it spends on research in this field, says Google, an investor and professional in the field of artificial intelligence, which has Apple.
This comment is coming to be added to announcements by various parties of the U.S. government on artificial intelligence, as the U.S. does not have an official strategy for artificial intelligence at all.
In the meantime, China unveiled last year its plan to become the first country in the world to innovate in the field of artificial intelligence by 2030.
“Doubling the research budget for artificial intelligence would be a good start, given that all other countries are so much left behind by the U.S. and we are looking to make the next major discovery in the field of artificial intelligence,” he said.
The doubling of the budget could double the chances of the next big achievement in the field of artificial intelligence taking place in the United States, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book is titled “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” (The Superpowers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order of Things) has been published in his book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order of Things.”
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an artificial intelligence system that defeated the best American player Othello, and later was a Microsoft Research executive and chairman of the Google Attachment in China.
Lee recognized the importance of previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Advanced Research Projects for Defense (DARPA), and was asked when the next one will be held, so that the next one could be held.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to get state grants, Lee said.
“It’s not China that gets the best in the academic field, it’s companies,” he said.
Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have hired authorities from universities to work on artificial intelligence issues in the last few years, according to the report.
Lee argued that changes to the immigration policy could also help the U.S. to support its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence (AI).
“I believe that a green card should be automatically offered to holders of a Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence,” he said.
The State Council of China adopted a Plan for the Development of Next-Generation Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China provides funding to people in academic institutions such as the National Science Foundation and other non-governmental organizations, such as the National Science Foundation, and other non-governmental organizations, such as the National Science Foundation and the National Science Foundation of China.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which will be joined by partners from the business and academic world, and the U.S. White House has announced the formation of a Joint Research Centre.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next, the company said.
The U.S. National Science Foundation is currently investing more than $100 million a year in research in the field of artificial intelligence (AI).
In the meantime, there has been no progress in U.S. legislation for months with the aim of creating a National Security Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
The citizens of the Republic of Macedonia hold a referendum to decide whether to change the name of the country
The people of FYROM took part in a referendum on Sunday to decide whether the country will be renamed a "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would lead to a decades-long disagreement in the European Union with Greece, which had blocked the candidacy.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of the northern neighbouring country represents a demand on its territory and has exercised a veto on its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached a deal in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of the population of the Democratic Republic of Congo.
President George Ivanov has said he will not participate in the referendum and a boycott campaign has raised doubts as to whether the participation will reach the required 50 percent in order for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the ballot was as follows: "You are in favour of joining NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece."
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price that deserves to be paid in order to pursue the accession of the OSCE to organizations such as the EU and NATO for the Democratic Republic of Congo.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, so that the young people of FYROM can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because so the lives of all of us will be safer," she said in a statement.
Although it is not legally binding, several Members of Parliament have stated that they will comply with the result of the vote so that it becomes final.
A two-thirds majority in parliament is required to change the name.
The state election committee said there were no reports of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, participation reached just 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, so it gave the present 66 per cent of the registered voters. (more...)
“I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Jose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
The Prime Minister of FYROM, Zoraf Zaev, his wife Zorika and son Dusk<0xC3><0xB3> voted in the referendum on the change of the name of the country in the country in Sept, which will pave the way for the country's accession to NATO and the European Union.
In front of the Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepares a small scene and places chairs in front of scenes set up by those who will boycott the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join head-to-head, not as second-class partners," Kavardarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia, and become a member of the Eurasian Union.”
Prime Minister Zaef said that NATO membership will bring long-awaited investments to the country, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
"I believe the overwhelming majority will be in favour, as more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
He said a positive result would be "confirmation of our mallow".
According to a poll published last Monday by the Institute of Political Research of the Republic of Macedonia, 30 to 43 per cent of voters would participate in the referendum, i.e., lower than the required turnout.
According to another poll carried out by the TV station Telma TV in FYROM, 57 percent of the respondents were planning to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote in favour.
In order for the referendum to be successful, participation must reach 50 per cent plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first serious blow to the policy of the neighbouring government, since its incumbent in power last May.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Avero passes all of Brighton's defense to score a goal
Sergio Avero and Rahim Sterling represented Brighton's defense by a 2–0 win over Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Averos showed he scored easily in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker got a pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the phase.
He passed three of Brighton's defenders before he escaped into the open.
After that, Averro was found surrounded by four green players, and he was surrounded by four green players.
He passed one defender in a sledgehammer, then escaped from several others on the edge of the large area of Brighton.
Then he gave a pass to his left, finding Sterling.
The English forward made his first move in the area by returning the ball to Averos, who used his right foot to beat the goalkeeper of Brighton Matthew Ryan, scoring on the right side of the field.
"Averos is facing some problems in his legs," City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We said he'd play 55 to 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky to have scored a goal at the time.”
However, it was Sterling who gave the blues the initial advantage in the Premier League battle.
This goal came in the 29th minute.
Averos got the ball deep in the Brighton area at this stage.
He sent a beautiful ball along the left-hand side to Leroy Sane.
Shane held the ball in his possession and led Sterling to the back of the bar.
The Forward of the Blues kicked the ball into the net just before he got out.
City will face Hofenheim in the Champions League on Tuesday at 12:55 a.m. at the Rain-Nekar Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Sergeant wants to beat the Rockies.
As the Niassionals were excluded from the playoffs, there was no reason to try to make another start.
But the ever-competitive Sergeant hopes to play Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still impacts for the Rockies in the playoffs as they advance to a Los Angeles Dodgers game.
The Rockies have passed the playoffs with their 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they still want to lock in the first place in their category.
“Although we don’t have anything to win, at least we can play knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the fans and the other team will probably be a game of the highest level that we will face.
Why wouldn’t I want to fight in a fight like this?”
The Nationals have not yet announced who the original rapper will be on Sunday, but it is reported that they tend to let Cerzer throw the ball.
Cerzer, who will make his 34th start, made coaching throws on Thursday and will play on Sunday, which is normally a day off for him.
The right-hander from Washington has a performance of 18-7 with an average of 2.53 points (ERA) and 300 outs due to a strike in 220 2/3 periods this season.
<0xE2><0x86><0x90> Trump holds a speech in West Virginia <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The President indirectly referred to the situation regarding his selected candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, in his speech on the importance of the participation of Republicans in the midterm elections.
"Everything we've done has been going on in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important electoral processes in our lives.
"This is a very important moment, I'm not a candidate, but it's actually like I am, and that's why I travel everywhere to support excellent candidates," he said.
Trump went on to say: “You see this miserable, miserable radical group of Democrats, you see what’s going on right now.
And they're determined to take back power by any means necessary, and you see evil, misery.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to destroy to take power and control, because what they want is power and control, and we’re not going to give it to them.”
The Democrats, he said, have undertaken a “resistance and obstruction” mission.
"And you've seen this in the last four days," he said, characterizing Democrats as "angry and evil, miserable and liars."
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee by naming Senator Diane Feinstein, a report that was accepted with possible disapproval from the public.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you uncover the document?
Oh, oh, what?
No, oh no, I'm waiting for an answer. That was a really bad use of body language, the worst use of body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a broad grouping.
It is not tolerant of those who express their opinion.
It did not surprise me at all that activists of the Momentum movement in my local group voted to give me a mute.
In addition, I am the last of a series of Labour MPs who have been told that they are not welcome, precisely because we are saying our opinion.
My fellow Member, Joan Ryan, had similar treatment, because she was resolutely opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, my impeachment proposal was criticised for arguing with Jeremy Corbyn.
For the importance of a responsible economic policy, for national security, for Europe, paradoxically, on issues similar to those on which Jeremy had disagreed with previous leaders.
The invitation to the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday said that “we want our meetings to be productive with the participation of all.”
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, the meetings of the General Committee on Friday night were just like that.
Unfortunately, today is not that tone of many meetings and the promise of a “more compassionate, more compassionate” policy has long been forgotten, if it ever really began to be implemented.
It is increasingly evident that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is accepted by the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremiah became chief, as colleagues with whom I had previously thought that we had similar political views began to expect me to take a 180-degree turn in the future, and to adopt opinions with which I would not have been able to do so.
Every time I spoke in public, no matter what I was really saying, I heard an outcry on social media, where some people demanded my rejection, rejected the center’s policy and told me that I shouldn’t be a member of the Labour Party.
And that didn't just happen to me.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than other colleagues, as the comments that were addressed to me were usually political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face a stream of sexist or racist attacks on a daily basis, but never give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era in politics is how offenses are now seen as normalcy.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should encourage a culture of tolerance, and that it should be a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer a broad class, and that with every proposition of mutilation or change in the rules of selection, the party's boundaries are narrowing.
I have been advised many times in the last two years not to stand up, not to talk too much and that so "everything will be okay".
But I didn't go into politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party, 32 years ago, as a student still, because of the neglect shown by the Thatcher government which literally led to the failure of the whole of my class of underprivileged, my intention was to defend better underprivileged.
I never hid my politics, and I did the same in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been confused in any way with regard to my political views and my points of disagreement with today’s leadership.
To those of you who put forward the mop proposal on Friday, all I have to say is that, while the country is facing a Brexit that will hurt our households, businesses and public service agencies, I don’t understand the desire to waste time and energy on it.
But, really, my only message is not addressed to the members of the Momentum movement in Nottingham, but to my voters, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of rejection or political rejection

Air - Melrose: 38 - 17: The unbeaten Air climbs to the top
Two late goals may have somewhat distorted the final result, but there’s no doubt that Ire deserved to triumph in this highly entertaining today’s Teddy’s championship game.
It is now at the top of the ranking, the only undefeated team out of the ten.
In the end, it was her superior defense, as well as the best use of opportunities, that set the balance in favor of the pitchers and coach Peter Murci had every reason to be satisfied.
“We’ve been tested in our games so far and we’re still invincible, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robin Christy of Melrose said: “Congratulations to the Air, they took advantage of the opportunities better than we did.”
The goal of Grand Anderson in the 14th minute, with the conversion of Fraser Climo, brought the Air ahead, but a yellow card to the Scotsman Rory Hughes, a midfielder, who was also tied for the game by the Warriors.
Climate boosted Air's lead with a penalty, before scoring, just in half time, a goal with a conversion, leading Air to the dressing room with a score of 17-5.
But Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's goal, with Baycott's conversion, reduced the lead by five points.
There was a long wait due to a serious injury to Roryd Not, who was removed with a carrier, and, after the reboot, Ir further increased the difference with a goal of Stafford McDowell, with a conversion of the Climate.
Substitute leader Blair McFerson then took the yellow card and Melrose took advantage of the numerical advantage again with Bruce Colvin's goal without conversion, after a period of intense pressure.
The pitchers returned, however, and when Strouan Hutchinson took a yellow card for tackling the climate without the ball, from the penalty line, McFerson scored a goal in the back of the attack that was sent off.
The climate has undergone a transformation, as it has done again almost since the restart, after Kylie Rowe first picked up David Armstrong's kick and sent the extra-goal Gregor Henry away for the first time.
Still Game Protagonist Begins a New Career in Focus
The protagonist of the series Still Game, Ford Kieran, is ready to jump into the industry of focus, after it has been revealed that he has been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays the role of Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, which he writes and co-stars with his longtime partner in the comedy Greg Hubble.
The couple announced that the upcoming fifth cycle will be the last of the show, and it appears that Kieran is planning his life after Gaegleland.
According to official records, he is the director of the company Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the information, although a Scottish Sun source alleged that Kiernan wanted to deal with the "blowing industry of focus" in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": The enclosed Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Marines patrol at the fully-equipped naval headquarters in La Paz.
There are blue flags floating in public buildings.
At the bases of the navy from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon is written the motto: "The sea belongs to us rightfully.
It's our duty to get her back."
Throughout Bolivia, the memory of the coastline that Chile acquired after a bloody conflict for the exploitation of natural resources in the 19th century is still alive, as is the desire of the people of the Naxos Islands.
These hopes have been raised today more than ever for decades, as Bolivia awaits the International Court of Justice’s decision on October 1st after five years of consultations.
“Bolivia has the dynamic, a spirit of unity and calm, and of course it expects the result with a positive outlook,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the judgment of the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country, in the hope that the Court of Justice of The Hague will adjudicate in favour of a resolution on the request of Bolivia to oblige Chile, after
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who is giving a controversial battle for his re-election next year, has a lot to gain or lose from Monday’s decision.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to rule in favor of Bolivia and that, even if it did, they would not change much.
The UN body in the Netherlands does not have the power to give thousands of territories and has made it clear that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the International Court of Justice’s decision is to be issued just six months after the final arguments were presented suggests that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And instead of further advancing Bolivia’s goals, the past four years may have undermined them.
"Today's Bolivian government has made the issue of access to the sea more acute," Zarate said in a statement.
Morales’ aggressive rhetoric has exhausted every remaining goodwill of Chile, he said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to have discussions after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Velze, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision-making process was unusually fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will be given “an excellent opportunity to launch a new era of relations with Chile” and the opportunity to “end 139-year disputes with mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of Latin America’s most popular leaders, is using the issue of going out to sea as a political dean.
"Bolivia will never be denied its right to access the Pacific Ocean," he said.
The decision is an opportunity to see that we have to go beyond the past.”
North Korea Says There Will Be No Nuclear Disarmament If It Cannot Trust The U.S.
North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, says his state will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if it can't trust Washington to do so.
Rey spoke to the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to deliver on the promises made during a summit in Singapore by the leaders of the two countries.
Ri made these remarks while U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears ready to restart the nuclear diplomacy that had come to an end, three months after the meeting in Singapore, Mr. Kea, with Mr. North’s leader.
Ri says the view that the ongoing sanctions and the U.S. refusal to declare the end of the Korean War will at some point force the North to “slow down” is a dream of a summer night.
Washington is hesitant to agree to the relevant declaration if Pyongyang does not make significant disarmament moves first.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit to be held.
But there is widespread scepticism about whether Pyongyang is seriously considering renouncing an arsenal that the country most likely sees as the only means to guarantee its security.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit in the country.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest trends in oversized hats that will soon be available at a store near you.
If you want to enlarge the collection of hats you have or avoid the sun completely, then stop looking for them.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown presented a series of strange oversized hats to the parlor for their Spring-Summer 2019 collection that stole the show at Fashion Week in Paris.
Extremely inconvenient hats popped up on Instagram this summer and their designers sent their impressive creations across the board.
The piece that stood out from Valentino was an exaggerated beige hat decorated with a wide can with wings that completely covered the head of the models.
Among other oversized accessories were handcuffs decorated with stones, a magic hat, even a pineapple, but these are not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also presented a series of strange masks, about the time for Halloween.
Many of the multi-colored masks had sewn lips and were more suited to Hannibal Lecter than to high-sweat fashion.
One creation brought to mind full scuba gear with a ventilator and glasses, while another looked like melted ice cream in a bucket.
And if you want to adopt this fashion style with the huge accessories, you are in luck.
Stylists foresee that these huge hats could get to central shopping streets near you. . . .
The oversized hats made their appearance very quickly after "La Boba", the sleek hat with the too wide skirt that we've seen so many wear, from Riana to Emily Rataikovsky.
The popular brand that created the extremely inconvenient hat that housed the social media has sent another great creation to the parlour, a beach bag almost as big as the model that wears it wearing it.
The dark orange shelves bag, decorated with shelves and a white leather handle, was the piece that stood out from the collection La Riviera in Spring-Summer 2019 by Jacquemus in Ebro.
Stylist Luke Armitaz told the FEMAIL column: "I look forward to seeing big hats and big beach bags in the shopping malls this summer," as the designer made such a big impression that he would be happy to see.
John Edward: Language Skills are Necessary for the Citizens of the World
The independent schools of Scotland have a history of academic excellence, which continued in 2018, with yet another series of excellent results in the exams, which have only been further reinforced by my personal and collective achievements in the athletics.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, which are represented by the Council of Independent Schools of Scotland (SCIS), strive to provide the best possible level of service to their students and parents.
The goal of the independent schools is to prepare their students for the next and higher educational degrees, the professional career they will choose and their position as citizens of the world. -
As an educational sector that can design and implement a school curriculum to order, we see that modern languages are still a popular and desirable course of choice in the schools. -
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you speak to someone in a language they understand, then what you say goes into their head.
If you speak to him in his own language, what you say goes into his heart.”
This is a strong reminder that we can’t just rely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries, and we can’t just rely on English.
Based on the recent results of this year’s exams, we find that languages are at the top of the performance charts, with the highest success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of pupils who studied foreign languages graduated with a bachelor’s degree in A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of the pupils graduated with a bachelor’s degree in Mandarin, while 72 percent of the pupils also studied German, and 69 percent of the pupils studied German.
This proves that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that will undoubtedly be needed by children and young people in the future, according to the report.
Languages today, as a course of choice, are considered to be as important as courses relating to science, technology, engineering and mathematics in the study programmes of independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK’s Employment and Skills Committee found that, as far as the reasons why employers were finding it difficult to fill vacancies were concerned, 17 percent of the class concerned a lack of language rights.
Therefore, the need to acquire language skills is becoming more and more urgent, so that young people are prepared for their future professional careers.
Since more future employment opportunities require language proficiency, these skills are essential in a globalized world, and they are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career one chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future, because of this skill that he will be able to take advantage of throughout his life.
If one is able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries, then automatically this multilingual person will have an advantage over the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent of those surveyed were not able to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, while French was the only bilingual language in the UK.
For this reason, investing in language teaching today is important for today’s children.
Knowledge of many languages, in particular the languages of the developing economies, will give children better opportunities to find employment with meaning. . . .
In Scotland, each school will teach a variety of different languages.
Some schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are deemed to be more important for the UK with a 2020 horizon, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child is interested in, there will always be some languages to choose from in the independent schools, which have specialized teaching staff in this area.
Scotland’s independent schools provide with dedication a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds for them. -
It cannot be denied today that, in a global business environment, languages continue to be extremely important for the future of the country, so this reality should be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be regarded as truly "international communication skills" . . .
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, multiculturalism, and excellence for the young people of Scotland . . .
They have to do it.
John Edward is the Director of the Councils of Independent Schools of Scotland.
LeBron will make his Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego, California.
The wait for fans who are eager to see LeBron make his first appearance with the Los Angeles Lakers has almost come to an end.
Lakers head coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the first game on Sunday ahead of the season against Denver Naguets in San Diego.
However, it has not yet been decided how many minutes he will play.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48," Walton told the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell wrote on Twitter that James is likely to be playing for a few minutes.
After training a few days ago, James was asked about his plans for the six-game program that the Lakers had to give before the race season.
“I don’t need preparation games at this stage of my career to prepare,” he said.
Trump's Concentration in West Virginia, YouTube Channel <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
President Donald Trump is launching a series of gatherings starting at Willings, West Virginia, in the United States.
It will be Trump’s first of five planned gatherings next week, which includes tours of friendly surroundings such as Tennessee and Mississippi, according to Reuters.
With the vote confirming his choice for the Supreme Court to be pending, Trump is seeking to boost popular support for the upcoming mid-term elections, as his fellow Republicans are in danger of losing him. (more...)
What time is Trump’s rally in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump’s rally in Willing, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s concentration in West Virginia online below through a live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to be referred to this week's hearings on the candidate for the position in the Supreme Court, Bret Kavanaugh, who was held in a tight-knit atmosphere for a long time due to allegations of sexual misconduct.
However, the primary goal of this series of rallies is to help the Republicans who are facing ambiguous outcomes in the November elections in order to gain some momentum.
So, the campaign staff of President Trump said that these five gatherings next week are aimed at "mobilizing volunteers and supporters, as the Republicans in the U.S. have been trying to protect and expand them," according to Reuters.
“Congress control is so critical to its agenda that the president travels to as many states as possible as we are going into the busy period of the campaign,” Trump’s campaign spokesperson told Reuters in a statement.
The gathering scheduled for tonight at the Wesbanco Arena in Willing could bring back supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract coverage from the Pittsburgh News media," according to the West Me newspaper.
Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state he won with a difference of more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate in West Virginia for the U.S. Senate, who is low on polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come and try to give him a push to the gallows,” Simon Hender, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, said in a statement.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team has the nerve to fight by keeping hopes alive as it walks into Sunday's singles
After three one-sided games, Saturday afternoon’s quarterfinals might have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The fluctuating suspension of the pulse is a completely inventive sporting idea, but players believe it deeply, and especially in such encounters.
Where would they say the tremor is now?
“It was six degrees ahead and now it’s four, so we probably have a little momentum,” Jordan Spith said as he left for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, to go ahead with four points and stay in the game with twelve more points.
Americans, as Spith says, feel the “air in their canvasses” and have a lot to encourage them, such as the twin Spith and Justin Thomas who played together all day long and each broke three degrees out of the four.
Spith was deadly from tee to green and gives the example.
The voices of the celebrations became louder as he continued his round, achieving a critical blow to get the game four all-square when he and Thomas were down two after two.
The hit with which they won the game on the 15th was accompanied by similar celebrations that show his conviction that the American team is not out.
“You have to look deep inside you and worry about your own game,” Spith said.
That’s what every player has left.
Eighteen holes to write a story.
The only players with the most scores from Spith and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flitwood, the undisputed history of the Ryder Cup.
The bizarre but adorable twin of Europe has won four out of four and seems to do nothing wrong.
The "Mollywood" was the only twin that didn't hit the bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided the bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
This game, as well as the way in which the energy seems to flow to and from the noisy spectators, underlines the fact that it is the players who are supposed to win the game on Sunday and that there is no more popular player than Flintwood or Mowgli.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
The debate on European glory is still an early one.
Baba Watson and Webb Simpson put their glasses on Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning fourball, when he played with Alex Noren.
With a bogey and two doubles on the front nine they had the Spaniard and the Swede so deep in a hole that they couldn’t get out of it.
But on Sunday, there will be no one to help you get out of your hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are so engaging games to watch them closely due to the interactions between couples, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give and how a strategy can change in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has a significant lead in the last day, but this foursome also showed that the U.S. team has the courage, despite some doubts.
Europe takes the lead 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a good advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after its fourball lead and Saturday's foursome with 10-6 against the United States.
The inspired twins Tommy Flitwood and Francesco Molinari made a comeback with two victories against a struggling Tiger Woods and managed to take the lead at Le Golf National so far to four degrees.
The European side of Thomas Byorn, who is trying to keep the trophy he lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the unscathed American side in the morning fourball, with a 3-1 series.
The U.S. resisted the foursome more, winning two games, but could not cover the difference.
Jim Furrick's side needs eight points out of Sunday's 12 singles matches to keep the trophy.
Flitchwood is the first European newcomer to win a four-degree series, while along with Molinari, also known as "Mollywood", he is the first-timer to appear on a shocking weekend.
Having smashed Woods and Patrick Reid into fourballs, they joined forces to defeat a tired Woods and American newcomer Brian DeShampoo with an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who was drawn in Saturday's two games, showed occasional bursts of brilliance, but has now lost 19 of his 29 games in fourball and foursome and seven series.
Justin Rose, who was rested for the morning fourball, returned to fellow player Henry Stanson for the foursome with 2&1 defeats by Justin Johnson and Brooks Kepka, scoring first and third place in the world.
Not everything went well for Europe, despite the pleasant, cool day south-west of Paris.
The three-time winner Jordan Spith and Justin Thomas set the bar for the Americans by two points on Saturday.
They won a difficult 2&1 victory over John Ram and Ian Poulter of Spain in the fourball and later returned to beat the Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursome while losing both holes in the foursome.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history a team was able to recover while losing by four points in the singles, although because he is the competitor, Furick is enough to score a draw to keep the trophy.
However, after being in second place for two days, it seems that a Sunday counter-attack is out of their reach.
North Korea Says It Won’t Disarm Unilaterally Without Confidence Measures
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the ongoing sanctions deepen the sense of distrust towards the United States and that his country is not going to give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally, according to Reuters.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organization's annual general assembly that North Korea had taken "significant measures of goodwill" in the past year, including the cessation of nuclear and ballistic tests, the abolition of nuclear weapons.
"However, we do not see any corresponding response from the United States," he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and under such conditions, there is no way to unilaterally start our disarmament.”
While Ri reiterated North Korea’s known grievances about Washington’s resistance to the possibility of a “stage” approach to de-nuclearization, he argued that North Korea would not be rewarded as it progressed gradually.
Ri referred to Kim Jong Un's and Donald Trump's joint press release at the first summit held between a U.S. president in office and a North Korean leader in South Korea on June 12, when Kim pledged to work in Singapore on June 12.
North Korea is seeking to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first “deliver” its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls for a loosening of the tough international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
“The U.S. insists on being ‘first denuclearized’ and increases pressure by threatening sanctions to achieve their goal by blackmailing, even putting obstacles to the ‘demonstration of the end of the war,’” he said.
“The perception that sanctions can knee us is a dream of those who don’t know us.
“But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions deepen our distrust.”
Ri did not make any reference to a planned second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader pointed out to the United Nations earlier this week.
The minister, however, noted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If the partner in the matter of nuclear decommissioning had been in the country, it would have been South Korea, not the United States, but the United States.
Even so, the tone of Ri’s speech was very different from last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that the targeting of the U.S. inland air defense missiles by North Korea was an “inevitable” consequence.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who threatened last year to "totally destroy" North Korea, won Kim's tribute for his courage to go ahead with the measures to disarm, but he said there must be much more to do.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timetable for it, saying "If it takes two years, three years, or five months, it's okay."
China and Russia argue that the U.N. Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures it has taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that “the imposition of sanctions by the Security Council must continue intensively and uninterruptedly until the full and final is reached.”
The Security Council unanimously approved sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an effort to neutralize the funding of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs (NPP) in the country.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times already this year, but his last trip didn’t go well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying that progress had been made, to be denounced by North Korea a few hours later that he had “the demands of a gangster.”
North Korea has pledged in a meeting with Moon this month to decommission a missile facility and also a nuclear complex, if the United States has taken "corresponding measures".
He explained that Kim told him that the "corresponding measures" he was pursuing were security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore and promote normalization of relations with Washington.
<0xE2><0x86><0x90> Harvard Students Take Lessons on How to Get Enough Rest
This year, a new course at the University of Harvard seeks all undergraduate students to sleep more in an effort to combat the growing mass of culture of all-night study by consuming a lot of coffee.
One academic discovered that students at the number one university in the world often don’t know the basics, such as how to take care of themselves.
Charles Chaisler, a professor of breathing medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is his first of its kind in the United States.
She was inspired to start the class after a speech on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
"In the end, a girl came up to me and said, 'Why am I learning about this just now, in my last year?'
She said that no one had ever talked to her about the importance of sleep — something that surprised me,” she told The Telegraph.
The course, which began for the first time this year, explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits contribute to academic and athletic performance, as well as to improving overall well-being.
Paul Barrera, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said that the university’s undergraduate student had decided to include the course when it was found to be in the university.
The one-hour course includes a range of interactive tasks.
In a section there is the image of a student bedroom, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes and books, to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light, how the athletic episodes affect the effects of caffeine and light.
In another section, participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, cerebral palsy, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their day-to-day routines.
“We know that the behavior of the students will not change immediately.
We believe, however, that they have a right to know, just as you have a right to know the health impacts when you choose to smoke,” added Professor Chaisler.
The culture of being proud because you studied all night still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students means that deprivation of sleep is a problem that inflates.
Sufficient sleep, of good quality, should be the "secret weapon" of students to fight stress, exhaustion and stress, he said, even to avoid insomnia and weight loss, as deprivation of sleep puts the brain to the test.
Raymond Shaw, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Chaisler design the course, having attended one of his last year’s classes, his first year at Harvard.
He said that his class opened his eyes and inspired him to push for a class all over the campus. He said that he was going to have a class.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all graduate students to attend a similar program before they begin their studies at this highly competitive educational institution. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Professor Chassler advised students to set up an alert for the time they should go to sleep, as well as an alarm clock for the time of waking up, and to know the harmful consequences of the "blue light" emitted by it.
Livenston - Rangers 1-0: Menga scores on Gerard's men
The Rangers suffered another sad off-field defeat as Dolly Menga's shot led to Steven Gerard's discoordinated side in a 1–0 defeat at Livingston.
Ibrox's team wanted to score their first away win from the February triumph with 4-1 at St. John'stown, but Garry Holt's team is in the first, 18 in the first, just his second defeat.
Menga hit seven minutes before the half-time, and the Rangers' inspired roster seemed incompetent to pay back.
While the Rangers are now dropping to sixth place, Levingston is climbing to third, with just one goal away from the previous Hibernian.
And Rangers may be in further trouble, as Superintendent Callum Spencer was forced to get first aid for a head injury caused by an object that was thrown off the stand.
Gerard made eight changes to the team's make-up and horrified Air in the semifinals for the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same "Livy 11" composition that he got a grade from Hart's last week and would be happy with how this well-oiled machine was able to squeeze every effort of his opponents.
The Rangers may have dominated the possession, but Livingston did more with the ball.
He should have scored in the second minute, when Menga's first long-distance pass sent Scott Pittman into Alan McGregor's area, but the average didn't find the ball.
A deep free kick from Kigan Jacobs found Chief Craig Halket, but fellow defender Alan Lithgow's all he could do was send the ball away from the goal.
The Rangers took control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith for the game in the final third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly believed he should have won a penalty in the 15's, as he clashed with Steven Lowelles, but referee Steven Thompson ignored the Colombian's grievances.
Reedgers had only two shots in the area in the first half, but Ibrox’s former goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, wasn’t worried at all about the head of Lasana Koulimbali and Ovi Etzaria’s hypotonic shot.
Although in the first 34 minutes of the match, Libya was clearly below expectations, no one can deny that it was worth the win for the effort alone.
Once again, Rangers failed to deal with Jacobs's problem.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Deklan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool and found Menga who simply completed the effort. (more...)
Gerard made changes to the half-time by taking out Kulimbali and putting on Ryan Kent. The change was almost immediately delivered, as the extram passed the ball to Morellos, but the impressive Kelly ran off the line for him.
However, Livingston continued to lure guests into the style of the game she knows and enjoys, with the Leagues and Halket moving away from one distant ball after another.
Holt's side could've increased the difference towards the end, but McGregor faced Jacobs straight, stopping him before Lithgow's attempt at the corner.
Rangers' replacement, Glenn Middleton, had another phase for a penalty to the end, as he clashed with Jacobs, but again Thompson ignored it.
Almanac: The Inventor of the Geiger Meter
A page from the Almanach Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882: as today, 136 years ago and WHITE... the day that the future physicist Johan Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, and this invention eventually led to the device that is now known as the Geiger Meter.
A pillar of science since then, Gauger has gone into the sphere of pop culture, as in the 1950 film called Bells of Coronado, starring the improbable Cowboy Scientists Roy Rogers.
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger meter, which is used to detect radioactive metal elements, such as uranium.
When you wear these headphones, you hear the action of people caused by radioactivity in the metallic elements.”
Evans: "Look, he's acting crazy!"
Hans Geiger passed away in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the invention that bears his name continues its work.
New Cancer Vaccine Teaches the Immune to “See” Problem Cells <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
New Cancer Vaccine Teaches the Immune System to "See" the Problem Cells and Kill Them
Vaccine Teaches the Immune to Recognize Problem Cells in Treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their modification in the laboratory.
They can "give" a protein that is common in different types of cancer and then re-inject them.
A vaccine under test presents promising results in patients with a variety of types of cancers.
A woman who received treatment with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize problematic cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months, according to the study.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient, modifying them in the laboratory so that they "see" a protein common to many cancers, which is called HER2, and then re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzovski, from the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “The results show that we have a very promising vaccine in our hands.”
As Professor Berzovski explained, the protein HER2 “is the driving force for the development of several types of cancer,” such as breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer.
A similar approach in which immune cells are extracted from patients and then "teached" how to target cancer cells has been used to treat a type of leukemia.
Kanye West defended himself against Trump, wearing a hat with the motto MAGA, after his appearance on SNL.
It didn't go very well.
Kanye West was dismissed in the studio during a Saturday Night Live after an out-of-pocket interview in which he honored U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in the 2020 election.
After presenting his third song for the evening, entitled Ghost Town, in which he wore a baseball cap with the slogan Make America Great Again (Let's Make America Great Again), he gave a recital against the D's.
"I often talk to a white man and he says, 'But how do you like Trump? He's a racist.'
“If I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL opened with a sketch in which Matt Damon starred, with Hollywood star, to dispute the testimony of Brett Cavanaugh before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of sex.
Although it was not broadcast, the video of West's rapping was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock tried to compromise West with this smear.
Also, West protested to the public that he had not behaved well in the background because of his hat.
"I was bowling in the background.
They said, "Don't go out with your hat."
I've been bowling!
And they say I don't know what's going on with me," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "I don't know what's going on with me? I'm going to wear the superman's cape, because no one will be able to tell me what to do.
“Try the love.”
His comments were rejected at least twice by the public and SNL's coefficients seemed to be in a difficult position, Variety reported, with one person stating to the magazine: "In the whole studio there was a fatality."
West was called in as a replacement for singer-songwriter Ariana Grande, whose former friend, rapper McMiller, had died a few days earlier.
West confuses several when he sings I Love It dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West was backed by Kantas Turner, head of the TPUSA conservative group, who tweeted: "To one of the most courageous spirits: WE HAVE TO BE RELIEFED IN THE WORLD."
However, the show's presenter, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West was just "his self and that's great".
"But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his 'art') who I believe is embracing and embracing an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And so do we,” he added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he is no longer "the creature that was previously known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Debbie, also known as Pope Debbie, Paphy and P. Debbie.
The rapper Snoop Dogg had changed his name to Snoop Leopold and of course the music legend Prince had changed his name first to a symbol and then to The Artist Formerly Known As Prince.
Category of attempted murder for the attack with a knife on a restaurant in Belfast <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a knife attack on a man at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Balikhakamor, according to the police.

The charges will be investigated by the D.A.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harrington criticises toxic masculinity
Keith Harrington is known for his role as swordfighter John Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series, Game of Thrones.
However, the actor, 31, criticises the stereotype of the hero's batch, saying that such roles on the screen pass on to young boys the message that they will have to be tough to earn the respect.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture magazine, Kit said "something's wrong" and wondered how the problem of toxic masculinity could be tackled in the time of <0x23>MeToo.
Keith, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star, Rose Leslie, also 31, has admitted to having a "strong opinion" on the matter.
"Personally, now, I believe it very much. Where did we go wrong with masculinity?" he said.
“What do we learn from men as they grow up about the problem we see now?”
Keith believes that television may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to the masculine characters it promotes.
He continued: "What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television and in the streets, which makes young boys feel that they need to show such behavior in order to be men?
I think it's one of the big questions of our time. How can we change that?
“There’s something wrong with our young people.”
In the interview he also admitted that he does not intend to play any prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones, after the end of the series next summer, saying "end of battles and horses".
From November, Kit will star in the revival of Sam Shepard’s True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that his acquaintance with Rose's wife is the best he's ever gotten from Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife in the series, so somehow she gave me my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose was cast as Eggrit, the love interest of John Snow, the character Keith is portrayed, in the Emmy-winning series.
The couple got married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China Reports 14% Increase in New Cases
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, according to health services.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
In their overwhelming majority, the new cases were transmitted through sexual contact, signaling a change in relation to the past.
Traditionally, the HIV virus was spreading rapidly in some parts of China due to transfusions of contaminated blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way had almost zeroed, according to China’s health officials at a conference in the Yunnan province.
However, compared to the previous year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Transmission of HIV through sexual contact is a very serious issue for the LOT community of China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LOT community remains a common phenomenon.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many cases of transmission of these diseases are due to the lack of sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to anti-HIV drugs as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member has leaked data from Republican senators, condemns "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories."
On Saturday, U.S. Representative Maxine Waters denied allegations that a member of her staff had posted personal information of three Republican senators on the legislature’s Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democratic MEP argued that the allegations were promoted by commentators and websites of the “right-wing extremist party” (“the right-wing extremist party”).
"Lies, lies, and even more horrific lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information reportedly includes the home addresses and phone numbers of Senators Lindsay Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hutch of Utah, according to Reuters.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday and appears to have been published by an unknown person from the surroundings of Capitol Hill during a hearing of the Senate committee on allegations of sexual misconduct against the candidate for the Supreme Court.
The leak occurred at some point after the three senators had interrogated Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the uploads was associated with the Waters office and published the data of a member of the Waters staff, The Hill reported.
“This unfounded claim is a completely untrue and untrue lie,” Waters said in a statement.
“My staff member, whose identity, personal information and security have been violated because of these fraudulent and false allegations, was in no way responsible for the leakage of this information.
This unfounded claim is a completely untrue and untrue lie.”
Waters’ statement quickly received criticism on the Internet, including former White House press secretary Ari Fleiser, who was also a member of the White House.
“This smear is full of anger,” Fletcher wrote.
“This shows that he doesn’t have the guts to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn’t do, they shouldn’t be angry.
It mustn't be shy.
He must not question the motives of the one who accuses him.
It has to be calm and calm.”
Fleecher appeared to compare Waters’ reaction to Democrats’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by his critics of appearing very angry at Thursday’s hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who seeks to oust Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"It's huge if it's real," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had notified "competent authorities and law enforcement authorities of these false claims" and that the company had "informed" the law enforcement authorities.
“We will do everything we can to find those responsible,” he continued, “and account for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to anyone and to all of my staff.”
Review of the film Johnny English Strikes Back - a hypocritical spy film with Rowan Atkinson
It is now a tradition to look for signs of Brexit in every new film with a British character, and this seems to be true in this revival of the action-comedy film franchise, the 2011 epic Johnny and the heroine Johnny Ingles, which appeared in English in 2003.
Could this humourous self-satisfying question of how obviously bad we are to become the nation's new export opportunity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny Ingles with his eyes sniffed was able to renew his permission to make them mud for the second time. His name states that it is a wider comic creation designed for non-English cinema.
It is, of course, the secret agent of 2012 who, while pretending to have the brilliance and the ways of a secret agent, brings a little to Clouseau, with a dose of his "Mr. Bin" and something of the type that played only one note in the theme.
It’s also based on the traveler and international mystery man Atkinson once dressed in Barclaycard’s most forgotten TV commercials, spewing chaos into his passing.
There are one or two great moments in this last JE movie.
I liked it when Johnny Ingles approached a helicopter dressed in medieval armor and the helicopters slammed his helmet.
Atkinson shows his talent in comedy, however, the humor is quite hypotonic and strangely outlandish, especially at a time when "serious" film franchises such as 007 and Dangerous Mission now include quite a few.
Humor seems to be aimed at children and not adults, and in my opinion, Johnny Ingles’ crazy twists are not as inventive and relevant as Atkinson’s movie-type sketches of Person’s Persephone.
The eternal central issue is that the United Kingdom has a serious problem.
A cyber-hacker has hacked into Britain’s super-secret Internet network of spies, bringing to the fore the identities of all British agents who are on a mission, to the great disappointment of the agent in service.
It’s the last drop for a prolific and ambitious prime minister on the verge of collapse due to political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does her best with this character reminiscent of Theresa May, but the script doesn’t help her.
The intelligence advisers inform her that, as each active spy has been revealed, she will have to return someone disarmed.
And that means Johnny Ingles, who is now working as a director at an aristocratic school, but gives informal lessons on secret agents: here there are some pretty cool scenes, as Ingles offers one.
Ingles returns to Whitholm for an urgent update and reunites with Buff's former and pathetic accomplice, whom Ben Miller once again plays.
Buff is now married to a submarine commander, a crazy role in which Vicky Peperdin is not fully exploited.
So, Batman and Robin of the Gaffa for the Secret Service of Her Majesty return to action, meeting the beautiful and fateful Ophelia Bouletova, who is portrayed by Olga Kirilenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is endangered by the charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain’s technological ailments: the menacing Jason Volta, who is succumbing to Jake Lace.
Inglés and Buff start the odyssey of their pharmacy: disguised as waitresses, set fire to a chic French restaurant, cause a mess as they try to get on board illegally in the luxury.
All the tricks are used in this last scene, but as adorable and fabulous as they are, it still resembles a bit of a children's TV.
Moderate things.
And as with other Johnny English films, I wonder: can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role where he’ll really grow up with his talent?
Workers denies that they are considering a plan to work for the British for four days, but to pay for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is going to consider a radical plan to get the British to work four days a week, but to get paid for five-day work.
The party, according to information, is seeking the bosses of the companies to channel the savings achieved through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to the workers, giving them an extra day off.
This way, the workers will enjoy a three-day weekend, without a reduction in their wages.
Sources say the idea aligns with the party’s economic agenda and plans in order to turn the balance in favor of workers.
The change in a four-day week was approved by the Congress of Labor Unions as a way for workers to benefit from the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: “A policy change is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
“It’s not going to happen in one night, but the four-day work week is an ambition aligned with the party’s approach to rebalancing the economy in favor of workers, as well as its overall strategy for industry.”
The Labour Party is not the first to support such an idea, as the Greens Party has promised a four-day working week in its general election campaign in 2017.
However, this vision is not currently supported by the entire Labour Party.
A spokesperson for the Labour Party said: “The four-day working week is not the party’s policy and is not considered by the party.”
The shadow government’s secretary, John McDonnell, used last week’s Labour conference to develop his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy, which he said would be a big step forward.
McDonnell said he is determined to reclaim power from “individual directors” and “traffickers” in companies of common interest.
The shadow government’s plans also mean that today’s shareholders in water companies may not get their full share back, as a potential Labour government’s “supreme government” would be able to perform in “supreme.”
It also confirmed the plans for the placement of employees on the boards of directors of the companies and the creation of mutual equity funds, in order to give 10% of the private-sector companies to employees who will receive 500 shares per annum.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy are talking on 60 Minutes about whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his candidacy for the Supreme Court by at least a week, and has raised the question of whether the findings of the service will be included in the report.
In an interview on Sunday, Scott Pelley, the correspondent for 60 Minutes, asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could leak anything that would have been done to them, and if the FBI could leak anything that would have been done to them.
Kennedy appeared more open-minded than his colleague from South Carolina, and he was more open-minded.
"Yes, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said that when I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the incident, when the complaint came out, and I asked him directly, “Did you do it?”
He was immoderate, determined, categorical."
However, Graham’s vote seems to be not going to change.
"I've decided on Brett Cavanaugh and it's going to take some explosive charge to change my mind," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Bluesey Ford.
"And whoever has named it, can't confirm it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I don’t see anything new changing.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and how much has it contributed to poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with a rich program and celebrity stars, as well as an equally impressive mission: the eradication of global poverty.
For the seventh year now, tens of thousands are expected to flock to the Great Lawn of Central Park as part of the Global Citizen Festival, not only to enjoy artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi Bie and Son Mendes, but also to be sensitive to 20.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international pressure group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to secure a free ticket to the event (unless they were willing to buy a VIP ticket), interested parties had to complete a series of quests or "actions", such as to report it to other volunteers, to send an email to a global audience.
But how successful is the Global Citizen, while there are still 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding with a free concert the right way to persuade our fellow citizens to take action, or is it just another case of so-called “clickactivism”, when some feel that they really make a difference by signing a tweet?
Since 2011, the Global Citizen group has reported that it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, promoting a number of different goals.
These actions have helped world leaders to announce commitments and policies that amount to more than $37 billion, which are set to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group reported 390 commitments and announcements as a result of these actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or accumulated.
The group estimates that the insured funds have so far directly affected nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the core commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a British association of investors and contractors, who have undertaken the commitment "to help children to make full use of their potentials from their joint ventures", promising to give Rwanda $35 million of its shares.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments, and members of the Global Citizens community like you, we can make the social injustice of undernutrition a note in the story of his life," said Tracey O'Reilly.
The group also stated that following the 5,000 actions and now calling for the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government has announced the funding of a project entitled The Power of Nutrition, which is addressed to 5 children and children.
Answering the question "What makes you think that we can eliminate extreme poverty?" that is included in the site's frequently asked questions,
A member of the Global Citizen community responded: “The road will be long and difficult, sometimes we will fall and we will fail.
But like all the big human rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because we are united, we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, Vicente, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Mona are some of the artists who will be featured at this year’s New York event, which will be presented by Deborah-Lee and Fry.
The U.S. could use the Navy to "block" Russia's energy exports - Secretary of the Interior
Washington could turn “if necessary” to its navy in order to prevent the provision of Russian energy to markets, including the Middle East, as U.S. Secretary of the Interior, Ryan Xin, said in a statement.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s involvement in Syria, where it is trying to do so at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I believe that the reasons they are in the Middle East is that they want to sell energy, just like they do in Eastern and Southern Europe,” he said.
According to the Minister, there are ways and means to deal with the Russian activity.
"The United States has the ability, with the support of the Navy, to ensure that the seaways will remain open and, if necessary, to block them, to ensure that Russian energy will not be placed on the market," he said.
Zinke addressed attendees at an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group characterized as the “energy consumer’s voice” in the United States.
He compared Washington’s approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, pointing out that they are essentially the same.
“The economic choice for Iran and Russia is, little by little, the utilization and replacement of fuels,” he said, referring to Russia as “a pony who knows only one trick,” as it has an economy that relies on fossil fuels.
The statements were made as the Trump administration has taken on a mission to boost U.S. liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, which is the much cheaper option for European consumers.
For this reason, the Trump administration, including President Donald Trump himself, is trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the “unfit” project for the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which, according to Trump, will make Berlin.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, a project with a budget of 11 billion dollars, which is going to double the existing capacity of the pipelines to 110 billion cubic meters, is one.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s strong resistance to the project is driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose the gas supplier that they want," Russian Minister of Energy Aleksandr Nova said in a press release.
The U.S. stance provoked Germany’s reaction, which underscored its commitment to the implementation of the project.
Germany’s leading industry organisation, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), has called on the United States to move away from the EU’s energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kebf, head of the German Federation of Industries (BDI) in Germany, after a recent meeting with German Chancellor of Germany.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider whether to nominate for the presidency in 2020, Massachusetts U.S. senator said in a statement.
Massachusetts U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would seriously consider the possibility of declaring her candidacy for the presidency after the midterm elections.
At a meeting in Hollywood, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering the possibility.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix our problematic government, and that’s why we need a woman at the top,” she told The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will consider the possibility of a nomination for the Presidency."
Warren criticised President Donald Trump during the meeting, saying he was “bringing the country in the wrong direction.
“I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing in our democracy,” he said.
Warren didn’t say anything about Trump and his nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said: “Of course, an FBI investigation is necessary before the vote.”
A poll published on Thursday, however, showed that a majority of Warren’s voters do not believe she should run for the presidency in 2020.
58% of Massachusetts’ “probable” voters said the senator should not run for office, according to a poll by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32% were in favour of such a candidacy.
The poll showed more support for a possible candidacy than former governor Deval Patrick, with 38% in favor of a possible candidacy and 48% against.
Other popular names from the Democrats discussed in connection with a possible 2020 candidacy are former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. (more...)
Biden said he would make a formal decision by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin Referred to Track Palin's Traumatic Stress Disorder at Donald Trump's Concentration
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after he was recruited in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
"With what my son has been going through since his return, I can understand other families who live with the effects of the Metatraumatic Stress Disorder and the injuries to the torso that our soldiers carry on the torso when they return home," he said.
Palin described his arrest as "a bomb ready to explode" and said of her son and other veterans that "they return a little different, the priests return a lot tougher, and they return to him, wondering if there is respect for what they have."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasila, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, interfering in a report of domestic violence and gun control while she was in a state of intoxication, according to Dan Bennett, his spokesman.
18 states and the province of Columbia support the challenge of the new policy of asylum <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy that denies providing asylum to victims who are trying to escape gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the region submitted an amicus curiae report on Friday in Washington, D.C., supporting an asylum seeker to challenge the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Gray v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal policy has not been disclosed.
She said her partner "and his violent sons who are gang members" were abusing her, however, U.S. officials rejected her application for asylum on July 20th.
He's been held in Texas.
Lawyers from states that support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum-seekers in the United States come, as countries with a high prevalence of migrants and asylum-seekers.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed the 2014 decision taken by the Immigration Appeals Commission (BIA) and allowed unannounced migrants fleeing situations of domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The Attorney General of the District of Columbia, Carl Rasin, said on Friday that the new policy "ignores entire decades of civil, federal and international law," according to the report.
"According to federal law, all applications for asylum must be considered on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application. Such a statute violates this principle," according to the report amicus curiae.
Lawyers also claimed in the report that the policy that denies entry to immigrants harms the U.S. economy, proposing that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "make necessary labor power."
In June, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration justices to stop granting asylum to victims who are trying to escape situations of domestic violence and gangs, according to Reuters.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their country of origin because of persecution or intimidation due to race, religion, nationality or participation in a particular social group or political point of view," Sesion said in a statement.
The purpose of asylum was never to alleviate all the problems (even the most serious) that people face on a daily basis around the world.
Unrecognized rescue efforts in Pula, as the number of dead doubles despite the struggle to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse.
"It's very intense," said 35-year-old mother Riza Kousuma, trying to relieve her fever-stricken baby, in an evacuation center that had been set up in the damaged city of Palou.
"Every minute, the ambulances bring in more bodies.
“Clean water is scarce.”
Some residents attempted to return to their damaged homes and collect their belongings through the waters, trying to enclose as much as they could find. . . .
Hundreds of people were injured and the hospitals, which suffered damage from the 7.5-size Richter-scale earthquake, were unable to meet the needs.
Some of the injured, such as Dowy Harris, who suffered a fracture of the waist and shoulder, remained outside the Army Hospital of Palo, where first aid was given in the countryside because of the ongoing post-mortems.
Tears flooded his eyes as he recounted how he felt the violent earthquake rattling the room on the fifth floor of the hotel he was sharing with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save us.
I was trapped in the rubble of the wall," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence,” he said.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of “Intimidation” with “Propaganda Ads”
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a U.S. daily newspaper overriding the reciprocal trade benefits between the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused the U.S. ambassador of doing so.
U.S. President Donald Trump reported last Wednesday on the China Daily's on-paying insert that appeared in Des Moines Register, the newspaper with the most sales in the state of Iowa, after he accused China of attempting to interfere in the process.
Trump’s allegation that Beijing had attempted to interfere in the U.S. election signaled what U.S. officials told Reuters is a new phase of the escalating campaign that Washington has launched.
While it is not forbidden for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote their trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an escalating trade war and have imposed various tariffs on each other’s imports.
China’s tariff retaliation at the beginning of the trade war was aimed at hitting exporters in states such as Iowa that backed the Trump Republican Party, according to Chinese and U.S. officials.
Terry Brandt, a U.S. ambassador to China and former long-time governor to Iowa, a state that is a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had hit its workers, farmers, and migrants.
China, as Brandt wrote in an opinion article in the Sunday Des Moines Register, “is characterised by this kind of intimidation by publishing propaganda advertisements in our free press.”
“In an effort to disseminate this propaganda, the Chinese government exploits the precious tradition of America’s freedom of speech and the free press, by publishing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register,” he wrote.
"On the contrary, in Beijing's tents, you will find minimal divergent voices and no true representation of the different views that the Chinese people may have on China's problematic economic course," he said, adding that "the Chinese people are under pressure from China's problematic economic course."
He added that "one of China's most important newspapers avoided the offer to publish" his article, although he did not reveal which.
The Republicans are alienating women voters in the face of the midterm elections because of the fiasco with Kavanaugh, analysts warn
As many top Republicans continue to defend the candidate for Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh in spite of allegations of sexual abuse, analysts warn that there will be an indiscriminate reaction, especially from women, to the U.S. government.
Emotions on this issue are particularly tense, and most Republicans have stated that they would like to proceed with the vote.
These things can’t be restored,” said Grant Ryer, a professor of political science at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School, in an article published on Saturday.
Rier doubts that the last-minute move of U.S. Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to ask for an FBI investigation will be enough to attract angry voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday, they are not going to forget it tomorrow, and they are certainly not going to forget it in November," said Karin Jean-Pierre, senior counsellor and co-chair, in a statement on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters rhythmically shouted the slogan "November is coming!" in the hallway of the Senate as the Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee gave the green light to Mr. Kheri, Mr. Khartoum, for the candidacy of Mr. Mvano.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will reach record levels," Stu Rodenberg, an acclaimed political analyst, told the news website, according to Reuters.
"They say it's already high, and that's true.
But it could be higher, especially in the group of indecisive women voters in the suburbs and younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who, while opposing the president, often do not vote.”
Even before Ford’s public filing, in which she detailed her complaints of sexual abuse against the candidate for the Supreme Court, analysts had foreseen that there could be a reaction if the Republicans were to retaliate.
“It’s a huge mess for the Republican Party,” Michael Styl, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the vote on the committee or the final vote of the USA or whether Kavanaugh will be expelled. It's also about how the Republicans handled the matter and how it was handled by the Republicans," she said in a press release.
However, the Americans seem to be somewhat divided about who to believe after the Fortnite and Cavanese depositions, ranking slightly more in favor of the latter.
A new YouGov survey showed that 41% of respondents believed Ford’s testimony, or probably believed it, while 35% said they believed Kavanaugh, or probably believed it.
In addition, 38% said they believed that Kavanaugh probably or surely lied in his testimony, while only 30% said the same thing about Ford.
After Flake’s move, the FBI took over to investigate Ford’s complaints and at least one more plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reported.
Last week, Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh attacked her while she was drunk when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed her his genitals while they were at a party when they were both studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Web is planning to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners Lee, the inventor of the World Web, is launching a startup with the goal of competing with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The new pain of this technology legend is Inrupt, a company based on Berners Lee’s open Solids platform.
The Solid platform allows users to choose where their data will be stored, as well as who will be able to access and what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is “global dominance.”
“We have to do it now,” he told the startup.
“It’s a historic moment.”
The application uses the technology of the Solid platform by allowing users to create their own “personal electronic data storage space” or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, work drop-down lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available in one browser and all at the same time.
The unique feature of the personal electronic data storage space is that it allows the user to decide who has access to what kind of information.
The company calls this capability “personal empowerment through the data.”
Inrupt’s idea, according to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, is to provide the company with resources, processes and appropriate skills so that the Solid platform is available to everyone.
The company consists of Berners Lee, Bruce, a security platform that was purchased by IBM, some dedicated developers who worked on the project, and a community of volunteer code developers.
As of this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools that are available on the Inrupt website.
Berners Lee said he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether they are allowed to make radical changes, reversing business models in one night.
"We're not asking them for permission."
In a post in Medium released on Saturday, Berners Lee wrote that “Inrupt’s mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that will protect the integrity and quality of the new web created based on the Solid platform.”
In 1994, Berners Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
In recent months, Berners Lee has been a strong voice in the debate over the neutrality of the Internet.
Even with Inrupt, Berners Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m extremely optimistic about the next era of the Internet,” said Berners Lee.
Bernard Van: A tribute to a clergyman who received the Victorian Cross in World War I
The only Anglican Church cleric to have received the Cross of Victoria during World War I as a soldier was honoured in his homeland 100 years later.
Colonel-Colonel Bernhard Van received the medal on September 29, 1918, for the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a freelancer four days later and never learned that he had withdrawn the highest British military distinction.
On Saturday, the revelations of a memorial plaque were made by his two grandchildren, who were accompanied by a parade in Rusden, Northhamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said it was "extremely symbolic" that the plaque's revelations were made exactly 100 years after his grandfather's heroic act for which he received the medal.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Van led his order to the Saint-Kenten Canal in the midst of a very dense fog and while he was receiving powerful fire from weapons of battle and weapons.
Later, he rushed to the front line and with "excellent courage" led the line forward, before hitting himself with a gun three from the detachment.
Colonel Van was killed by a German free sniper on October 4, 1918, almost a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather’s heroic actions were “something I know I could never get to, it’s something that makes you feel unlimited respect.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also laid a wreath after the parade, led by the philharmonic young Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said he "feeled a great honour to have participated in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is demonstrated by the support he has from many people."
MMA fans stayed overnight to watch Bellator 206, but saw Peppa in Gurunaki
Think of the following scenario: you’ve spent the night watching the exciting Bellator 206, but you’re depriving yourself of the joy of seeing this unique sporting event.
The program in San Jose included 13 matches, including six on the main card, and would be broadcast live in the United Kingdom, from Channel 5, in the night zone.
At 6:00 p.m., as Gegard Musashi and Rory McDonald were preparing to go on the ring, viewers in the United Kingdom remained awkward when the show switched to Peppa the Piglet.
Some weren’t happy at all, as they had stayed awake until the early morning hours, especially for the race.
A fan on Twitter described the screening of the children's program as "some kind of sick joke."
“According to the legislation, this content was not suitable for 6 a.m., so the children’s program had to be presented,” said Dave Swartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communication, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the Pig, indeed."
Bellator’s president, Scott Cocker, said he was going to work out the program to include UK viewers in the future.
“If we think about ripples, I think we can do it,” Cocker said.
“But it’s six in the morning there on Sunday and we won’t be able to do it until Sunday our own time, that is, their own Monday.
But we're trying.
Believe me, when the change took place, a lot of messages were exchanged back and forth and they weren’t friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical flaw.
It wasn't, it was because of the regulations.
I promise you, next time, this is not going to happen.
We're going to limit it to five games instead of six, as we usually do. We tried to offer more to the fans and we overtook it.
It's an unpleasant situation."
Previous articleDesert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels 'Lower' Because of His Sexuality
The Olympian at the dives, Tom Daley, said that he grew up feeling inferior to the rest because of his sexuality, however, that pushed him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize until high school that “not everyone is like me.”
Speaking at the first Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne on Radio 4, she said she supported gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that since he became a parent, he’s been less interested in a win at the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, a regular presenter of the well-known radio show, was on leave for several months due to illness.
As a guest on Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "insufficient" compared to others when he was growing up, because "it was not socially acceptable to like someone and boys and girls."
“Until today, these feelings of inferiority and diversity have given me the strength and the will to succeed,” he said.
He wanted to prove that it was “something,” he said, so that he wouldn’t disappoint anyone when they finally learned about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze Olympian is a well-known defender of the rights of the LOATKI community and took advantage of his participation in this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to make an appeal, so that more countries can move on to the apocalypse.
He said that he decided to talk, because he felt lucky that he could live openly, without consequences, and that he wanted to give others "hope".
The three-time world champion said he was “surprised” when he fell in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Dale was married last year to Oscar-winning actor Lance Black, who is 20 years older than him, but argued that the age difference was never an issue.
"When you spend so much at such a young age" (he took part in the Olympic Games for the first time at the age of 14, while his father died of cancer three years later) "it's hard to find a good friend."
The couple adopted a son in June, Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Daley said he changed "his whole outlook."
“If you asked me last year, all I wanted was to win the gold medal,” he said.
“But there are more important things than the Olympic gold medals.
My gold medal at the Olympics is Robbie.
His son has the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Dale said his father did not accept the fact that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if they had made tickets for the 2012 Olympics in London, as he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘Daddy, you won’t be near us to sit in the front row,’” he said.
“I held his hand as he stopped breathing and only when he stopped breathing and he was already dead, I finally accepted that he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"I knew it was what I had dreamed of all my life, to compete in the scuba diving at the Olympics in my home country, there was no better feeling," he said.
This also inspired the choice of his first song, Heather Small's Proud, which inspired him in his preparations for the Olympics and still causes him a panic attack.
Desert Island Discs broadcast on BBC Radio 4 every Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Michaelson will be on the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Michaelson will set a record on Sunday, when he will play his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to improve his performance so he doesn’t remember him for the wrong reasons.
Michaelson, who participates for the 12th time (record number) in the matches held every two years, was forced by head Jim Furrick to sit on the bench for the fourball and foursome on Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as is customary for the United States, the five-time winner divided the day to thrill from the lines and "work" his game in hopes of fixing his problematic spots.
Without ever having been the most direct driver even at the end of his career, the 48-year-old’s game is not suitable for Le Golf National’s narrow stadium, where the distances are often problematic.
And as if the difficulty of the field did not come, Michaelson, in Sunday's ninth match, is facing Francesco Molinari, the champion of the British Open, who is collaborating with the team's first-ever Tommy Flitwood for the British Open.
If the Americans, who were four points below the start of the 12 singles, could take the lead with a good start, Michaelson’s game could be critical.
Furick expressed his confidence in his player, not that he could say anything else.
"He fully took on the role he plays today, he hit me in the back, he put his hand around me and he said he would be ready for tomorrow," Furick said.
“He has a lot of confidence.
His name is in the Hall of Fame and he has offered a lot to these groups, both in the past and this week.
I guess I didn't expect him to play two games.
I was thinking more, but that's where we ended up, so we thought we should go.
He wants to go out there, just like everyone else.”
Michaelson will beat Nick Faldo’s record for most of Sunday’s Ryder Cup games.
It could mark the end of a career in the Ryder Cup that did not reach the height of his individual record.
Michaelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven halves, although Furick said his presence had benefits for the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, spiritual, he likes to make plates and he's great in the team's room," he explained.
"I think the younger players were also having a lot of fun to bully him this week. It was fun to see it.
It’s not just about the game.”
The leader of the European team, Thomas Byorn, knows that the big lead may soon be lost.
Thomas Byorn, the leader of the European team, knows from his experience that a big lead starting from the last day’s singles in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a defeat.
Danes made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a team led by Sheve Balesteros managed to gain a five-degree advantage over the Americans, but only to pass the final line 1/4 with a difference of 13 chests.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a great lead at Valderrama, we had a great lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but he barely got as far as he could," he told National in the photo.
So the story will show me and all the members of the team that this is not over.
We're going to be ready tomorrow to give it all.
We're gonna go out there and play right.
Nothing is finished until you see the scores in the table.
We have a goal, to win this trophy, and that's where we focus.
I always say that I focus on the 12 players in our team, but we know very well that there are equally good players in the other team – the best in the world.”
Satisfied with the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn adds: "I wouldn't be in a hurry to betray the result.
Tomorrow's another beast.
Tomorrow's individual performance counts, and that's something different.
It’s great to be on the pitch with a teammate when things go well, but when you’re out there on your own, you’re testing your skills as a golfer.
This is the message you need to convey to the players, how to get the best out of them tomorrow.
You leave your teammate behind and he has to give it all and show his best self.”
Unlike Byorn, Jim Furrick from the opposing team will ask his players to score better individual performances than they had with their team-mates, with the exception of the Jordan Spiths and Justin Thomas, who have won the title.
Furick himself has experienced both ends of the last day’s upheaval, as he was part of the winning team at Brookline before the unexpected defeat, as Europe did its miracle.
“I remember every bunch of his words,” he replied when asked how Ben Cransoo, the leader in 1999, had gathered his players for the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want a quick start like at Brookline, like at Medinah.
When we get this momentum, there's a lot of pressure in the middle races.
We decide our turn accordingly and we play in the order that suits us, we will try to do our magic tomorrow.”
Thomas has taken the lead in the game and is facing Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flitwood and Ian Poulter, the rest of the European Championship.
"I went with this team in this series because I think it covers the entire track," Byorn said, justifying his choices for the singles.
New postponement for Germany's new warship
The new frigate of the German Navy should have been put into service in 2014, to replace the outdated warships of the Cold War era, but it is not due to be received until next year at least, due to its defective systems and systems.
The entry into service of the Rheinland-Pfalz frigate, the navy of the all-new Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which invokes a representative of the armed forces.
The ship was supposed to have joined the Navy in 2014, but problems with the delivery were decisive for the fate of the ambitious plan.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the oldest Bremen-class frigates.
They will carry a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft missiles and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features are that the frequency of maintenance work is reduced, as it will be possible to use the new frigates for up to two years outside of German ports.
However, the ongoing delays mean that although warships are considered the latest technology, which will allow Germany to show its power abroad, until they are finally put into service, they will already be outdated, Die Zeit notes.
The unfortunate F125 frigate became headlined last year when the German Navy officially refused to take over the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipyard after delivery.
Not much information has been revealed about the reasons for the return, but German media reported a number of significant "software and hardware defects" that would put the warship in vain if used in a combat mission.
The software problems were particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships have a crew of about 120 sailors, only half compared to the older Bremen-class frigates.
It was also revealed that the ship has a much larger weight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy’s ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton Rhineland-Palatinate frigate is believed to have twice the weight of similar-class ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the defective equipment, the cost of the entire project (including the training of the crew) was also an issue.
It is said to have reached an annual amount of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.6 billion), while the initial budget was <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems that plague the new frigates are particularly important as Germany’s naval power is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee of the German parliament, admitted that the Navy "will soon have no ships for missions".
The official said that the problem swelled over time, because the old ships were dismantled, but there were no other ships to replace them.
It was claimed that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates were able to join the Navy.
The National Trust hides the secret life of the Nightingales
A new research carried out on a farm in the Scottish Highlands seeks to uncover how eagles use the landscape when they hunt for their food.
The findings will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and will contribute to the planning of future actions for the protection of the environment.
The study by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will explore the habits of the common nanonail and micronoid, as well as the brown octopus and the myotid of Dobbendon in the Inverewe Gardens, in the Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the estate to monitor the activities of the bats during the entire season. <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80> <0xE2><0x80> <0xE2><0x80> <0xE2><0x80> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2>
NTS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld scanners.
Analyzing the sound of all the recordings by specialists will verify the frequency of the calls of the bats, as well as which types have this behavior.
Next, a map of the habitat and an exhibition will be created to form a detailed picture of their behavior on a landscape scale.
Rob Duar, an environmental protection consultant for the NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to identify the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of meadows and the best way to conserve forests for bats and other related species.
The populations of bats in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have declined significantly since the last century, and the populations of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom have declined significantly.
They are endangered by construction and development projects that affect the places where they crumble and destroy their habitats.
Wind turbines and lighting are also a risk, as are adhesive tapes for flies and some chemical processing of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Wings aren’t really blind.
However, because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes to catch their prey.
They use an advanced sound-detection technique to detect insects and obstacles in the course of their flight.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, considers bats to be very important.
It has ten trained experts, who carry out regular surveys, inspect the areas where the nails are crawling, and sometimes save them.
The organization has also created Scotland’s first and only refuge for bats exclusively on the Thrave estate, in Damfries and Galway, where eight of Scotland’s ten bat species live.
The estate manager, David Thomson, states that the estate is the ideal terrain for the finches.
“Here at Thrave we have an excellent area for bats,” he said.
“We have the old buildings, a lot of big trees and an ideal habitat.
There’s still a lot we don’t know about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to grow their populations.”
It stresses that it is important to first check for the existence of fins before any maintenance work in homes, as the destruction of a single nest with small ones could kill up to 400 females and small ones, possibly eliminating the entire nest.
Wings are protected species and it is forbidden to kill them, to harass them, to disturb their silence, or to destroy their nests.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a member of the Bat Conservation Trust in Scotland, encouraged the public to offer his help.
He said: “We have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of our species, we simply don’t know the evolution of their population.”
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape, as his lawyers are preparing to sue a German magazine, according to Reuters.
Cristiano Ronaldo described the allegations of rape against him as “fake news,” saying that some “want to self-promote” by exploiting his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which has published the complaints.
The nationalist Portugal and Juventus aggressor is accused of raping an American woman named Katherine Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to the complaint, she reportedly paid her $375,000 to buy her silence and did not report anything about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking in a live video on Instagram to his 142 million followers after the complaint, Ronaldo, 33, described the reports as “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news,” the five-time Golden Ball winner said on camera.
“They want to be self-sufficient and exploit my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous using my name, but that's part of my job.
I’m happy and everything is fine,” the player added smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the allegations it has published, which it has described as "an unacceptable report of rumours affecting privacy," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Scarts said the player would seek compensation for "moral damages of a magnitude proportional to the severity of the breach, which is probably one of the most serious breaches of privacy in recent years."
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting them at a nightly entertainment center, Ronaldo and Maggiorka returned to the player's room, where she is reported to have raped her in spite of nature according to documents filed with the County Court of Comoros.
Myorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was a "good guy" for "99 percent", but betrayed the other "one percent".
The documents state that Ronaldo admitted to having had sexual intercourse, but that it was consensual.
Mayorgka also claims to have gone to the police and hospital where her injuries were photographed, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "afraid" of her "possibility of retaliation" and was concerned about "theft."
The 34-year-old says she is trying to reverse the settlement as she continues to suffer from post-traumatic syndrome due to the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of getting a transfer to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged abuse and this summer he switched to Italy's Juventus securing a deal of 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK 'will regret' the loss of the auto industry 'forever'
The United Kingdom will "repent forever" if it loses its reputation as a global leader in the automotive industry after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clarke said in a statement.
He added that it was "concerning" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, it will temporarily stop production at its plant in Bernaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese auto industry has said that the impact of cross-border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The factory in Bernaston, where Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models are manufactured, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our factory will be discontinued,” said Marvin Cook, Toyota’s CEO in Bernaston.
Other automakers in the UK have voiced fears of leaving the EU without a deal on cross-border trade, such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, has said it will close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main problems are related to risks in the supply chain according to the automotive industry in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line follows just-in-time. Spare parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for custom-built cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be problems at the border, resulting in delays and a lack of components according to the industry.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep a stock for more than a day at its plant in Derbyshire, the company said, so production would stop.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's plan for the future relationship with the EU "concretely seeks to resolve the issue of cross-border checks".
"We want the best possible deal that will allow us not only a temporary success, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today.
“The data that comes not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers is that the continuity of supply chains must necessarily be ensured.”
Toyota was not able to say how much car it would stop production, however, warned that in the long run the additional cost would reduce the factory’s competitiveness and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Bernaston for 24 years and is Unite’s trade union manager at the factory, said that the members of the association are increasingly concerned: “From my experience, if these jobs are lost, they never worry.
A government spokesperson said: "We have presented an accurate and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, the White House has said.
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may "delay another week" as the dispute over Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, continues, according to a press release from the U.S. Supreme Court.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Investigator Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in the election, Trump’s assistant connections with Russia, and the possible impediment to justice by the president.
The possibility that Trump fired the deputy attorney general, jeopardizing Mueller's independence, has been fueling Washington's turmoil for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of wearing a belt in order to record his talks with Trump and make it possible for the president to be removed under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein has denied the report.
However, on Monday, he went to the White House amid reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at the time at the United Nations in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer" not to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed in order not to coincide with the hearing before the Committee on Judiciary Affairs of the Senate, where both Kavanaugh and one of the women were present.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct an investigation within a week into the allegations against Kavanaugh, delaying the holding of a vote further than the Senate plenary session.
Sarah Sanders, Trump's spokesperson, appeared on Fox News Sunday on the television show.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "A date has not yet been set, maybe this week, but maybe it will be postponed another week of data on all the other cases that concern the Supreme Court.
But we’ll see, otherwise I like to always keep the press informed.”
Some journalists have refuted this allegation: Sanders is due to hold a press briefing to the White House from September 10th.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked why this was happening.
Sanders responded that the limited frequency of updates was not due to resentment at the "impression" movements of television journalists, although she said: "I won't disagree with the fact that they show up."
He then let it be understood that there will be an increase or direct communication between Trump and the press.
"The president gives more interviews than any previous president," he said, adding without giving any evidence: "We looked at these numbers."
An update will still be held, Sanders said, but "if the press has the ability to address questions directly to the President of the United States, that's incomparably better than talking to me.
We are trying to implement it often and you have seen that we have implemented it often in recent weeks and it will take the place of the press release where you will be able to speak to the President of the United States."
Trump often receives questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open-ended meetings or press interviews with official visitors.
Individual press interviews are rare.
This week in New York, the president has probably demonstrated why this is happening, with an unconventional and sometimes bizarre appearance in front of assembled journalists.
The Minister of Health sends a letter to EU citizens working in Scotland’s National Health System amid fears of Brexit <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The Minister of Health has sent a letter to the EU citizens who are employed in Scotland’s National Health System to express the country’s gratitude and to wish them to remain after the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union.
Scotland's MEP Jean Freeman has sent a letter with less than six months left to resign from the UK's resignation from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the cost of so-called "settled status" applications for EU citizens who work in its decentralised public services, as well as for the EU's citizens who work in its decentralised public services.
Ms Freeman wrote in her letter: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on leaving have continued and are heading towards expected decisions in the autumn.
However, the UK government has also stepped up its preparations for a possible scenario of non-agreement.
I know that this period must be particularly difficult for all of you.
For this reason, I would like to repeat how much I appreciate the contribution of each employee regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and the communities that we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we very much want you to stay here."
Cristion Ambercroby underwent emergency surgery after a head injury. <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Tennessee State Tigers defender Cristion Ambercrobby underwent an emergency surgery after a head injury in Saturday's match, where the Tennessee State Tigers were defeated with a score of 31-27 by Vat.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reid told reporters that the injury had occurred just before the half-time mark.
“He came to the bench and just collapsed there,” Reid said.
The gymnasts and medical staff gave Ambercroby oxygen to the bench and then put him in a carrier and transported him back for further evaluation.
A Tennessee State staffer told Chris Harris of the WSMV television station in Nashville, Tennessee that Ambercrobby had left the surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there is "no evidence yet on the type/extension of the injury" and Tennessee State is trying to ascertain when the injury occurred.
Ambercrobby, a second-year student under a restricted membership ("redshirt"), spends his first season at Tennessee State after his transfer from Illinois.
He made five total tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, reaching the total of 18 tackles for the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged with a higher tax on the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Foreign buyers will be charged with a higher toll on the purchase of real estate in the UK, while the additional money will be used to provide assistance to the homeless, according to the new Tor plans.
The measure will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters.
The increase in the toll will be imposed on those buyers who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Ministry of Finance expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year - to provide assistance to the homeless.
Foreign buyers will begin to be charged a higher levy on the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom, while the additional funds will be used to provide assistance to the homeless, as Teresa will announce today.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and to target high salaries.
The increase in the fee will be imposed on natural and legal persons who are not taxed in the United Kingdom, while the additional funds will strengthen the government’s campaign to combat the lack of housing.
The increase, imposed on the current card fee, along with the highest tax rates introduced two years ago for the purchase of a second home and a home for rent, could be as high as 3%.
The Ministry of Finance expects the measure to cost up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per annum.
It is estimated that 13 percent of newly-built real estate in London is purchased by people who do not live in the UK, leading to rising prices and making it more difficult for first-time home buyers to enter the real estate market.
Many affluent areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy is being introduced just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a cut in the tariff, so that more young people can get their first home, according to Reuters.
He criticized the big construction companies for keeping property prices high, acquiring land without, however, using it, and called on Ms. May to remove the ceilings in economic housing in order to restore the "homestay" of Vreta.
Corbyn has announced a series of impressive proposed housing reforms, which include rental checks and a ban on “no-blame” evictions.
He also wants to give greater powers to the councils in order to build new houses.
May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my prime minister to the restoration of the British dream - to improving life for every new generation.
And this entails the repair of the dismantled real estate market.
“The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it would not be right for people who do not live in the UK and companies based abroad to buy homes as easily as hard-working UK nationals.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home has become too far away, and the unreliability of the lack of a home remains.
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to train the Scottish team" (Reuters)
Sanderland’s leader, Jack Ross, says his “absolute ambition” is to become a coach of Scotland’s national team at some point.
The 42-year-old Scot is thrilled with the challenge to raise the north-east England team, which is currently in third place in England's C-Class football (League One), three degrees below the top.
She moved to the Light Stadium in the summer, having previously relegated St. Mirren to the Scottish Championships in the previous racing season.
“I wanted to fight for my country as a player.
I got a call for the second national team and that was it," Ross told the Scottish BBC on the radio show Sportsound.
“But I grew up seeing the Scotland team in Hamden all the time with my dad as a kid, and that’s something that always drew me back.
But this opportunity will only come if I have success in training teams.”
Among Ross' predecessors in Sanderland are Dick Endvocat, David Moyes, Sam Alardais, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keene, Gus Poyet, and Paul Di Canio.
Former Aloe Athletic coach says he was not honored when he was called upon to spread such established names to such a large team, having previously rejected approaches from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At the moment, success for me will be measured based on the answer to the question 'can I bring this team back to the Premier League?'
Because of the structure and facilities of this team, it is undeniably owned by the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy job to get her there, but I'll probably consider myself a success here only if I can bring the team back there."
Ross began his career as a coach just three years ago, having spent a period as an assistant coach at Dambarton and a period of 15 months at Harts coaching staff.
He then helped Aloe to return from relegation to the third category and led St. Mirren from the rim of relegation to winning the Championship the following season.
Also, Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever felt during his career as a player at Clyde, Hartpool, Folkerk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was rather a real crossroads," he recalled taking the position of Aloe's coach.
“I really believed that it was better for me to be a coach than a player.
It sounds strange because I was doing well, I was making decent money out of it, and I had gotten high enough.
But playing can be difficult.
You have to endure a lot on a weekly basis.
“I’m still having trouble with stress and work pressure, but my coach’s job fits in perfectly.
I’ve always wanted to train, and now that I’m doing it, I feel more comfortable than I’ve felt with myself all my adult life.”

The best time for beer is at 5.30pm on Saturdays, according to research
The summer fuel boosted profits for Britain’s test-run pubs, but brought greater pressure to the restaurant chains, the report said.
Pubs and bars saw sales increase by 2.7 percent in July, but restaurant earnings fell by 4.8 percent, according to the figures.
Peter Martin, from the CGA consultancy firm, which has collected the data, said: "The continued sunshine and the largest than expected participation of England in the World Cup in recent years, however, the result was that July was to follow a lead.
The 1.8 percent decline in restaurant revenues in June only worsened in July, according to the report.
The pubs and bars that serve alcohol went far better, with the corresponding figures from previous years having gone up more than the corresponding figures from the restaurants fell.
The pubs that serve food also suffered on sunny days, though not as dramatic as the restaurants.
Looks like the world just wants to go out for a drink.
In all of the managed pubs and bars, beverage sales increased by 6.6 per cent for the month, while food sales fell by three per cent.
Paul Newman, from RSM’s entertainment and hospitality analysts department, said: “These results confirm the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The weather and the influence of important social or sporting events remain the biggest factors in terms of sales in the out-of-house market.
It’s no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, but a 4.8 percent drop in sales on an annual basis will be particularly painful given the ongoing cost pressures that have been put on the table.
The long warm summer couldn’t have appeared at a worse time for the entrepreneurs in the focus area, and the weather will show whether the lower temperatures we experienced in August will give a much-needed aftershock.”
The overall increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new businesses, amounted to 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in the launches of brand names.
The Coffer Peach Tracker sales index for the UK’s pubs, bars and restaurants industry collects and analyzes performance data from 47 active groups, with a total turnover of more than 9 million, and a record-breaking turnover of more than 9 million.
One in five children keep secret accounts on social media, hidden from their parents. <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
As the study reveals, one in five children — even just 11 years old — keep secret accounts on social media, hidden from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in fake pages (“fake Insta”) on Instagram
This news aroused fears that sexual content was being uploaded.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "master" account to show it to their parents.
One in five children — even just 11 years old — create accounts on social media, which they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid rise in fake Insta accounts - a reference to Instagram's photo-sharing site, according to Reuters.
This news sparked fears that sexual content was being uploaded.
Twenty percent of the pupils said they maintain a healthy "master" account to show it to their parents, while at the same time maintaining private accounts, according to the study.
A mother who accidentally found her 13-year-old daughter’s secret website, spotted a teenager who encouraged others to rape her (“Get with me”).
The survey, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the HMC in independent schools, found that 40 percent of the pupils aged 11 to 18 years of age had two profiles, while half of the pupils had two profiles.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said: “It’s worrying that so many teenagers are tempted to create web sites where they can’t be spotted by their parents and teachers.”
Aiden Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" at the Scottish stage council
Aiden Doyle was elected as a non-executive advisor to the Scottish Step Council at the annual general meeting of the board of directors.
Doyle is Scotland’s most award-winning track athlete, and President Ian Byte has commented on her election as a great opportunity for those who lead the sport to take advantage of her broad experience at an international level.
"Eilind enjoys immense respect for the entire Scottish, British and global bands community, and we are confident that the band in Scotland will benefit greatly from its entry into the board," he said in a statement.
Doyle said: “I’m excited to be the voice of the athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help guide the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won the gold medal in the 200 and 400 metres at the Olympic Games in Atlanta in 1996, having won a total of four Olympic gold medals and is now a regular commentator on the BBC, has remained outstanding.
He tweeted: “A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk. I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell whether or not I will recover.
It was exhausting, but I was completely healed, I learned to walk again, and today I do fitness exercises!

Breastfeeding advertising comparing mothers to cows divides the online public opinion <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
A mammalian production company has divided the online public opinion with an ad that compares breastfeeding mothers with cows breastfeeding them.
In order to launch the so-called "world's first noiseless and wearable teal", consumer technology company Elvie has released a humour-filled ad in the so-called "novel" video clips to highlight the "novel".
Four real mothers dance inside a pile of cows full of sanity, with a song that includes lyrics like, "Yes, I'm pissed at myself, but you don't see any tail to me" and, "In case you haven't noticed it, those are not dumb.
The chorus continues, "Pum it, pump it, I'm feeding babies, pump it, pump it, I'm pumping my ladies."
However, the advertisement, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, has sparked an online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, as many say it doesn’t take the dairy industry’s “frightening” seriously.
"It's a very unfortunate decision to use cows to advertise this product.
“Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their own babies steal it a few days after giving birth,” he said.

Someone else commented: “Obviously traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But yes, why not use them to advertise breastfeeding for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added, "An ad that's completely out of reality."
Others defended the advertisement, while one woman admitted that her song seemed "heartbreaking" to her.
"I think it's a very smart idea.
I'd buy one of those if I was still breastfeeding.
The pumping made me feel just like a cow. It's like a cow.
The ad's a little clumsy, but I haven't stopped to overanalyze it.
“It’s a great product,” someone wrote.
Someone else commented: “It’s a funny ad that targets mothers who pump mother’s milk (often in their workplaces or toilets) and feel like ‘cows’.”
This is not an advertisement that praises or criticises the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the women’s team reveals that they were all dancing with the discrete hiccups buried inside their bras.
The logic behind the advertising campaign is based on the idea that many women who pump breast milk with a skewer say that they feel like cows.
The Elvie breastfeeder, however, is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and fits discreetly inside a breastfeeding bra, allowing women to move, hold their babies and even get out during it.
Ana Balarin, partner and Executive Creative Director at Mother, commented: “The Elvie teaser is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By making a parallel between the lactating women and the lactating cows, we wanted to put the focus on the pumping of breast milk and all the challenges it entails, showing at the same time the new year in a fun and correlated way.
It's not the first time Elvie's teal has become a headline.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the pavement for fashion designer Marta Yakubovsky while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved silently to a camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children being detained has risen to a high level, although monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part because the harsh rhetoric and cowardly policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it more difficult.
Traditionally, most conservatives are the same immigrants without travel documents and are afraid to go ahead and ask for a child and thus endanger their ability to stay in the country.
The risk intensified in June, when federal authorities announced that the incumbent conservatives and other adult members of their household would have to give fingerprints and that the data would be communicated to the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Service, testified before Congress that the service had arrested dozens of people who had been asked to keep unattended.
The police later confirmed that 70 per cent of the detainees had a white criminal record in their hands.
“Nearly 80 percent of the people who are either conservatives or members of the conservative household are illegally in the country, and a large part of them are foreign criminals.
Therefore, we continue to pursue these individuals,” Mr. Albens said in a statement.
Aiming at the faster processing of children's cases, the officials introduced new rules according to which some of these children should appear before a court of law within a month of the commencement of their detention and not within 60 days of the commencement of their detention.
Many will appear through a virtual televised conference, in place of a self-employed appearance, in order to develop their claims for granting legal status before the judiciary responsible for immigration matters.
Those who feel that they do not meet the eligibility criteria will be deported immediately.
The more children remain in detention, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts, according to shelter workers and with reports that have come out of the system in recent months.
Lawyers said these concerns are intensifying in larger facilities such as Turin, where indications that a child is struggling are more likely to become unnoticed due to the size of the facilities.
They added that moving the children to the scene without being given enough time to prepare the children psychologically or to say goodbye to their friends can aggravate the trauma they are already struggling with.
Syria Calls on U.S., French and Turkish “Occupying Powers” to Withdraw Immediately
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Secretary of State Walid al-Muhammad also called on Syrian refugees to return to their homeland, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Mohammad, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally located on Syrian territory, under the pretext of combating terrorism and "will be given appropriate treatment."
"They must be withdrawn immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Mohammad insisted that “the war on terrorism is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, while millions more have been driven out of their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to “give this sacred battle until we expel all the Syrian terrorists” from both the terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, which are mainly training and informing both the Kurdish forces and the Syrian Arabs who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the territory of the war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Mohammad said conditions were good for their return and blamed “certain western countries” for “dispersing unreasonable fears” that drove refugees to stay away from their country.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said in a statement.
"They're politicizing an issue that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no support for the reconstruction of Syria unless a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition for the end of the war.
U.N. diplomats report that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a de-armed zone in the last large rebel turret in Idlib has created an opportunity to advance political discussions.
The Russian-Turkish deal prevented an extended attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province, where three million people live.
Mohammad, however, stressed that the deal had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military actions would target jihadists, including militants from the Al-Qaeda-linked Front, which "Nusra" said.
UN Special Envoy Stefan de Mistura hopes to convene soon the first meeting of a new committee consisting of members of the government and opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and to prepare the drafting of the constitution.
Moalem set the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the committee's work should be limited "to a revision of the articles of the current Constitution" and warned that interventions should not be made.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
With this logic, Mr. Trump will win the 2020 election again unless, as many liberal spectators hope, the bill of impeachment and scandals prematurely end his presidency.
One thing that would undoubtedly be "The most dramatic presidential finale of all time!"
So far, there are no indications of fatigue in the audience.
Since 2014, television numbers in the high-television zone have more than doubled, reaching 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled, reaching 1.6 million on MSNBC.
The Fox News television network has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the high-television zone, while four years ago it had 1.7 million, according to Nielsen and the broadcast of MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" broadcaster 3, has scanned the tracks.
It's a fire that people are attracted to because it's something we don't understand," said Neil Bair, producer of the ABC drama series Designated Survivor where a minister becomes president after a devastating attack.
Nell Scovel, a veteran comic book writer and author of the book entitled "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club" has a different theory.
He remembers a taxi ride to Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
He asked, "Why?"
“He said, ‘Because it makes me laugh,’” said Mrs. Scovel.
One can have fun even with the chaos.
Of course, contrary to what happens to the TV series, the scenarios that come out of Washington can judge the future of the Roy v. Wade case, if the immigrant families of the world could reunite and reunite with her.
Frequency change is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can enjoy.

When I met Mr. Flies this week, it was a sunny day with 26 degrees Celsius outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, but he was locked inside watching MSNBC while he was magnetising CNN.
He couldn’t get out, not when Brett Kavanaugh was about to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was hanging from a wire.
“I remember doing those stupid shows long ago and people were saying, ‘This is going to mark the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Mr. Flies told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right after all."

Foreign money is entering the most marginal meeting for the midterm elections.
It comes as no surprise that the 17th Pennsylvania constituency in Congress is receiving a cash flow, thanks to the reorientation of the constituencies of Congress, which has put two active members of Congress candidates for the Congress.
This recently redesignated suburban district of Pittsburgh is represented by Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who was elected to another district in the special elections that were held last spring in the U.S. state of Pittsburgh.
Lamb has as his opponent another active representative, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who represents the former 12th constituency of Pennsylvania, which coincides to a large extent with the new 17th constituency.
The maps were redesigned following a ruling by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January that the old regions were being manipulated unconstitutionally for the benefit of the Republicans.
The election rally in the new 17th constituency sparked a campaign of financial competition between the major financial departments of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Committee for the Congress (DCCC) and the National Republican Committee (NCCC).
Lamb became popular in Pennsylvania after he achieved a marginal victory in a special election rally held in March, for Pennsylvania's 18th constituency in Congress, which was attended by a lot of people.
This position was held by Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the region by 20 points.
Political analysts are giving a slight lead to the Democrats.
The U.S. has considered the possibility of punishing El Salvador for its support in China, but has made it back.
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, prompting mild responses from Washington, D.C., and the United States.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and was maintaining a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump Organization’s administrative team.
Officials of the State of Djibouti have decided to recall the American head of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and the Republic of Panama because of the "recent decisions" of this country, they no longer recognize the situation.
However, sanctions were considered only against El Salvador, which is estimated to have received about $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including for drug control, development, and financial support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial support and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the country of Central America, with high rates of unemployment and homicides.
As internal meetings progressed, the officials of the North and Central America held a high-level conference that focused on the security and economic well-being of the Poles, as a follow-up to a corresponding concentration that took place.
But in mid-September, senior executives made it clear that they wanted to move forward with the conference, effectively ending the thought of imposing sanctions on El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is going to address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, indicative of the great importance that concentration has for the administration, as the diplomats said.
All three U.S. envoys returned silently to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without any new harsh messages or sanctions from Washington, D.C., the U.S. government said.
The White House spokesperson on behalf of Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two other diplomats, who had agreed to discuss the issues of the meeting.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity.
READ HISTORY
The next blow may be Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Mr. Trump’s obstruction of justice, for which very strong evidence has now been made public.
It is rumored that Mr Mueller is also turning his investigation into the possibility of collusion between Mr Trump’s election campaign and Russia regarding the Russian attack on our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will be held accountable in front of his body as he prepares to reclaim the presidency in the upcoming elections, and perhaps eventually before an affidavit court.
The "ifs" are many, and I do not mean that Mr Trump's fall, nor his European counterparts, is inevitable.
There are choices we all have to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will judge the duration of this battle.
In 1938, German officials were ready to make a coup against Hitler, if the West had resisted and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of massacres that followed.
The rush of history revolves around such turning points, and the unstoppable course of democracy is accelerating or slowing down.
The U.S. is now facing a number of these turning points.
What do we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Justice Secretary Rod Rosenstein, the man who holds in his hands the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since he wrote to that newspaper that last year he had proposed that the president be secretly recorded and that he considered him inappropriate for the president's position.
Mr. Rosenstein said that the version the Times adopted is inaccurate.
“How will we respond if the recently requested FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if he is appointed to the Supreme Court despite reasonable allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, are we going to vote in the midterm elections a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail in these tests, democracy will enter into a long winter.
But, because of the lesson I took on the Thing, I think we're not going to fail.

Graham Dorans of Rangers is optimistic about the battle with Rapid Wiens.
Reeders is hosting Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory over the Austrians, after the impressive match in Spain against Vigoreale earlier this month, will give her a lot of chances for the Europa League 7 this year.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorans from making his first appearance in the season until the 2–2 draw with Vijayreal, but he believes that Rangers can use this result as a prelude to larger incidents.
"It was a good time for us because Vijayreal is a good team," the 31-year-old said.
“We got into the game thinking we could do something and we came out with a degree.
Maybe we could get away in the end, but, in general, the match was a pretty fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we were the best team in the second half.
Now, Thursday is another great European evening, I think.
Well having things, we can get three points, but it will be a difficult game because they brought a good result in their last game, but, with the world on the court, I'm sure we can put our best and get a good one.
“Last year was definitely difficult, because of my injuries and the changes that were made to the team itself, but there’s a positive feeling now.
The team is good and the kids enjoy it, the training is good.
Let’s hope that we can put our best into it now, let’s leave last season behind and succeed.”

Despite the fact that the participants in the study had a clear idea of how they would like to be treated, few would discuss it with their family members.
Nearly half of the participants in the Nationwide survey said they were discussing with their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they’ve talked about it to their children.
“People want to take care of their family, but they don’t take the initiative to do the relevant discussion,” said Holly Snowder, vice president of the nationwide life security business.
Start with that.
Talk to your husband and children: You can’t prepare your family to provide care for you if you don’t express your wishes much earlier.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how you will receive care, as these options can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Get your financial advisor: Your financial advisor can also help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Your financial options for long-term care can include traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid life insurance at a buy-in price to help you cover these expenses, or self-insurance with your own back-up.
Write down your legal documents: Avoid any legal disputes that may arise.
Make an attorney for health care matters so that you set up a trusted person to oversee your medical care and ensure that health care professionals will comply with your wishes in case you are not able to contact.
Also, consider the possibility of making a commissioner for your finances.
You can choose a trusted person in order to make decisions on your behalf about financial matters and to ensure that your accounts are paid, in case you become non-commercial.
Don’t Forget the Little Details: Imagine that your elderly parent is facing an emergency health problem and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Include these details in a written plan so that you are ready.
"It's not just the financial issue, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What are the medications?
Who will take care of the dog?
Be sure to prepare this plan for you.”
Man Received Multiple Fires With Aerial Weapon In Ilfracombe
A man received multiple shots with an aeroplane gun as he walked towards his house last night.
The victim, aged about 40, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon County, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and arm.

The victim did not see the perpetrator of the attack.
The injuries he sustained are not life-threatening, and the police are calling for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to official sources, while the number of casualties is expected to increase.
With communications interrupted, humanitarian aid forces have been unable to obtain information from Dongala, an area north of Palo, which is closer to the center of the 7.5-degree-scale earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Pula after the disaster erupted.
Here are some important facts about Palo and Dongala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palou is the capital of the province of central Sulawesi, located on the edge of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
Dongala is an anti-kingdom that stretches over 300 kilometres (180 miles) of coastline to the southwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The Counter-Kingdom, a rank of administrative division under the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy of the province of central Sulawesi and especially in the coastal area of Dongala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it is found more in Morowali, off the coast of Sulawesi.
Palo and Dongala have been hit by a tsunami several times over the past 100 years, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Management Service.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
The tsunami also struck western Dongal in 1996, causing the deaths of nine people.
Indonesia is located within the seismogenic Ring of Fire in the Pacific Ocean and is often affected by earthquakes.
Some of the biggest recent earthquakes and tsunami are as follows:
2004: A large earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Atchek in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people in the inland area along the coast of India.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late May and early April.
Hundreds of dead on the island of Nias, near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-degree Richter-scale earthquake struck the southern part of Java, Indonesia’s most populous island, causing a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: 7.6-degree Richter-scale earthquake with a focus near the city of Pantang, the capital of the Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-degree Richter-scale earthquake struck one of the Mendaway Islands near Sumatra, causing a 10-metre-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and cost the lives of about 300 people.
2016: A low-lying earthquake struck the Pindi Jaya area of Atchek, causing disaster and panic, as it brought to the world memories of the devastating 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people were killed by buildings that fell.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lobok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded in the area.
Sarah Palin's eldest son has been arrested for domestic violence.
Trac Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for assault.
The 29-year-old Palin, from Wasila, Alaska, was arrested as a suspect in domestic violence, obstruction of a complaint of domestic violence and resistance to the principle, according to a report published Saturday by the state-run Trokaop police.
According to the police report, when a well-known woman tried to call the police to report the crimes she allegedly committed, she grabbed the phone from her hands.
Paolin is being held temporarily at the Mat-Su temporary detention facility, with a $500 guarantee, as reported on the KTUU television station.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, where he said "definitely, innocent" when asked, according to the network.
Palin is facing charges for three Category A flooding, which means he can be sentenced to up to a year’s imprisonment and a $250,000 fine.
He is also charged with a Category A offense, which is punishable by a one-day prison sentence and a fine of $2,000.
This isn't the first time he's been prosecuted against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case has now been brought before the Alaskan Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstructing a complaint about the criminal offence of domestic violence and possession of weapons, while he was in a state of intoxication.
His partner claimed to have stabbed her in the face.
Sarah Palin received criticism from veterans groups in 2016 when she linked her son’s violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder caused by his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-degree earthquake on the Richter scale caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electrical and communications networks have been cut off, while the number of deaths is expected to increase in the coming days.
The quake struck near central Sulawesi, located northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
On social media, videos are circulating from the moment of the disastrous incident.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach party in the city of Palou when the tsunami hit the coast.
U.S. Attorneys Call for Rarely Imposed Death Penalty for Suspect of Terrorist Attack in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York are demanding the imposition of the death penalty on Saifoulos Saipoff, the suspect in the terrorist attack in New York City that has cost him his life since the coup costing him the lives of eight people.
Saif, 30, is reported to have used a rented van from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bike path along West Side Avenue in Lower Manhattan, smuggling 31 pedestrians and cyclists into his car.
In order to justify the death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov killed the eight victims "intentionally" and caused serious bodily harm "intentionally", according to the prosecutor's statement of intent to impose the death sentence.
Both of these charges impose the death penalty, according to the transcript.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal jury brought Sa<0xC3><0xAF>pof to trial with a charge of 22 counts, which included eight counts of manslaughter and one count of manslaughter in favour of a criminal organization, a tactic that is frequently applied.
The attack required "significant planning and pre-examination," prosecutors said, describing the way in which Sa<0xC3><0xAF>pof carried out the attack as "intimidating, hard and ruthless."

Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina, according to the report.
It has been a decade since the last time the Court of the Southern District of New York has prosecuted a case that has upheld the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug traffickers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty for a federal case was imposed in New York was in 1953 on the wives of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who were executed after two years of imprisonment for conspiracy to commit espionage in favor of the Soviet Union.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, appeared relentless in the days and months that followed the attack, according to court documents.
He told the investigators that he felt satisfied with his act, according to the police.
Saif told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the ISIS video attack he saw on his mobile, according to the indictment.
He also asked for the ISIS flag to be placed in his hospital room, according to the police.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22 charges listed in the indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal public prosecutors representing Saipov, said they were "apparently disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to request the imposition of the death penalty instead of the acceptance of the declaration of guilt for life imprisonment with no possibility of release will simply prolong the injury that caused the events for all of them," he said.
Saif's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to request the imposition of the death penalty.
TORIS MEP Says Naitzel Faratz Should Be Headed of Brexit Negotiations <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Nigel Farage vowed to “mobilize the people’s army” today during a rally of protests at the Tories conference.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party (UKIP) said politicians should “feel the pressure” from Eurosceptics, as one of the MEPs in the U.K. Theresa May said he should be under pressure.
Conservative MP Peter Boone told protesters in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would have "already come out" by now if Mr Farage was the responsible Brexit minister.
But the challenge that Mrs May faces in her attempt to reconcile her deeply divided MPs was underlined by the fact that supporters of the stay in the EU, Toris, participated in a separate rally of protests against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to keep the Chequers compromise plan under control amid attacks by Brexit proponents, proponents of the stay in the EU and the EU.
The allies insisted on moving forward with their efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the reactions and forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its package and the "chaos".
Mr. Boon told the Leave Means Leave protest rally in Solihal that he wanted to throw "the Chequers Plan" away.
He said that he should have been granted a title of nobility to Mr Farage and that he had been given powers to negotiate with Brussels.
“If we were the head, we’d be gone by now,” he said.
Wellingboro MP added: "I will support Brexit but we have to throw away the Chequers plan."
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in global wars to become subordinates.
“We want to make our own laws in our country.”
Mr. Bowe rejected the claims that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The assumption that the British people have changed their mind and wish to stay is completely untrue."
The pro-Brexit member of the Tories Andrea Jenkins was also at the rally and told reporters: “I just say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers plan does not have the approval of the general public, the Opposition is not going to vote for it, it does not have the approval of our party and our activists who are going down the streets and electing us.
Please leave the Chequers plan and start listening to it.'
With a sharp message to Mrs. May, she added: “Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Farage told the protest rally that politicians should be forced to “feel the pressure” if they are preparing to betray the decision made with the 2016 referendum.
“It is now a matter of trust between us – the people – and the class of our politicians,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to tell them ‘we won’t let you save it if you do that.’”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make the order of our politicians, who are preparing to betray Brexit, feel the pressure.
“We are mobilizing the people’s army of this country that has given us victory with Brexit and we will never rest until we become an independent, sovereign and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, supporters of the stay in the EU marched in Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A handful of activists were pushing the Tories’ banner against Brexit after the group’s rallies this weekend.
Labour MP Lord Adonis sneered the Conservatives over the security issues they faced with an application of the party at the start of the session.
“It’s the same people who tell us that they can put into operation the information systems and all the technological means needed for the EU-Canada type agreement with enrichment, for the unfettered border, for free trade without borders,” he said.
"It's an absolute physique.
“There is no good Brexit,” he added.
Warren is planning to seriously consider the possibility of running for the presidency.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she will seriously consider the possibility of running for the presidency after the November elections in the United States.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democratic senator spoke about her future plans during a rally in a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday, the U.S.-based U.S.-based U.S. intelligence agency said.
Warren, who frequently criticises President Donald Trump, is demanding her re-election in November, with an opponent of Republican state representative Jeff Dell, who co-chaired the 2016 Trump campaign in the United States.
It is strongly suspected that he may face Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with voters using the structures of the town hall since Trump’s term of office began.
An attendee at the meeting asked her if she was planning to run for the presidency.
Warren responded that it was time "to go to Washington women to build our disbanded government and that means a woman has to be at the top."
Arrest for the fatal shooting of the LSU Sims basketball player <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Police in Los Angeles’ Bathon Rose announced Saturday the arrest of a suspect in the fatal shooting of LSU basketball player Wade Sims on Friday, according to Reuters.
The Batton Rouge police department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Diton Simpson in a press interview at 11am (Eastern Time Zone).
They had posted a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help in identifying the man who appeared in the video.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot dead near the campus of Southern University early on Friday.
"Wood Simms suffered a bullet wound to the head, which led to his death," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, according to the 247-page sports network.
Wade intervened to defend his friend and was shot by the Simpsons.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being at the spot holding the gun and confessed to shooting Wade Simms.
Simpson was arrested without any resistance and detained in the Police Department of the Eastern Batton Rouge neighborhood.
The 1.98-year-old Sims, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games, with 10 appearances as a key player last season, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is going for a world title as the team's instructions gave him the hand to win over Sebastian Fettel.
It became clear from the moment Valtery Boots passed in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team's orders would play an important role in the race.
At the start, Booth had a good start and almost hanged Hamilton, as he defended his position in the first two laps and called on Fetell to attack his home base.
Fettel went to the pits first and let Hamilton run in the race queue, which should have been decisive.
Mercedes went to the pit a lap later and came out behind Fettel, but Hamilton came out in front after a wheel-by-wheel fight, which forced the Ferrari driver to give up on the in-house race to overrun the race due to the risk of suffering the offense.
Max Ferstapen started from last place and was seventh at the end of the first round today of his 21st birthday.
He then remained first for a large part of the race, as he held his tyres aiming to finish fast and pass in front of Kimmy Rickonen in fourth place.
He eventually went to the pits in the 44th lap, but was unable to increase his speed in the remaining eight lap, as Rikonen came fourth.
“It’s a tough day because Walter was fantastic all weekend and he was a real gentleman who let me through.
“The team did a great job and did a one-two,” Hamilton said.
The body language was very bad.
President Donald Trump mocked U.S. Senator Diane Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for her insistence that she had not leaked the letter from Christine Blazi Ford, in which he accused the candidate for the Supreme Court of the United States.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to Ford's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, commenting instead that "the perpetrators and the perpetrators in the Senate proved to be human beings."
“The only thing that could happen is this beautiful thing that’s happening in the last few days in the Senate, where you see anger, you see people who are angry and miserable and miserable and lying,” he said.
“When you see posts and leaks and then they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t.
I didn't do it."
You remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you make the leak?
Remember her answer... you leaked the paper-- "Oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't infiltrate it."
Well, wait a minute.
If we leaked...No, we didn’t leak,” the senator added imitating.
Feinstein received Ford's letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh in July and it leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the leak was made by her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't leak her story," Feinstein told the committee, as reported in the Hill newspaper.
"He asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as he asked me to."
But her refusal didn’t seem to convince the president, who commented during Saturday’s rally: “I’ll tell you something, the body language was very bad.
He may not have, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing to defend the candidate for the Supreme Court, who was accused by three women of sexual harassment, the president let it be understood that the Democrats are using the charges to serve their own purposes.
“They are determined to take back power by using any means necessary,” he said.
You see the viciousness, the misery, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to step on to take power and control," the president said, according to the news website Mediaite.

<0xE2><0x86><0x90> Air traffic controller loses his life to smother hundreds of plane passengers from earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia declares himself a hero, as he lost his life in an effort to ensure the safe take-off of an aircraft carrying hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are missing as a result of a major earthquake that struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to hit the area and many have been trapped in debris in the city of Palou.
However, even though his colleagues ran to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung refused to relinquish his position in the manicured control tower of Pou Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He remained in his position to ensure that flight 6321 of the airline Batik Air, which was in the take-off corridor at the time, could take off safely.
Then, he jumped out of the control tower when he thought he was crashing.
He later died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia's spokesman, Joanes Sirrett, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australia's ABC News television network.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palou.
"We are shocked by his death," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the dead could be thousands, while the country's disaster management service reports that access to the cities of Dongala, Sighi and Bhutan is limited.
"The death toll is expected to rise further, as many bodies are still under debris, and many of them we have not been able to reach," said the ministry's spokesman, Sutopo Purgo Nugrocho.
Waves that reached the six meters destroyed the Palo, which will be held a mass funeral ceremony on Sunday.
Military and commercial aeroplanes bring aid and supplies to the region.
Riza Kuzuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance brings bodies.
The clean water is very little.
Mini-markets are being looted everywhere."
Jean-Gelfand, president of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is struggling to save survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
What happened is already a tragedy, but it can get a lot worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widondo arrived in Palo on Sunday and told the country’s army: “I ask you to work day and night to bring all the work related to the evacuation to an end.
“Are you ready?” he told CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lobok, which cost the lives of more than 550 people.
Air Niugini says a man is missing after a plane crash in a lake in Micronesia <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The airline, which carried out a flight that crashed into a Pacific lake in Micronesia, now reports that a man is missing, while earlier it said that all 47 passengers and crew members had been evacuated by air.
Air Niugini said in a press release that since Saturday afternoon it has not been able to find the traces of a male passenger.
The airline said it was cooperating with local authorities, hospitals and investigators on the man’s locating.
The airline did not respond directly to requests for more information about the passenger, such as his or her age or nationality.
Boats from the area helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water as it tried to land at the Chuk Island airport.
Authorities said on Friday that seven people had been taken to a hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were staying at the hospital on Saturday and that all of them were in stable condition.
The causes of the conflict and the exact sequence of events remain unclear. . . .
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane had been sunk into the lakeside off the landing hallway, the U.S. Navy said.
Some of the witnesses believed that the plane had passed through the landing hall.
U.S. passenger Bill Janes said the plane had landed at a very low altitude.
"That's very good," said Janes.
Janes said he and others were able to pass through the water that reached them as far as the middle of the emergency escape exits of the sinking plane.
He said the airmen had panicked and yelled, and he himself suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that some sailors who were working there to improve a dock also helped rescue by using a inflatable boat to transport people to the shore before the sinking of the ship to a depth of about 30.
According to data from the Air Safety Network, 111 people have lost their lives in conflicts of airlines registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none of these conflicts were involved by Air Ni.
Analyst specifies the schedule of the night when a woman was burned alive
The indicted authority completed its purchase on Saturday in a repetitive trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive from Mississippi in 2014. . . .
U.S. Department of Justice Analyst Paul Roulet has spent hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
She explained to jurors how she used cell phone records to track the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
Roulet said she received location records from various mobile phones that showed that Telis was with Chambers the night of her death, disproving his previous allegations, as reported by the Clarion Ledger newspaper.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers's cell phone for as long as he claimed to be with Michael Sanford's friend, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified as a witness on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When the indictment asked him if Telis was telling the truth that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said "he was lying, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Telis said she knew Chambers about two weeks before her death, and that she had been in a relationship.
The cell phone records showed that they only knew for a week.
Roulet said that sometime after Chambers' death, Tallis recorded Chambers' messages, calls, and contact details from his phone.
"He wrote it down from his life," Hale said.
The defense is set to begin its purchase on Sundays.
The judge said he believes that later that day the trial will be put to the jury's judgement.
The High Breed: What Is Conscious Hip Hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative view that prevails about the genre, filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claim that hip hop has escaped its roots, which were the political messages and the handling of social issues.
They want to go back to his roots and make the conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as the Fugees and Common experience a recent recovery in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Is there another black man?
A New York girl sues a couple who fired her after receiving a “racist” message.
A New York nanny is suing a couple for racist dismissal after receiving a message from her mother that she had mistakenly complained that the nanny was "another black man."
The couple denies being racist, resembling the treatment to "extortion".
Lince Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two, was disappointed when she realized that the new babysitter Jessiel Morris was black, the last she appeared for her first day at work in 2016.
"Other Black's Eighty-Three," Ms. Plasko-Flaksman wrote in a message to her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mr. Morris, and even twice.
As soon as she became aware of her misfortune, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman dismissed Mrs. Morris, stating that their absentee nurse, who was an African-American, had done no good work at all with New York, and waited in her place for one.
Mrs. Morris received a reward for her one and only working day and was then sent home with Uber.
Now, Ms. Morris has filed a lawsuit against the couple seeking compensation for her dismissal and is demanding compensation in the amount of $350 a day for her six-month-long work as an internal nurse, for whom she had originally been hired, and if she has been vaccinated, she will be fined.
“I want to show them that, look, you can’t do such things,” he told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s about discrete treatment.”
The couple opposes claims that they are racist, saying it was logical to fire Morris, as they feared that they would not be able to trust her again after she was insulted.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to send her.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists," husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you've offended, even by mistake?
Is it your newborn baby?
Come on, now."
Comparing the lawsuit to “extortion,” Plasko said that his wife had given birth just two months ago and was in a “very difficult situation.”
"Would you be chasing someone who is in this situation?
It's not that polite," the banker added.
While the legal case is underway, the court of public opinion hastened to condemn the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and rationality.
The publishers of Pennington feared that readers would not show interest in a talking bear, as a new letter reveals . . .
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to get in the place of someone who read it for the first time before its release.
It’s a lot of fun when you know what we know now about the huge success of Paddington.”
She said her father, who worked as an illustrator for the BBC before being inspired to write the children's book by a bear, was optimistic about his work, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book's release was "a fairy tale."
Regarding Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of the family", she added that her father was secretly proud of his subsequent success.
“He was a pretty quiet man and he wasn’t a superhero,” he said.
“But because Paddington was so real in his eyes, it was almost like having a child who accomplishes something: you’re proud of it even if it’s not your own accomplishment in reality.
I think that's how he saw Pendington's success.
Although he was a creation of his own and his own imagination, he always paid tribute to Paddington himself."
My daughter died, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After the landing, her daughter was rushed to the Nice Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“Nand kept calling and telling me it was very bad, that he didn’t have much hope for it,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“Sometimes, Nad called me to tell me that he was going to die within the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tassie, I love you too much, darling.
I'll be back to you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications given to her by the doctors to keep her heart alive were slowly declining and she was getting out of her body.
He had already died a few hours ago and at that time and now everything was erased.
I had to just sit there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn’t scream, scream, or cry because I was surrounded by families and people, and I couldn’t cry.
“I had to stay cool.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who so far mourns the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with the other passengers, who ignored the test she was passing.
“Nobody knew,” he said.
"I had my head lowered and they were running tears all the time.
It's hard to explain, but when I was on the plane, I had a sense of sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and my understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Women Complaining About Losing Their Own Faces Hanging Cards On Bridges To Prevent Suicides
Two women who have lost their loved ones by suicide are trying to prevent other people from taking their lives away from their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are hanging on a bridge in Wales with cards with emotional messages and phone numbers that can be called to get back-up. . . .
Mrs. Davis’ son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he began suffering from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I feel every day,” he said.
The 45-year-old Davis, who lives in Linden, said her son was a very promising chef, with a contagious smile.
"They all knew him because of his smile.
They always said that his smile was lighting up the room. "
However, he quit his job before he died, as “he was in a very bad condition.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was then 11 years old, was the one who found his brother after putting an end to his life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm just worried there'll be an impact."
Mrs. Davis created the cards "to inform the world that there are people out there that you can go and talk to, even if they are your friends.
Don't be silent - you have to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davis for many years, lost Mark, her 15-year companion, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he felt down or sad or anything like that,” he said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He had caught up on Christmas Day - when the kids opened their presents, he didn't look them in the eye."
He said his death caused them a huge injury, but they have to get over it: "It's breaking up the family.
It's crushing us.
But we all have to go on and fight.”

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is uncertain as the FBI begins an investigation.
"I thought that if we could actually achieve something like what she was looking for - a limited-term and limited-object research - maybe we could bring some succinctness," Mr. Flake said in an interview on Saturday, adding that she was afraid of the possibility.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want to conduct an FBI investigation?
Their reluctance is entirely due to the time constraint.
The midterm elections are only in five weeks, on November 6, and if, as expected, the Republicans are not doing well, they will be significantly weakened in terms of their efforts to succeed in the election of the person they wish to the upper house.
George Walker Bush calls Senators, forcing them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who was working in the White House for Mr. Bush, and through him met his wife, Ashley, who was his personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI's report is submitted?
A vote will be held in the Senate, which is currently composed of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to get the majority and confirm his appointment to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's Number of Displaced Persons Drops Under Kim's Rule
The number of detainees from North Korea to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea’s Ministry of Consolidation, said that there were 1,127 detachments last year, up from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher fees for smugglers were key factors, the report said.
Pyongyang has not made any public remarks.
In the vast majority of North Koreans, South Korean citizenship is finally offered to them.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are fleeing through China, which has the largest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross compared to the heavily-protected De-Secured Zone between North and South Korea.
China considers deportees illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often expels them by force.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are formally still at war, have improved significantly in recent months, according to Reuters.
Earlier in the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the negotiations on de-nuclearization, which have been delayed.
The meeting came after the historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore, where they agreed on broad terms to cooperate on the de-nuclearization of the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea’s Secretary of State Reim Jong Il blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and under these conditions, in no case will we disarm our country unilaterally first,” Rim said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Cavanaugh a “mystery” and says he is unsuitable for serving in the Supreme Court.
Democratic Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi called the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh "mysterious" and said that he is on his own initiative unsuitable to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I could only think that if a woman behaved in this way, they would call her ‘hysterical’,” Pelosi commented on Kavanaugh’s testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh, with intense emotion, denied the allegations that he had committed a sexual assault against Dr. Christine Bluey Ford when they were both teenagers.
At the time of his inception, Kavanaugh was deeply moved, sometimes almost yelling, and his voice was running as he talked about his family and his school years.
He also unequivocally condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the charges against him "a monstrous and coordinated political murder", organized by liberals who have been outraged by the 2016 defeat of Hillary Clinton.
Pelosi said she believes that Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he cannot serve in the Supreme Court, as she showed that he is biased against the Democrats.
"I think he excluded himself with these statements and in the way he did against the Clintons and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi responded when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if his appointment was confirmed and if the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’m going to say this — if he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he’s not only suitable for the Supreme Court, but also for the court he’s serving in right now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is a judge of the District Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia (D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals).
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about Kavanaugh’s possible decisions on the Affordable Care Act or the Roy v. Wade case, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In the hearings on the confirmation of his appointment, Kavanaugh avoided answering questions about whether he would overturn certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“Isn’t it time for a hysterical, prejudiced man to go to court and wait for us to say ‘isn’t that wonderful?’” said Pelosi.
And women should have it in their possession.
It’s a legitimate eruption, months and years of anger are fading away and he can’t get it out of it without crying.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't find it unusual, do you?"
She went on to say, "I was helped a lot by a woman who was a boss somewhere, who said that she was crying when she was pregnant, too, but she had developed a technique according to which when she was pregnant and she began to think that she was crying," she said to the person she was talking to.
I'm angry."
And so it just went on.
And it seemed great to me."
Tears are allowed as a rash of anger in part because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my strongest recollections of a job I used to do, in an office where men dominated, is one time I cried in unrelenting anger and a long-haired woman grabbed me by the throat - a long-haired woman - a cold-haired director whom I loved.
“Don’t ever let them see you cry,” he said.
"They don't know you're upset.
They think you're sad and they'll be glad they broke you."
Patricia Srander, then a Democratic senator from Colorado, had collaborated with Gary Hart in his campaign for the presidency.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught having an extra-marital relationship on a ship called Monkey Business and left the race humiliated, Mrs. Sreeder, who was deeply disappointed in her speech, thought that there was no such thing.
"It wasn't such a wise decision," he said laughing, 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was one more nomination.
Someone described the situation as "The Snowman and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because the campaign had already started a long time ago, it was back in funding and so he vowed that he would not enter the election race if he had not raised $2 million.
The battle was lost.
She found out that some of her supporters, who gave $1,000 to men, gave her just $250.
"Do they think I have a discount?" he wondered.
In her speech in which she announced that she would not start an official campaign, she was very intensely charged with feelings - gratitude for the people who supported her - disillusionment with the system that made it so difficult for her to worship.
"You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," Mrs. Srander recalls of the press' reactions to her.
"You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to write on my graveyard?
"Crying"?
How the trade war between the U.S. and China can do good in Beijing
The congratulations on the U.S.-China trade war were overwhelming, and while the battle still has a long way to go, a rift between the two countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year, taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation took place this week, with new tariffs on goods worth 200 million U.S. dollars (150 million pounds), essentially taxing half of all products imported into the U.S. from China.
Beijing is returning fires in kind every time, while it has recently imposed tariffs of five to ten percent on goods worth $60 million (<0xC2><0xA3>1 million) in the world.
China is determined to pay back the US fires and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to put it down anytime soon.
In order to make Washington resign, he will have to commit to their demands, but to publicly worship in the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
But, according to experts, if Beijing can play its cards correctly, U.S. pressures in the context of the trade war could turn out to be positive for China in the long term by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
"The fact that an urgent political decision by the US Security Center, either in Washington or in Beijing, could create the conditions for an economic collapse in any of the two countries, in fact, is far more dangerous than the observers have admitted."
Syria is “ready” for the return of refugees, according to the Foreign Minister
Syria claims that it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help in rebuilding the country that has been damaged by the seven-year (and now) war.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Secretary of State Walid al-Muhammad said that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation in the country is more stable and safe thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government is continuing to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by the terrorists in order to restore normalcy.
All the conditions are now met for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that were forced to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and their livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the outbreak of the war in 2011.
A further six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Muhammad said aid for the reconstruction of the devastated country was welcomed by the Syrian government.
However, he stressed that he would not accept aid on terms or aid from countries that supported the insurgency.
Europe locks down victory at the Ridder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Rider Cup, winning the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 at Le Golf National, outside Paris in France.
The American team has now been defeated 6 times in a row on European soil and has won the Ridder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe again took first place, as the team of the Danish leader Thomas Björn reached the 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
U.S. team star Phil Michaelston, who fought hard in the longest run of the tournament, threw his shot into the water in the par-3 16th hole, conceding the victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari gleamed in all his rounds and thus became one of the 4 players who have won 5-0-0 since the current form of the tournament began, in 1979.
The American Jordan Spith was defeated in 5&4 by the lowest-ranked player of the European team, the Dane Thorbjorn Olsen.
The best-ranked player in the world, Dustin Johnson, won 2 and 1 against Ian Puller from England, who may have played his last game in the Rider Cup.
Spain’s eight-Pokal veteran Sergio Garcia has been crowned the most winning European of all time in the tournament with a total of 25.5 points.
“I usually don’t cry, but today I can’t hold back.
It's been a tough year.
I'm grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very happy that we got the cup back.
It’s all about the team and I’m glad I was able to help,” Garcia said excitedly after the European victory.
He gives the skeleton to fellow countryman John Ram, who defeated the American legend of golf Tiger Woods 2&1 in an individual game on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to have won Tiger Woods, I grew up admiring this guy," Ram, 23, said in a statement.
Woods lost in all four of his matches in France and now has a career record in the Ridder Cup 13-21-3.
Unusual statistics for one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 important titles and has only surpassed him by Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend to find a goal, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Fino, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Chief Jim Farick said after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these kids, they fought it.
At some point this morning, we put a lot of pressure on Europe.
We've fought hard.
Well, congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great leader.
All 12 players have played very well.
We will reorganize, cooperate with the PGA of the United States and the Ridder Cup Commission, and we will move forward.
I love these 12 kids and I'm proud to be their leader.
We have to admit it.
They were better than us.”
