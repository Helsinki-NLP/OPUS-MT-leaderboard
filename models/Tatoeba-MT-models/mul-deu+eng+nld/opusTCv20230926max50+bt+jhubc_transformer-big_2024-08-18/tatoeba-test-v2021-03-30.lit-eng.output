I thought she had no reason to share what she did.
Aren't you tired?
Good evening, how's it going?
She's very beautiful.
I told myself that.
People should work.
"Shut up," he whispered.
Because he often lies, he can’t be trusted.
What do you want to say?
Leave me alone!
I do it without any problems.
Mark took his belongings and left.
We finally found out the truth.
You look stupid.
Currently, Tom is teaching English in Japan.
Tom was complaining about the noise.
No one came.
Whose bike did you want to borrow?
Did you ever tell anyone where our hiding place is?
I went to Japan for the first time.
Look at what Mary is doing.
He knows how to play poker.
Thank you very much.
It's finally over.
I don't like school.
The bird was looking for worms.
I am proud of my son.
Mary broke into the kitchen.
I don’t have the slightest understanding.
Don't rush that.
Why are you so angry?
There are a lot of words I don’t understand.
Can I have a cup of tea?
I have to tell her the truth tomorrow.
My dream is to learn the totorian language in Kazan.

Betsy always managed to get what she wanted.
You didn't say anything?
Stay with me, ladies and gentlemen.
She knows exactly what she wants.
Hey, hey.
Did Tom forgive you for what you did last week?
Good morning, it's time to wake up.
The baby was crying all night.
She didn’t like living in the city.
This size is too big for me.
That won't change anything.
Do what you want.
That man you saw yesterday is my uncle.
I don't like winter.
I gave Tom a chance.
We played golf in spite of the rain.
What's the test?
He told me the story of his life.
I decided to be happy because it is good for my health.
I'll wait here until he gets back.
The teacher teaches.

They don't help.
Please contact me as soon as you arrive in Boston.
She asked me who was the first to come.
Sooner or later we will all die.
How long will it take?
It is a shadow.
Where is the German Embassy?
Be kind to me.
This rose is amazing.
But he knew it couldn’t go on.
Probably not.
I want it too!
She looks but doesn’t see anything.
You can’t eat anything sweet today.
She's eating.
I would like to travel around the world.
Do you like the Italian language?
I got five years in prison.
I didn't.
Any universe that is simple enough to be understood is too simple to create a mind that can understand it.
We didn't have to rush.
I'm asking?
It doesn’t matter which team wins the match.
He's running.
This dress is too big for me.
Go and sit next to your car.
Bring her a plate of salads.

What's the difference?
You're like that.
She rejected my request.
Which one do you prefer?
I love the Korean food, though.

They discussed the problem.
If I hadn't received his help, I'd be dead.
He was almost slumbering.
I have one brother.
What are you here for?
Do you like this color?
Isn't it strange that Tom isn't here right now?
A million people lost their lives during the war.
Compare your sentence with that on the board.
She agreed with him happily.
They need our help.
Did you get Tom's message?
I don't like how he speaks.
I don't know what they're doing to me anymore.
I learned a lot from him.
He's killed that man.
Don’t expect too much.
That brown hat is old.
He's playing golf every Sunday.
Be creative .
I couldn't understand what he was saying.
Close the gate.
I'm always tired.
He's a weird guy.
Go back to your place.

His son is eight years old.
If I had wings, I'd fly to you.
Where the hell are you going?

Don't go now, we're getting ready for lunch.
Italy is a very beautiful country.
That's an old slut.
Eat the bread!
Although he lives in the United States, Thomas does not speak English.
The school is five miles from my house.
I gave up my weapons.
Who ate all of our food?
I know her bread will be delicious.
I'm asking you to come.

What does that mean?
The apples on the other side of the wall are the sweetest.
What's that?
I am studying the Japanese language.
It's pointless.
She had the head of a woman, the body of a lion, the wings of a bird, and the tail of a snake.
Tell me how you figured out that problem.
Would you like to dance with me?
Even if I wanted to, I wouldn't be able to explain what happened there.
I'm afraid of heights.
I don't know where to go.
If it doesn't, then we won't.
What's going on with me?
I agree.

It’s time to start a new business.
Let's wait here.
That girl I told you about living here.
Please, just go away.
I can't believe she's older than my mother.
Look back and you'll see the black cat.
Her family traveled a lot.
Do you know him?
I don’t know whether to turn left or right.
I’ll clean the kitchen later.
He came from a small town in the mountains.
I was talking to my friends.
All of your cats are grey.
I still remember those days when we were making a comeback with you.
When we go to sleep, we say "sleeping."
The scandal has ruined his career.
Cats are complex individuals.
He was so poor that he couldn’t buy bread.
I suggest you ask Tom.
This bag is not small.
There's nothing wrong with that.
If you invite him, he'll probably come.
I know that you know that I know.
Go home by six o'clock.
The bread is fresh.
I'll be back in half an hour.
I don’t want to be bad anymore.
Are you a lawyer?
Where's your school?
The candles lit up the room.
I'm sorry.
Fold the paper in half.
What does he write in the letter?
A woman eats bread.
I ate the apple.
A lonely person gets pleasure by watching the ants.
Who's that man sitting at the other table?
Are you pregnant?

The eternal silence of these infinite spaces scares me.
Why do you need a new umbrella?

You need patience, Tom.
How'd you do?
Your journey begins here.
Can you believe what he said?
Tom asked where you were.
I'd like to help, but I'm very busy.
Thomas couldn’t stop thinking about Mary.
I think we need to call Tom.
Don't be late for the bus.
All the apples are there.
You're gonna have to pay.
What time should we go to the station?
The more I think about it, the less I like it.
I'll take you to a new store.
Everybody knows her.
She is incredibly naive.
Where do you live in Turkey?
Thomas is lost.

He walked into my room without permission.
You can't just leave.
Come on, Jew!
You can sit in a chair.
Where do you live if you don’t have a home?

I asked her to wait a minute.
How long have you been learning Esperanto?
They do not pose a threat.
Her advice led me to go abroad.
You're the only one who can help me.
What places did he visit?
He started having a lot of sex. That's why we played inside.

But I don't want to.
I'm sorry I can't see you tonight.

Do not speak in the reader.
What's the matter with you, sir?
I'd exchange yen for dollars.
I hate the winter.

When do you want to do it?
Tom didn't show up.
Don't be so serious, it's just a game.
He told me a funny story.
I don't have time now.
Tom is the captain of our team.

What does it remind you of?

Where are we?
I've got twenty-five.
Her squirrel looked funny.
She's too young to understand it.

Look at the book on the table.

We saw her enter the park.
You don't look like you're busy.
It didn't look like you wanted that book.

I went inside through the window.
Take Tom to the hospital.
I have a white cat.
He quickly wrote down our names.
Our son died during the war.
He is dissatisfied with the result.
Of course you are wrong.
I can't say who's coming first.

We may as well all go.
Who is that person sitting at the other end of the table?
This idea is very attractive.
They're going shopping.
Everything that is genius is simple.
Your students are learning too much.

It's my fault.
Not bad, but I'm a little tired.
This is a wonderful idea.

He looked down at his dirty shoes.
Her cat was lying on my pillow and didn’t want to come down.
There are several good hotels in the city.
What is this letter from?
He doesn’t want to learn today.
We are all different.
You don't know how much I love you.
I wrote a long letter to her.
He couldn’t do what he wanted.
I feel a little weak today.
Life is fun.
She's here?

These clothes are right for you.
Let's not blame her.
Do you know that you are stronger than you think?
I love her so much that I can't leave her.
Can you come with us?
I don't care.
Tom couldn’t find a reason why he had to go home early.
Raise your hand.
He did not sell the house.
No one has ever seen God.
She saw someone waiting for her at the school.
You don't look like you're busy.
Where's Maria?
The new contract allows us to demand whatever we want.
Tom is still a prisoner.
Go and open the door.
I said I’ll have another one later.
God, help me!
She told him she was happy.
She needs him more than he needs her.
What a fun outcome!
