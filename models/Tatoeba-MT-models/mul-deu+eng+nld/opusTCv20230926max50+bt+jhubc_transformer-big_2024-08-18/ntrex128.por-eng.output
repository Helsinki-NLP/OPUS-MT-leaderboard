Members of the Assembly of Wales fear "passing through Marretas"
There is a consternation on the part of some Members of the Assembly of Wales (AM) regarding the suggestion that their title be changed to MWP (Deputies of the Welsh Parliament).
The origin of this controversy is in the plans to change the name of the assembly to "Wales Parliament".
Some members of this assembly, from all political backgrounds, fear that this will make them ridiculous.
An AM worker said the group is concerned about the fact that "the designation rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For non Welsh readers: in Welsh, "twp" means "idiot" and pwp means "excrements".
An AM from Plaid said the group as a whole was "not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative MP said the group was "open minded" about the name change, but said the MWP designation was verbally too close to Muppet (Marreta).
In this context, the letter w in Welsh has a pronunciation similar to that of the letter u in English of Yorkshire.
The Committee of the Assembly, currently drafting legislation to introduce the name changes, stated: "The final decision on how Members of the Assembly are appointed will obviously be taken by themselves".
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 gave its assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which noted widespread support for the proposal to designate the Assembly as the "Galician Parliament".
On the question of the title of AM, the Commission favoured "Deputies of the Welsh Parliament", or WMP, but the MWP option was more favoured in a public consultation.
Apparently, the AMs are suggesting alternatives, but the effort to gather the consensus may be a headache for President Elin Jones, who is expected to present a draft legislation on the amendments within a few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes to the way the assembly conducts its activities, such as rules on the disqualification of AMs and the configuration of the commission system.
When they debate the legislation, the AMs will have the final word on the question of how they should be designated.
Macedonians to Referendum on Change of Country Name
Voters will vote on Sunday to change their country’s name to the “Republic of North Macedonia.”
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to resolve a decades-long conflict with neighboring Greece, which integrates a province with the name of Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor constitutes a complaint about its territory, having repeatedly objected to its requests for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, opponent of the plebiscite on the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is no more than the price to pay for EU and NATO membership.
St. Martin's Synods Quiet at a Time when Harlem Churches Struggle for Survival
“From a historical perspective, the elderly I spoke to told me there was a bar and a church in every corner,” Adams said.
"Today, there is neither one nor the other."
The disappearance of the bars, he said, was understood.
“People socialize differently,” he said.
“The bars are no longer the living rooms in the neighborhood where people go to regularly.”
As far as churches are concerned, he is concerned about the possibility that the money earned from the sale of property will not last as long as the leaders expect, and that sooner or later everything will return exactly to the starting point."
The churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums inhabited by the type of people who will not support the neighborhood shrines that remain.
“The overwhelming majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white,” he said, “and therefore, such will hasten the arrival of the day when these churches will close all of them, as it is unlikely that the majority of those who move to these complexes will join these congregations.”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation left here in the 1930s.
The building was later laid up by a black congregation that held its worships in the vicinity.
St. Martin's was occupied by a black congregation under the auspices of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of shopkeepers on 125th Street, a major commercial street in Harlem that resisted hiring and promoting black employees.
A fire in 1939 left the building severely damaged; however, when they made plans for its reconstruction, Father Johnson's parishioners ordered the railroad.
Rev. David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the railroad "the bells of the poor".
The expert who touched the railroad in July called it another thing: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
This expert, Tiffany Ng, of the University of Michigan, also reported that it was the first railroad in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who moved to the largest railroad at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What happened in St. Martin’s in recent months was a complicated story of architects and contractors, some brought by the church’s lay leaders and others by the episcopal diocese.
The parish council, the governing body of the parish made up of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July, expressing its concern that it would "seek to bear its costs", displeased that it had not been involved in the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark Causes Injuries to 13-Year-Old Teenager on Lobster Hunting Dive in California
A shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday during a lobster hunt in California on the first day of the lobster season, officials said.
The attack occurred shortly after 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour as he heard the boy scream for help, then rowing in his direction with a group to help him get out of the water.
Hammel stated that he initially thought it was only enthusiasm for catching a lobster, but then realized that the boy was screaming "I was bitten"!
I was bitten!
The entire area of the clavicle was torn apart, Hammel described what he observed when he reached the boy.
“I yelled at everyone to get out of the water, ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” added Hammel.
The boy was transported by air to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted to critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles said in a press release that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it was considered not to belong to a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the top of the trunk.
Authorities closed access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours, for investigation and security reasons.
Giles said there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury’s is competing with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with large warehouse-style cosmetics sections, supported by expert assistants.
As part of a substantial initiative to gain share in the UK cosmetics market, valued at <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion, that has continued to grow as sales of fashion clothing and household items rebound, these larger cosmetics sections will be tested in 11 stores that will be most widely deployed across the country.
This investment in cosmetics stems from the demand by supermarkets for ways to use exhibition space once used for TVs, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury's said it would double its beauty product catalog with the offer of up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing ranges of L’Oréal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also get more space with branded areas similar to those of stores such as Boots.
The supermarket chain is also relaunching its boutique makeup range so that most products comply with vegan regulations, something increasingly demanded by younger buyers.
In addition, The Fragrance Shop will test concessions at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week. The second, in Selly Oak, Birmingham, is expected to open near the end of the year.
Online shopping and the shift from grocery shopping habits to small daily quantities in nearby stores have now led supermarkets to make more effort to persuade customers to visit their stores.
Mike Coupe, executive chairman of Sainsbury's, said the stores will increasingly resemble large warehouses, as the supermarket chain tries to fight off the Aldi and Lidl discount stores with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has been installing Argos outlets in hundreds of stores, and has also installed a number of Habitats, as it acquired both chains two years ago, and claims that this has boosted grocery product sales and made acquisitions more profitable.
The company’s previous attempt to renovate its cosmetics and pharmacy departments has failed.
Sainsbury's tested a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the relationship ended after a dispute over the distribution of revenues from health product stores in its supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its pharmacy business three years ago with 281 points of sale to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million.
The company said Lloyds would participate in the plan by adding in four stores an extended range of luxury skincare brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s Chief Commercial Officer, said: “We have transformed the look and feel of our cosmetics departments to provide our customers with a more pleasant environment.
We also invest in the specialized training of colleagues, who will be available to advise the client.
Our range of brands has been designed to suit all needs. On the other hand, the inviting environment and practical locations make us now an irresistible point of sale of beauty products that breaks with the old ways of shopping."
Peter Jones 'angry' after Holly Willoughby quits <0xC2><0xA3>11 million business
Dragons Den star Peter Jones was “angry” after TV presenter Holly Willoughby left an 11 million-pound deal with her lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for the brand of truly home items and accessories.
The business of both had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand.
The 37-year-old This Morning spokeswoman announced on Instagram that she would leave the partnership.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Den star Peter Jones alive by leaving the lucrative last-minute brand to focus on her new highly profitable contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Some sources say Jones was "angry" when the TV gold girl admitted, during a tense meeting last Tuesday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new business (the Truly article could mark <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million) meant that she would have left her time.
The deal was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and was expected to double Willoughby’s estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune.
While Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones was taking a plane to one of his vacation homes abroad.
A source said: “Truely was by far the biggest of Holly’s priorities.
It would mean the resolution of its future in the long term and would be a financial support for the next two decades.
His decision to leave left everyone absolutely amazed.
No one believed what was happening on Tuesday... it was so close to launch.
There’s a warehouse full of ready-to-sell items at the headquarters in Marlow.”
Experts believe the departure of the presenter of This Morning, which is among Britain’s most lucrative stars, could cost the company millions, given the hefty investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and household items, and the potential for further delays in launching.
In addition, it may mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, with three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined the project as president in March.
The couple are on vacation together and Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is about to become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night that “we do not intend to comment on your business.”
The conversation lasted "and then we fell in love"
The U.S. president jokingly mentioned criticism that he would be the target of the media for making a comment that some would consider “a president unworthy” and for revealing such a positive attitude toward the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said, in his pretended voice, "telejournal pivo".
"I didn't give in to anything."
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after his initial meeting in Singapore in June, stressing that it would be a major step in the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations for denuclearization are dragging on.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, top North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that the North does not see a “corresponding response” from the US to the first steps toward North Korea’s disarmament.
Instead, he said, the U.S. continues with sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump adopted a more optimistic viewpoint in his speech at the rally.
“It’s going very well with North Korea,” he said.
“We were about to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
We now have this excellent relationship.”
Trump said his efforts to improve relations with Kim brought positive results: the end of missile tests, support for the release of hostages and the return to the country of the dead remains of U.S. military personnel.
In addition, he defended his unusual approach when he spoke about relations with Kim.
“It’s so easy to be worthy of a president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded arena, we’d have about 200 people standing right here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd directly in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia cause devastation on an island, causing the deaths of hundreds of people
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population had been displaced, it was not declared a national catastrophe, a prerequisite for the channeling of international aid.
“Unfortunately, they were, in many cases, clear to declare that they are not seeking international help; therefore, it becomes a bit difficult,” Ms. Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is organizing a team that will head to Palu, there is still no guarantee that foreign personnel will be able to work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster response agency, said Indonesian authorities were evaluating the situation in Palu to determine whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Despite the constant earthquakes suffered by Indonesia, the country remains terribly ill-prepared for the ires of nature.
Although they were built in Aceh, shelters against tsunami are not commonly seen on other coastlines.
It is likely that the apparent absence of a tsunami alarm mermaid in Palu, badly pleased with the validity of a warning, had contributed to the loss of lives.
In the most favorable times, traveling between the many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make the logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to arrive at the site of this new calamity.
President Joko Widodo, who made the infrastructure improvement a central piece of his election campaign, spent huge amounts on roads and railroads.
However, the funding shortage has hit Mr. Joko's executive, at a time when he faces his re-election next year.
The president is also being pressured by the persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands were displaced as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using catanas, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge makes a long shot to the tie goal against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat against Chelsea, with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when he was about 30 meters from the Chelsea beacon, with his team losing 1-0.
He made a touch to his left before making a shot towards the second bar.
In the attempt, the ball flew high over the large area as it headed to the upper right corner of the net.
In the end, the ball fell on a Kepa Arrizabalaga in flight and fell into the net.
“I was just trying to reach that position, to go to the ball, and players like Shaq are moving forward as much as possible, so I was just earning as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, I gave a touch and I didn't think too much about it. I just finished."
Chelsea won 1-0 in the interim after scoring a goal in the 25th minute of Belgian star Eden Hazard.
In that play, the forward of the blues gave a back heel pass to Mateo Kovacic before desegregating near the midfield and making a sprint towards the Liverpool area.
Kovacic made a quick pass to the midfield.
Then he made a beautiful finish that crossed the opposing defense, leading Hazard to the big area.
He went beyond the defenses and scored against the second-strap grid with a left foot shot that went through Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool face Naples in the Champions League group stage at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
Tsunami death toll in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country's disaster response agency said on Sunday.
There are reports describing a large number of people trapped in the debris of buildings that collapsed during the 7.5 magnitude earthquake on Friday, which triggered waves that reached 6 meters high, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the agency, at a news conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with the debris of the buildings that collapsed.
Police Arrest 32-Year-Old Man Suspected of Murder After Slaughtering Woman to Death
A murder investigation was initiated after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old victim was found at 7:55 a.m. with gunshot wounds in Grayson Mews, John Street, with a 32-year-old man arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police have urged the people of the area who may have witnessed something to give information.

We ask who has information to contact by DM <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 indicating the registration 247 of September 30th.
The statue of Cromwell of Parliament became the most recent monument engulfed by the contest of "historical revisionism"
His removal would constitute an act of poetic justice for his destruction, reminiscent of the Taliban’s perpetrated of so many English cultural and religious artifacts, and that was carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Crick’s suggestion as “an insanity” and “an attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable that in the current debate about removing statues, Oliver Cromwell’s figure next to the Palace of Westminster would become a target to shoot down.
The iconoclasty of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell is being sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent depiction of Cromwell, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is a testament to the opinion of the 19th century and part of historiography regarding a figure that many still believe to be worthy of honour.
Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is viewed by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as an advocate of parliament against external pressures, in his case, of course, of the monarchy.
Whether or not this constitutes an entirely accurate description is the subject of a continuing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and that Cromwell is a figure with individual notoriety that represents a side of this division.
His successes as Lord Protector are also worthy of tribute and commemoration."
Chinese Farmer Kills and Attacks Pork
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his nickname "Yuan", was found dead, with a blood-sniped artery near a well in the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, reads the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
The pig farmer is preparing to inject vaccines into pigs at a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
According to reports, he has traveled with his cousin from the neighboring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered a door to an open neighbouring well.
In that well, he said, there was a big male pig with blood in his mouth.
A forensic analysis confirmed that the pig, weighing 227 pounds, had attacked the pig farmer to death, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were covered in blood and crushed,” the cousin, referred to by his nickname “Wu,” according to Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been closed to prevent it from attacking other people while police collected evidence at the scene.
Reports say Yuan’s family and market officials are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of attacks from pigs to humans have already been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig immobilized a Welsh farmer against his tractor until the woman managed to scare the animal.
After a Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the smell of blood can function as a “stimulus.”
"They're just kidding.
They like to sneeze, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
We just need to show them the proper respect,” he said.
Residuals of Hurricane Rosa likely to bring widespread heavy rain to the southwest of the United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the colder waters of Mexico’s northern coast.
However, it will bring torrential rains throughout the north of Mexico and southwest of the United States in the coming days.
At 5 a.m. Eastern Time on Sunday, the Rose caused 137 km/h bursts, a Category 1 hurricane, located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depression begins to take shape over the Pacific Ocean moving to the west coast of the U.S. As it approaches the Baja California peninsula, the Rose, now a tropical storm, will begin to push a strong tropical humidity northward in the southwestern U.S. zone.
On Monday, it will cause precipitation that can reach 25 mm in certain areas of Mexico.
At that time, the tropical humidity interacting with the approaching depression will produce widespread heavy rains in the southwest in the coming days.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 mm of rain can cause sudden, dangerous floods, flooded with debris and possibly landslides in the desert.
Strong tropical humidity will cause precipitation that can reach 5 to 7 mm in point zones, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5 to 10 mm of precipitation is expected in southwestern areas, especially over much of Arizona.
Sudden floods are possible with conditions deteriorating rapidly, due to the scattered nature of tropical rains.
It is highly advisable to walk in the desert on foot with the threat of tropical rains.
Heavy rainfall can cause the gorges to become bold rivers and thunderstorms will bring strong point winds and clouds of dust.
The approaching depression will bring with it heavy precipitation over parts of the southern California coastline.
Total precipitation of more than 12 mm is possible, which can cause small floods of debris and slippery roads.
This may be the first precipitation of the region's wet season.
Some tropical showers will begin to occur in Arizona at the end of Sunday and early Monday, before the rain becomes more dispersed at the end of Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
The month of October can record strong temperature variations throughout the U.S. as the Arctic cools. However, the tropical zones will remain quite mild.
Sometimes this leads to drastic changes in temperature over short distances.
There is an excellent example of the drastic temperature differences throughout the U.S. central zone on Sunday.
There is an almost 11-degree difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the coming days, persistent summer heat will tend to increase and expand again.
Much of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to record a hot start in October, with temperatures widespread between 27 and 30 degrees from the South Plains to parts of the Northeast.
New York City could hit 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 5.5 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates high probability of above-average temperatures occurring in the eastern U.S. by the end of the first half of October.
More than 20 million people attended Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people watched yesterday on six television stations the rapist testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court, and the woman who accused him of alleged sexual abuse in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continued, with the stations interrupting regular programming due to a last-minute turnaround: an agreement drawn up by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he is absolutely certain that Kavanaugh stabbed her while drunk and tried to rip her off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an inflamed testimony, stated that he is absolutely certain that this has not happened.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people, numbered by Nielsen on Friday, have attended the hearing.
The company accounted for the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers of the other stations that broadcast it, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not yet available.
In addition, Nielsen usually has difficulty measuring audiences of those who watch programs in offices.
To give some perspective, it is a level of audience similar to the end of an American football game or the Oscars ceremony.
The Fox News Channel, whose commentators strongly supported Kavanaugh’s appointment, led all television stations with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the hearing that lasted all day, Nielsen said.
ABC finished second with 3.26 million viewers.
Then come CBS with 3.1 million, NBC with 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million and CNN with 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican’s office issued a statement stating that his vote would be in favour of Kavanaugh, the senator was caught by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning being verbally attacked by protesters when he tried to get into an elevator to address a Commission hearing.
The senator remained motionless looking at the floor while being criticized live for CNN's cameras.
"I'm here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told that “you have power while so many women have no power.”
Flake said his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator door closes, that he would have more to say at the hearing.
Cable and broadcast stations were all covering the event live hours later, when the Judiciary Committee went to the vote to make Kavanaugh's appointment proceed to a vote in the Senate plenary session.
However, Flake said he would only do so on the understanding that the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominee over the next week, something the Democratic minority had come to demand.
Flake was partially convinced after talks with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and later with some other senators, he made his decision.
Flake's choice was decisive, as it was obvious that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an investigation by the FBI into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
Prime Minister May accuses critics of ‘making politics’ with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "politicizing" Britain's future and harming the national interest, in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview alongside what he gave on the front page of the newspaper, his former foreign minister Boris Johnson reinforced his attack on what is known as the minister's "Checkers Plan" for Brexit, stating that a proposal that foresees Britain and the EU to "absurdly cover the tariffs from the other side."
Wayde Sims murder: police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson of LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in the deadly shooting of Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and charged with second-degree homicide, according to a statement from the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, with police claiming that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered them at the scene and stated that they had found Simpson's DNA in them, according to WAFB, a subsidiary of CBS.
After questioning Simpson, police reported that he had fatally hit Wayde with a firearm.
A security deposit of $350,000 has been established, the lawyer said.
The East Baton Rouge parish medical office issued a preliminary report stating that the cause of the death was a gunshot wound to the head that extended to the neck.
The department reports that the collaboration of the Louisiana State Police Action Group, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, the Southern University Police and residents of the area who collaborated in the investigation led to this arrest.
LSU's athletic director, Joe Alleva, thanked the area's authorities for their "diligence and effort to get justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
This advanced, 1.98 m tall, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
His average was 5.6 points and 2.6 touchdowns per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "devastated" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
“This is what we worry about all the time,” Wade said.
Volcano ejects ash in Mexico City
Ash emanating from the Popocatepetl volcano hit the neighborhoods south of Mexico’s capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention advised Mexicans on Sunday to stay away from the volcano after a resumption of crater activity, which recorded 183 emissions of gas and ash in 24 hours.
The center detected numerous deaf noises and tremors.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash covering car windshields in Mexico City neighborhoods like Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have recorded an increase in the activity of the volcano, located 72 kilometers from the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Conflicts between police and Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the vote for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after clashes between independence protesters and intervention police, while thousands of people joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarizing Catalan referendum on secession.
A group of masked separatists, blocked by the intervention police, hit her with eggs and threw powder ink, creating dark clouds of dust on streets that are usually packed with tourists.
Later clashes also occurred, in which police resorted to bars to contain the conflicts.
For a few hours, independence groups chanting “We don’t forget, we don’t forgive” faced unionist protesters, who shouted “Long life for Spain.”
Fourteen people have been treated for minor injuries suffered in the protests, the local press said.
Tensions remain high in the region inclined to independence, a year after the October 1 referendum, which was deemed illegal by Madrid, but which was celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters overwhelmingly opted for independence, although the influx to the polls had been low, with a majority boycott of those against it.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to block the ongoing vote at polling stations spread across the region, resulting in violent clashes.
The independence groups had camped during the night on Friday to prevent a demonstration of support for the national police.
Although it was held, this demonstration was forced to take a different path.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had hopes that Catalonia would become independent.
“Last year, we had our best moments.
“I saw my parents crying with joy for being able to vote, but now we are blocked,” he said.
Despite having achieved a vital but tangential victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year, with their best-known leaders in voluntary exile or in detention awaiting trial for their role in the independant organization of the referendum.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of the police with his mobile phone, said the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
“It’s getting more and more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders detained since last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament next year.
“Presenting myself as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression we are witnessing on the part of the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: men arrested after car crash against a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car hit a house in Londonderry repeatedly.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m., British summer time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage was done to the gates and the building itself.
At some point, someone may also have shot a beast at the car.
Menga Attack Gives Livingston a 1-0 win against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
Livingston, promoted to the first division, shocked the Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard a second defeat of just two in 18 games as Ibrox's club coach.
Dolly Menga's attack made a difference, at a time when Gary Holt's team changed levels, with the Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's team, which continues without a home win in the first division this season, will face the Hearts leaders, with eight more points, next Sunday.
Before that, the Rangers will face home Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, extended his succession of unbeaten clashes in the division to six games, with head coach Holt not losing a single time since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston Loses Opportunities Against Turbulent Visitors
Holt's team should have advanced to the scoreboard long before the goal, as the incisive character of his game was causing all sorts of problems to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson penetrated the defense but allowed himself to be dragged in front of the beacon and then Alan Lithgow only managed to direct his effort away after he slipped to find Craig Halkett's headlining over the beacon.
The home team was pleased to let the Rangers play in front of her, knowing that it could cause problems to visitors in the playoffs.
And that's how the crucial goal came about.
The Rangers granted a free pass and Livingston got an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson coordinated to make the pass to Menga, who gave a touch and scored from the center of the large area.
At that point, the Rangers dominated possession of the ball, but faced an impenetrable home team defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had no major problems.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to a defense.
Scott Pittman was frustrated by the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow gave a touch away from another stopped ball play at Livingston.
They continued to see crossings to the large area of Livingston, which were successively resolved, and two large-penalty claims, one after Halkett's incursion over substitute Glenn Middleton and another after one hand, were rejected by the referee.
Livingston "phenomenal" - analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They were excellent without exception, continuing to exceed expectations in this upward trajectory.
His playing style and staff have changed little since his return to the big teams, but it is necessary to praise Holt for the way he galvanized the 11th since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was colossal, achieving an extremely well-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall giving their best throughout the game.
Anyway, the Rangers revealed little inspiration.
Despite the excellent quality shown at times with Gerrard, the team fell far short of these standards.
Their final play was little inspired (only once managed to open the house team), constituting a sort of warning for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan is ambiguously welcomed in Cologne
There were smiles under a blue sky on Saturday (September 29) when leaders from Turkey and Germany met for a breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, whose goal was to repair relations between NATO allies.
The dispute involved issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s access to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to inaugurate a new and gigantic mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of its country.
Police claimed security reasons to prevent a crowd of more than 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters marked a presence in the vicinity to see its president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an protesters, many of them Kurds, were also heard, condemning both the president’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The antagonistic protests reflect the divisional character of a visitor acclaimed as a hero by some German Turks and hated as an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in car collision
A cyclist died in a collision involving a car in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street with Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, in the south-east of the city, near 10:15am British summer time.
The driver of the vehicle stopped and a rescue team intervened, but the cyclist died on the spot.
This collision occurs months after the death of another cyclist in a runaway collision on Childers Street, about a mile and a half from Saturday's crash.
The Metropolitan Police said the officers were trying to identify the person and inform their family members.
Barriers and detours were placed for buses, and drivers were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Agents Injured in Disturbances
Six prison officers were injured in riots in a high-security male prison, the Prison Office reported.
The unrest, which continues, began at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 09:30, British summer time, on Saturday.
Special agents "Tornado" were summoned to solve the problem, which involves eight inmates and is restricted to one wing.
Officers were treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A prison services spokesman said: “Specially trained teams were used to solve the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and it should be clear that the names of those responsible will be communicated to the police and they will be able to spend more time behind bars.”
HMP Long Lartin is home to more than 500 inmates, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had to receive hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
In addition, in October last year, intervention police officers were summoned to resolve a serious disturbance in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Pink Hurricane threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (areas affected by drought may benefit)
It’s rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but it’s exactly what is forecast for early next week, when the remaining energy from Hurricane Rosa crosses the Southwest Desert, implying the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday, for the areas of southern and eastern Nevada, southern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct trajectory over Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix said in a tweet that "only ten tropical cyclones have maintained a tropical storm or depression state within 300 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that passed 60 km from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 mm of precipitation, with isolated amounts that can reach 15 mm in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert, such as the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin can receive 3 to 5 mm, with the possibility of total insulations that can reach 10 mm.
For those not affected by the risks of sudden flooding, the Rose rain can be a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious concern, part of this precipitation can be beneficial, as the southwest is currently being affected by drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, the second-most serious category.
First, Hurricane Rosa will hit the continental mass by crossing the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
The Rosa, still with hurricane force on Sunday morning, with winds at maximum speeds of 137 km/h, is located 619 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, so it is weakening.
Thus, it is expected to reach the coastal zone in Mexico with tropical storm force in the afternoon or at the fall of Monday night.
Heavy rainfall may occur in parts of Mexico, which poses a significant risk of flooding.
"A total of 8 to 10 mm of precipitation is expected from Lower California to the northwest of Sonora, with a maximum of 25 mm possible," weather.com said in a statement.
Rosa will then head north, crossing Mexico as a tropical storm before hitting the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then head south of Utah in the late hours of Tuesday night.
“The main expected danger of the Rose or its remnants is the very high rainfall in Lower California, northwestern Sonora, and southwestern U.S. Desert,” the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These rains are expected to produce sudden flooding and flooding of debris in the deserts, risking life, and landslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three male teens and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with gunshot wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the area of the Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton, near 4 a.m. British summer time, on Saturday.
He was transported to the hospital, where he remains "stable".
A 17-year-old teenager, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man in the Radstock area were arrested overnight, police said in Avon and Somerset.
The agents appealed to anyone who might have cell phone footage of what happened to them.
Trump says Kavanaugh has been a victim of the Democratic Party’s “victims of malice and anger”
“A vote by Judge Kavanaugh is a vote of rejection of the Democratic Party’s relentless and outrageous tactics,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh was “a victim of the evil and anger” of the Democratic Party during its nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress on Thursday, having vigorously and emotionally denied an accusation by Christine Blasey Ford that she had sexually abused her decades ago, when both were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing about his claim.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people witnessed Kavanaugh's brilliance, quality and courage" on that day.
“A vote of confirmation by Judge Kavanaugh is a vote of confirmation from one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a jurist with a brilliant public service curriculum,” he told a crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president laterally referred to Kavanaugh's appointment when he spoke about the importance of Republican influx to the polls in the midterm elections.
“We are five weeks from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I’m not competing, but I’m actually competing,” he said.
“That’s why I go everywhere to fight for excellent candidates.”
Trump argued that the Democrats are on a mission of “resistance and obstruction.
The first procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's appointment is scheduled to take place no later than Friday, a senior deputy of the Republican Party leadership told CNN.
Hundreds of deaths in earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia; number continues to rise
At least 384 people have died, many of them dragged by the gigantic waves that hit the beaches when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves as high as six meters hit the beach at sunset, dragging many to death and causing a trail of devastation in their way.
The tsunami occurred in the wake of a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still in their activities on the beach and did not immediately flee, having been victims of what happened," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian disaster mitigation agency (BNPB) said in a statement in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not move alone: it dragged cars, trunks, houses, hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami was moving in the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h before reaching the coastline.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Public aerial photographs by the agency show many destroyed buildings and shops, deformed and demolished bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The coastal city continued to be shaken by replicas on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area with 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday’s massive blast was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, located at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have amplified the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the debris of the demolished buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the number of casualties and damage could be deeper along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, an area named Donggala, closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications "were completely incapacitated and there was no information" about Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people in the area," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading for the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse,” he said.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not reporting that a tsunami had hit Palu, although officials said the waves emerged at the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur footage released on social media, you can see a man on the upper floor of a building screaming frenzied warnings that the tsunami was approaching, to people on the street below.
Within minutes, a wall of water collapsed on the coast, dragging buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately confirm the authenticity of the filming.
The earthquake and tsunami caused an extensive power outage that disrupted communications in the Palu area, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army began to send cargo aircraft with the help of Jakarta and other cities. However, the evacuators still desperately need food and other commodities.
The city’s airport has been reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo scheduled a visit to the evacuation centres in Palau on Sunday.
The death toll in the tsunami in Indonesia is growing exponentially to more than 800.
It's very bad.
Although he managed to safely get to the city of Palu, where employees are housed in canvas shelters mounted in the yard of his offices, the staff at World Vision in Donggala went through scenes of devastation along his way, Mr. Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
It's very bad.
Even as aid groups began to begin the grim task of assisting the victims of the disaster, some complained that highly experienced foreign aid workers were being prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funding, supplies and personnel can only have access to the site if it is declared a "national disaster zone".
That hasn't happened yet.
"This is still at a level of provincial catastrophe," said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“Once the government says, ‘OK, this is a national catastrophe,’ we can open the doors to international assistance, but that status does not yet exist.”
As the second night fell in Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of the still missing still maintained the hope that their loved ones would be part of the miracles that mitigate the dark headlines of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a boy was removed from a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped in the rubble for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, head coach of the Indonesian paragliding national team, had trained two of his missing athletes for the Asian Games, completed earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other prisoners at Hotel Roa Roa, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
“As a senior paraglider practitioner, I have to carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon said that in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel had begun to circulate among the paragliding community, he desperately sent messages on WhatsApp to the athletes of Palu, who were participating in the festival on the beach.
However, their messages produced only a grey check mark, rather than a pair of blues.
“I think that means the messages have not been delivered,” he said.
Thieves take $26,750 during ATM refuelling in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who refuelled an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a statement from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car was emptying an automatic box in the entertainment complex and preparing to introduce more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in a statement.
While he was busy, another man "came up running behind the Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money that was destined for a delivery.
Witnesses saw several suspects flee the scene, according to the statement, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Those with information about their identities should contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper Changes His Name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
In announcing this change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “Being previously known to Kanye West.”
West, 41, received the nickname Ye some time ago and used it as the title of her eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before her participation in Saturday Night Live, where she is expected to present her new album Yandhi.
This intervention is intended to replace that of singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her for "emotional reasons," the show's creator said.
Being at the same time an abbreviation of his current professional name, the word has a religious meaning for him, according to West.
"I think 'yes' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year, when he commented on the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
"Therefore, I am you, I am us, we are us.
It comes from Kanye, which means “the only one,” to just Ye – being just a reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, of everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.”
Kanye is part of a series of famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was known alternately by Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
Former West collaborator, JAY-Z, also used variations of his name with or without hyphens and capital letters.
In Mexico, AMLO pledges not to use military against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has vowed not to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza “never use the army to repress the Mexican people.”
Military fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, resulting in a number of deaths that may have amounted to 300, when leftist student movements were deployed throughout Latin America.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador pledged to support young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to those who study and opening more public universities.
The president said that unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities drag young people into criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double the funding of artificial intelligence
At a time when China is stepping up its AI business, the U.S. is expected to double its research spending in that area, said Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and professional in the area who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several U.S. government departments have made AI-related announcements, even though the country does not have a formal overall strategy on the matter.
However, China presented its plan last year: it intends to lead AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubling the AI research budget would be a good start, given that all the other countries are so behind the U.S. and we are looking for the new AI revolution,” Lee said.
Doubling funding could double the chances of the next big AI success being achieved by the United States, Lee told NBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, a company that has invested in one of China’s most prominent AI companies, Face<0x2B><0x2B>.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that defeated Othello's best-ranked American player. Later, he held executive roles at Microsoft Research and was president of Google's branch in China.
Lee credited previous U.S. government technology contests as the Defense Agency’s Robotics Challenge for Advanced Research Projects and asked when it would be the next to help identify future visionaries.
U.S. researchers often have to make a big effort to get state funding, Lee said.
“It’s not China that’s stealing academic leaders; it’s companies,” he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired luminaires from universities to work in AI.
Lee said changes to immigration policies could also help the U.S. give impetus to its AI efforts.
“I’m of the opinion that green cards should be automatically awarded to PhDs in AI,” he said.
The Chinese State Council presented its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The Chinese National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people in academic institutions in a way similar to that used by the National Science Foundation and other government organizations to fund researchers in the United States. However, the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, intended to involve industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the formation of the Restricted Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, DARPA announced this month a $2 billion investment in an initiative designated by AI Next.
As far as the NSF is concerned, it currently invests more than $100 million per year in AI research.
However, U.S. legislation that intended to create a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has not progressed for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing the country's name
Macedonians voted on Sunday to decide on the country's name change to "Republic of North Macedonia", an initiative that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that blocked its applications for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which is part of a province called Macedonia, insists that its neighbour’s name to the north represents a complaint about its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue the change would be a blow to the ethnic identity of the mostly Slavic Macedonian population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign raised questions about whether the influx of votes will be enough to meet the 50% required for the referendum to be valid.
The referendum question was as follows: "Is it in favour of joining NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, which includes Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to continue the EU and NATO accession efforts to Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
“I came today to vote for the future of our country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
While the referendum is not legally binding, a sufficient number of parliamentarians said they would respect the result of the vote to make it decisive.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The National Electoral Commission said there had been no record of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, the influx was only 16%, compared to the 34% obtained in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters attended to vote.
“I came to vote for my children; our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, an elector from the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dusko vote in the referendum on the change of the country’s name, which would open the doors to their accession to NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of the tents that will boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to stick with our heads up and not the door of service,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to welcome us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia to become part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said that the entry into NATO will bring much-needed investments to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I believe that the overwhelming majority will be in favour, as more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after giving his vote.
A “yes” would be the “confirmation of our future.”
A poll published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research revealed that between 30 and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, lower than the necessary influx.
Another survey, conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, found that 57% of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70% said they would vote yes.
For the success of the referendum, the influx must be more than 50% plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would represent the first major unrest in the pro-Western government’s policy since it took office in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City crosses all the defense of Brighton towards the goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling missed Brighton's 2-0 victory over Manchester City at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy on his goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine forward received a midfield pass at the start of the game.
He made a sprint between three Brighton defenses before cutting to reach open field.
He was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He finished one defense before neutralizing others in the race at the limits of the Greater Brighton area.
Then he made a pass to his left, where Sterling was.
The forward used his first touch in the large area to return the ball to Aguero, who, with the right boot, defeated Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot on the right side of the net.
"Aguero is debating some foot problems," City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We said he would play for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial lead in the Premier League match.
This goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball well in Brighton's territory in that game.
He made a pass on the defenses along the left flank for Leroy Sane.
This gave a few touches before driving Sterling towards the second bar.
The Sky Blues advanced kicked the ball into the net immediately before sliding out of the field limits.
City face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to make life harder for the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the final, there was not much reason to force another start.
However, the ever-competitive Scherzer has hopes of entering the field on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are implications for the final for the Rockies, who hold a lead of a game over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies were at least lucky with a 5-2 win against the Nationals on Friday night, but still intend to secure their first-division title.
“Even if we’re playing for nothing, at least we can go into the field knowing that the environment here in Denver, with the crowd, the other team will probably play at the maximum level I could face this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to compete in those conditions?”
The Nationals have yet to announce the title launcher for Sunday, but some say they are inclined to allow Scherzer to make the launches in that situation.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, made a bullpen session on Thursday and would launch in his normal position on Sunday.
Washington’s right-hand player goes 18-7, with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holds a rally in West Virginia
The president laterally referred to the situation involving his election to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while mentioning the importance of the Republican influx in the midterm elections.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
We are five weeks from one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is one of the big, big... I’m not competing, but I’m competing and that’s why I’m everywhere fighting for excellent candidates.”
Trump continued, “You’re seeing this horrible, horrible group of radical Democrats, you’re watching it happen right now.
And they're determined to regain power using all the necessary means. Do you see evil, deafness?
They don’t care who they harass, who they have to go through to get power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, and we’re not going to give them.”
The Democrats, he said, have the mission of “resisting and obstructing.”
“And they’ve seen that in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “aggressive, evil, sordid and lying.”
The president referred to Dianne Feinstein, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, having received vocals from the public.
"Do you remember your answer?
Caused the document to leak?
Oh, oh, what?
No, um, no, I, wait, one -- that was a body language even bad -- the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer inclusive.
It is intolerant of those who openly give their opinion.
When Momentum activists from my local party organization voted to censor me, it wasn’t a surprise to me.
In the end, I am the most recent of a number of Labour Members in Parliament who have been told they are not welcome - all because we openly express our views.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was the target of similar treatment because she resolutely opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship motion criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically similar issues over which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notice for the Nottingham East Workers' Meeting on Friday mentioned that "we intend the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as a local labor representative in parliament, the meetings of the General Committee were just that.
Unfortunately, today it has ceased to be the tone of many of the meetings and the promise of "more kind and gentle" politics has long been forgotten, if it has ever been realized.
It has become increasingly apparent that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and that every opinion is judged on whether or not it is acceptable by the party’s leadership.
That started shortly after Jeremy took the lead, because colleagues with whom he thought he shared a similar political perspective began to expect a turnaround from me and to take positions with which he would never agree - whether they were on national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public (and it doesn’t really matter what I say), there’s a torrent of insults on social media that call for “retirement,” denouncing the center’s policies, telling myself that I shouldn’t belong to the Labour Party.
And I'm not the only one going through this.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since the comments that are addressed to me tend to be political in nature.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of these colleagues who face a dam of sexist or racist insults every day, but who never retreat before them.
One of the aspects that disappoint me the most in this age of politics is the way these levels of insult have become normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we have ceased to be inclusive, and with every motion of "censorship" or change of selection rules the party narrows its views.
I’ve received countless advice over the last two years urging myself to keep my head down, not to be so expressive, and so “all would be fine” for me.
But that's not why I came to make politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, driven by the negligence of the Thatcher government that left the classroom of my comprehensive school literally in rubble, I have sought to strive for better public services for those who need it most, either as an authoritarian or as a minister in the government.
I have never concealed my policies, including in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been in any way confused about my political positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
For those who promoted the motion on Friday, all I have to say is that when the country is heading for a Brexit that will harm families, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on the issue of my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the message I have is not for the Momentum of Nottingham; it is for my constituents, whether or not members of the Labour Party: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threats of "resignation" or political files will prevent me from acting in the sense that I believe is in everyone's interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: the unbeaten Ayr goes to the top
Two late rehearsals somehow drove the result, but there’s no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this incredibly interesting Tennent’s Premiership game of the day.
The team is now at the top of the table, the only one of the ten unbeaten.
In the end, it was a superior defense and better risk management that made the home team take the best, and coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be satisfied.
“We’ve been tested in our games so far and we’re still unbeatable, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Melrose's Robyn Christie said, "The merit goes to Ayr. They're better at risk than we are."
Grant Anderson's rehearsal in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead, but a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, handed over to the Warriors, allowed Melrose not to express the numbers.
Climo widened the Ayr advantage with a great penalty, before, immediately before half-time, having scored and then converted a ground rehearsal to put the score on 17-5 for Ayr at intervals.
However, Melrose started the second part well and Patrick Anderson's rehearsal, converted by Baggot, reduced the draw to five points.
It was followed by a long interruption due to a serious injury from Ruaridh Knott, who was transported from the hull to the outside and, after the restart, the Ayr reinforced the leadership with a Stafford McDowall rehearsal converted by Climo.
Ayr's acting captain, Blair Macpherson, then received a yellow card and, once again, Melrose took advantage of the numerical advantage with an unconverted rehearsal of Bruce Colvine at the end of an intense pressure surge.
However, the home team returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for knocking down Climo without the ball, in the penalty shootout, MacPherson put the ball on the ground behind Ayr's advancing maul.
Climo converted, as he had done almost immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe picked up the box kick from David Armstrong and sent the wing Gregor Henry for the house team's fifth rehearsal.
Still Game star ready for a new career in the catering business
Still Game star Ford Kieran appears ready to enter the catering industry after learning he was appointed director of a licensed catering company.
The 56-year-old actor portrays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and participates with longtime comedian partner Greg Hemphill.
The pair announced that the ninth season, which will soon debut, will be the last in the series, and it looks like Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source from the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan was intending to get involved in the "flowering Glasgow restoration business".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, devoid of coastline, expects the court to reopen a path to the Pacific
Marines patrol a rope-covered naval base in La Paz.
Public buildings bear a blue-sea flag.
The naval bases of Lake Titicaca to the Amazon bear the motto: "The sea is ours by right.
Recovering it is a duty.”
Throughout Bolivia, a landlocked country, the memory of a lost coastline for Chile in a bloody conflict over resources in the 19th century, as well as the longing to sail the Pacific Ocean once again, is still alive.
These hopes are perhaps at the highest point in decades, as Bolivia awaits a verdict from the International Court of Justice on October 1, after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the impetus, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, a positive perspective on the result," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will witness the TIJ’s ruling on giant screens across the country, hoping that the Hague court will deliberate in favor of their country’s claim, so that, after decades of uncertain negotiations, Chile will be forced to negotiate, granting Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic Bolivian indigenous president, who faces a controversial re-election battle next year, also has a lot at stake in Monday's sentence.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” were the president’s vows last August.
However, some analysts believe it is unlikely that the court will rule in favor of Bolivia, and that little would change even if not.
The UN body, based in the Netherlands, has no powers to assign Chilean territory to another country and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
That the TIJ’s sentence was delivered just six months after the final allegations were heard indicates that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And far from promoting the Bolivian cause, the last four years may have harmed it.
“The question of access to the sea has been kidnapped by the current Bolivian administration,” Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales's belligerent rhetoric undermined some Chilean residual goodwill, he suggested.
At some point in the future, Bolivia and Chile will continue the talks, but it will be extremely difficult to maintain the dialogue after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision process was unusually fast.
Next Monday will give Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and a possibility to "end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, was using the maritime issue as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never waive its right of access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
“The sentence is an opportunity to understand that we have to go beyond the past.”
North Korea Says There Will Be No Disarmament Without U.S. Trust
North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, said his nation would never give up its nuclear weapons if it did not trust Washington first.
Ri was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
In his speech, he urged the United States to deliver on the promises it made during a summit in Singapore among the leaders of rival countries.
His comments come when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to restart nuclear diplomacy at a standstill, more than three months after Singapore’s summit with North Korean President Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was an “impossible dream” to consider that the continued sanctions and US objection to a statement that would put an end to the Korean War will ever lead the North to kneel.
Washington is afraid to accept the declaration without Pyongyang taking significant first steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump are planning a second summit.
However, there is widespread scepticism about Pyongyang actually intending to reduce an arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second Kim-Trump summit.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest line of huge hats on the way to a store near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or protect yourself completely from the sun, you don’t need to look any further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented on the sidewalk a series of extravagant and oversized hats for their spring-summer 2019 collections, which left the style set astonishing at Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, Instagram was flooded with very impractical hats and these designers sent these amazing creations to the sidewalk.
Valentino’s most prominent piece was an extravagant beige hat decorated with a wide lining similar to a feather that flooded the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included jewellery-creamed watermelons, a wizard's hat, and even a pineapple, although they weren't designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks...even at the time of the carnival.
Many of the colorful masks had cooked lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than with high seam.
One of the creations resembled diving equipment, with tubes and glasses, while the other looked like a melted ice cone.
And if you want to continue this huge fashion statement, you're lucky.
Stylish observers predict that these huge hats are on their way to a store near you.
The oversized hats appear effervescent in the path of "La Bomba", the straw hat with a 61 cm blade that has been worn by everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult mark behind the very impractical hat that spread through social networks sent another great creation to the walkways: a straw beach bag almost as large as the bathing suit model that carried it.
The burnt orange raffle bag, adorned with raffle stripes and with a white leather grip, was the highlight of Jacquemus’ 2019 spring-summer La Riviera collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I’m looking forward to seeing big hats and beach bags arrive at stores next summer. Since the designer had such an impact, it would be hard to ignore the search for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language Skills are Essential to Global Citizens
Scotland’s independent schools benefit from a curriculum of academic excellence, this trend continued in 2018 with another set of exceptional exam results, reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community initiatives.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to achieve the best level of service for both students and parents.
Independent schools intend to prepare their students for deepening their studies and access to universities, as well as for the career they have chosen and to take their place as global citizens.
Since this is an educational sector capable of designing and implementing a tailor-made school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and sought-after topic in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If we speak to a man in a language he understands, we can get into his mind.
If we talk to him in his own language, we can get into his heart.”
This quote reminds us well that we cannot depend only on English when we intend to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Based on the results of the recent exams this year, we found that the languages are at the top of the table, with the highest rates of use of independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages achieved the maximum rating of A.
These data, collected in the 74 schools under the SCIS, show that 72% of the students obtained the maximum A score in Mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish also obtained an A.
This demonstrates that independent Scottish schools are favouring foreign languages as vital skills that will undoubtedly serve children and young people in the future.
Languages, as an option, are now treated in the same way as STEM themes (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curricula and beyond.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills concluded that, among the reasons for employers’ difficulty in filling vacancies, 17% were concerned with the lack of language skills.
Therefore, knowing other languages is increasingly imperative to prepare the young generation for their future careers.
With more potential employment opportunities that require language skills, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of your chosen career, if you have learned a second language, you will have a tangible advantage in the future with a fitness for life like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% did not speak a foreign language well enough to maintain a conversation, with French being the only language spoken by a two-digit ratio, 15%.
Therefore, investing now in language teaching is important for today’s children.
The mastery of several languages, particularly those of developing countries, will give children with better chances of finding employment with relevance.
In Scotland, each school differs in the languages it teaches.
Some of them will focus on the most classical modern languages, while others will teach languages considered the most important for the UK by the 2020 horizon, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest, there will always be a set of languages to choose from in independent schools, supported by specialized teaching staff in the area.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a pedagogical environment that prepares children and gives them the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future holds for them.
It is undeniable that today, in a globalised business environment, languages continue to be of fundamental importance for the future of the country.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to provide this option with diversity and excellence to young Scots.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron starts at the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is over for fans who want to see LeBron James start at the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will take part in Sunday’s pre-season opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, how many minutes you will play is yet to be determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers journalist Mike Trudell posted a tweet stating that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was questioned about his plans for the Lakers' six-game schedule in the preseason.
“I don’t need pre-season games at this stage of my career to be ready,” he said.
Time and YouTube channel of the Trump rally in West Virginia
President Donald Trump kicks off a campaign rally tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five rallyes scheduled for next week, which include stops in friendly locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the ballot pending for his chosen Supreme Court vacancy, Trump intends to reinforce support for the midterm elections to be held soon, as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time is Trump’s rally in West Virginia tonight and how do you watch it online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. Eastern Time on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s rally in West Virginia online below in a live stream on YouTube.
Trump will likely address this week's hearings to Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court, who have become tense over allegations of sexual abuse. The Senate-proposed confirmation vote will be held for a week as the FBI proceeds with investigations.
However, the main goal of this torrent of rallies is to help Republicans, who face tough elections in November, win some momentum.
President Trump’s campaign officials said the five elections next week were intended to “energize volunteers and supporters at a time when Republicans are trying to protect and broaden the majority they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives,” Reuters reported.
“Congress control is so fundamental to the president’s agenda that he will visit as many states as possible as we approach the turmoil of the campaign season,” a Trump campaign spokesman said.
Marked for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the nightly rally could attract supporters "from Ohio to Pennsylvania and get coverage from the Pittsburgh area's media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will mark the second time this month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state in which he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Republican West Virginia Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, at a disadvantage in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come and help him with the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team demonstrates they have the strength to fight to keep hope alive before Sunday's singles
After three uniform sessions, Saturday afternoon foursomes may be exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The pendulum oscillation of momentum is a fully invented sporting concept, but it is one that players truly believe in, and never more than in competitions like these.
So where would you say the momentum is coming now?
"They had a six-point lead and now it's four, so we're looking at it as a bit of a boost," Spieth said as he was leaving the field at the end of the day.
Europe is in the lead, of course, with four points ahead and another twelve in play.
The Americans, as Spieth claims, still have some spare energy and many reasons to feel encouraged, especially given the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each of them scored three points out of four.
Spieth has been deadly from tee to green and is leading by example.
Those festive guttural screams were getting louder as the round continued, with a crucial putt that made the fourth game an all-square when he and Thomas were two holes behind in two.
His putt that won the match on the 15th produced a similar cry, of the kind that reveals that he still believes the American team continues in the competition.
"We just need to focus and worry about our own game," Spieth said.
That’s all there is to each of these players.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed revelation of the Ryder Cup.
The European pair, unlikely but adorable, is four in four and can’t go wrong.
The "Moliwood" was the only duet not to do a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning back nine.
In this series, and given the way their energy seems to flow from and to this turbulent crowd, it consolidates the idea that they are the players to beat on Sunday, and that there is no more popular player to seal a potential European sunshine victory at Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both simultaneously in different holes.
However, the discourse on the glory of Europe remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson defeated Sergio Garcia, the hero of the fourballs this morning, when teaming up with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine plunged the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole that they were never close to leaving.
However, on Sunday, there is no one to help them get out of it.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to see closely due to the interactions between partners, the advice they give or not, and how the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better in the team so far and gained a significant advantage on the final day. However, this foursome session also demonstrated that the US team has the stomach for the fight that some, especially in the US, doubted it had.
Europe with a 10-6 lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will enter the final day of the Ryder Cup with a loose advantage after leaving the fourballs and foursomes of Saturday's matches with a 10-6 lead against the United States.
The duet inspired by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two wins over a Tiger Woods with difficulty reaching the rankings in Le Golf National, so far, four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, struggling to keep the trophy he lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an unsuccessful American team in the morning's fourballs, winning the series 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes with two wins, but failed to shorten the downside.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points in the Sunday 12th singles to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European starter to earn four points in a row when he and Molinari, who received the nickname "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend are only the only duet to earn four points in their four opening games in Ryder Cup history.
Having crushed Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they superbly consolidated the lead, defeating an energyless Woods and American starter Bryson Dechambeau with an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself during two games on Saturday, revealed occasional genius accesses, but has already lost 19 of the games he played in fourballs and foursomes, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, resting during the morning fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, defeating 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, first and third ranked in the world rankings.
However, on this pleasant day with a slight breeze southwest of Paris, Europe did not always take the best.
Jordan Spieth, the three-time winner of the main men's tournaments, and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
The duo won a brave 2&1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter, and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy by 4&3 in the foursomes, having lost both opening holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history a team has reversed a four-point draw before the singles, although the title-holder Furyk team only needs to beat to keep the trophy.
After two days in second place, a counterattack on Sunday seems to be beyond its possibilities.
North Korea Says ‘Not to Think’ About Unilateral Disarmament Without Confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continuation of the sanctions was aggravating mistrust about the United States and that there was no way for the country to unilaterally renounce its nuclear weapons in those circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body’s annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken “significant goodwill measures” last year, such as the disruption of nuclear and missile tests, the dismantling of the nuclear test center and the commitment to non-proliferation of weapons and nuclear technologies.
"However, we see no corresponding response from the United States," he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and in such circumstances there is no way we can proceed to our disarmament first.”
Although Ri has recycled North Korean complaints already known about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to denuclearization, within which North Korea would be rewarded as it took step-by-step steps, his previous statements against Pyongyang appear to be significant insofar as unilaterally dismisses the licle.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between a U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim pledged to work towards "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula," while Trump offered North Korea security assurances.
North Korea has sought a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls for softening tough international sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States insists on ‘denuclearization first’ and increases the level of pressure with sanctions to coercively achieve its goal, opposing even the ‘declaration of the end of war,’” Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can put us on our knees is an impossible dream of people who know nothing about us.
However, the problem is that the extension of the sanctions is aggravating our distrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that had been referred to by the U.S. leader at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: "If South Korea were interested in this issue and not the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this impasse."
Still, the tone of Ri’s speech was drastically different from last year’s, when he told the UN General Assembly that directing North Korea’s rockets to U.S. territory was inevitable after “Mr. President Evil” Trump called Kim the “man of rockets” in a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year had threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, filled Kim with praise for his courage to take steps towards disarmament, but said there was still much to be done and that sanctions would have to continue until the denuclearization of North Korea.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn’t have a calendar for that, noting that “whether it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously until denuclearization is complete, final and verifiable.”
The Security Council unanimously strengthened the sanctions imposed on North Korea since 2006, in an attempt to curb the funding of North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying progress had been made, although North Korea later denounced him for “making gangster demands.
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile facility and also a nuclear complex if the United States “takes appropriate action.”
Pompeo said Kim had told him that the “corresponding measures” they were looking for were the security assurances Trump had taken in Singapore, as well as initiatives to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend a course that teaches them how to rest long enough
A new course at Harvard University this year put all of its students to sleep more, in an initiative to combat the machic culture of studying in caffeine-infused “directs.”
One professor concluded that the students of this university at the top of the world ranking often did not have the slightest idea about the most basic concepts about the care they should have with themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, was the author of the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
The inspiration for the course came after giving a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"In the end, a girl came to me and said, 'Why are they just telling me this in the last year of the course?'
The young woman said that no one had ever mentioned the importance of sleep to her, which surprised me,” she told The Telegraph.
The course, taught for the first time this year, explains to students the essential concepts on how good sleep habits contribute positively to academic and athletic performance, as well as to the improvement of overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the institution decided to introduce the course after concluding that some students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In a section there is an image of a dormitory where students click on coffee mugs, curtains, slippers and books to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light, and how athletic performance is influenced by sleep deficiency, and the importance of a routine to collect in bed.
In another section participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risks of stroke, depression and cancer.
Then, a map of the campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
“We know it won’t change the behavior of the students instantly.
However, we believe that they have the right to know, just as we all have the right to know the health effects of the smoking option,” added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in “doing straight” still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students makes this a growing problem.
Ensuring that we sleep enough and with quality should be a "secret weapon" for students to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, and even to avoid getting fat, as sleep deprivation puts the brain in a hunger mode, making them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student of physics and chemistry biology, helped Professor Czeisler devise the course after attending one of his classes last year in his first year at Harvard.
The course opened his eyes and inspired him to encourage the creation of a course for the entire campus, he said.
The next step, according to your expectations, is to ask all graduate students to attend a similar study program before entering the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider using an alarm for bedtime, such as waking up, and be aware of the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can disrupt the circadian rhythm and lead to problems.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: Menga goal knocks down Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another unfortunate outreach when Dolly Menga's attack caused Steven Gerrard's disjointed team a 1-0 loss at Livingston Stadium.
Ibrox's team sought to record their first victory on their way since the 1-0 victory at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team ended up inflicting Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games, leaving his team eight points behind the undefeated Hearts, leader of the Scottish first division.
Menga scored seven minutes before the end of the first part and the Rangers collective, devoid of inspiration, never seemed to be able to match.
With the Rangers now descending to sixth position, Livingston climbs to third, and just behind the Hibernian for the goal difference.
And there could be even more trouble for the Rangers after line prosecutor Calum Spence received treatment for a head injury caused by an object apparently shot from the visitor's area.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that surpassed Ayr in the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, for his part, used the same eleven from Livingston who stole a point from the Hearts last week, and will have been delighted with how his well-waved team has suffocated opponents in every play.
The Rangers may have dominated the possession of the ball, but Livingston did more with the one he had.
The team could have scored soon after two minutes, when the first pass sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's beacon, but the average missed his big opportunity out.
A long free kick from Keaghan Jacobs went to Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow only managed to finish out towards the second bar.
The Rangers managed to regain control, but the hope was greater than the belief in his game in the final third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought he should have been given a big penalty in the quarter-hour with his collision with Steven Lawless, but referee Steven Thomson declined the Colombian's appeals.
The Rangers scored only two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little to worry about Lassana Coulibaly's head shot and Ovie Ejaria's weak shot.
Although Livingston’s 34th minute goal may have been contrary to what was expected from the game’s development, it is undeniable that the team deserved it, let alone for its tenacity.
Once again, the Rangers failed to deal with a long standing Jacobs ball.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher made a pass to Scott Robinson, who kept calm when he chose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard moved in the interval, having replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, and this trade had almost immediate impact when the forward side passed to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly made a sprint from his line to make the blockade.
However, Livingston continued to force visitors to play exactly the kind of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett making long pass after long pass.
Holt's team may have increased their lead in the final stages, but McGregor held out well, defending himself against Jacobs before Lithgow finished out in the corner.
The Rangers' replacement, Glenn Middleton, again claimed a large penalty when he narrowed down Jacobs, but Thomson once again ignored the request.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page of our Sunday Morning Almanac: On September 30, 1882, it is now 136 years old and continues to count...the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger counter.
A fundamental piece of science since then, the accountant Geiger has also become a central element of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" in which the unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans participated:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals like uranium.
When we put on these headphones, we can even hear the effects of atoms released by radioactivity on minerals.”
Evans: "Look, now you're really cracking!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that gave the name still persists.
New Cancer Vaccine Teaches the Immune System to “See” Harmful Cells
New Cancer Vaccine Teaches the Immune System to “See” Harmful Cells and Kill Them
Vaccine Teaches the Immune System to Recognize Harmful Cells as Part of Treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and their alteration in the laboratory.
These cells, which can “see” a protein common to many cancers, are then injected back into the body.
An experimental vaccine is producing promising results in patients with a number of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and their alteration in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to many cancers, designated by HER2. These cells are then injected again into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “controls the growth of various types of cancer,” including those of the breast, ovary, lungs and also the colorectal, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach that involves removing immune cells from patients and “teaching them” to attack cancer cells worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarks on a diatribe of support for Trump enveloping a MAGA hat after his appearance on the SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was cast in the studio on Saturday Night Live after an inconsistent performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump, saying he would run for president in 2020.
After performing his song of the night, called Ghost Town, in which he wore a "Make America Great" hat, he started a bravado against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"So many times I talk to a white guy and he says to me, 'How can you like Trump? He's a racist!'
“Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL began with a satire with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star split from Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it had not been broadcast, West's brave scene was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to break up with West when he did.
In addition, West had complained to the public that he had spent a bad bit behind the scenes because of the hat.
"I was intimidated behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go in there with that hat."
They intimidated me!
And then they tell me I'm marginalized," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on, "Do you want to see the marginalization?", saying, "It would take my superman cover, because that means no one tells me what to do.
Try the love.”
His comments sparked public outrage and SNL participants appeared to be embarrassed, Variety reported, with someone from the show told the newspaper: "The whole studio was completely silent."
West had been invited to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West confused many with the performance of the song I Love it disguised as Perrier's bottle.
West received a demonstration of support from TPUSA’s director, Candace Turner, who posted the tweet: “To one of our most courageous spirits: OBRIGADO BY TURBA.”
However, interview show host Karen Hunter posted a tweet saying West was simply “to be what it is, and that’s absolutely wonderful.”
“But I chose NOT to reward someone (buying their music or supporting their ‘art’) who I believe is welcoming and spreading harmful ideologies to the community.
He's free.
And so do we,” he added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, stating that it was now "the one previously known to Kanye West".
West is not the first artist to change his name, following the pasts of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Also rapper Snoop Dogg has used the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the missing musical legend Prince changed the name to a symbol and then to "the artist previously known by Prince".
Accused of attempted murder after stabbed in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in the eastern part of Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to be brought before the Belfast Court on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the public prosecutor.
War on the Thrones Star Kit Harington Attacks Toxic Masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series, War of the Thrones.
However, the actor, aged 31, attacked the macho hero's stereotype, stating that such roles on the screen make boys often feel they have to be tough to be respected.
In a conversation with Sunday Times Culture, Kit reported that she believed "something went wrong" and wondered how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the age of <0x23>MeToo.
Kit, who recently married her colleague in the War of the Thrones Rose Leslie, also at the age of 31, admitted that she has a "quite strong position" on the approach to the problem.
“I have a pretty strong personal position right now: what went wrong with masculinity?” he said.
“What have we been teaching men when they are growing up in terms of the problem we are seeing now?”
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity due to its very masculine characters.
He said, “What is born and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and in the streets that makes young people feel they have to belong to this particular form of masculinity?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time: how can we change that?
Because clearly something went very wrong for the young people.”
In the interview, the actor also admitted that he would not enter into any prequels or sequels of the War of the Thrones when the series ends next summer, referring to him as having ended the "battlefields and the horses".
From November, Kit will participate in a re-edition of Sam Shepard’s True West, which is the story of a movie producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he believes finding his wife Rose was the best thing that came out of the War of the Thrones.
"I met my wife in this series, so somehow she gave me my future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the loving interest of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple gave the knot in June 2018 on Leslie's family property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% jump in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, health authorities said.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases result from transmissions through sexual intercourse, which marks a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contracted HIV in this way has been reduced to virtually zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, in terms of annual homologous variation, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
Transmission of HIV through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community is said to be frequent.
Studies have estimated that, due to the country’s conservative values, 70 to 90 percent of men who have had sex with other men end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases derive from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies leaking information about Republican senators by one of her collaborators and attacks the "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that a member of her team had posted personal information of three members of the U.S. Senate on lawmakers’ Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the accusations were being promoted by opinion leaders and "ultra-right" websites.
“Lies, lies, and more despicable lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information allegedly includes the home addresses and phone numbers of Senators Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person in Capitol Hill during a hearing with a Senate panel on allegations of sexual misconduct against Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court.
The leak occurred some time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the publications was associated with Waters’ cabinet and published data from a member of Waters’ staff, The Hill reported.
“This unfounded accusation is totally false and an absolute lie,” Waters said.
“My employee, whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised by these fraudulent and false allegations, had no responsibility for this leak.
This unfounded accusation is totally false and an absolute lie.”
Waters’ statement quickly attracted online criticism, including that of former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is cholera,” Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that she doesn’t have the temperament to be a Congresswoman.
When someone is accused of something that is not their responsibility, they cannot get angry.
You can't have a challenging stance.
You can't question the prosecution's motives.
It must reveal calmness and serenity.”
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who had been accused by critics of appearing too choleraous during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who will contest Waters’ place in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Very serious if it's true," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his cabinet had alerted “the competent authorities” to these fraudulent allegations.
“We ensure that the culprits will be revealed and will be legally held accountable for all their acts, which are destructive and dangerous to all and any members of my staff.”
Johnny English Review Returns to Attack - Weak Espionage Movie Parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is now fashionable to look for connotations with Brexit in any new film with a British flavor, and that seems to apply to the new edition of the Johnny English comedy and action film series, which began in 2003 with "Johnny English" and brought back to life in 2011 with "The Return of Johnny English".
Is the ironic self-satisfaction about being so bad the new opportunity for export to the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his eyes shrouded and an overly elastic expression obtained his license to create confusion, renewed a second time - with his name to signal, above all, that it is a comprehensive comic creation intended for non-English-speaking cinematographers.
He is, of course, the idiotic secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims to a soft glamour, has a little Cloiseau, a bit of Mr. Bean and something of that guy who contributed a single note to the theme of the film "Moments of Glory" at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
In addition, his character is originally based on the international traveler and mysterious man whose role Atkinson played in TV commercials for Barclaycard, who left chaos on his trail.
There are one or two interesting moments in this latest edition of JE.
I loved the scene where Johnny English approaches a helicopter enveloping a medieval armor, with the rotor blades briefly making a railing noise against the helmet.
Atkinson's talent for comedy is obvious, but the humor sounds weak and strangely superfluous, especially given that editions of "serious" films such as 007 and Mission Impossible now confidently propose comedy as an ingredient.
We get the idea that humor is aimed at children and not adults, and in my opinion Johnny English’s bizarre misadventures are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson’s silent movie numbers in Bean’s character.
Now, the premise, always current, is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A hacker has infiltrated the British super-secret spy network, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground to the dismay of the service agent, a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last drop for a prime minister who embodies a pompous and conflicting figure, already suffering a total scale of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives her best with this role that reminds the character of Theresa May, but the argument does not give much material for big flights.
Her secret service advisers inform her that once all the agents in the asset have been compromised, she will have to take someone out of retirement.
And this one is the disastrous Johnny English, now working as a teacher in a chic school, but giving unofficial lessons on how to be an infiltrator spy: here are some interesting numbers, because English offers us a spy academy in the style of the movie "Rock School."
English is quickly taken to Whitehall to receive emergency instructions and rejoin his suffering auxiliary Bough, a role played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, attached to a submarine commander, an effusive character in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit wasted.
Thus, Batman and Robin from the disaster in His Majesty's Secret Service are back in action, facing the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova, the role played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is being dangerously enchanted by the charismatic billionaire of technologies who claims to be able to solve Britain’s computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of absurd disastrous acts: disguised as desk employees, set fire to a fancy French restaurant, create confusion penetrating as clandestines on the luxurious yacht of Volta, and English unleashes pure anarchy as he tries to use virtual reality glasses from the home.
All the stops were certainly created with this last sequence in mind, but as nice and stormy as it is, the set has plenty of TV for children.
The result is quite median.
And as in other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help but investigate: Can the British film industry not give Rowan Atkinson a role that will do justice to his talent?
Workers dismiss that they are generating a plan for the British to work four days a week, but receiving five
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party may be considering a radical plan to provide the British with a four-day working week, but with five days paid.
Reports suggest that the party wants bosses to pass the savings with the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution for workers, giving them an extra day off.
The workers got a three-day weekend, but keeping it orderly.
Sources say the idea would “adjust” to the party’s economic program, which reorients the country in favor of workers.
The transition to a four-day working week gained the favourable opinion of the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changes in the economy.
A senior Labour Party official told The Sunday Times: “We look forward to announcing a policy review before the end of the year.
“It’s not going to happen overnight, but a four-day work week is an aspiration adjusted to the party’s approach to rebalancing the economy in favor of the worker, as well as the party’s overall strategy for the industrial sector.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party had already proposed a four-day working week during its campaign for the 2017 legislative elections.
However, this aspiration is not favoured at this time by the entire Labour Party.
A party spokesman said: “The four-day work week is not part of the party’s policy and we are not considering it.”
Shadow finance minister John McDonnell used the party’s conference last week to reveal his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from the hands of “faceless directors” and “speculators” of basic services companies.
Its plans also include the non-recovery of the full share of current shareholders in water companies, as the Labour Party may make "deductions" based on the perception of illicit conduct.
McDonnell also confirmed plans to put workers on the company’s boards and create Inclusive holding funds that transfer 10% of the private company’s share to employees, which will be able to bag annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell '60 Minutes' whether the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh can do them or not change their minds
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week, raising questions about whether the findings could lead Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could figure out something that would change their minds.
Kennedy was more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
"I said when I was going to the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, when this allegation came up, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, determined, unequivocal.”
Graham’s vote, however, seems immovable.
“I’m determined about Brett Kavanaugh and an explosive charge would be needed,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I do know one thing: Brett made a vigorous denial,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone she mentioned couldn't confirm it.
It was 36 years ago.
I don’t see anything else changing.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Did you do anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York City will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with an extremely impressive list of stars that will perform on an equally impressive mission: to eradicate poverty in the world.
Already in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will welcome tens of thousands of people to the Great Harvest of Central Park, not only to attend performances such as those of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to reinforce awareness of the true goal of the event: to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To receive a free ticket to the event (unless they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket) viewers had to perform a series of tasks, or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, a phone call to the public, or any other meaningful ways that contribute to raising awareness.
However, what was the degree of success of the Global Citizen in these 12 years in achieving its goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a genuine way to persuade them to demand action, or is this just another case of “clickivism” – do we think it makes a difference to sign an online petition or send a tweet?
Global Citizen claims that since 2011, it has recorded more than 19 million “actions” of its supporters that have exerted pressure to achieve a number of different goals.
These actions, according to the organization, contributed to world leaders announcing commitments and policies valued at more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its shares, with at least $10 billion of them already disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that the funds raised so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership bringing together investors and implementers committed to “helping children reach their full potential,” which promised to give $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments, and global citizens like all of us, we can make social injustice from malnutrition a footnote of history,” Tracey Ullman, The Power of Nutrition’s ambassador, told a crowd at a live concert in London in 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions of pressure on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced it would fund a project, Power of Nutrition, which will cover 5 million women and children, with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the website’s frequently asked questions, “What makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?”
The Global Citizen responds: “It was a long and winding road – sometimes we fell and failed.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements that preceded us, because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are among the artists who will perform at this year’s event in New York, presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use the Navy as a "blockade" to put an obstacle to Russia's energy exports - Interior Secretary
“If necessary,” Washington may resort to its navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s involvement in Syria, particularly where it intervenes at the legitimate government’s invitation, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they intend to mediate energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, in the belly of southern Europe,” he said.
And, according to the governor, there are ways and means to prevent it.
“The United States has the capacity, with its navy, to ensure that the seaways are open and, if necessary, to make blockades to ensure that energy does not reach the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed the participants at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group entitled “the voice of the energy consumer” in the United States.
In his speech, he went on to compare Washington’s approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, stating that they are effectively the same.
“The economic option in Iran and Russia is, more or less, to leverage and replace fuels,” he said, while referring to Russia as a “magic of a single trick” with a fossil fuel-dependent economy.
These statements come at a time when the Trump administration is on a mission to increase natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, which is by far the cheapest option for European consumers.
To this end, the Trump administration authorities, including the president himself, are trying to persuade Germany to abandon the “unsuitable” Nord Stream pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin a “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stated that the Nord Stream pipeline, budgeted at $11 billion, aims to double its existing capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economical project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s fierce opposition to the project is motivated simply by economic reasons, being an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument to exert pressure and that consumers should have the ability to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said following a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow on Monday.
The US position motivated a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main German industrial association, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, the top head of the German Federation of Industries (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will “deeply examine” the possibility of running for president in 2020, Massachusetts Senator said
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she will “deeply examine” the possibility of running for president following the midterm elections.
During an informal public debate in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider applying.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington to repair our dysfunctional government, and that includes a woman as the top person in charge,” she said.
“After November 6th, I will deeply examine the possibility of running for president.”
Warren commented on President Donald Trump during the informal debate, saying he was “bringing the country in the wrong direction.”
“I am extremely concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren has been a harsh vocal critic of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said: “Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
However, a poll conducted on Thursday revealed that most of Warren’s own constituents are not of the opinion that she should run for president in 2020.
59% of Massachusetts’ “probable” voters said the senator should not run, according to a poll by the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe’s Center for Political Research.
32% support your candidacy.
The poll revealed superior support for a candidacy from former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% in favor of a potential candidacy and 48% against.
Other prominent Democratic Party names debated regarding a potential 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions Track Palin post-traumatic stress in Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after his enrollment in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with an incident of domestic violence.
“What my own son is going through, what is going on after I’m back, I can identify with the other families who feel the ramifications of post-traumatic stress and some of the wounds our soldiers are actually coming back with,” he told the audience at a rally in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest "the elephant in the room" and said his son and other veterans "return a little different, they return hardened, they return to investigate whether there is such respect for what his fellow soldiers and aviators, and all other members of the armed forces, have given to the country."
Track Palin was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence over a woman and possession of a gun while alcoholic, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for Wasilla Police Department.
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the challenge of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are backing a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum for victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the district sent a statement amicus curiae (friends of the court) on Friday in Washington in support of an asylum seeker who is challenging this policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace vs. Sessions lawsuit that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against the policy was not revealed.
The person said her partner "and her children, members of a violent gang," abused her, but U.S. authorities rejected her asylum application on July 20.
The complainant was arrested in Texas.
The public ministries supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum seekers in the U.S., as nations facing widespread problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy revoked a 2014 decision of the Immigrant Resources Council that allowed migrants without documents fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Attorney General of the District of Columbia Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international laws".
“Federal legislation requires all asylum applications to be assessed on the basis of the facts and specific circumstances underlying them; this ban violates this principle,” the statement said.
Lawyers also argued in the statement that the police ban on entry of immigrants negatively affects the U.S. economy, stating that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "dispose the necessary labor."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gangs in June.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their country due to persecution or fears based on ethnicity, religion, nationality or belonging to a specific social group or with a certain political opinion,” Sessions said in its June 11 policy announcement.
Asylum has never been destined to alleviate all the problems, not even all the serious problems that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu when the death toll doubles in a counter-clock to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is increasingly desperate.
“The environment is very tense,” said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, mother of a febrile male baby, as she comforts him in an evacuation center in the shattered city of Palu.
“Every minute an ambulance brings more bodies.
There is a shortage of clean water.”
Residents were spotted returning to their destroyed homes to try to save everything they could find among their splashed with water.
There were hundreds of wounded and the hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, such as Dwi Haris, who fractured the ribs and shoulder, rested outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated abroad due to strong replicas that continued.
His eyes were bathed in tears as he recounted how he felt when the violent earthquake shook him in the fifth-floor hotel room where he was with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save us.
I was stuck in the ruins of the wall, I think,” Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of “Intimidation” with “Propaganda Ads”
A week after a Chinese official newspaper published a four-page ad in a U.S. daily promoting the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to China Daily's paid supplement at the Des Moines Register, Iowa's state-run newspaper, after accusing China of seeking to interfere in the November 6 election, a charge denied by China.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. election marked the beginning of what U.S. officials, in remarks to Reuters, have designated as a new phase in Washington’s growing campaign to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently waging an increasingly intense trade war that has seen both sides impose tariff loopholes on each other’s imports.
China’s retaliatory tariffs in the early stages of the trade war were designed to affect exporters in states that support Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and American experts say.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion article in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, “is now putting its foot on the accelerator of this intimidation with the publication of advertisements in our free press.”
“With the spread of this propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the bitter American tradition of freedom of expression and the press by publishing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register,” said Branstad.
On the other hand, in the banks here in Beijing, we find very few dissenting voices and we will never see a true reflection of the disparity of views that the Chinese may have of their country’s worrying economic trajectory, as the media are under the firm control of the Chinese Communist Party.
In addition, he added that "one of the most prominent Chinese newspapers has declined the offer to publish" his article, although he has not mentioned which.
Republicans alienate female voters before midterm elections with Kavanaugh disaster, analysts warn
At a time when many prominent Republicans support and defend the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of the various allegations of sexual assault, analysts warn that such a move could trigger a negative reaction, particularly from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
Emotions around the case have been very strong and most Republicans have already publicly stated that they intend to move forward for a vote.
These things don’t back down,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the University of Syracuse’s Maxwell School, told an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that last-minute pressure from Senator Jeff Flake (Arizona Republican) to conduct an FBI investigation was enough to appease the insurgent voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday — they will not forget tomorrow or November,” Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, told the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted “November is at the door!” as they protested in the Senate hallway, as Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee chose to move forward with Kavanaugh’s appointment despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony, Mic reported.
“The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will break all records,” Stu Rothenberg, a political analyst with no party affiliation, told the news site.
“People say it’s already high; it’s true.
But it can be even higher, particularly among undecided voters in suburban areas and younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who, although they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony describing his allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested a negative reaction could occur if Republicans moved forward with the confirmation.
“This has become a trap for the Republican Party,” said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee's vote, or whether Kavanaugh will take his place as a judge, it's also about how Republicans handled the matter and how they handled it," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided about who to believe after Ford and Kavanaugh’s testimonies, with a small majority aligning it with the first.
A new YouGov survey revealed that 41% of respondents believed absolutely or probably in Ford's testimony, while 35% said they believed absolutely or probably in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they thought Kavanaugh had probably or absolutely lied about his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
Following Flake’s proposal, the FBI initiated an investigation into Ford’s allegations, as well as another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, according to the Guardian.
Ford under oath to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week reported that Kavanaugh sexually molested her while drunk when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee exposed his genitals when the two attended a party during the period they both studied at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web intends to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, created a startup that aims to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this legendary technology character, Inrupt, is a company that leverages Berners-Lee’s open source platform, Solid.
This allows users to decide where their data is stored and who has access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokingly stated that the intention underlying Inrupt is to “dominate the world.”
“We have to do it now,” he said of the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid’s technology to allow people to create their own “personal online data warehouse,” or POD.
This may include contact lists, task lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available in one browser and at the same time.
What is unique about online personal data storage is that it is solely up to the user to decide who has access to what type of information.
The company calls it “personal training through data.”
Inrupt’s idea, according to John Bruce, is to provide the right resources, processes and skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some internal programmers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology creators around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a total change in which all of their business models are turned from scratch from one day to the next.
“We’re not asking for permission.”
In a post in Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to create commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new Web created with Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over internet neutrality.
Even while launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this upcoming era of the Web,” added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Tribute to the clergyman decorated with the Victoria Cross in the First Great War
The only clergyman of the Church of England to receive the Victoria Cross during the First Great War as a combatant was honored in his hometown after 100 years.
Lieutenant-Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann received the decoration on 29 September 1918 with the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he received the highest British military honor.
His two grandchildren unraveled a commemorative plaque at a stop in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of them, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliantly symbolic" that the plaque had been presented exactly 100 years after the fact that gave the decoration to his grandfather.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Saint-Quentin Canal "in a very thick fog and under closed fire of portable weapons and machine guns".
He then ran to the line of fire and, "with the greatest courage", led the line forward before attacking alone a cannon and shooting down three soldiers from the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I would never be able to match, but also a lesson in humility.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, deposited a flower crown after the stop, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt "very honored to participate in the parade" and added that "the courage of a genuine hero is being demonstrated through the support that will be given by many people."
Mixed martial arts fans wake up all night to see the Bellator 206 instead watch the Peppa Pig
Imagine this: you wake up all night to see the Bellator 206, full of stars, and in the end you are prevented from seeing the main event.
The San Jose series included 13 fights, with six from the main group, and was being shown live during the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At six in the morning, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the confrontation, the spectators in the UK were shocked when the coverage moved to Peppa Pig.
Some were not impressed after they had been woken up until dawn especially for the fight.
A fan on Twitter described the move to children's cartoons as "a kind of bad taste joke."
“Government regulation says the content is not suitable for six o’clock in the morning, so they had to switch to another schedule,” said Dave Schwartz, administrator with the marketing and communications board, when questioned about the broadcast.
""Peppa bitch," yes."
Bellator chairman Scott Coker said the company will revise the schedule of broadcasts to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think when I think about repetition, I think we can solve the problem," Coker said.
“But it’s six in the morning there on Sunday and we won’t be able to resolve it until our Sunday time, which is Monday in British time.
But we're working on it.
I’m not lying when I say that when programming changed, there were a lot of messages exchanged and none very nice.
We're trying to solve the problem. We thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn’t: it was a government problem.
I promise it won't happen next time.
We will reduce the number of fights to five instead of six, as we normally do. We tried to exceed the expectations of the fans and we exaggerated.
It's a sad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" about his sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley said he grew to feel inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but that this gave him motivation to become a success.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize until he entered high school that “not everyone is like me.”
In an interview with the first Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 presented by Lauren Laurene, he said he was in favor of gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also claimed that becoming a father made him less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The show’s regular host, Kirsty Young, took several months off due to illness.
Appearing as a pair on Laverne's first show, Daley said she felt "inferior" to everyone else because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
In his words, “until today, this impression of feeling smaller and different has been the real motive that gave me the power and strength to achieve success.”
His goal was to prove that he was “someone,” he said, so as not to disappoint everyone when they discovered their sexuality sooner or later.
The Olympic bronze medalist has become a prominent LGBT activist and used his participation in this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
According to him, he manifested himself because he was happy to be able to live openly without consequences and intended to give “hope” to others.
The three-time world champion mentioned that falling in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, “took me by surprise.”
Daley got married last year to the 20-year-old Oscar winner, although he claimed that age difference was never a problem.
"When we go through it when we're so young" - his first participation in the Olympics was at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said, it's hard to find someone of the same age who has gone through similar ups and downs.
The couple had a son in June last year, named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley claimed that "his whole perspective" had changed.
“If they had asked me last year, all that mattered was ‘winning a gold medal,’” he said.
"But you know, there are things bigger than Olympic gold medals.
“My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley mentioned that his father did not accept the fact that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if they already had tickets to the 2012 London games, because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell you that you’re not going to be around to be in the front row, Dad,” he said.
“I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and it was only when he really stopped breathing and died that I finally recognized that he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I was fully aware that it was what I had dreamed of all my life: diving in front of a crowd of compatriots at the Olympics ... there was no better feeling," he said.
All of this was also the inspiration for her first choice of song - Proud, by Heather Small - with which she had identified during preparation for the Olympics, and which still gives her chicken skin.
Desert Island Discs airs on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 p.m.
Mickelson in low form at the bank at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will hit a record on Saturday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but will have to regain his shape to prevent the mark from symbolizing an unfortunate occasion.
Mickelson, playing in the biennial event for the 12th time, a record share, was sent to the bench by captain Jim Furyk at Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as has been so many times in the U.S. teams, the five-time champion of the men’s main championships divided the day between the supporting role and the work in his playing field, in hopes of rectifying what afflicts him.
Never having given straight shots even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old is not ideal for the Le Golf Nacional field, where the long rough usually punishes the wrong shots.
And if the field itself wasn’t intimidating enough, Mickelson will face the exact British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood, winning all four games they played this week.
If the Americans, with a four-point draw to start the 12 singles games, record a good start, Mickelson’s game may prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, but not that he could say much more.
“He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a snag on my back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is a respected champion who has given these teams a lot in the past, and also this week.
I probably hadn’t seen him play two games.
I thought about more, but that's how it happened, and that's how we thought we'd have to move on.
He wants to be in the game, like everyone else.”
Mickelson will break Nick Faldo’s record for the most games played in the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
This may mark the end of a career in the Ryder Cup that has never matched the successes of your individual resume.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven draws, although Furyk has claimed his presence has created some intangible advantages for the team.
"He's sarcastic, funny and spirited, he likes to play with people and he's an excellent person to have in the team room," he explained.
“I think the younger players had a lot of fun messing with him this week too, which was fun to see.
He gives so much more than just playing.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that his great advantage can disappear in a pinnacle
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows from experience that his loose leadership on entering the last day of singles in the Ryder Cup can easily become an accidental ride.
The Danish had his debut at the 1997 match in Valderrama, where a team captained by Seve Ballesteros kept a five-point lead over the Americans, but crossed the finish line with the nose with the narrowest margins, winning by 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"We always try to remember that we had a considerable advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but for a while," Bjorn said in the image, after witnessing the victory of the 2018 Tournament by 5-3, both on Friday 10th to Friday 5th.
So history has shown me and everyone on this team that this is not over yet.
Tomorrow, do your best.
Go there and do all right.
This doesn't end until we have the dots on the marker.
We have a goal that is to try to win this trophy and that is where the focus should remain.
“I’ve always said that I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we’re well aware of who’s on the other side: the best players in the world.”
Enchanted by the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never get ahead of myself in that.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
Tomorrow what matters is the individual performance and that involves a different task.
It’s great to be there with a partner when things go well, but when we’re there on our own, our skills as golfers are tested to the fullest.
This is the message that you need to convey to the players: tomorrow, do your best.
Now they’re going to leave the partner and he has to go and give his best as well.”
In contrast to Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk will look for his players to perform better individually than as partners, constituting the exceptions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Furyk himself was already on both sides of these big turns the last day, having been part of the winning team in Brookline before he ended up losing when Europe pulled the "Miracle in Medinah" out of the cartel.
"I remember all the words," he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, motivated his players for the final day.
“We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you would like to get that quick start like what you saw in Brookline and what you saw in Medinah.
When this momentum is directed to one side, the pressure is too great in these mid-games.
We organized our team accordingly and ordered the players the way we feel, you know, that we will try to do magic tomorrow.”
Thomas, with the mission of trying to lead the counter-attack, faces Rory McIlroy in the main game, being Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the first half of the order.
“I chose this group of players for this order because I think it covers the entire track,” Bjorn said of his choices for the singles.
New German Warship Delayed Again
The latest German navy frigate should have entered service in 2014 to replace warships from the Cold War era. However, it will be necessary to wait at least until next year, due to systems prone to breakdowns and an exponentially growing cost, according to local media.
The entry into service of the "Rheinland-Pfalz," the command ship of the brand new frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quoted a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the worrying post-delivery problems undermined the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels that the Navy had ordered in 2007 will serve to replace the aged Bremen-class frigates.
It is known to be equipped with a powerful cannon, as well as a number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technologies such as reducing radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer periods between maintenance, which would allow the latest frigates to be sent on missions with a maximum duration of two years away from the ports of origin.
However, the continued delays have caused the next-generation warships, which are seen as a way for Germany to project power across borders, to be outdated when they enter service, Die Zeit reports.
The unfortunate F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy refused to put it into service, having returned it to the yards of Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned a ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media cites a series of crucial "hardware and software defects" that would make the warship useless if used in a combat mission.
Software deficiencies were particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, only half of the necessary contingent on the oldest Bremen-class frigates.
It was also known that the vessel is overly heavy, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy’s ability to install additional functionality in the future.
It is believed that the "Rheinland-Pfalz", of 7000 tons, has twice the weight of ships of similar classes used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to hardware failures, the cost of the entire project, including crew training, is also becoming a problem.
It is said to have reached an astonishing <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion, an increase from the initially budgeted <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems facing the most recent frigates have become particularly important in light of recent warnings that German naval power is weakening.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliamentary defense committee, acknowledged that the navy is currently running out of ships capable of being used.
The politician said the problem grew exponentially over time, as older ships were put out of service without any boats to replace them.
In the end, he regretted that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class had been able to join the navy.
The National Trust is spying on the secret life of bats.
New research is being carried out on a property in the Scottish Highlands with the aim of revealing how bats use the landscape to search for food.
The results are expected to shed some light on the behavior of these singular flying mammals and help guide conservation activities in the future.
The study, conducted by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, will follow common bats and fruit, as well as long-eared browns and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations spread across the property to follow bat activities throughout the station.
Mobile studies will also be conducted by NTS staff and by volunteers with portable detectors.
Expert analysis of all the recordings will assess the frequency of calls from bats and what each species is doing.
A map of the habitat will then be produced to create a detailed picture of its behavior on a territorial scale.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Conservation Advisor, expects the results to reveal which habitat areas are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as grassland breeding, as well as how best to maintain forests for bats and associated species.
Flesh populations in Scotland and across the UK have declined considerably over the past century.
These animals are threatened by construction and development works that affect dormitories and cause habitat degradation.
Wind turbines and lightning also pose a threat, along with fly-killing roles and some chemical treatments of building materials, in addition to domestic cat attacks.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, given their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
It is by them used a sophisticated echo localization technique to identify insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the region, takes bats very seriously.
The organization has ten trained experts who regularly carry out studies, dormitories inspections and sometimes rescues.
It also created the first butterfly-only reserve in Scotland, at the Thrave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which houses eight of the ten species of Scottish bats.
The director of the property, David Thompson, says the same is the ideal territory for them.
“Here at Thrave we have an excellent area for bats,” he said.
“We have the old buildings, a lot of old trees and all this good habitat.
However, there’s still a lot about bats we don’t know, so the work we do here and on other properties will help us learn more about what they need to bloom.”
He emphasized the importance of checking for bats before carrying out maintenance on the property, as the unintended destruction of only one maternity dormitory could lead to the death of up to 400 females and young animals, which could eradicate the entire local population.
Fleas are a protected species and it is illegal to kill them, harass them, disturb them or destroy their dormitories.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish head of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to participate to help.
“We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of our species, we simply don’t know how their populations are getting revenge.”
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape as his lawyers prepare to sue German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo described the allegations of rape against him as “fake news,” claiming that people “want to promote themselves” using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portuguese forward and Juventus were accused of raping an American woman, identified as Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is alleged that he will then have paid $375,000 for the alleged victim to remain silent about the accident, reads Der Spiegel on Friday.
Speaking in a live video on Instagram to his 142 million followers hours after the allegations were made public, 33-year-old Ronaldo described the reports as “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news,” the five-Ball winner told the camera.
"They want to promote themselves at the expense of my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous for saying my name, but that's part of the profession.
I’m a happy man and everything is fine,” the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they characterized as “an inadmissible report of suspicions in the area of privacy,” according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would demand compensation for moral damages in the amount corresponding to the seriousness of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations of recent years.
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's room, where he would have violated her anal, according to documents submitted to the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga alleges that Ronaldo got down on his knees after the alleged incident and told him he was "99%" "a good guy", hurt by "one percent".
The documents allege that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she turned to the police and had photographs of her injuries taken in a hospital, but that she would later have agreed to enter into an extrajudicial agreement because she felt "terrified by the prospect of retaliation" and was concerned about the possibility of "publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old woman now says she intends to cancel the deal, as she continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid, leaving Manchester United, at the time of the alleged aggression. This summer he moved to the Italian giants Juve in a deal of 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK 'would regret forever' to lose car makers
The UK “would regret it forever” if it lost its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
Clark also mentioned that Toyota in the UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production of its plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need an agreement,” Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese manufacturer said the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston factory, which produces Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My perspective is that if Britain unruly leaves the EU at the end of March, we will witness production stops at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s chief executive officer in Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in the UK have expressed concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement on the functioning of cross-border transactions, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said it would close its Minis factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns concern what manufacturers claim to be the risks of the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is managed on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes, coming from suppliers both in the UK and the EU, for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be disruptions at the border, which the sector says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day of stocks at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production would have to stop.
Clark said Theresa May's "Checkers Plan" for future relations with the EU was "precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks".
"We want to have the best deal that allows, as I said, not only the current success, but also the opportunity for us to take advantage of this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today.
“The evidence not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers indicates that we absolutely need to be able to continue with what has been a highly successful supply chain set.”
Although it has not been able to give an estimate of the downtime, Toyota said that, in the long run, the increased costs would reduce the factory’s competitiveness and could, sooner or later, lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked at the Burnaston factory for 24 years and coordinates the Unite union at that location, said its members are increasingly concerned: “According to my experience, if they are lost, these jobs will never come back.
A government spokesperson said: "We have presented an accurate and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, White House says
Donald Trump’s important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be “added another week” given there is still no understanding on Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of legal adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, links between Trump’s advisers and Russia and the possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Trump’s ability to prepare for the deputy attorney general’s dismissal, thus jeopardizing Mueller’s independence, has fueled rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of secretly recording talks with Trump and the possibility of deposing the President through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last Monday he moved to the White House, with information that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced on Thursday with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would "prefer not to fire" Rosenstein, but the meeting was then postponed to avoid overlapping with a Senate Justice Committee hearing at which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, delaying the final vote in the Senate.
Trump’s press adviser, Sarah Sanders, participated in Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "The date has not yet been set, it may be this week but it may also be postponed another week, given everything that has happened in the Supreme Court.
Let's see. I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists would disagree with such a statement: Sanders has not organized a press conference at the White House since September 10.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the scarcity of press conferences is not due to an aversion to the "protagonism" of television reporters, although he said that: "I wouldn't disagree with the fact that they like the protagonism."
He then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president makes more questions and answers than any previous president," he said, adding, without adding evidence: "We analyzed these numbers."
The press conferences will continue to take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, that's infinitely better than talking to me.
We have tried to do this often and have seen that we have done it in the last few weeks, and the fact that you can talk to the President of the United States replaces any press conference."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences, when he receives foreign representatives.
Soil press conferences are rare.
This week the President showed why in New York, appearing casually and sometimes bizarrely in front of the journalists present.
Health Minister writes to EU workers at the Scottish National Health Service about fears of Brexit
The Health Minister wrote to EU staff working at the Scottish National Health Service to express the country’s gratitude and request that they remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent the letter less than six months after the UK left the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed to costing EU citizens who work in the country’s decentralised public services to obtain their status as a resident.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "Throughout the summer negotiations between the UK and the EU on the withdrawal have continued, and decisions are expected this fall.
But the UK government has also accelerated preparations for a possible no-deal exit scenario.
I know this is a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I would like to reaffirm at this time how much I value the contribution of each employee, regardless of their nationalities.
Colleagues from across the EU and other backgrounds bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, benefiting the patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is truly your home and we very much want you to continue here.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering head injuries
Tennessee State Tigers defender Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering head injuries in Saturday's 31-27 defeat to the Vanderbilt Commodore, Tigers' Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee team coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the break.
"He approached the lateral line and practically fainted," Reed said.
The technical team and medical staff put Abercrombie's oxygen on the sidelines before laying it on a mattress and transporting it for further evaluation.
A team representative told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was recovering from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no information about the type/severeness of the injury" and that the team is trying to figure out when it occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student, suspended his studies during the first season with the Tennessee State Tigers after a transfer from Illinois.
He made five appearances on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing his total of the season to 18 appearances.
A higher stamp duty will be charged to foreign buyers when acquiring properties in the UK
The Conservative Party has announced plans to levy a higher stamp duty on foreign buyers who purchase properties in the UK, with additional revenue to be invested in aid for homeless people.
The measure will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s campaign to attract the younger electorate
The rise in stamp duty will affect buyers who are not taxed in the UK
The Ministry of Finance expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless
A higher stamp tax will be charged to foreign buyers who acquire properties in the UK, with the additional revenue to be invested in aid to the homeless, Theresa May announced today.
The move is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to attract the younger electorate, with promises to provide more affordable housing and tax higher incomes.
The rise in stamp duty will affect people and businesses that are not taxed in the UK, with the additional revenue boosting the government’s campaign to offer a ceiling to the homeless.
The surcharge – added to the current stamp duty, including the highest levels introduced two years ago for second homes and rental purchases – could rise to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects the measure to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
It is estimated that 13% of new buildings in London are purchased by non-residents in the UK, causing prices to rise and making it difficult for first-home buyers to access the market.
Many thriving areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes weeks after Boris Johnson has demanded a stamp tax cut to help young people acquire their first home.
He accused the major construction companies of keeping property prices high by boarding unused land, demanding that Ms. May abandon quotas on affordable housing to resolve Britain's "accommodation devastation".
Mr Corbyn announced an appealing set of housing reform proposals, including income controls and the end of "no justification" layoffs.
It also wants to give municipalities extended powers for the construction of new houses.
May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my mandate to restoring the British dream that living conditions should be improved for each new generation.
And that means solving the problem of our real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is not certain that it is as easy to buy a home for people living outside the UK and for foreign companies as it is for British workers residing in the UK.
For too many people, the dream of owning their home has become too far away, and the shame of those who sleep lately remains too real.”
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland'
Sunderland coach Jack Ross said his "last ambition" is to become Scotland's national team manager.
The 42-year-old has been successful in the challenge of giving new life to the Northeastern club, currently ranked third in the Premier League, three points ahead.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after directing St. Mirren on his return to the Scottish First Division last season.
“I wanted to represent my country as a player.
But I only got a B internationalization,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportsound.
“I grew up watching Scotland play in Hampden with my father and these are some of my best memories.
But this opportunity will only arise if it succeeds in the management of clubs.”
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland coach include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic coach says he was not afraid to succeed such consecrated names in such a large club after rejecting invitations from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, for the moment, success is just, 'can I take the club back to the Premier League?'
Given the structure and facilities of the club, his place is undoubtedly in the Premier League.”
"It will not be easy to bring the club back, but I will only consider that I was successful here when I reached that goal."
Ross's career as a coach is only three years, after a period as an assistant coach at Dumbarton and 15 months at the Hearts technical team.
He then helped Alloa recover from the descent to the third division and led St. Mirren from the threat of depromotion to the championship title in the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever felt during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
Taking care of Alloa "was a real crusade," he recalls.
"I've always seen myself more in the role of coach than in the role of player.
It seems strange because it went well, I made a living as a player and had some high moments in my career.
But playing can be very hard.
We face a lot of challenges every week.
I still face them in terms of stress and job pressures, but I feel very good as a coach.
I’ve always wanted to train and now that I do, I feel more comfortable than I’ve ever felt in my adult life.”

The perfect time for a pint is 17:30 on Saturday, according to a study
The summer heat wave filled British pubs, but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Restoration groups recorded a 2.7% increase in sales in July, but restaurant occupancy declined 4.8%, the statistics show.
Peter Martin of CGA, which compiled the statistics, said: "The continuation of good weather and England's career in the World Cup, longer than expected, have led to the June pattern, in which restaurants have seen a 2.8% increase in sales, but repeat sales.
The 1.8% drop in restaurant sales in June worsened in July.
The pubs and bars with the beverage-based business have by far had the best performance, with a homologous growth that more than compensated for the descent of restaurants.
Pubs with the meal-based business also encountered difficulties, though not as dramatic as those of the catering operators.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In directly managed pubs and bars, beverage sales rose 6.6% over the course of the month, with meals falling 3%.
Paul Newman, an RSM leisure and restoration analyst, said: “These results prolong the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
Meteorology and the impact of major social and sporting events continue to be the main factors influencing the out-of-home food market sales.
It is not surprising that restoration groups continue to face difficulties, although the annual drop in sales of 4.8% is especially harmful when added to the prolongation of cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not come at a worse time for operators with the meal-based business. Only time will tell if the milder temperatures we know in August will provide the much-wanted relief."
Total sales of pubs and restaurants, including new openings, grew by 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in brand launches.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, the sectoral indicator of UK pubs, bars and restaurants sales, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, being recognized as the industry benchmark.
One in Five Children Hide Parents’ Secret Accounts on Social Media
One in five children — some only 11 years old — have secret social media accounts that hide from parents and teachers, a study found.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a growth of "false" Instagram pages
The news aggravates fears about the publication of content of a sexual nature
Twenty percent of students claimed to have a "main" account to show parents
One in five children – some only 11 years old – create social media accounts that hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth in “fake” accounts on the Instagram photo sharing site.
The news aggravates fears about the publication of content of a sexual nature.
Twenty percent of the students claimed to have an innocuous "primary" account to show to parents, while at the same time owning private accounts.
A mother who found her 13-year-old daughter's secret account found that the teenager was inciting others to "rape her."
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Independent School Board of Directors (HMC), revealed that 40% of young people between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, half of which admitted to keeping private accounts.
HMC director Mike Buchanan said: “It’s disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where their parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" in the Scottish Athletics Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected non-executive director of the Scottish Athletics Council at the Annual General Assembly of the regulator.
Doyle is the most awarded Scottish athletic practitioner. President Ian Beattie described the appointment as an excellent opportunity for sports regulators to take advantage of their vast international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh is extremely respected throughout the Scottish, British and world athletic community and we are sure that Scottish athletics will have a lot to gain with its presence in the Council," Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I’m excited to be able to act as the voice of the athletes and I hope I can truly contribute to helping guide the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won the 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, and a total of four Olympic gold medals, and who is currently a regular commentator on the BBC, stopped running after suffering a transient ischemic vascular accident.
As he wrote on Twitter: “It’s been a month since I suffered a stroke.
I stopped being able to walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell if he would be able to recover and to what extent.
It has been a hard job but I have achieved a total recovery, I have learned to walk again and I even do agility exercises!
Thank you for the encouragement messages!”
Announcement of milk extraction pump compares mothers to cows, sharing opinions online
A milk pump company has shared opinions online with an ad that compares mothers breastfeeding cows in the barn.
To mark the launch of what is described as the “first portable silent milk extraction pump,” consumer technology company Elvie has released an ironic music-inspired ad to highlight the freedom the new pump gives milk-extracting mothers.
Four mothers dance in a vacant hay-filled vacancy to the sound of a song that includes verses like "Yes, I'm ordering myself, but I don't have a tail" and "If you haven't noticed, I don't have tits, these are my breasts."
The chorus continues: "Pumping, pumping, feeding the babies, pumping, pumping, I'm ordering my girls."
However, the announcement posted on the company’s Facebook page generated controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from spectators, with many saying it alleviates the “horror” of the dairy sector.
"You've saddened the decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are stolen from them a few days after they are born.”
The Elvie extraction pump fits discreetly inside a breastfeeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: "Understandingly traumatic for the mother and for the baby.
But yes, why not use them to advertise an extraction pump for mothers who can have their babies?"
Someone else said, "An announcement with a huge lack of sensitivity."
Others defended the ad, such as a woman who admitted to finding the song "hilarious".
"I think the idea is great.
If I was still breastfeeding, I'd buy one.
The extraction made me feel exactly like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy but it makes all sense.
This product is great,” one of the women wrote.
Another commented: “It’s a fun ad aimed at mothers who extract milk (often in bathrooms or at work) and feel like “cows.”
It is not an announcement to praise or judge the dairy sector.”
At the end of the video the group of women reveals that they were dancing with the discrete bombs housed in the bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on information that many women who extract milk with bombs claim to feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and fits discreetly inside a breastfeeding bra, giving women the freedom to move around, grab their babies and even leave the house while extracting milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and Creative Director of "Mother", commented: "The Elvie bomb is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By establishing a parallel between the women who extract milk and the dairy cows we wanted to highlight all the challenges of milk extraction, while presenting in a fun way and with which people can identify the incredible sense of freedom provided by the new bomb.
It wasn't the first time the Elvie bomb was headlined.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two paraded on the sidewalk to designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children discreetly displaced to a camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has peaked, although monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to support children.
Traditionally, most “parents” are themselves undocumented immigrants, fearing to compromise their own possibility of staying in the country by offering to support a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential patrons and other adults who integrate their family members would have to record their fingerprints, with the data being shared with the authorities regulating immigration.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with the Immigration and Customs Control Service, testified before Congress that the service detained dozens of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The service later confirmed that 70% of the detainees had no criminal record.
Nearly 80% of the godparents or members of their family members find themselves illegal in the country, many of them foreigners with a criminal record.
That is why we will continue to pursue these individuals,” Mr. Albence said.
In an effort to speed up the processing of children, officials introduced new rules that require some of them to appear in court within one month of the date of detention, rather than 60 days, the previous rule, according to staff at the reception centers.
Many are present by videoconferencing, and not in person, to defend their request for legal status before an immigration court judge.
Those who are considered ineligible for aid shall be promptly deported.
The longer children are held, the more likely they are to feel anxious or depressed, which can lead to access to violence or escape attempts, according to reception centre officials and reports produced by the system in recent months.
Immigrant rights advocates say these concerns are exacerbated in larger facilities such as those in Tornillo, where the large size contributes to children’s signs of disruption being ignored.
They add that transferring children to camps without leaving time for their emotional preparation or to say goodbye to friends aggravates the trauma that many are already debating.
Syria calls for immediate withdrawal of U.S., French and Turkish "occupation forces"
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called for the return of Syrian refugees home, despite the war in the country in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces are illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that "they will be treated as such."
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the Assembly.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, in a war that left millions more displaced.
He said Damascus would continue “to wage this sacred battle until we liberate all Syrian territories” both from terrorist groups and from “all and any illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in this war-torn country.
Regarding the refugee issue, Moualem said the conditions for his return were assured, accusing "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that led the refugees to stay abroad.
“We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no aid to rebuild Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a security zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity to insist on political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement set “clear deadlines” and expressed hope that the military action would target the jihadists, including the fighters of the Al-Nusra Front associated with Al-Qaeda, who “will be eradicated.”
The UN envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria, preparing the ground for elections.
Moualem set conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and warning against possible interference.
Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Trump would be re-elected in 2020 unless, as many liberal observers are likely to expect, the challenge and scandals end his presidency in advance.
In the one that would undoubtedly constitute "the most dramatic end of a presidency of all time"!
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue from the spectators.
Since 2014, nobility hearings more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in noble times, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" led the cable audiences with up to 3.5 million viewers on the big news nights.
“This is a strong whim for people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, producer of ABC’s Designated Survivor, about a chief of staff who becomes President after an attack that destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedian and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club", has another theory.
He recalls once calling a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The taxi driver told him he was going to vote for Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
He replied, "Because he makes me laugh," Scovell told me.
Chaos has entertainment value.
Of course, unlike television programs, stories from Washington could determine the future of abortion legislation, the right to family reunion of immigrants, and the health of the global economy.
Changing program is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
And yet, it's more than just being an informed citizen when we're watching the sixth hour of an expert debate about Bob Woodward's use of "deeply knowledgeable" sources in his book "Fear," the ostrich leather blouse of 15,000 dollars implicates Paul Manafort's post-employment descriptions.
For my part, I will never face Super Mario in the same way again.
“Part of what he’s done looks like a reality show because he gives us something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars,” about Trump’s dynamic cast and the daily twists of the plot.
We can't miss any episodes or stay behind.
When I spoke to Mr. Fleiss this week they were 26th on the north coast of Kauai, but he was locked up at home, watching MSNBC while filming CNN.
He did not shy away from television as Brett Kavanaugh prepared to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee, with the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
“I still remember when we were doing all those crazy programs and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right."

Significant external funding in the midterm elections for the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that the 17th Circle of Pennsylvania is experiencing an influx of funding, thanks to a realignment of the electoral circles that left two titles in the race for the same place.
The recent adjustment of Pittsburgh suburban circles put Democrat Conor Lamb in the race, who won his place in another circle in an extraordinary election last spring.
Lamb is running against another titleholder, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th Circle of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps the new 17th Circle.
The maps were redesigned after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old circles favored Republicans unconstitutional.
The race for the 17th circle sparked a fierce dispute over campaign funding between the financial arms of the main parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a tangential victory in the highly contested March extraordinary election for the 18th congressional district of Pennsylvania.
This place was occupied more than a decade ago by a Republican and President Donald Trump won in the circle by 20 percentage points.
Analysts have attributed a slight advantage to the Democrats.
The US considered penalizing El Salvador for supporting China, then retreating
Some diplomats pointed out that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with few protests from Washington.
President Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump Organization from the leadership.
State Department officials have decided to call the leaders of U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama after “recent decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement this month.
But only sanctions were considered against El Salvador, which received about $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including for drug control, economic aid and development.
The proposed penalties, which included cuts in financial aid and specific visa restrictions, would have severely penalized this Central American country with high unemployment and homicide rates.
As internal meetings continued, representatives from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on economic security and prosperity, following a similar meeting last year seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from entering the United States.
But in mid-September, top administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to move forward, putting aside any and all considerations of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence has scheduled an intervention at the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, in a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, the diplomats said.
The three U.S. representatives returned discreetly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any harsh messages or punishments from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to talk about the internal deliberations covered by anonymity.
His reports were corroborated by an external analyst close to the Administration, who also requested anonymity.
Studying the History
The next bomb to be dropped may be the report by legal adviser Robert Mueller on Mr Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, on which there is currently substantial evidence in the public domain.
Mueller will allegedly be directing his investigation into whether Trump’s campaign has conspired with Russia to attack the election.
If Congress changes hands, Trump will face accountability on the part of that body, while preparing to appear again to voters and perhaps be judged by his peers.
There are many possibilities and I don’t want to suggest that Mr. Trump’s fall is inevitable – not even that of his European counterparts.
There are choices we have to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the fight.
In 1938, some German officers were prepared to depose Hitler in a coup d'état, as long as the West had resisted and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around turning points like this, where the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or hindered.
The Americans are currently facing several of these turning points.
What do we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been under threat since this newspaper reported that, last year, he suggested secretly recording the President, speculating about his inability to perform the role.
Rosenstein says the news from The Times is incorrect.
“How will we respond if the FBI’s recently requested investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not fair and complete or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we take these tests, democracy will be about to cross a long desert.
But I believe we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my diplomatic residence.
She survived, immigrated to America, and, 60 years later, sent me to light Sabbath candles on that table with the swastika.
With a legacy of this, how could you not be optimistic about our future?”

Graham Dorrans of the optimistic Rangers before the game with the Rapid of Vienna
The Rangers receive the Vienna Rapid on Thursday, knowing that a victory over the Austrians, following the impressive draw in Spain with Villarreal earlier this month, will leave them in a good position to qualify in Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making the first game of the season until a two-goal draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers will be able to use this result as a springboard for higher flights.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We faced the game with a positive mindset and scored a point.
Maybe we could have won near the end but, overall, the tie was probably the fairest result.
They were probably better in the first part but we turned around and dominated in the second part.
Thursday will be another great European night.
I hope we can win all three points. It will be a difficult game because they got a good result in the last game but, with the support of the public, I am sure we will do our best to achieve a positive result.
“The last year was very hard, with all my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there is a good atmosphere.
The team is good and the players are having fun; the training runs well.
I hope we can do our best, forget the past and achieve success.”
Women Are Losing Sleep Afraid of This Savings-Reform Account
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of the type of care they intended to enjoy, few people spoke to their relatives about the matter.
About half of the individuals surveyed in the Nationwide study reported talking to their spouses about the cost of continued care.
Only 10% mentioned talking to their children about the same issue.
“People want a family member to take care of themselves, but they’re not having that conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of the nationwide life insurance business.
Here's how to get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to take care of you unless you let them know your wishes in advance.
Work with your consultant and family, discussing where and how to receive care, as these choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Engage your financial advisor: Your consultant can also help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Your options for continuing care funding may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid policy with monetary valuation to help cover these expenses, or financing using your own savings, as long as you have those available values.
Prepare legal documentation: Avoid legal battles.
Appoint a health care attorney, choosing a person of your trust to oversee your health care and ensure that professionals respect your wishes in case you are prevented from communicating them.
Consider also the establishment of a proxy on your finances.
You should select someone you trust to make financial decisions for yourself, ensuring that your accounts will be paid if you become disabled.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medication and allergies?
Include this information in a written plan to be prepared.
“There are not just financial issues at stake, but who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
"What is the medication?
Who will take care of the dog?
Prepare this plan.”
Man shot multiple times with air pressure in Ilfracombe
A man was hit several times with air pressure when he returned home after a night in the city.
The victim, in her forties, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when she was hit in the chest, in the abdomen and in the hand.
The officers described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a “random act.”
The victim didn't see the assailant.
The injuries do not pose a life-threatening risk and the police have asked for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a severe earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with the number expected to increase.
With the communications interrupted, the rescuers were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala region, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster occurred.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a region that stretches along more than 300 km of coastline, in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The region, with lower administrative status than a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main economic activities of the province of Central Sulawesi, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel extraction is also important in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunami several times in the past hundred years, according to the Indonesian disaster management agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit the western part of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Seismic Fire Ring and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: On December 26, a severe earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, north of Sumatra, caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island off Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia’s most populous island, causing a tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck the city of Padang, the capital of the Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit one of the Mentawai islands off Sumatra, depolating a tsunami with waves of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hit the Pidie Jaya region of Aceh, spreading destruction and panic among people who remembered the devastation caused by the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died buried under the debris of the buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
Earthquakes have destroyed thousands of buildings, leaving thousands of tourists temporarily isolated.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, a 29-year-old resident of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference in an investigation into domestic violence and resistance to detention, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska police.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took his phone.
Palin is being held at Mat-Su pre-trial detention centre, subject to a $500 bail, KTUU reported.
He was present to the judge on Saturday, declaring himself "obviously innocent," the station said.
Palin faces charges for three Class A offenses, meaning he could be sentenced to up to a year’s imprisonment and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a Class B offence, punishable by a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
The mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is being tried by the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interference in reporting a crime of domestic violence and possession of a weapon under the influence of alcohol in relation to the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of smearing his face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by veterans’ associations after associating her son’s violent behavior with post-traumatic stress from her service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electrical and communications networks have been cut off, with the death toll expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck the region of Sulawesi Central, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
They circulate videos on social media showing the timing of the impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Public Prosecution Calls for Rare Death Penalty for New York Terrorist Attack Suspect
The New York State Department is calling for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the terrorist attack that killed eight people in the city – a rare punishment that has not been executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is accused of using a truck rented by Home Depot to carry out an attack in October on a bike path on West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, riding pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious injuries, according to the notification calling for the death penalty, registered in the South Zone of New York.
Both charges can be punished with the death penalty, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, the jury of a federal court accused Saipov of 22 crimes, including eight charges of murder at the service of organized crime, usually used by the Public Prosecutor's Office in cases of organized crime, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for “considerable planning and premeditation,” prosecutors said, describing how Saipov executed him as “cowardly, cruel and depraved.”
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnocco," the statement read.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
A decade ago, the South Zone of New York did not ask for the death penalty for an indictment.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug traffickers, but the sentence was switched to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953, when the couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage acts in favor of the Soviet Union, two years earlier, during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities he had felt inspired to carry out the attack after watching videos of ISIS on his phone, according to the charge.
He also requested permission to hang the ISIS flag in the hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of Saipov’s defense lawyers, said they were “obviously disappointed” with the indictment’s decision.
“We think that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a guilty confession to life imprisonment, with no possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked the prosecutors not to request the death penalty.
Conservative MP Says Nigel Farage Should Lead Brexit Negotiations
Nigel Farage promised today to “mobilize the popular army” during a protest at the Conservative Congress.
The former UKIP leader said politicians should “feel the pressure” of eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May’s MPs suggested he should lead negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham rally that the UK would have "already left" if Farage was Brexit minister.
But the challenge faced by Mrs May to reconcile her deeply divided co-religionists has been underlined by conservatives advocating permanence, who organized a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister has debated to maintain her commitment plan, known as the Chequers Plan, in the face of attacks by Brexit supporters, pro-democracy and the EU.
The allies insist that it will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the protests, forcing Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between its package and the “chaos.”
Mr. Bone said at the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he intended to "finish the Plan".
Bone suggested that responsibilities should have been assigned to Farage in the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was in charge, we would have left,” he said.
Wellingborough MP added: "I will continue to defend Brexit but we should end the Plan."
Strengthening his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in two World Wars to be subservient.
We want to make the laws of our own country.”
Bone rejected the allegations that public opinion has changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and intend to remain is totally flawed."
Conservative Brexit proponent Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the rally, telling reporters: “I just say: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers Plan is unpopular with the public, the opposition will not approve it, it is unpopular with our own party and with the militants who are taking the campaigns to the streets and to whom we owe our election.
Drop the Checker Plan and start listening."
In a message addressed to Mrs May, she added: "Only prime ministers who know how to keep promises keep their jobs."
Farage said in the demonstration that politicians should "feel the pressure" if they are ready to betray the decision to leave the 2016 referendum.
“This has become a matter of trust between us – the people – and the political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to tell them they’re not going to get away with it.”
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to pressure our political class, which is on the brink of betraying Brexit.
We want to mobilize the popular army of this country that has given us victory in Brexit and that will not rest until we become an independent, proud and self-governing United Kingdom.”
However, supporters of the stay marched in Birmingham before organising a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A crowd of activists stamped tracks with the message “Conservatives against Brexit” after the group’s launch this weekend.
Labour’s representative to the House of Lords, Andrew Adonis, criticized the Conservatives for the security issues they faced with a party application at the opening of the congress.
“These are the people who tell us that they will have the computer systems and all the technology prepared for ‘Canada more’, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
It's a complete farce.
There is no good Brexit,” he concluded.
Warren Plans to 'Seriously Consider' Possible Candidacy for President
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will “seriously consider running for president” after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a debate in that state on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Rep. Geoff Diehl, a co-mandate of Trump’s 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
It has been speculated that he will face Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters in debate format since Trump’s takeover.
One of the participants asked him if he planned to run for president.
Warren responded that it is time “women go to Washington to fix our government’s problems and that includes a woman at the top.”
Arrest as part of the murder of Wayde Sims, LSU Tigers
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on Saturday announced the arrest of a suspect in the murder of LSU Tigers basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at a press conference at 11 a.m.
Police had released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help in identifying a man seen in the pictures.
Sims, 20, was shot dead near Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims took a shot in the head, after which he ended up dead," police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde defended a friend and was targeted by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to his presence at the scene, holding a gun, admitting to targeting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without resistance and taken to the East Baton Rouge Parish police station.
Sims, a 1.98-metre junior created in Baton Rouge, played 32 games and was the winner for 10 times last season, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 recoveries per game.
Russia Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title with a victory over Sebastian Vettel following orders from the team
It became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that team orders at Mercedes would play a central role in the race.
Leaving pole position, Bottas had a good start and left Hamilton behind defending his position in the first two corners, allowing Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was first at the boxing and made Hamilton face traffic from the end of the peloton, which could have been decisive.
Mercedes went to the boxing lap later and went after Vettel, but Hamilton outpaced him after a skirmish, after which the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inside of the track free, at risk of disqualification after a double track correction to defend himself in the third.
Max Verstappen came out of the last line of the grid and was in seventh place at the end of the first round, on the day of his 21st birthday.
He then led much of the race, changing tires too late, which would allow him to be fast in the final, aiming to overtake Kimi Raikkonen to finish in fourth place.
He ended up coming to the boxing in the 44th lap but was unable to improve his pace in the last eight lap, which allowed Raikkonen to finish in fourth.
"It's a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job throughout the weekend and was a real gentleman, letting me out of it.
The team did an exceptional job, which allowed us to finish in the first two positions,” Hamilton said.
Bad body language.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein in a rally on Saturday over her insistence that she would not have revealed a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court-appointed Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to Ford's testimony before the Senate Justice Commission, instead commenting that what happens in the Senate shows that people are "more, malicious and false."
“Look at the beautiful thing that’s happening in the Senate in the last few days, look at the anger, look at how people are evil, malicious and fake,” Trump said.
"When we see the leaks and the communiqués and when they say 'oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did the escape start from you?
Do you remember her answer... did you publish the document? - 'Oh, what, what?
Oh, no.
The escape didn't start from me."
Well, wait there.
The escape started from us... No, it wasn't us," he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein received the letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh sent by Ford in July and the escape occurred in early September, but denied the escape had left his cabinet.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t reveal his story,” Feinstein told the commission.
"She asked me for confidentiality and I respected her request."
But his denial did not convince the President, who commented during Saturday night's rally: "You know what else, that was very bad body language.
Maybe it wasn’t her, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee, accused of sexual abuse by three women, the President suggested the Democrats would be using the accusations in his favor.
“They are determined to regain power by using all means.
We see evil, evil, it doesn’t matter who they can hit, who they have to step on to take power and control,” the president said.
First Division: Dundee Stars defeat Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals by the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars redeemed themselves from the defeat on Friday in the First Division game against the Belfast Giants, winning the second hand 5-3 on Saturday in Dundee.
The Giants gained an initial two-goal lead with shots from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied for the home team before Dwyer put the Giants in front again.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bouchard tied for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald secured the team's victory.
It was the third defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who had achieved a turnaround on Friday night in Belfast, defeating Dundee by 2-1.
It was the fourth match of the season between the two teams, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute (3:35) following an assist from Kendall McFaull, with David Rutherford assisting for Beauvillier to increase the lead four minutes later.
In a frenzied first period, Sullivan put the home team back in the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt provided the tie to Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured that the Giants reached the first interval in the lead, scoring their second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The home team reorganized and Bouchard rebounded with a powerful goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined efforts to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game at the end of the second period, guaranteeing victory by scoring the team's fifth goal in the middle of the last period.
The Giants, who have lost four of the last five games, will receive Milton Keynes in the next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to help hundreds of passengers escape earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller has been hailed as a hero after dying by ensuring that a plane with hundreds of passengers boarded safely.
More than 800 people have died and many remain missing after a severe earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Powerful replicas continue to haunt the region, leaving many residents buried in the debris in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing to save themselves, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post while the control tower was swaying violently at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
It remained concentrated to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then on the runway, took off safely.
He then jumped out of the control tower, before the eminent collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
Indonesian air navigation agency spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australian television channel ABC News reported.
We sent a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to evacuate him to a major hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he passed away this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“We were devastated by this news,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach thousands, referring to the country’s disaster management agency that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The balance is increasing, as there are many bodies buried in the debris that we have not yet been able to rescue," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency, said in a statement.
Waves of up to six meters devastated Palu, where a collective funeral is held on Sunday.
Commercial and military aircraft are transporting aid and supplies to the site.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute ambulances arrive with bodies.
There is no drinking water.
The mini-markets are being pillaged everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is in a race against time to help survivors, but we don’t know what we’re going to find.
The current situation is really tragic, but it could have been much worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday. According to CNN sources, he addressed the military forces on the spot and said:
"I ask you to work day and night to complete the evacuation operations.
Earlier this year, the island of Lombok in Indonesia was hit by earthquakes that killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now reports that there is a missing man after plane crash in the lagoon
The airline responsible for the plane that landed in a lagoon in Micronesia, Pacific, now reports that there is a missing man after having reported that all 47 passengers and crew had been rescued safely from the plane sinking.
In a statement, Air Niugini said it had not been able to confirm the whereabouts of a male passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The area company said it was collaborating with hospitals, researchers and local authorities to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details about the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline said six passengers remained hospitalized on Saturday, all of them with a stable clinical picture.
It is not yet known exactly what caused the fall or the exact sequence of events.
The airline and the U.S. Navy have unanimously stated that the plane failed to reach the runway and slammed into the lagoon.
Some witnesses thought the plane had come off the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane was too low.
“It was the best thing that ever happened,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and other people had managed to drag themselves with water through the waist and reach the emergency exits of the plane sinking.
He said the flight attendants had panicked and started screaming, and that he had suffered a small head injury.
According to the U.S. Navy, sailors who were working on a nearby mooring improvement facility also helped in the rescue by resorting to an inflatable boat to transport people to land before the plane sank 30 meters (100 ft) deep.
Based on data collected by the Aviation Safety Network, over the past two decades, 111 people have died in accidents with PNG registered airlines, but none involved Air Niugini.
Analyst explains the chronology of the events of the night when a woman was burned alive
The indictment concluded its allegations on Saturday in a new trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowllet, an analyst with the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for several hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He described to the jury how he used the cell phone records to reconstruct the movements of 20-year-old defendant Quintom Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chamber on the night of his death.
According to the Clarion Ledger newspaper, Rowlett claimed to have obtained location data from several mobile phones confirming that Tellis was with Chambers the night of his death, contradicting statements he had previously made.
When the data showed that his phone was with Chambers at the time he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he had not been in the city that day.
When the indictment asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in his van that night, Sanford replied that he was lying because the van was in Nashville.
Another inconsistency in Tellis' testimony pointed to the fact that he claimed to have known Chambers about two weeks ago when she died.
The cell phone records indicated that they only knew each other a week ago.
Rowlett claimed that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"You paid her off her life," Hale said.
The defense is expected to begin filing its final claims on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped the trial would begin to be reviewed by the jury at the end of the day.
The High Breed: What is conscientious hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to change the negative tone of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
Bristol’s “High Breed” group claims that hip hop has deviated from its roots of political orientation and social criticism.
They want to go back to these roots and return popularity to conscientious hip hop.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have witnessed a recent revival in the UK thanks to the intervention of other performers such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black?!
New York mistress sues couple for firing via "racist" text message
A New York mistress is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after she accidentally received a text message from her mother complaining that she was "more a black woman".
The couple denied the accusations of racism, claiming that the trial was an act of "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two, showed some fear when she discovered that the new mistress Giselle Maurice was black when she showed up for her first day at work in 2016.
“I can’t believe it...More than one,” Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent it to Giselle Maurice... twice.
According to the New York Post, when she noticed her flare, a "shameful" Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman fired Giselle Maurice alleging the poor performance of the previous African-American mistress and who was waiting for a Filipino mistress.
Giselle Maurice was paid for her only working day and sent home to Uber.
Now, Giselle Maurice is suing the couple and asking for a $350-a-day dismissal compensation for the six-month period for which she had been chosen without a contract.
"I want to show them that they can't be impunity," he told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know this is discrimination."
The couple refuted the allegations of racism, saying that dismissing Giselle was perfectly logical given that they feared they could not trust her after they offended her.
“My wife sent him something that she didn’t really want to say.
You're not racist.
We are not racist people,” Joel Plasco told the Post.
"Would your children trust in someone who has dealt ill? Even if by mistake?
Your new-born child?
I can't believe it."
Calling the process “extortion,” Plasco said his wife had been a mother only two months ago and had to deal with “a very difficult situation.”
“Will they chase someone like that?
It’s not very friendly,” added the investment banker.
As the legal process proceeds, the court of public opinion was quick to condemn the couple on social media, criticizing their behavior and reasoning.
New letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared that readers might not identify with a talking bear
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, commented: "It's hard to get into the skin of someone who reads it for the first time before it's published.
It’s really fun to get to know this now, after Paddington’s been so successful.”
He commented that his father, who worked as a BBC camera operator before being inspired by a little bear to play writing the children's book, would not have taken it to his chest if the book had been rejected, and added that the publication's 60th anniversary had a bittersweet flavor past his death.
About Paddington, who he described as "a very important member of our family," he said his father was very proud of the success achieved.
"He was a modest man and not a person given to the gabarolice," he said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was like having a successful son: we’re proud even when it’s not ours.
I think that's how I saw Paddington's success.
Despite being the fruit of his imagination, he always attributed credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on my phone.
Soon after landing, the daughter had been taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors fought in vain to save her life.
“Nad often called to say that the situation was really bad and that there was no chance of survival,” Ednan-Laperouse said.
“So Nad called and said she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
She said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my dear.
We'll be together soon.
Together.
The medications that doctors had given him to keep his heart working were slowly giving up and getting out of his system.
He had been dead for some time and all his organs were stopping.
I had to stay there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn’t scream or complain because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to hold myself.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with other passengers outside the test of what was going on.
"Nobody knew," he said.
"I've always been low-minded.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt a huge compassion for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
He knew how much he loved her.”
Women of mourning post cards on bridge to prevent suicides
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide fight to prevent others from following the same path.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted cards on a Welsh bridge with motivational messages and phone numbers that people can use to get support.
Tyler, the son of Sharon Davis, was 13 when she began suffering from depression and 18 when she committed suicide.
“I don’t want no parent to have to feel what I feel every day,” he said.
Sharon Davis, a 45-year-old resident of Lydney, said his son was a promising boss with a contagious smile.
"He was known for his smile.
Everyone said it was lighting up the room.”
However, he gave up his job before dying because he had “dived in the dark.”
In 2014, Tyler was found dead by his 11-year-old brother.
Sharon Davis said, “I’m always worried about a possible repercussion.”
Sharon Davis created the postcards "so that they know that there are people who are available to help and with whom they can talk, even if they are a friend.
Don't shut yourself up, you have to talk."
Kelly Humphreys, a longtime friend of Sharon Davis, lost Mark, her 15-year-old companion, shortly after the death of her mother-in-law.
“I didn’t say I was sad or depressed,” he said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas Day, there was a napkin, and when the kids opened the presents, you didn't even look at them."
He said his death traumatized them a lot, but it's something they have to overcome: "Destroy a family.
No one gets indifferent.
But we all have to continue to live and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake with the start of the FBI investigation
“I thought that by having similarities to what I asked for — an investigation with defined time and scope — we could be more united,” Jeff Flake said on Saturday, saying he feared the committee was “breaking down” in the face of a rooted party impasse.
Why didn't Brett Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
His reluctance is merely a temporary matter.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away. On November 6, if, as expected, the Republicans will have poor results, they will see their attempts to elect their candidate to the Supreme Court frustrated.
George W. Bush has contacted senators to pressure them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and through whom he met Ashley, Bush’s personal secretary at the time.
What happens after the FBI submits your report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not certain that Kavanaugh will get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to cast the ballot and confirm his place in the Supreme Court.
North Korea's Number of Deserters Declines During Kim's Regime
According to a South Korean lawmaker, the number of North Korean deserters to North Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un’s rise to power seven years ago.
Quoting data from South Korea’s Unification Ministry, Park Byeong-seug reported 1127 desertions last year compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China, as well as the fact that people smugglers are asking for more money, were the main factors.
Pyongyang did not make a public statement.
As a general rule, South Korean citizenship is granted to the vast majority of North Korean deserters.
Seoul reported that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee for China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters to be illegal emigrants and non-refugees, and often repatriates them.
Relations between North Korea and South Korea (technically still at war) have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the denuclearization negotiations that are on a standstill.
The talks came after a historic meeting in June between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, during which they agreed, in general, to collaborate in the creation of a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the U.S. for lack of progress.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and in these circumstances, it is impossible for us to take the first steps towards unilateral disarmament,” Ri said in a speech at the United Nations Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is hysterical and incapacitated to serve in Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the minority leader in the House, said Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, was hysterical and temperamentally incapacitated to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if a woman had behaved like this, she would soon be called hysterical," Pelosi said of his reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied all sexual abuse ties to Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both were teenagers.
Kavanaugh made a statement of emotional openness, sometimes in a shuddering and soothing voice, when talking about his family and high school years.
He also explicitly accused the Democrats of the committee, calling the allegations made against him “a grotesque and conspiratorial assassination” organized by liberals angered by Hillary Clinton having lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he believes Kavanaugh's testimony proves that he is unable to serve in the Supreme Court given his prejudiced behavior against the Democrats.
“I think he disqualified himself with his statements and the way he attacked Clinton and the Democrats,” he said.
When asked if he would try to challenge Kavanaugh's effective appointment and if the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi hesitated.
“What I can say is that if you lie to Congress or the FBI, you don’t meet the conditions to be in the Supreme Court, not even to serve in your current court,” Pelosi said.
Currently, Kavanaugh is a judge at the D.C. Circuit Court of Relations.
Pelosi added that while a Democrat, he feared Kavanaugh’s potential opinions against the Affordable Care Act (better known as Obamacare) or the Roe vs Wade case, given the reputation of being a conservative judge.
During the confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh circumvented questions about the possibility of revoking certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“This is not a time to elect someone hysterical and prejudiced to the Supreme Court and expect us to be happy with the decision,” Pelosi said.
Women need to be able to control emotions.
It's a justified diatribe, months and years of rage overflowing, and it can't unleash without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's weird, do you?"
A woman with an executive position in any company helped me immensely. She told me that she was also crying when I was angry, but she had created a technique. When I was angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, "Don't think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And it went on.
And I thought to myself... it's brilliant," continued Mrs. Steinem.
Tears are accepted when they express anger because, in a more common context, they are misinterpreted.
I perfectly remember, in an old job in an office dominated by men who were crying with inexpressible anger, being grasped by the neck by an older woman—a non-friendly manager who terrorized me a little—and literally dragged down the stairs to hear her say,
“Never let them see you cry.”
"They don't know if you're angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll be happy that they’ve been able to affect you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on her presidential nomination.
In 1987, when Gary Hart was caught in an extramarital relationship aboard a boat called Monkey Business and dropped out of the candidacy, an extremely frustrated Patricia Schroeder did not see why she could not run for president herself.
“It wasn’t a very thoughtful decision,” he told me laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates and another one was simply unnecessary.
There was someone who dubbed the situation "The Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Given his late entry, the fundraising was less than desirable and he swore that he would only enter the race if he could raise $2 million.
A battle doomed to defeat.
He found that some of his supporters would only give him $250, even though they had given $1000 to male candidates.
"Do they think I'm entitled to a discount?" he asked.
When he announced that he would not enter a formal campaign, emotions came to the top – gratitude for the people who had supported him, frustration with a system that lifts so many obstacles to fundraising and makes the message reach voters, rather than delegates, and anger against sexism – and tears to the south.
“It even seemed like she was depressed,” recalled Patricia Schroeder as she spoke of the media reaction.
“I would have thought Kleenex was my business sponsor.
What would you write in my epitaph now?
"She's crying"?
How the U.S.-China trade war could be beneficial to Beijing
The first salvage of the trade war between the U.S. and China has been daunting, and while the end of the conflict is not in sight, from the perspective of experts, the withdrawal of the two countries can be beneficial for Beijing in the long run.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired the first warning earlier this year by taxing major Chinese imports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
This week was the scene of a significant aggravation of the situation with the new tariffs affecting goods worth $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), actually taxing half of all goods shipped by China to the United States.
Beijing has always retaliated in the same currency, recently raising rates from 5 to 10 percent for US goods worth $60 billion.
China has pledged to follow in the footsteps of the U.S. and it is unlikely that the world’s second-largest economy will fluctuate in the coming times.
Making Washington back would mean succumbing to the demands, but showing a public subservience to the U.S. would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, President of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing makes good use of its truffles, the pressures imposed by the trade war with the U.S. can positively sustain China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“In fact, the fact that an untimely political decision by Washington or Beijing could result in an economic crisis in both countries is far more dangerous than observers could ever have anticipated,” said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher dedicated to the study of Asia at the Center for New American Security, a reflection group.
Foreign Minister Says Syria Is Ready for Refugees to Return
Syria says it is prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild a country devastated by more than seven long years of war.
In his speech at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem stated that the country’s conditions are improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
There are now all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country who have left due to terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people who have remained in the country are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome aid for the reconstruction of the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from the countries that sponsored the uprising.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European Cup beats the U.S. and wins the 2018 Ryder Cup with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National in the outskirts of Paris, France.
The U.S. has now accumulated six consecutive defeats on European soil since the last time they won the Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe again crowned itself victorious after the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who proved to have serious difficulties during almost the entire tournament, threw the starting tee into the water in hole 16, par 3, giving the victory to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shined in all his rounds, becoming 1 of the 4 players to get 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth lost 5&4 to the worst ranked player of the European Cup, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to England's Ian Poulter in what may have been his last Ryder Cup appearance.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia has become the most awarded European of all tournaments with 25.5 career points.
“It’s not my habit to cry, but today I couldn’t contain myself.
It's been a tough year.
I can't help but thank Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so glad we won the cup.
It was all a team effort and I’m happy to have been able to help,” said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He speaks to his compatriot Jon Rham who defeated the American golf legend, Tiger Woods, by 2&1 in singles on Sunday.
"It's impossible to describe the pride I feel for defeating Tiger Woods. I grew up watching him play," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
Unusual statistical values of one of the greatest players of all time with 14 major titles won and only beaten by Jack Nicklaus.
With the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau who had a high-calibre performance throughout the tournament, the rest of the U.S. National Team debated for coming to the fairway.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team's disappointing performance. "I'm proud of them. They fought.
This morning, we managed to put some fear on Europe.
Demos fight.
My congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players were excellent.
We will reorganize and I will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Commission to move forward.
I like a lot of these 12 players and I’m proud to be their captain.
I have to take the hat off to the other team.
They were better."
