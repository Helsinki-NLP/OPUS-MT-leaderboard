Members of the Welsh Assembly are concerned that they will be “associated with mappings”
Some charities are horrified by the recommendation to change the name of their post to “Member of the Parliament of Wales” (MWP).
This recommendation came about because of plans to change the name of the assembly to “Parliament of Wales”.
The time of the entire political spectrum is concerned that it can provoke ridicule.
One C.A. from the Labour Party said his group was worried about the rhymes with Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside of Wales: in Welsh, "twp" means "smooth", and "pwp" means an act of defecation.
The Welsh Party said its group as a whole was “not satisfied” and offered alternatives.
One of the Welsh Conservatives said his group was “unbiased” about the name change, but noted that MWP could quickly become a “mapper.”
In this context, the pronunciation of the Welsh letter "w" is similar to the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter "u".
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to change the names, noted: “The final decision on the new name of the members of the Assembly will certainly be made by the members themselves.”
The Welsh Self-Government Act of 2017 gives Wales the right to change its name.
In June, the commission published the results of the public discussion of the proposals, and the renaming of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament received broad support.
When it comes to how to call the CPA, the commission proposes to call them "members of the Welsh Parliament", i.e. WMP, but the MWP option has received the greatest public support.
Of course, the CA offer alternatives, but trying to reach an agreement could cause problems for chairman Elina Jones, who is due to file a bill of change within a few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes to the work of the assembly, including the rules for the removal of the CA and the structure of the committee system.
The CA will hold a final vote on their new name when they discuss the legislation.
Macedonians are going to vote on a referendum on changing the name of the country
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change the name of the country to “Republic of North Macedonia”.
The vote was organized with the aim of resolving a long-standing dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of their northern neighbor is a claim to the territory of Greece, and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia’s membership in the EU and NATO.
The President of Macedonia George Ivanov, who opposes holding a referendum on the change of name, said that he will ignore the results of the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, argue that a name change is simply a price that needs to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of Saint-Martin are silent, because the churches of Harlem are experiencing difficult times
“The old people with whom I spoke say that there was a bar and a church on every corner before,” says Adams.
There is no one or the other.”
He believes that the disappearance of bars can be understood:
“People are socializing in a different way.
Bars are no longer the local lounge where they regularly go.”
As for churches, Adams fears that the money from selling assets will not be enough as long as the leaders expect, and “early or later they will be where they started.”
Churches, he added, can be replaced by condominium houses, and there will be people who will not help the shrines that have remained nearby.
“The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in these houses will be white,” Adams explained, “so it will speed up the day all these churches close, because it is unlikely that the majority of those who move to condominiums will become their compatriots.”
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community Church was built in 1870, and Saint-Martin – ten years after it.
The indigenous white Methodist community left here in the 1930s.
The black community, which held the ceremonies nearby, obtained ownership of the building.
Saint-Martin moved to the black community under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, the main shopping street of Harlem. These merchants did not want to take on their blacks and underwear.
In 1939, the fire severely damaged the building, but Father Johnson's parishioners wanted to restore it and set up a carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson in Saint Martin, proudly called the carillon “the bells of the poor.”
The expert, who played the carillon in July, called it a “cultural treasure” and an “indispensable historical tool.”
This expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by black musician Dionysio A. Lind, who 18 years ago switched to a larger carillon at Riverside Church.
According to Mr. Merrivier, he was not found a replacement in Saint-Martin.
What has been happening in Saint-Martin over the last few months is a complex story about architects and contractors. Some of them have been involved by church leaders, others by the episcopal diocese.
The Council — the governing body of the parish, which consists of lay leaders — in July wrote to the diocese that concerned that the diocese “will try to pass on the expenses” of the council, while the council did not participate in the hiring of architects and contractors.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark Injured 13-Year-Old Boy Who Dived Behind California Lobsters
According to officials, on Saturday, the shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and injured him. The boy dived for lobsters in California on the day of the opening of the lobster season.
The attack took place at almost 7 a.m. near Bicon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that on Saturday morning he had already dived with friends for about half an hour when he heard that the boy was crying for help, and along with a group swam to him to get out of the water.
At first, Hammel thought it was just a catch about a caught lobster, but then realized that the boy shouted, “I’ve been bitten!
I've been eaten!"
As soon as he reached the boy, he saw that his key was completely torn.
“I shouted to everyone to get out of the water, ‘In the water a shark!’” Hammel added.
The boy was taken to the Radi Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The type of shark that carried out the attack is unknown.
Rescue Captain Larry Giles told a news briefing that a shark was spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was established that it does not belong to dangerous species of sharks.
Giles added that the victim had suffered traumatic injuries to the upper part of the body.
For the purpose of investigation and security, the authorities for 48 hours blocked access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami in Encinitas.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the British cosmetics market
Sainsbury's is going to compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams using islands with cosmetics similar to those in department stores. Working on the islands will be qualified sellers.
As part of the increased exit to the British cosmetics market worth 2.8 billion pounds (continues to grow at a time when the volume of sales of clothing and goods for the home is decreasing) as the number of other exports has increased, all islands with cosmetics will be tested in 11 markets.
Investments in cosmetics are linked to the fact that supermarkets are looking for ways to use the shelf space that was previously used for televisions, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury's said it would double its cosmetics range and offer up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing range of L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will get more space: there will be branded zones similar to those in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also updating the Boutique cosmetics range: now most of the products presented will not be tested on animals, which is increasingly demanded by young buyers.
In addition, a perfume retailer Fragrance Shop is testing its trays in two Sainsbury's stores: the first tray opened in Crawdon, North London, last week, and the second will open in Celly Oak, Birmingham, at this time.
Internet shopping and the transition to buying small volumes of food every day in small stores makes the supermarkets make extra efforts to attract visitors.
Mike Coupe, Sainsbury’s CEO, said their stores would become more like department stores, as a chain of supermarkets were trying to withstand Aldi and Lidl’s discounters with more services and dissatisfaction.
Sainsbury's opens Argos branches in hundreds of its stores, also opened a number of Habitats branches. Sainsbury's bought both networks two years ago and claim that it increased sales of food products, as well as made both networks more profitable.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to upgrade the departments of cosmetics and pharmaceuticals ended in failure.
Sainsbury's tested collaboration with Boots in the early 2000s, but it ended after a dispute over how to split income from pharmacies in supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury's sold its pharmacy business (281 pharmacies) Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
They agreed that Lloyds would help by adding an expanded range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s commercial director, said: “We’ve changed the look of our cosmetic islands to make the atmosphere more pleasant for buyers.
We have also invested in specially trained consultants who will be able to give advice.
The range of brands presented by us is designed to meet any needs, and the pleasant setting and convenient locations mean that we are now an attractive place to buy cosmetics, which is a competition to the old way of buying.”
Peter Jones 'disillusioned' by the fact that Holly Willowby got out of a deal worth <0xC2><0xA3>11 million
“Dragon League” star Peter Jones “disjoined” because TV host Holly Willowby came out of a deal with his brand of goods for life (the cost of the deal is <0xC2><0xA3>11 million sterling) to focus on new TV I & Marks contracts
Willowbi doesn’t have time for truly’s homewear and accessories brand.
The gambling business was associated with the Goop brand Guinette Peltrow.
The 37-year-old host of This Morning has announced her Instagram entry.
Holly Willowby proved Peter Jones' Dragon League star to say when at the last minute she stepped out of their lucrative life goods business to focus on new lucrative contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources report that the Dossey Jones "disgusted" when the golden girl from the TV admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of the business empire of his brother Johns in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new deals worth 1.5 million pounds.
This business was associated with the Goop brand Guinness World Records and was to double Willowbi's fortune, which is estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When 37-year-old Willowby announced on Instagram that she was going with Truly, Jones flew out of the UK to one of her vacation homes.
The source said: “Truely, no doubt, was Halli’s top priority.
It was to be her long-term future for the next few decades.
Willowbi’s decision to quit the business stunned all interested parties.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, almost on the eve of the launch.
Headquarters in Marlow is full of ready-to-sell stuff.
Experts believe the departure of the host This Morning, which is one of Britain’s highest-paid stars, could cost firms millions due to large investments in goods (from pillows and candles to clothing and household clothing) and create further delays with the shutdown.
It can also mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children, Willowbi and her husband Dan Baldwin, were close to Jones and his wife, Tara Kapp, for ten years.
Willowby and Capp created Truly in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined as chairman of the board in March.
The couple spent the holidays together, Jones owns 40 percent of the shares of Baldwin, which is engaged in television production.
Willowby will become M&S brand ambassador and replace Anthony McPartlin as I'm A Celebrity host on ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night: “We will not comment on his case.”
A tough conversation, “and then we fell in love”
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the news media for a comment that someone would consider “non-presidential” and also for a very positive attitude towards the leader of North Korea.
“Why did President Trump go on such big steps?”
Trump said, imitating the voice of the news host. —
I didn’t do anything.”
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
But negotiations on denuclearization have come to a dead end.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that North Korea does not see a “suitable response” from the United States to its first steps on the ground.
Instead, he noted, the United States continues sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Speaking at his rally, Trump was much more optimistic.
“We have a good relationship with North Korea,” he said.
We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
We have such a wonderful relationship now.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had brought positive results: the end of missile tests, the release of hostages, and the return of the remains of U.S. military personnel home.
He also defended his unusual approach when he talked about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to be Presidential, but instead of 10,000 people on the street trying to get into this battle-filled stadium, we have about 200 people standing right there,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroyed the island, hundreds of dead
In particular, after the earthquake in Lombok, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that their assistance was not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok have been affected, the national disaster has not been declared, and this is a prerequisite for international aid.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they are not seeking international help, so it’s somewhat difficult,” she said.
Although “Save the Children” gathers a team for a trip to Pal, it is not yet known whether foreign personnel will be able to work on the spot.
Mr Sutopo, a representative of the national disaster relief agency, said the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether to allow international organizations to provide assistance.
Given the fact that earthquakes are constantly occurring in Indonesia, the country remains terribly unprepared for the anger of nature.
In the province of Aceh, shelters from the tsunami have been built, but they are not typical for other coasts.
The obvious absence of a siren warning about a tsunami in Palu, although the warning was effective, probably contributed to the deaths.
Moving between the many Indonesian islands is not easy, even at the best times.
Disasters further complicate the logistics.
The medical ship, which was in Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake, will float to Pal, but will be able to reach the site of the new disaster in at least three days.
President Joko Widodo has made improving Indonesia’s infrastructure the basis of his election campaign and increased spending on roads and railways.
But the lack of funding has created problems for the administration of Mr. Joko, who plans to relocate next year.
Mr. Joko is also hampered by prolonged interfaith hostility in parts of Indonesia where members of the Muslim majority have chosen a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have been killed, tens of thousands displaced from their homes as a result of clashes between Christian and Muslim gangs in the streets using machetes, bows, arrows and other primitive weapons.
Watch: Daniel Starridge of Liverpool scores goal from the depth of the field and equalizes the account with Chelsea
Daniel Starridge saved Liverpool from a defeat by Chelsea in the Premier League with his 89th-minute goal on Saturday at London's Stamford Bridge Stadium.
Starridge got a pass from Gerdan Shachiri when he was at a distance of about 27 meters from the goal "Chelsea". At this point his team lost with an account 1-0.
He threw the ball to his left leg and charged it in the direction of the long bar.
The ball flew high above the penalty in the direction of the top right corner of the gate.
He flew over the climbing Cape Arrisabalagha and fell into the gate.
“It was just an attempt to take that position so as not to waste time. Players like Shachiri always go on the attack as much as possible, so I just tried to secure myself as much time as possible,” Starridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante approaching, and made one touch, I didn’t think about it too much and just took the ball.
Chelsea scored 1-0 after the first half, in which Belgian star Eden Azar scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The blue attacker handed the pass back to Mateo Kovacicchu, turned around the middle of the field and quickly ran for half of Liverpool.
The forger quickly played against a wall in the middle of the field.
Then he made a nice penetrating pass, which brought Azar to a penalty.
Azar overcame the defense and made a decisive blow with his left foot in the net of the long bar. The ball passed past Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will play against Naples in the group stage of the Champions League at 15:00 on Wednesday at the stadium of S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play with Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia increased to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the Indonesian agency for the elimination of the aftermath of the disasters reported on Sunday morning.
Many people remained trapped in the ruins of buildings destroyed during Friday’s earthquake by a force of 7.5 points, which caused waves of 6 meters in height, the agency’s press secretary Sutopo Purvo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, where more than 380,000 people live, was dormant with broken buildings.
Police Arrest 32-Year-Old Man on Suspicion of Murder After Woman Shot to Death
Investigations into the murder began after a woman’s body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found dead at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Museum, John Street, where a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police called for people to respond who saw or heard something.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan commented: "The investigation is now in its early stages, but I ask everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who could have taken something on the video recorder, to contact us as the information on these videos could be very important to our investigation.”
A police official confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and was found in the house.
Today in the second half of the day, friends who think they know a woman came to the crime scene to ask where she was found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing, and the police said they are currently informing the victim's closest relatives.
The taxi driver, who lives in Grayson-Museum, was just trying to get back to his apartment, but police said no one was allowed to enter and leave the house.
When he found out what had happened, he lost the gift of language.
Now the residents are told that it will be hours before they are allowed to return home.
Someone heard a policeman telling one man that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
At the scene of the crime, a woman appeared in tears.
She repeats, “It’s so terrible.”
At 2:00 p.m. two police vans were standing behind the fence, another van — in front of the fence.
Several police officers were standing behind the fence and were tracking down the apartment building.
Anyone with information is asked to write a direct message <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously call Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111 and call code 247 and the date of September 30.
The statue of Cromwell near the Parliament becomes a new monument, which will suffer from the "rewriting of history"
The removal of the statue would be a well-deserved payment for the destruction in the Taliban style of many of England's cultural and religious artifacts made by its fanatical Puritan followers.
But Cromwell’s community called Mr. Crick’s proposal “stupid” and “an attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, the head of the Cromwell Community, said: “Given the current debate over the removal of statues, it was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell near Westminster Palace would become a target.”
Icon warfare during the English Civil War was not carried out either by Cromwell himself or by his order.
It is likely that Cromwell will be undeservingly sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The great statue of Cromwell sculptor William Hamo Thornecroft is a testament to the mood of the 19th century and part of the historiography of the figure, which, in the opinion of many, is still worth venerating.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Many people probably more at the end of the 19th century than now consider Cromwell a defender of parliament from external pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether such an idea is quite accurate is the subject of ongoing historical debates.
There is no doubt that the conflict of the middle of the 17th century determined the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is one of the famous figures who represents one side of this conflict.
His achievement as a Lord Protector is also worth noting and honouring.”
Chinese Farmer Killed by Slaughter Pig to Death
According to local media reports, the farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwestern China.
The man, identified only by the name Yuan, was found dead in blood with a broken artery near a pig market in Liupanshui, Guijou province, the South China Morning Post newspaper reported on Sunday.
In Xinjin, Qinhai Province, China, on May 30, 2005, a pigmaker is going to vaccinate pigs in a pighouse.
It is reported that on Wednesday he left with his cousin from the neighbouring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his brother found him dead and saw that the door of the pigstore was open.
The brother noted that in the piggy bank there was a big cock with blood on the skewer.
A forensic examination confirmed that a 249-pound cow had killed the farmer.
“My cousin’s legs were in blood and distorted,” said a cousin of the victim named Wu, quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
A security camera footage showed that Yuan entered the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed a man did not belong to Yuanya or his cousin.
The head of the market told Evening News that when police collected evidence on the scene, the pig was locked to prevent it from attacking people.
It is reported that seven I Yuanya and the market administration are discussing compensation for his death.
Although rare, but cases of attacks of pigs on humans have been recorded before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and caused a man with critical injuries.
Ten years before that, a pig weighing 295 kg kept a Welsh farmer pressed on a tractor until the farmer’s wife scared the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon ate his own pigs in 2012, one farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can become a “trigger.”
“They’re just playful.
They're like kids, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to treat them with due respect,” he said.
Remains of Hurricane Rose Will Bring Extensive Floods to Southwestern United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening, moving over cooler waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
In the coming days, however, Rose will bring rain with flooding to the north of Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
Rose had a wind speed of 137 km/h (this is a Category 1 hurricane) at 5 a.m. Eastern Time on Sunday and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rose is expected to go to the North on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a wetland begins to form over the Pacific Ocean, which moves east to the west coast of the United States. When on Monday Rose approaches the peninsula of Lower California in the form of a tropical storm, it will begin to push a strong tropical storm.
On Monday, the rose will bring up to 25.4 cm of rain in some parts of Mexico.
Next, in the coming days, tropical humidity, which interacts with the impending debris, will create strong spills in the southwest.
In this area from 2.54 to 10.2 cm of rain will cause dangerous floods, waste streams and the possibility of displacement in the desert.
Strong tropical humidity will lead to an increase in precipitation by places of 5–7.6 cm per hour, especially in some parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
5–10.2 cm of rain is expected in some parts of the southwest, especially in large areas of Arizona.
Flood floods are possible with rapid deterioration of conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rains.
We strongly advise not to go to the desert on foot, because tropical rainforests are possible.
Heavy rain can make the canyons turbulent rivers, and storms will bring here whirlwinds and dust storms.
Approximation of wetlands will cause places of heavy rain in some parts of the northern coast of California.
The amount of rainfall can exceed 1.27 cm, which can cause poor flows of garbage and slippery roads.
It will be the first in the region in the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical showers will begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and Monday morning, and in the evening on Monday and Tuesday the rains will become more extensive.
Heavy rain will go over the For Corners from Tuesday to Wednesday.
In October, there may be intense temperature fluctuations throughout the United States, as the Arctic gets colder, but the tropics remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to sharp temperature fluctuations over short distances.
On Sunday, we will be able to observe a great example of sharp temperature fluctuations in the central part of the United States.
This is an almost 7-degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and De Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the summer heat will try to come back and spread.
It is expected that in a significant area of the center and east of the United States will be warm by October, and the temperature from the southern plains to some parts of the northeast will be 27 degrees Celsius.
The temperature in New York City can reach 27 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, which is about 12 degrees Celsius above the average temperature.
According to our long-term weather forecast, there is a high probability of exceeding average temperatures in the eastern part of the United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched the hearing in Brett Kavanaugh’s case
On Thursday, more than 20 million people on six television networks watched the exciting testimonies of the candidate for the post of Supreme Court Justice Brett Cavano and Christine Blaise Ford, a woman who accused him of sexual violence in the 1980s.
The political confrontation continued, the channels interrupted planned programs to report Friday’s latest news: a deal prepared by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to conduct a one-week FBI investigation into the indictment.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh was smothering her drunk and trying to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in his emotional testimonies that he was 100 percent sure it wasn’t.
It is quite likely that on Friday, more than 20.4 million people watched this, as reported by the research company Nielsen.
The company counted the average audience of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Unable to immediately get the numbers on other networks that also showed the listening, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Also, Nielsen usually has problems measuring the number of people who watch TV in the office.
For comparison, such a sized audience is similar to an audience watching a play-off game or an Oscar award.
Fox News Channel, whose show leaders strongly supported Kavanaugh’s appointment, was the leader among all channels during the day-long audition, with an average viewership of 5.69 million, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake became the central character of Friday's drama.
The office of this moderate Republican published a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh. After that on Friday morning, CNN and CBS cameras recorded how protesters shouted at Flake when he was trying to go on the elevator to the court hearing.
He stood with his eyes down for a few minutes, during which he was being cheered that was broadcast live on CNN.
“I’m standing right in front of you,” said one woman.
You think he's telling the truth to the country?
They said to him, “You have power, and many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office had published a statement and, before the elevator closed, added that he would say more at the hearing of the committee.
All cable and broadband channels were broadcast live hours later, when the Judiciary Committee was to vote on Kavanaugh's candidacy for a full Senate vote.
Flake said he would only do so if he knew the FBI would consider charges against the candidate next week, which is demanded by a democratic minority.
Flake was partially convinced by talks with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Kuns.
After a conversation with Kuns, and then with a few more senators, Flake made the decision.
Flake's choice was influential, as it was obvious that Republicans would not have the votes to nominate Cavano without an investigation.
President Trump has initiated an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of “games in politics” around Brexit <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of “games in politics” with Britain’s future and undermining national interests.
On September 29, 2018, Prime Minister Theresa May of the United Kingdom came to a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom.
In another interview, which came alongside Teresa's interview on the front page of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson criticized her so-called Chequers Brexit plan, saying that she would offer Britain and the EU a "one-off duty".
Who Shot Wade Sims: Police Arrest Dayton Simpson on Suspected Death of University of Louisiana Player <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Police arrested the suspect in the shooting that led to the death of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from the University of Louisiana.
20-year-old Dayton Simpson was arrested and sent to jail on charges of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge police department said.
Authorities posted a video of the dispute between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims had lost his glasses during the fight.
According to a report by affiliated CBS TV channel WAFB, police removed the glasses from the crime scene and noted that they found Simpson's DNA on them.
After questioning Simpson, the police reported that he had confessed to shooting Wade.
According to the lawyer, he was awarded a bail of $350,000.
The Coroner's office of East Baton Rouge on Friday released a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The Department expresses its gratitude to the Louisiana State Police Refugee Search Unit, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, the Southern University Police, and local citizens for assisting in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Sports Director of the University of Louisiana, Joe Alleva, thanked the local law enforcement authorities for “the old-fashionedness and the aspiration for justice.”
Sam was 20 years old.
Forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the University of Louisiana.
Last season, his average score was 5.6 points and 2.6 selections.
On Friday morning, University of Louisiana basketball coach Will Wade said the team was “destroyed” and “shocked” by Wade’s death.
“That’s what worries you all the time,” Wade said.
Volcano releases ash to Mexico
The ash, which ejects the volcano Popocatepetl, has reached the southern areas of the capital, Mexico.
The National Center for Natural Disasters on Saturday called on Mexicans to stay away from the volcano, as the crater began activity and recorded 183 emissions of gas and ash in 24 hours.
The center monitored numerous noises and shocks.
In the photo on social networks you can see thin layers of ash on the windshield of cars in the vicinity of Mexico, such as Chochimilco.
Geophysicists have noticed an increase in the activity of the volcano, located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital, after a 7.1 magnitude earthquake in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clashed with Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the vote for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protesters who advocated independence clashed with a special police unit. Thousands of people joined the demonstrations each year to mark the first anniversary of the protesters' vote.
A proseparatist group in masks, which was held by special agents, threw them with eggs and powder paint, which created dark clouds of dust on the streets, which are usually full of tourists.
The clashes took place and later that day, the police used sticks to deter aggression.
A few hours later, a group of independence supporters who chanted, “We will not forget, we will not forgive!” came across supporters of the country’s preservation, who shouted, “Long live Spain!”
According to the local press, fourteen people were assisted with the lung injuries they received during the protests.
A year after the referendum on October 1, which was declared illegal by Madrid, but marked by Catalan separatists, tensions in the region, which is seeking independence, remain high.
Voters mostly voted for independence, but the turnout was low, as the majority of those who opposed the partition boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year as a result of police efforts to stop voting at polling stations across the region.
The independence groups spent the night on Friday in tents to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcissus Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who took part in a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer has hope that Catalonia can gain independence.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
“I watched my parents cry out for the joy they can vote, but now we’re in a blind spot,” he said.
Despite the vital but very difficult victory in the regional elections in December last year, the Catalan parties, who are in favour of independence, have not been able to keep the momentum of this year’s pulse in the hands of their supporters, because many of their most famous leaders are in a voluntary or voluntary bid.
Hoan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who pulled out a protest to support the police on the phone, said the conflict was provoked by politicians on both sides.
“The tension is getting worse,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Hunkeras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in the investigative insulation since the end of last year, announced that he will vote for the European Parliament next year.
“The candidate’s status in the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and repression that we see from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men Arrested After Car Crashes Into House
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after the car entered a house in Londonderry on several occasions.
The incident took place at Ballinagard-Kresent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m. British Standard Time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings noted that the gate and the house itself were damaged.
It is possible that at some point the car was shot from an arballet.
Menghi's strike provided Livingstone with a 1-0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal in the "Livingstone" team became the winner
Elevated in the class of "Livingstone" stunned the Rangers and brought Steven Gerrard a second defeat of 18 games as the manager of the club "Ibrox".
Dolly Menge's blow proved decisive: Gary Holt's team rose to one level per second from the Hibernian.
Gerrard's team has not won any Premier League exits this season and will play next Sunday with the leaders of the Harts, from whom she is behind by eight points.
Prior to this on Thursday, the Rangers will host “Rapid Vienna” within the framework of the Europa League.
Meanwhile, Livingstone continues its invincible move to six games in the division, and head coach Holt has not yet suffered a defeat after replacing Kenny Miller last month.
"Livingstone" misses the chances that ruthless guests offer.
Holt's team had to be ahead long before they scored, because their straightness creates the Rangers with all sorts of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through the defense, but made a blow along the gate, then Alan Litgow broke through the gate after pushing and taking a blow by Craig Halkett along the gate, which he made a head.
The owners were satisfied with the fact that they allowed Rangers to play in front of them, while they knew that they could cause problems to guests from the standard settings.
That’s how the decisive goal was scored.
The Rangers missed a free kick, and the Livingston made the opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson engaged Meng, who took the ball and scored from the center of the penalty.
Prior to this stage, the Rangers dominated possession of the ball, but the defense of the hosts of the field proved unbreakable for them and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was mostly not worried.
This trend continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos managed to strike in the direction of Kelly.
Scott Pittman's kick was kicked by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor. Litgow was kicked over the gate in another standard combination of Livingston.
The navies constantly flew into the penalty box of Livingston and were constantly neutralized, and two applications for the penalty — after Halkett's attack on Glenn Middleton, who was replaced, and for the game by hand — were rejected.
The phenomenon of "Livingstone": analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal game and the result of Livingston.
Everyone to one played perfectly, they continued to exceed expectations on this upward trajectory.
Their playing style and composition hardly changed after returning to the highest level, but should be given proper to Holt for the way he mobilized the team after his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett played grandiosely, organized the defense very well, and Menga forced Connor Goldson and Joe Warrall to be constantly vigilant.
The Rangers, however, had no inspiration.
They used to play very well under Gerrard, but now they do not reach those standards.
They didn’t have the last ball — they only broke the field’s defenders once — and it was a wake-up call for the Rangers, who were in the middle of the table.
Erdogan was unequivocally accepted in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin, a smile and a blue sky were seen.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
There have been some disputes between them on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
For security reasons, the police did not allow 25,000 people to gather in front of the mosque, but many supporters of the president still appeared nearby to see it.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, including many Kurds, have also made themselves heard. They condemn Erdogan’s policies and the decision of the German government to invite him to the country.
Bilateral protests indicate the ambiguity of the guest, whom some German Turks called a hero, and others a dictator.
Depford Road Accident: Bicyclist Killed in Car Accident
A cyclist was killed in a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred at the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street on a bustling road in the Deptford area of the city's southeast at about 10:15 a.m. British standard time.
The driver stopped the car, and paramedics arrived at the scene, but the man died on the spot.
The accident occurred a few months after another cyclist died after the driver fled the scene of the adventure on Childers Street, about 1.6 km from the Saturday crash.
London police have said they are working to identify the man’s face to inform his closest relatives.
The passage is forbidden and the routes of buses have been changed, motorists are advised to avoid this zone.
Long-Larty Prison: Six Inmates Injured in riots
Six employees of the prison were injured as a result of riots in the male prison of a strict regime, the prison administration reported.
The riots in Her Majesty's Long-Lartin prison in Worcestershire began at approximately 9:30 p.m. at British standard time on Sunday and are still ongoing.
To stop the unrest, initiated by eight prisoners and localized in one wing, a special unit "Tornado" was called.
The officers were given medical assistance in connection with the mild facial injuries received at the scene of the incident.
A spokesman for the prison service commented: “In order to resolve the incident that is ongoing in Her Majesty’s Long-Lartin prison, specially trained prison personnel have been recruited.
Six of the staff members received medical assistance in connection with the injuries.
“We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and make it clear that those responsible will be sent to the police and their time behind bars may be extended.”
Her Majesty Long-Lartin prison has more than 500 inmates, among them the most dangerous offenders in the country.
In June, it was reported that the head of the prison was sent to hospital treatment after the attack of the prisoner.
In October last year, a special police unit was called to the prison to stop serious riots, during which prisoners were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rose threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with flooding (dry areas it may benefit)
Tropical depression rarely hits Arizona, but it can happen early next week, as the remnants of Hurricane Rose head across the desert’s southwest, creating a risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings on Monday and Tuesday in the territory from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff and Las Vegas.
Rosa is expected to go straight through the Phoenix on Tuesday, and in the evening there will be rain on Monday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted on Twitter that only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of a tropical storm or depression within 200 miles (322 km) of Phoenix since 1950.
and Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles (64.4 km) of the Arizona border.
According to the latest forecasts of the National Hurricane Center, the area of Mogollon-Rome in Arizona is expected to be from 5.08 to 10.16 cm, and places up to 15.24 cm of precipitation.
Other areas of the southwestern desert, including the central part of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to receive from 2.54 to 5.08 cm of precipitation, with places of up to 10.16 cm.
Where there is no risk of flooding, Rose’s rain can be a blessing as the region suffers from drought.
While flooding is a very serious problem, some of these floods are likely to be useful, as the southwest is currently experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. drought monitoring center, just over 40 percent of Arizona’s territory suffers from at least extreme drought, which is the second highest category of drought, according to weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa's path leads to shifts on the Mexican peninsula of Lower California.
Rose, still in the power of a hurricane on Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 137 km/h, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves north at a speed of 19.3 km/h.
The storm encounters cooler water in the Pacific Ocean and therefore weakens.
Thus, it is expected that with the force of a tropical storm in the day or in the evening, a hurricane Monday will cause a shift in Mexico.
The amount of rainfall in some parts of Mexico can be significant, which creates a significant risk of flooding.
“It is expected that the total amount of precipitation from Lower California to northwestern Sonora will range from 7.62 to 15.24 cm, with places possible up to 25.4 cm,” — reports weather.com.
Next, Rosa will go north through Mexico as a tropical storm, reach the Arizona border early in the morning as a tropical depression, which will go further through Arizona, and late in the evening will reach southern Utah on Tuesday.
“The main danger that is expected from Rose or her remains is very heavy rains in Southern California, northwestern Sonora, and in the southwestern part of the American desert,” the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
It is expected that these rains will lead to life-threatening floods and floods of waste in the deserts, as well as landslides in the mountainous terrain.
Attack in Midsomer-Norton: Arrest of Four Persons Who Attempted to Kill
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy with a knife wound was found in Somerset.
The injured teenager was found in the Exxelcior-Terras area of Midsomer-Norton at about 04:00 British standard time on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital, where he remains in stable condition.
The 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and 20-year-old man were arrested at night in the Radstok area, police said in Avon and Somerset.
The police are asked to respond to anyone who may have any video of these events on the phone.
Trump Says Cavano 'Tolerated Madness and Anger' by Democratic Party
“The vote for Judge Cavano is a vote against the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Willingu, West Virginia.
Trump said that Cavano “suffered the stupidity and anger” of the Democratic Party throughout the process of prosecuting.
Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress on Thursday, unequivocally and emotionally denying the accusations of Christine Blaise Ford that he committed sexual assault on her a few decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on the charges that she had been making.
On Saturday, the president said that on that day “the American people saw the brilliance, character and courage” of Cavano.
“The vote for Judge Cavano is the vote for one of the most accomplished lawyers of our time, a lawyer with impeccable experience of the public service,” he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president briefly recalled the appointment of Kavanaugh when he spoke of the importance of the appearance of Republicans in the midterm elections.
“In five weeks, there will be one of the most important choices in our lives.
“I don’t run, but I really run,” he said.
That’s why I’m fighting for great candidates everywhere.”
Trump claimed that the Democrats’ mission was to “resist and hinder.”
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Cavano’s candidacy is expected to take place no later than Friday, an assistant to one of the Republican leaders told CNN.
Hundreds of people died from earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, the number of victims is increasing
At least 384 people have died, many of them stranded in the ocean when giant waves hit the beach as a result of an intense earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people rested at a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves up to six meters (18 feet) high in the twilight crashed over the coast, killing many to death and destroying everything on their way.
The tsunami occurred after the earthquake with a force of 7.5 points.
"When the tsunami threatened yesterday, people were still doing their business on the beach and did not immediately start to flee, and they became victims," Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a representative of the Indonesian agency for the elimination of the consequences, said at a briefing in Jakarta.
“It wasn’t just a tsunami, it was moving cars, trees, houses, it was hitting everything on land,” Nugroho said, adding that before hitting the coastline, the tsunami passed through the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 mph).
To escape the tsunami, some people climbed trees and survived, he added.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
On the aerial photographs published by the agency on the elimination of the consequences of the disasters, it can be seen that many buildings and shops were destroyed, bridges were overturned and destroyed, and the mosque surrounded by water.
Shots in the coastal city continued on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes were felt in the area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technologies (BPPT) said the energy released as a result of Friday’s strong earthquake was 200 times greater than the energy of an atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographic location of the city, which is at the end of a long, narrow bay, could contribute to the strength of the tsunami, the agency said.
Nugroho called the damage “large-scale” and noted that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels were destroyed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found under the wreckage of the buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho noted that casualties and damage could be greater than 300 km (190 miles) along the coastline north of Palu in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
“The lines of communication were completely damaged and we did not receive any information from Donggala,” Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there, according to a statement from the Red Cross, as well as adding that its staff and volunteers had gone to the affected areas.
“It’s already a tragedy, but it can get much bigger,” the statement said.
On Saturday, the agency received widespread criticism for not reporting that the tsunami hit Pal, although officials said the waves had arrived at the time indicated in the warning.
On the amateur footage that people shared on social media, you can see a man on the upper floor of the house shouting crazy warnings about the approaching tsunami to people on the street under the building.
After a few minutes, the wall of water slammed into the shore, taking with it buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately verify the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a serious shutdown of electricity, which disrupted the connection around Pal, making it difficult to coordinate rescue actions.
Military personnel began sending cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuated people are still in dire need of food and other necessities.
The city’s airport was opened only for assistance, and it will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was due to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths from the tsunami in Indonesia exceeds 800.
It's very bad.
World Vision employees from Donggala safely arrived in the city of Palu, where they hide in tarpaulin tents installed in the backyard of their office, but on the way they saw scenes of devastation, Mr. Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of ruined houses,” he shared.
It's very bad.
Even when aid groups began decisive action to eliminate the consequences of the disaster, some complained that foreign humanitarian aid workers with extensive experience were not allowed to travel to Pal.
According to Indonesian rules, the financing, supply and provision of personnel from abroad can only begin if the place of disaster is declared a zone of national disaster.
This hasn't happened yet.
“This is still a disaster at the province level,” said Aulia Arriani, a representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
As soon as the government says, “Okay, this is a national disaster,” we will be able to accept international aid, but this status has not yet been granted.”
The second night, after the Friday earthquake and tsunami, fell on Pala, and friends and families of those who had not yet been found, still hoped that the appearance of their loved ones would be a miracle that will adorn these dark tales of natural disasters.
On Saturday, the little boy was taken out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers found a woman who had been lying under a rock for two days with her mother's body nearby.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, trained two missing paragliders to participate in the Asian Games that took place earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other paragliders who got trapped in the Roa Roa hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his disciples.
“As a senior in paragliding, I have my emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Hendon tells how a few hours after the news of the destruction of the Roa Roa hotel, which spread among the paragliding community, he desperately sent a message on WhatsApp to Pal's rivals who took part in the beach festival.
However, his messages were marked with only one gray tick, and not with a double blue tick.
“I think that means that the messages have not been delivered,” he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 while filling an ATM in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from an employee of Brink, who refueled an ATM at Newport on the Levee, Newport Police Department news reports.
The driver of the car emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to add more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the news.
While he was busy, another man “runned back to the Brink employee” and stole a bag of money destined for refilling.
Witnesses noted several suspects who had fled the scene of the crime, according to the news, but the police did not specify the number of participants in the incident.
Anyone who has information about these people should contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes his name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
On Saturday, announcing the change on Twitter, he wrote, “Previously officially known as Kanye West.”
The 41-year-old West had been called Ye for some time, and he used this abbreviation as the title for his album, released in June.
The change took place on the eve of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album Yandhi.
On the show, he replaces singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her participation for "emotional reasons," the show's author said.
This is not just an abbreviation of the current professional name, the West has previously said that this word has a religious meaning for him.
“I believe that ‘yes’ is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,” West said earlier this year, discussing the name of his album with radio host Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
Kanye, which means “one,” was shortened to simply Yes — it is simply a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.”
Kanye is one of several famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs, formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, announced this year that he had chosen the names Love and Brass Love.
West’s former colleague, Jay-Z, also experimented with deficiencies and capital letters.
Mexican President Andrés Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador vows not to use the army against civilians
The newly elected President of Mexico Andrés Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has promised never to use the army against civilians. Soon the country will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the bloodshed over the students.
On Saturday in Tlatelolco Square, L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador promised “never to use the army to suppress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, the military shelled a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing about 300 people. At that time, leftist student movements began to be founded throughout Latin America.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to those who are studying, and to open more free state universities.
He pointed out that unemployment and the lack of opportunities for education lead young people to criminal groups.
The U.S. should double funding in the field of artificial intelligence
As China is increasing its activity in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on research in the field, according to an investor and practitioner in the field of AI Kai-Fu Li, who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These comments were made after various parts of the U.S. government made statements about AI, although the U.S. does not have a formal AI strategy at all.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: it aims to become the No. 1 for AI innovation by 2030.
“The dual budget for AI research would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the U.S., and we are preparing for the next breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
Doubling funding could double the likelihood that the next major AI achievement will be made in the U.S., Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book “The AI Powers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of the Sinovation Ventures Foundation, which invested in Face<0x2B><0x2B>, one of China’s most famous companies.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie-Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that won the best American player in Otello, and was later the CEO of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese subsidiary Google.
Lee noted previous competitions with technologies conducted by the U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), and asked when they would be next to help identify the next prospective participants.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win state grants, Lee said.
“It’s not China taking away academic leaders, it’s corporations,” he said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have been hiring lights from universities in recent years to work on AI.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policy may also help the U.S. increase efforts in the field of AI.
“I think the Green Card should be automatically offered to AI science candidates,” he said.
The State Council of China published its Plan for the Development of Artificial Intelligence of the New Generation in July 2017.
The National Foundation of Natural Sciences of China provides funding to individuals working in academic institutions, similar to how the National Science Foundation and other U.S. government organizations donate money to U.S. researchers, while the quality of academic work in Kyiv is low.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense created a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which aims to attract industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the creation of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
Also this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in the AI Next initiative.
As far as the National Science Foundation is concerned, it is now investing more than $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislature, which sought to set up a Commission on the National Security of Artificial Intelligence, has not taken any steps for several months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on changing the name of the country
The people of Macedonia on Sunday voted in a referendum on whether to change the name of the country to “Republic of North Macedonia”, which will allow to resolve a long-standing dispute with Greece, which blocked Macedonia’s possibility of membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of the northern neighbor is a claim to its territory, and has vetoed Macedonia’s accession to NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments signed an agreement on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents of the agreement claim that this change will undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President George Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and due to the boycott campaign, doubts arise as to whether the turnout of voters will reach a minimum of 50%, which will allow the referendum to be considered valid.
The question in the ballot in the referendum reads as follows: “Do you support NATO and EU membership on condition that an agreement with Greece is accepted?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, argue that this is the price that Macedonia, one of the countries that formed after the collapse of Yugoslavia, should pay for joining bodies such as the EU and NATO.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that it can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote does not carry any legal obligations, enough members of parliament have said they will support it to make it decisive.
It will take two-thirds of the vote in parliament to change the name.
The State Electoral Commission stated that no reports of violations were received by 13:00.
However, the turnout was only 16% compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters threw their ballots into the polls.
“I came to vote for my children, our place in Europe,” said 62-year-old Gozoe Tanevski in the capital Skopje.
On September 30, 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia, the Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko gave their vote in a referendum on the change of the name of the country, which will open the way for NATO and European integration.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of tents organized by those who will boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to come there with our heads proudly raised, not through the official door,” Kavardarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of the European-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev believes that NATO membership will bring a lot of necessary investment to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20%.
“I believe that the overwhelming majority will vote in favour, because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after the vote.
He said the “yes” result would be a confirmation of their future.
According to a poll published last Monday by the Institute of Political Studies of Macedonia, 30 to 43% of voters will participate in the referendum, which is below the required turnout.
According to another survey conducted by the Macedonian TV channel Telma, on Sunday, 57% of respondents plan to vote.
Seventy percent said they would vote for it.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the application must be 50% plus one vote.
The defeat in the referendum will be the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since its inception in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passes all defenses of Brighton and scores goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling went through the defense of Brighton and brought Manchester City a 2-0 victory on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero’s goal in the 65th minute of the match looked ridiculously simple.
The Argentine striker received a pass in the center of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between the three defenders of Brighton and found himself in an open field.
Then Aguero realized that he was surrounded by four greens.
He bypassed one defender, then ran a few more on the edge of the penalty "Brighton".
He then made a left pass after seeing Sterling.
The English forward made the first touch on the penalty shootout to give the ball back to Aguero, who with his right push launched it into the right side of the gate, defeating Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan.
“Aguero has some problems with his legs,” City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We agreed that he would play 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky to have scored a goal at this point.”
But Sterling provided the initial lead of the sky-blue in this Premier League match.
This goal took place in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep in the territory of Brighton.
He sent a beautiful penetrating pass along the left flank of Leroy Sane.
Leroy made a few touches and then made Sterling's pass in the direction of the long bar.
Forward of the sky-blue threw the ball at the gate just before sliding beyond.
City will meet Hoffenheim in the group stage of the Champions League at 12:55 on Tuesday at Rein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Zinsheim, Germany.
Chercer wants to take off the glasses in "Rokis"
Since the Washington Nashionals left the play-offs, there were no significant reasons to wait for another start.
But prone to rivalry, Shercer hopes to go to the Pitcher hill on Sunday in a game against Colorado Rokis, provided that Rokis will still have trouble with the Liujin to go to play-off. Now Rokis for one game ahead.
The Rockies have at least a wildcard for a 5-2 victory over the Nashionals on Friday night, but still seek to secure the title of the first division.
“Despite the fact that we’re playing for nothing, at least we’ll be able to leave the ball knowing how the spectators are doing here in Denver and the other team will probably play at the highest level I’ve seen in all this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to take part in this contest?
The Nashionals are yet to announce who will be the starting pitcher on Sunday, but it is reported that they are inclined to say that it will be Scherzer.
Shercer, for whom it will be his 34th start, held a pitching session on Thursday and can play on Sunday, his usual weekend.
Washington's right has a score of 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump rallies in West Virginia <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The president briefly recalled the situation around his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, when he spoke about the importance of the presence of Republican supporters in the midterm elections.
“Everything we have done will be put on the map in November.
In five weeks, there will be one of the most important choices in our lives.
“It’s one of the big, big ones — I don’t run, but I really run, so I’m fighting for great candidates wherever I can,” he said.
Trump continued, “You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see that it’s happening right now.
And they're firmly set to return power, using any means, you see stupidity, sleazyness.
They don’t care who suffers from them, who needs to go through to get power and control, they want power and control, we’re not going to give them that.”
The democrats’ mission, he said, is “to resist and hinder”.
“And you’ve seen that over the last four days,” he said, calling Democrats “evil and ugly, disgusting and lying.”
He mentioned the Senate Judiciary Committee, naming Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein by name, which provoked the audience to loud cries of discontent.
“Do you remember her answer?
You gave me a document?
E-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e
No, uh, no, I’m waiting — it was really a bad body language — the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
The Labour Party is no longer a broad church.
It is intolerant of those who express their opinion.
When momentum activists in my local party voted to condemn me, it almost didn’t come as a surprise.
After all, I am the last of those Labour Members who have been told that they are not happy, and all this because we are expressing our opinion.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, stood almost the same way because she was resolutely opposed to anti-Semitism.
I was convicted for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
As for the importance of a responsible economic policy, of national security, of Europe, these issues are ironically similar to those on which Jeremy disagreed with the previous leaders.
The report on the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said: “We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
Most of the Friday evening meetings of the General Committee during my eight years as a local member of Parliament from the Labour Party were just that.
Unfortunately, today many meetings have a completely different tone, and the promise of a “more benevolent, more soft” policy has long been forgotten, if it has ever been implemented.
It is becoming increasingly obvious that the Labour Party does not allow excellent views and each opinion is assessed from the standpoint of whether it is acceptable to the leadership of the party.
It started soon after Jeremy became a leader. My colleagues, with whom I had previously thought I had similar political views, started to expect me to turn 180 degrees and accept a position that I would not have been able to accept. I would never have agreed to.
Whenever I speak in public — and it doesn’t matter what I say — it follows a tyranny of attacks on social networks with calls for revocation, condemnation of the center’s politics, I’m told that I shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
And it’s not just my experience.
I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments that are directed at me are usually political.
I am fascinated by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face daily streams of sexist or racist attacks, but never give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is that levels of abuse have become the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should raise a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer such a broad church, and with every movement of “distrust” or change in the rules of selection the party narrows.
Over the past two years, I have received a lot of advice. I was urged not to speak out, not to speak out so loudly that “everything was fine with me.”
That’s not why I’m in politics.
I joined the workers 32 years ago as a schoolboy, because the lack of attention on the part of the Tetcher government, my middle school class literally collapsed, since then I have been striving to improve the quality of public services for those who need them most.
I have never concealed my politics, including in the last election, of course.
No one in Nottingham East was confused by my political views and disagreements with the current leadership.
For those who contributed to Friday’s events, I want to say only one thing: in terms of when a country steps towards a Brexit that will harm households, businesses and government services, I don’t understand the desire of a coupler to spend time and energy on my loyalty.
In fact, I have another message, but not for Nottingham's "Momentum", but for my voters, as members of the Labour Party, neither: I'm proud to serve you, and I promise you that I'll do my best to make sure that I don't have any threats to call me back and I'm not a cop.

"Air" 38 - 17 "Melrose": undefeated "Air" climbs up
The last two attempts may have slightly distorted the final result, but without a doubt, Ayr deserved a triumph in today’s great entertainment match of the Scottish Premiership.
Now they're leading the table, it's the only unbeaten team out of ten.
Ultimately, the excellent defense and improved ability to take advantage of the chances gives the owner and coach Peter Merci the full right to be satisfied.
“So far we have been testing our games and we are still undefeated, so I have to be satisfied,” he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose commented: "I'm giving up the right Air, they've used the odds better than us."
Grant Anderson's attempt at the 14th minute, implemented by Frasier Climo, took the Air forward, but the yellow card for the Scottish captain Rory Hughes, published by Verriors, allowed the Melbourous to show the numbers, and Jason Baggott to show the numbers.
Klimo reinforced the leadership of "Air" with a penalty and just before the break made and implemented a solo attempt, which gave an account 17-5 in favor of "Air"
But Melrose started well in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, implemented by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
Then there was a long delay due to the serious injury of Ruarid Knott, who was taken out of the field on the carriers, and from the restart "Air" broke out forward with the help of Stafford McDowell's attempt, which was implemented by Klimo.
Captain Air Blair Macferson then had a yellow card, and again Melrose forced another player to pay for Bruce Colvin's unrealized attempt under heated pressure.
The owners returned, however, when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for intercepting Klimo without the ball from the penalty line, Macferson made a tachdown behind the Ayr mill.
Klimo realized the attempt he made almost every time after the restart, after which Kyle Rowe received a punch in the box from David Armstrong and sent the flanker Gregor Henry on the fifth attempt of the hosts team.
It looks like the star of the series "Still a Game" is set for a new career in the restaurant sector
It seems that the star of the series "Still a Game" Ford Kiran is set for a new career in the field of hospitality. Such a conclusion can be made after it became known that he is the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC television series, for which he writes and in which he is filmed with longtime comedy partner Greg Hemfield.
The duet announced that the upcoming ninth series would be the last in the series, and it seems that Kirnan is planning a life after Craigleng.
According to the official record, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source in the Scottish Sun suggested that Kirnan wanted to enter Glasgow's "bright restaurant business."
“Our Sea”: Inland Bolivia hopes that the court will open its way to the Pacific Ocean
The Marines patrol the armed headquarters of the Navy in La Paz.
Public buildings are hanging an ocean-blue flag.
Sea bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are painted with the motto: “The sea is right.
We have to bring him back.”
In Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, there is still a memory of the loss of the coastline, which left Chile in the bloody conflict of the 19th century due to natural resources, and there is a desire to swim again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are now arguably the strongest in recent decades, as Bolivia awaits an international court ruling on October 1st after five years of hearing the case.
“Bolivia has a momentum, a spirit of unity and peace, and, of course, it expects a positive result,” said Roberto Calsadia, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will observe the announcement of the decision of the ICTY on large screens across the country. They hope that the tribunal in The Hague will make a decision in favor of Bolivia, that after decades of extradition of the Moroccans, Chile will force the talks to overnegotiate.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who faced opposition to his re-election next year, is also putting great hopes on a decision that will be announced on Monday.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to make a decision in favor of Bolivia, and if this happens, little will change.
The UN body, based in the Netherlands, has no authority to assign Chilean territory and has noted that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the ICTY’s decision, taken only six months after the final arguments were made, indicates that the case was “not complicated,” said Pas Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
The case of Bolivia has not progressed, the last four years could have contributed to the retreat.
“The question of access to the sea was used by the current Bolivian administration,” Zarate said.
The military rhetoric of Morales exploded the remains of Chilean benevolence, she assumed.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the dialogue at some point, but after that it will be very difficult to hold discussions.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltze, the representative of Bolivia in The Hague, disagreed that the court’s decision was unusually fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will have an “extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile and a chance to end 139 years of disagreements by gaining mutual benefit,” he said.
Calsadius also denied that Morales, still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, had used the maritime issue as a political bloc.
“Palestine will never give up its right of access to the Pacific,” he added.
This decision is an opportunity to see that we have to leave the past behind.”
North Korea Says There Will Be No Nuclear Disarmament If It Cannot Trust The U.S.
North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never give up its nuclear weapons before it can trust Washington for the first time.
Ri made a speech at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to deliver on the promises made during the summit in Singapore by the leaders of rival countries.
His comments emerged when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of relaunching nuclear diplomacy, which went into a deadlock more than three months after a Singapore summit with Kim Jong-un.
Ri says the belief that the continuation of sanctions and against the U.S. declaration of the end of the Korean War will one day put North Korea on its knees is an “unrealistic dream.”
Washington is afraid to accept the declaration before Pyongyang takes significant steps to disarm.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about the abandonment of its arsenal, which the country probably sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
At Paris fashion shows presented the latest trend of massive headwear, which is already heading on the main streets of your city
Whether you want to enlarge your hat collection or completely hide from the sun, you’ve found what you need.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown demonstrated a series of eccentric oversize headwear from the spring-summer 2019 collection on the podiums of the brilliant Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats have filled Instagram this summer, and the named designers have already sent their dizzying creations beyond the podium.
Valentino stood out with an extravagant beige hat with wide decorated feather fields that covered the heads of models.
Among other oversize accessories are decorated with gemstones of cod, chaplain hat and even pineapple hat, but they are not to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also demonstrated a range of original masks — very early in front of Halloween.
Many of these colorful masks had sewn lips and more reminiscent of Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One creature resembled an underwater swim gear with a tube and glasses, and the other looked like a slice of ice cream that melted.
And if you support this serious fashion application, you're lucky.
Stylists say that huge hats can go out on the main streets of your city.
Oversize hats have come into fashion thanks to "Lea Bombi", a straw hat with fields sixty centimeters wide, which was seen on everyone: from Rihanna to Emily Ratazhkovsky.
The iconic brand behind a very impractical hat, which could be seen everywhere on social media, gave the world another creation: a straw beach bag almost the size of a model in a swimsuit that carried it.
The bag in yellow-red raffle with chrome with raffle and white leather handle was a central element of the 2019 spring-summer collection of the Jacquemus brand at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “Next summer I expect to see big hats and beach bags on the main streets of the cities, because the influence of the designer is so huge that it will be difficult to ignore the demand for oversea.
John Edward: Language knowledge is a must for the citizens of the world
Scotland’s independent schools maintain high standards of education, and in 2018 again obtained excellent exam results, which are complemented by individual and collective successes in sports, art, music and other fields.
These schools, which have more than 30,000 pupils across Scotland, are represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SSH) and are committed to providing the best level of service for pupils and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for the further and higher education of their chosen careers, as well as to make them citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can develop and implement an individual school program, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, he perceives it with his mind.
If you talk to her in her native language, she perceives it with her heart.”
It’s a powerful reminder that we can’t just use English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the latest results of this year’s exams, we see that in independent schools, languages are leading in the rankings of the subjects with the best scores.
In total, 68% of students who studied foreign languages received a higher A score.
Data collected in 74 schools of the SNCH showed that 72% of students received a higher grade of A from Chinese, and another 72% of those who study German, 69% of those who study French, and 63% of those who study Spanish, also received A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland consider foreign languages to be vital skills that children and young people will no doubt need in the future, the report said.
Now languages as a subject of choice are taught in the same way as NTIM subjects (science, engineering, engineering and mathematics), in the framework of independent school programs and in other institutions.
A survey conducted by the UK’s Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that 17% of reasons employers can’t close vacancies are linked to language skills shortages.
Therefore, language skills are becoming more and more necessary in preparing young people for a future career.
As more and more forward-looking positions require language skills, these skills are necessary in a globalized world.
Regardless of the chosen career, if someone has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future, because it is a lifelong skill.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives the person who owns several languages an advantage over the competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to support a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage (15%).
This is why investing in language teaching is now important for modern children.
Knowledge of several languages, especially the languages of developing countries, will give children a better chance of finding a full-time job.
In Scotland, each school will learn its own language.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered to be the most important for the UK from the 2020 perspective, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interests in independent schools, it will always be possible to choose several languages to study them with qualified teachers.
Scottish independent schools are trying to create an educational environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to achieve success regardless of what the future has prepared them for.
It cannot be denied that in the international business environment languages continue to be of vital importance for the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
Modern languages should really be considered “the skills of international communication.”
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, diversity, and excellence to the Scottish youth.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron makes his debut with the Lakers in San Diego
Fans who want to see the first start of LeBron James for the Los Angeles Lakers, are looking forward to it.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play Sunday in the first pre-season match against the Denver Naggets in San Diego.
How many minutes he will play is not yet decided.
“It will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell has said that James will likely play a limited number of minutes in the game.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six pre-season games of the Lakers schedule.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need pre-season games to prepare,” he said.
Trump rallies in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is launching a series of election rallies today from the city of Willing, West Virginia.
It is the first of five planned Trump rallies next week, including rallies in friendly states, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
The final vote on the candidacy he proposed for the Supreme Court has been postponed, and Trump is seeking to form support for future mid-term elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress after the vote in November.
What time will Trump’s rally take place in West Virginia this evening and how to watch it on the Internet?
Trump’s rally in the West Virginia city of Willing is scheduled for 19 hours Eastern Time today, Saturday, September 29, 2018
You can watch Trump’s rally in West Virginia online below live on YouTube.
Trump is likely to recall the tensions in the hearings that took place this week over the Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavano, who is accused of sexual harassment, and the postponement of the Senate vote for a week while the investigation continues.
But the main purpose of this series of rallies is to help Republicans gain popularity before elections in November.
President Trump’s representatives said the five meetings next week were aimed at “activating volunteers and supporters as Republicans are trying to preserve and expand the majority they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives,” Reuters reported.
“Control over Congress is so critical to its agenda that the president will go to as many states as possible, as the tense season of the election campaign is approaching,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
At the planned stadium “Wesbanko Arena” in the city of Willing, today’s rally may be attended by fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media from Pittsburgh, reports West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday’s visit will be Trump’s second in the last month’s visit to West Virginia, where he won more than 40% of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the Senate of West Virginia, Patrick Morris, whose rating is lagging behind the poll results.
“It’s not good for Morris that the president is coming to raise his ranking in polls,” said Simon Heather, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Rider Cup 2018: U.S. team ready to fight and full of hope on the eve of Sunday's singles
After three sessions, which ended with a one-sided victory, Saturday afternoon forsoms could become exactly what this Rider Cup was missing.
The emergency pulse pendant is a fully invented sporting concept that players really believe in, especially in similar competitions.
So when do they say that the pulse works?
“They were ahead of six points, and now at four, so I think we perceive it a bit like a pulse,” Jordan Spitt said when he left.
Europe has an advantage, of course, by four points ahead and twelve more in the game.
Americans, as Spit says, feel a little bit of wind in their sails, and they are also encouraged by many, not least the form of Spit and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and each earned three points out of four.
Sleeping with his killer blows from the ti-site to the grin shows an example.
These hoarse celebration screams became louder when, in the course of his round, he made a decisive pat and equalized the score in the fourth game after he and Thomas were two points behind.
His pat, which allowed them to win the match on 15 yards, met with a similar scream, one that tells you that the American team does not seem.
“You really just have to try very hard and worry about your own match,” Spit said.
That’s all the players left behind right now.
Eighteen months to be famous.
The only players with more points than Spit and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable history of the Ryder Cup.
An unusual but charming couple from Europe has four out of four and can’t make mistakes.
The Molywoods were the only couple who didn’t make the gods on Saturday afternoons, they also managed to avoid the gods on Saturday mornings and after lunch on Fridays and on the last nine moons on Friday mornings.
This run and the way their energy seems to flow to this turbulent crowd and back makes them believe that they will win on Sunday and that there won’t be any more popular players, except for Fleetwood or Molinari, to solidify the potential victory of the Nationals of Golf when it comes to the Europeans.
It is preferable to both at the same time in different holes.
However, it is still too early to talk about the triumph of Europeans.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson broke up with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning forboss when he was in a relationship with Alex Noren.
One god and two dabblers in the first nine holes led the Spaniards and Swedes to a hole from which they could never escape.
On Sunday, however, no one will help you get out of the hole.
It’s very interesting to watch forbodies and forsomes closely through the interaction between the couple’s participants, through the advice they give, the advice they don’t give, and it’s interesting to watch how the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe is still playing better as a team and has a significant advantage on the last day, but this push has also shown that the U.S. team intends to fight something that some, especially the Americans, doubt.
Europe leads with a score of 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
On the final day of the Ryder Cup Europe will have a solid advantage, because after Saturday forbodies and forks it is ahead of the United States with an account of 10-6.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari won two victories over the lagging Tiger Woods, and now at Le Golf National they have four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, which is trying to return the trophies they lost to Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American team in the morning forboles with a score of 3-1.
The U.S. made greater resistance in the forsoms and won two games, but could not narrow the gap.
Jim Fury's team needs eight points in 12 Sunday singles to save the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novice to win four points in a row, while he and Mollinari (together with Mollywood) are only the second pair to score four points in the first four matches in the history of the World Cup.
Destroying Woods and Patrick Reed in forbos, they teamed up to defeat swollen Woods and newcomer American Bryson Deshambo with an even more spectacular 5ta4.
Woods, who pulled two games on Saturday, showed random bursts of genius, but so far he has lost 19 of his 29 games in forbos and foros and seven games in a row.
Justin Rose, who did not take part in the morning forbodies, returned to partner Henry Stanson in the forsoms to get a 2-1 loss from Dustin Johnson and Brooks Coepka, who are first and third in the world rankings.
Europe has not been able to do everything in its own way this pleasant fresh day to the south-west of Paris.
Three-time main winner Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas set the standard for Americans with their two points on Saturday.
They won a decisive 2–1 victory over the Spaniards John Ram and Ian Poulter in the Forbos and later defeated Poulter and Rory McLaren with a 4–3 victory in the Forsoms, losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup the team returned with a four-point deficit in the singles, although the team of Furick to save the trophies needed only nobody.
However, after the second place for two days, the counterattack on Sunday looks as if it is not for them.
North Korea says it will not “under any circumstances” disarm unilaterally without trust.
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continuation of the sanctions deepens distrust of the United States, and that in such circumstances the country will in no way be able to give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual UN General Assembly that last year North Korea had taken "significant measures of goodwill" such as the cessation of nuclear and missile tests, the dismantling of the nuclear test site and the non-commitment.
“However, we do not see a proper reaction from the United States,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances, we will in no case be the first to disarm unilaterally.”
And although Ri reiterated North Korea’s familiar complaints about Washington’s “step-by-step” approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea will be rewarded for its gradual steps in the past, his statement has proved important in that it does not leave.
Ri referred to the joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit in history between the true US president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim called on the Cowboys to work on the “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.”
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang should first give up nuclear weapons.
Washington is also resisting calls to weaken tough international sanctions on North Korea, the report said.
“The U.S. insists on ‘denuclearization first’ and raises the level of pressure by means of sanctions to achieve its goal by force, and even denies the ‘announcement of an end to the war,’” Ri said.
“To believe that sanctions can put us on our knees is an unrealistic dream of those who don’t know us.
But the problem is that the continuation of the sanctions will deepen our distrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, at which the U.S. leader stressed at the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister drew attention to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Zhe Ina over the past five months and added: “If a party on this issue of denuclearization would be South Korea, not the United States, denuclearization of the Korean Pivot.
Despite this, the tone of Ri’s speech differed sharply from last year when he told the General Assembly that targeting North Korea’s missiles on the U.S. mainland was inevitable after the “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Kim “a surprise.”
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to “destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his bravery in implementing disarmament measures, but said that there was much more to be done by the Cochnians and sanctions should remain in place.
On Wednesday, Trump noted that he did not set a time frame for this: “It will take two years, three years or five months — it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and unrelentingly until we see a complete, definitive, confirmed denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 with the aim of blocking the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear programs and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was unsuccessful.
He left Pyongyang in July and commented that progress had been made, but a few hours later North Korea condemned him for “gangster demands.”
During a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle the missile complex, as well as the nuclear complex, if the United States takes “appropriate measures.”
He said that, according to Kim, the “appropriate measures” he needs are security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore, and steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough rest.
A new course at Harvard University this year has provided all of its students with more sleep. It is an attempt to combat the growing culture of cruising learning all night after refilling with caffeine.
The professor found that university students number one in the world are often uneducated when it comes to the very foundations of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Chassler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Women’s Hospital, developed a course that he believes is the first such course in the United States.
He decided to start the course after giving a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
Finally, a girl approached him and said, “Why are they telling me this now, in the last class?”
“She told me that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” a teacher told The Telegraph.
In the course, which was first introduced this year, students are explained the basics of how good sleep habits help achieve academic and sporting results, as well as improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the university’s executive director of medical services, said the university decided to introduce the course after it was discovered that students were seriously sleep deprived within a week.
The hourly course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a room in a dormitory where students click coffee cups, curtains, gymnastics and books to learn about the impact of caffeine and light, the impact of sleep deficiency on sports performance, as well as the importance of routine associated with sleep.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Next, a map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that this will not change the behavior of the students instantly.
But we believe that they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know about the health consequences of smoking cigarettes,” added Professor Chaisler.
A culture of pride for “sleeping all night” still exists, he added, and also noted that modern technologies and the ever-increasing pressure on students mean that the problem of sleep deprivation is growing.
Adequate quality sleep should be a student's "secret weapon" to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, even with a set of excess weight, since sleep deprivation converts the brain to a hunger mode, which causes constant physical hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chaisler devise a course after enrolling in one of his other courses last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said that course opened his eyes and inspired him to create a new course for the whole campus.
The next step, he hopes, will be to appeal to all graduate students with a request to pass a similar study program before coming to a competitive institution.
Professor Chassler advises students to put a reminder to sleep, as well as to put an alarm clock and be aware of the harmful effects of “blue light”, which is emitted by electronic screens and LED lamps, and can cause problems with the circadian rhythm.
"Livingstone" 1 - 0 "Rangers": Menge's goal upset the guys of Gerrard
The Rangers experienced another attack of exit sadness: Dolly Menge's blow brought the distinguished team of Steven Gerrard a 1–0 defeat from Livingstone.
The Ibrox team sought to win their first win in the outing match after the February triumph over St. Johnston with an account of 4-1, but the team of Gary Holt gave the team a second defeat to Gerrard's team as manager of 18 games.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers, which lacked inspiration, did not look like he could match the score.
Now the Rangers have dropped to sixth place, and the Livingstone have risen to third, and by difference of balls they are preceded only by the Hibernian.
In addition, Rangers may face another inconvenience, as Lynsman Kalum Spencer was forced to treat a head wound after he was dumped with an item from the guest sector.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which once moved past Ayr to the semi-finals of the Scottish League Cup.
And Holt released the same Livy 11 band, which took one point at Harts last week, and was excited about how his coerced guys squeezed rivals at every step.
The Rangers may have dominated possession of the ball, but the Livingstones worked more with the ball.
They were to score just two minutes in the game when Menga's first dog in the free zone allowed Scott Pittman to hit Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed this big chance by sending the ball over the goal.
The deep free kick of Keegan Jacobs hit the skipper Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Litgow hit the back bar
The Rangers really got control, but the last third had more hope than the faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos, of course, felt he should get the right to a penalty on the mark a quarter of an hour after colliding with Steven Louless, but referee Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian's appeal.
The Rangers managed to make only two goals in the first half, but the former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly hit the head of Lassana Kulibali and the quiet hit of this Ejaria almost did not bother.
And while the 34-minute Liverpool goal may have contradicted the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it only for their hard work.
The Rangers again failed to cope with Jacobs’s infatuation.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who calmly chose Meng for a simple finish.
In the break, Gerrard replaced Kulibali with Ryan Kent, and this change worked almost immediately when the winger broke into Morelos, but the impressive Kelly slammed from his line to block him.
However, Livingstone continued to force guests to play exactly the kind of game they like when Litgow and Halket make one long pass after another.
Holt's team could have improved the score in the final stages, but McGregor did well against Jacobs before hitting Litgow from a corner.
Glenn Middleton, a replacement for the Rangers, made another late application for a penalty when he ran into Jacobs, but Thomson took a look again.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now the page from our almanac "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago on this day, and time is running out... in Germany was born the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Gans" Geiger.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactive radiation, an invention that eventually evolved into a device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, Geiger's counters have become one of the key elements of science, as well as one of the key elements of pop culture, for example in the 1950 film "Coronado Bells" with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, who play dubious-looking characters.
Man: “What is that at all?”
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter that is used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.

New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach the Immune System to “See” Malignant Cells
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach the Immune System to “See” Malicious Cells and Kill Them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize the malignant cells that are part of the treatment
The method involves the removal of immune cells in the patient and their change in the laboratory
Then these cells are able to "see" the protein, which is common to many types of cancer. Then these cells are re-injected to the patient.
The trial vaccine demonstrates promising results in patients with various types of cancers.
In one woman who received a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves removing the immune cells in a patient, changing them in the laboratory so that these cells can “see” common to many types of protein cancer (HER2), and then re-injecting these cells into the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results show that we have received a very promising vaccine.”
“HER2 “stimulates the growth of several cancers,” including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer,” he explained.
A similar approach, which involves the removal of immune cells in patients and the "training" of them to target cancer cells, worked in the treatment of one of the types of leukemia.
After appearing in the studio of the SNL show at the MAGA baseball team Kanye West slammed with a sharp speech in support of President Trump,
what caused the negative reaction of the spectators
Viewers at the SNL (Subtitled Evening Live) studio listened to Kanye after his summum speech, during which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would vote for the presidency in 2020.
After performing a third song called Ghost Town in a baseball captioned "Let's Give Back America Former Glory" he exploded with a tyranny in which he criticized the Democrats and again declared his support for Trump.
White people often ask me, “How do you like Trump? He’s a racist.”
“Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL show began with a sketch of Matt Damon, in which a Hollywood star made fun of Brett Cavano's testimony, which he gave to the Senate Legal Committee in a lawsuit by Christine Blaise Ford about sexual violence.
Although Vesta's speech was not broadcast live, the video with his tyranny was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It remains unclear whether Rock wanted to make Vesta laugh by posting this post.
West also complained to the viewers that behind the scenes there was an unpleasant situation with him due to the main garment.
As the Washington Examiner reported, West said: “When I was behind the scenes, I was brutally treated.
I was told, "Don't go out to the spectators in this baseball game."
They were abusing me!
And then they tell me that I am in a place where the oppressed are silent.”
West continued, "You want to see a place where the oppressed are silent? I'll wear my superman baseball because no one can tell me what to do like that. You want the world to keep moving forward?
Then try to treat each other with love.”
As the weekly Variety reports, his comments at least twice caused a negative reaction of viewers in the hall, and the actors of the SNL show looked confused. One of the viewers said: "The studio was dead silence."
Vesta was invited at the last minute to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days before airing.
West was surprised by performing the song I Love It (I Love It) in a Perrier water bottle suit.
Westa was backed by TPUSA’s conservative leader Kend<0xC3><0xA8>s Turner, who tweeted: “One of the most daring: THANK YOU FOR WHAT WAS ABOUT NATO.”
Karen Hunter, the host of the talk show, wrote on Twitter that West "is who he is, and that's just great."
“But I won’t reward him (by buying his music or his clothes or by supporting his ‘art’) who, in my opinion, professes and vilifies an ideology that harms my community.
He is a free man.
“Like us,” she added.
Before performing on the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name: now he is "the one previously known as Kanye West".
West is not the first performer to change his name. He follows the example of Granddaddy, also known as Puff Granddaddy, Puffy and P. Granddaddy.
Colleague rapper Snoop Dogg had previously been called Snoop Lion, and, as is known, the music legend of the last decades, Prince changed the name to a symbol, and later became an "Artist, formerly known as Prince".
Accused of Attempting to Intentionally Kill after a Knife Attack at Belfast Restaurant
A 45-year-old man is accused of attempting to intentionally kill another man with a knife wound at one of the restaurants in eastern Belfast on Friday.
Police said the incident took place at the Belligecomor restaurant.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The prosecutor's office is considering the charges.
The star of the series "Game of Thrones" Cat Gerington condemns the idealization of brutality
Keith Gerington became famous for the role of warrior with the sword of John Snow in the brutal medieval fantasy series "Game of Thrones" produced by HBO.
However, the 31-year-old actor has condemned the stereotype of the hero-macho, claiming that because of such characters on screens young boys often seem that they need to be tough to be respected by others.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kitt said that he thought "something went wrong" and asked how to solve the problem of idealizing brutality in the era of the popularity of the hashtag <0x23>MeTo (<0x23>yatakozh, <0x23>conflict, etc.).
Cat, who recently married his "Game of Thrones" colleague, 31-year-old actress Rose Leslie, noted that he was "quite determined" to tackle this problem.
"I'm quite determined at the moment. When did we get on the slippery path of idealization of brutality?" - he asked.
“Why do we teach future men if we look at their adulthood because of the prism of the problem we see now?”
Cat believes that television is partly responsible for the popularization of brutality through the imagery of extraordinarily brave characters.
He continued, “What is natural, and what is planted for us?
Why does television and the street teach that young men are under pressure to be such men?
In my opinion, today’s question is really important, “How can we change this?”
After all, it is obvious that the young men have fallen off the right path.”
In an interview, he also noted that he will not be filming in any sequels and sequels to Game of Thrones after the show's completion next summer, as he "was already finished with battles and horses."
From November, Kit will play in the production of the play "The Real West" by Sam Shepard - the story of the filmmaker and his brother the robber.
As the actor recently admitted, he considers meeting with his wife Rose the best he has received from participating in the series "Game of Thrones".
“While filming this series, I met my wife, so he gave me a future family and determined my future life,” he said.
In the fantasy series that won the Emmy Awards, Rose played Igritt, the love hero of Herington John Snow.
The couple got married in June 2018. The ceremony took place on the estate of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a sharp increase of 14% in the number of new cases of the disease
In China, a sharp increase of 14% in the number of citizens with HIV and AIDS has been reported.
According to the health authorities, there are more than 820,000 patients in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases of the disease were reported.
In most cases, the disease was transmitted sexually, indicating a change in the past trend.
For a long time in some regions of China, HIV spread rapidly through infected blood during transfusions.
However, as officials of health authorities said during the conference held in Yunnan province, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has dropped to almost zero.
However, compared to the previous year, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Transmission of HIV sexually on time is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
The decriminalization of homosexuality in China took place in 1997, but the LGBT community often suffers from discrimination.
According to the study, 70-90% of men who have sex with other men are still married to women because of the predominance of conservative values in the country.
The transmission of the disease in most cases occurs as a result of the improper use of means of protection during sexual contact.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged to provide free access to HIV medicines, seeing this as a way to partially solve the problem.
Maxin Waters denies the infusion of Republican senator data into the network by her full-time employee and sharply criticises “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories.”
On Saturday, U.S. House of Representatives member Maxine Waters condemned the vocal statements that one of its staff members posted the personal data of three U.S. Republican senators on their pages in Wikipedia.
A Los Angeles Democrat claims that these statements are spreading “extremely right-wing” political viewers and websites.
“Lies, lies, and then even more disgusting lies,” Waters said on Twitter.
According to reports, the released information contained home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsay Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrina Getch from Utah.
The data appeared on the network on Thursday. It was posted by an unknown person from the Capitol during a hearing in the Senate commission on allegations of sexual misconduct filed against Brett Cavano, a candidate for the position of a U.S. Supreme Court judge.
The leak occurred some time after three senators interviewed Kavanaugh.
The Hill publication reported that on conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, there was information that the IP address of the leak source was associated with the Waters office and it was able to find the data of its staff member.
“These unfounded claims are absolutely untrue, they don’t correspond to reality,” Waters said.
“The employee of my office, whose personal data and security is endangered as a result of these fabricated and false statements, has nothing to do with the leakage of this information.
These unfounded claims are absolutely untrue, they do not correspond to reality.”
Waters’ statement was quickly criticized on the network, including former White House press secretary Ari Fleisher.
“This denial is full of anger,” Fleisher wrote.
"This suggests that with such a character she cannot be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of what he has not done, there is no need to be angry.
The accused shouldn't be rude.
He should not ask about the motives of the accused.
He must remain calm and unmoved.”
Fleisher appears to have drawn parallels between Waters’ reaction and Democrats’ criticism of Judge Cavano, who was accused of appearing too angry during Thursday’s hearings.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is voting to take the place of Waters after the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
“This is news, if it’s true,” he wrote.
Waters said in a statement that her office had already notified "relevant state and law enforcement authorities of these false statements."
“We will do everything possible to find the culprits,” she continued, “and they have responded to the law for their actions, which are harmful and dangerous to all of my employees.”
Review of the film "Agent Johnny Inglesh: New Mission" – a transitory parody on spy fighters with Rowan Atkinson
It has already become a good tradition to look in every new British film for meanings inspired by Brexit. They are also in the new part of a series of comedy parodies on the fighters about Johnny Inglisher. The first film of the year of Inglisher in the 2011 film "Johnny Inglisher" was released on screens.
Will it become ridiculously ironic self-satisfied with what we are short-sighted, the nation’s new export potential?
In any case, Johnny Inglesh with his moving face and chosen eyes for the second time was given the opportunity to make a mess, with his name more than anything else indicating that this comic character was created for viewers in non-English-speaking countries.
As you know, Johnny is a relentless funny secret agent in 2012, in which, despite his strange attempts to be gallant and charming, there is a bit of Inspector Clouseau, a bit of Mr. Bean's year-old son-in-law and a lot of things - from that guy who played one note of the melody from the melody.
The protagonist of the character is also a traveler and a mystery of international scale that has always left behind the mess Atkinson once played in the long-forgotten Barclaycard television commercial.
In the last film about Johnny Inglis there are a few good moments.
I liked the scene when Johnny Inglesh in the cavalry gear approached the helicopter, and the scissors of the screw were sliding around his helmet.
The film clearly reveals Atkinson's talent for arranging a buffoonade, but humor is pervasive, and in some moments it is too much, especially if compared to "serious" film brands such as "Agent 007" and "Mission Impossible", one of the "components" is.
It seems to me that the jokes are intended for children rather than adults, and I don’t think the senseless misconceptions that happen with Johnny Inglesh are as inventive and thoughtful as Atkinson’s ideas in the silent films about Bin.
As always, the film begins with the fact that there was a serious threat over the UK.
The British super-secret spy network penetrates a hacker and reveals the names of all field agents, which became a complete surprise for the acting agent (unfortunately, Kevin Eldon played only an episodic role in the film).
This turned out to be the last drop for the Prime Minister – a proud person who has already suffered devastating criticism and is in a deep depression due to the loss of popularity (Emma Thompson tried his best to convey the image, inspired by Theresa May).
The advisers of the intelligence service informed her that all active agents were compromised, and she needed to attract someone from the retiring.
The choice falls on the impregnable Johnny Inglis, who now works as a teacher in a super-fashioned institution and unofficially teaches children to operate undercover (in this part with a spy "school of the year").
The Englishman is quickly taken to Whitehall for an urgent briefing, where he meets again with his long-suffering friend Buff, who is once again played by Ben Miller.
Buff is now married to the captain of the submarine (the role of an exalted tired person does not quite match the talent of Vicky Pepperdin).
So, when everything in the Secret Service of her Majesty went skerebert, "Batman and Robin" return in line and unexpectedly meet the fatal woman Ophelia Pistoletova, played by Olga Kurilenko.
And at this time, the prime minister falls under the spell of a charismatic billionaire who has earned his fortune in the field of technology and technology and claims to be able to solve the problem with the British network – the interest-bearing Jason Volt, played by Lexie.
Inglish and Buff shovels go on a trip and again resort to their ridiculous excerpts: dressed as waiters they make a fire in a chic French restaurant; then they sow chaos in the countryside, illegally going abroad on a luxury yacht Volta.
All the stops lead us to the last episode, but with his benevolence and insanity he somewhat resembles a children’s movie.
A passing film.
As I watched other Johnny Inglish movies, I asked myself the same question: Can’t the British film industry offer Rowena Atkinson a role that really fits his talent?
Labour denies drafting a plan according to which the British will work four days a week, but will receive a salary in five days
Labour’s Jeremy Corbyn is set to discuss a radical plan that would allow the British to work four days a week, but receive a paycheck in five days.
It is reported that the party wants to commit the heads of companies to transfer the funds saved as a result of the revolution of artificial intelligence, to the workers, giving them an extra weekend.
Thus, the workers will have a three-day weekend and at the same time bring home the same salary.
As reported by the sources, this idea will correspond to the economic program of the party and direct the resources of the country to support the working class.
The transition to a four-day working week was approved at the British Trade Union Congress. It is seen that in this way workers will be able to benefit from the change in the overall economic situation.
A Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: “A review of the policy will be announced at the end of the year.
Everything will not change overnight, but the idea of a four-day working week corresponds to the party’s approach to changing the balance of the economy in the interests of the workers, as well as to the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party was not the first to endorse the idea, as the Green Party promised to introduce a four-day working week even during the 2017 election campaign.
However, not all members of the Labour Party at the moment approve of such a desire.
The Labour Party spokesperson said: "The party's political agenda does not provide for the introduction of a four-day working week, so we are not currently considering this idea."
“Shadow” Chancellor John MacDonnell presented his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy at the Labour’s pre-election congress last week.
Mr. Macdonnell said he was willing to take back power from the “undifferentiated directors” of communal enterprises and “incumbents.”
The Chancellor’s “shadow” plan also means that shareholders of water companies may not get their entire share of capital if the Labour government introduces “deductions” on the basis of imaginary violations.
He also confirmed his intentions to include employees in the board of directors and create inclusive equity funds to transfer 10% of the ordinary shares of private sector firms to employees who are waiting for annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsay Graham and John F. Kennedy tell 60 Minutes (60 Minutes) whether the FBI’s investigation into Cavano could change their mind.
In connection with the investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavano, who is the head of the FBI, the final vote for his appointment to the position of a judge of the Supreme Court has been postponed for at least a week. The results of the investigation will be asked whether the Republican senators will continue to support Ka.
On Sunday’s 60 Minutes show, Scott Pelly asked Republican senators John F. Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could find anything that would change their minds.
Kennedy seemed to be more open-minded than his counterpart from South Carolina.
"Yes, of course," said Kennedy. -
During the hearing, I told him that I had a conversation with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after everything happened and the accusation came out, and I asked him, “Did you really do this?”
He was decisive, unwavering, uncompromising.”
It seems that Graham’s opinion will no longer change.
"I believe that the imposition of charges by Cavano is a provocation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett strongly denied everything," Graham added, referring to Christine Blaise Ford.
And everyone who she calls can't confirm it under oath.
It happened 36 years ago.
I don’t know what could change.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and how can it affect poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival – an annual event in the world of music with an astonishing number of star performers and a no less daunting mission – to fight poverty around the world.
During the 7th Global Citizen Festival tens of thousands of people will take to the Great Lawn of Central Park, not only to enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but also to draw attention to the 30th anniversary of the festival.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international public organization that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to get a free event ticket (if you do not want to pay for a VIP ticket), visitors must perform a number of tasks or "acts", such as taking a lesson in a volunteer project, sending an e-mail to the world leader, or making a phone call.
So are there any results already, because the Global Citizen organizers have 12 years to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding an act with a free concert a brilliant way to convince people to demand action, or is it just another case of so-called “clicitism” when people feel that they are really changing something by signing an e-petition or making a public announcement?
According to Global Citizen, since 2011, they have recorded 19 million “acts” of their supporters aimed at achieving different goals.
The organization claims that these actions have prompted world leaders to announce planned financial allocations and programs of more than $37 billion, which by 2030 will help change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people.
At the beginning of 2018, the group presented as an example the results of its activities 390 financial commitments and public statements, with at least 10 billion already collected and spent.
According to the group’s estimates, the funds provided have already directly affected the lives of approximately 649 million people around the world.
Among the main financial commitments of Global47 can be mentioned the fund The Power of Nutrition, which territorially relates to the UK. Within the framework of the project, investors and realisers have undertaken commitments after the project to "do not help children grow" and promised to provide 35 runes.
“With the support of the government of the UK, the patrons, the governments of other countries and the citizens of the world like you, we can make the social problem of malnutrition a minor fact of history,” said The Power of Nutrition representative Tracy Ullman, speaking to the public at the end of 2018.
The organization also said that after 5,000 "acts" that called for improving the nutrition of mothers and children, the UK government announced the allocation of funds for the project The Power of Nutrition, aimed at improving the nutrition of 5 million mothers and children.
In response to one of the common questions on your website, "Why do you think you will be able to overcome extreme poverty?",
Global Citizen representatives wrote: "This is a long and difficult path, so sometimes we will fall down and we will be hit by failures.
However, like the members of the civil rights movements and against the apartheid towards us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.”
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, and Janet Mona are just some of the star performers who will perform at this year’s festival in New York City, and will be led by Deborah Lee Fernance and Hugh Jackman.
The Interior Minister said that the United States could use naval forces to “blockade” to prevent the export of Russian energy resources.
According to a quote by U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinke, quoted in the Washington Examiner, "if necessary" Washington may seek help from the naval forces to prevent the exit of Russian energy resources to markets, including the Middle East.
Zinke said Russia’s involvement in the conflict in Syria, especially where it acts at the invitation of a legitimate government, is an opportunity to explore new energy markets.
“I think they’re in the Middle East because they want to become an intermediary in energy trade, as they already do in Eastern and Southern Europe,” he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to solve the problem.
"Thanks to the U.S. naval forces, it can ensure free passage by sea and, if necessary, block them so that Russian energy resources do not enter the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event, led by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that positions itself as the “voice of every consumer” in the United States.
He then compared the approaches to trade with Russia and Iran, noting that they are actually similar.
“The economic strategy for Iran and Russia in general is that we use energy resources effectively and replace them with alternatives,” he said, calling Russia “unilaterally developed”, as its economy relies on mine-energy.
While these statements were lurking, the Trump administration set a goal to increase exports of compressed natural gas to Europe, pushing out of the Russian-origin energy transmission market, a much cheaper option for Europeans.
To do this, Trump administration officials and President Donald Trump himself are trying to convince the German government to abandon the “unpurposeful” construction project of the North Stream 2 road, which, according to Trump, will make Berlin hostage to Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly emphasized that the gas pipeline "North Stream 2", which is worth 11 billion dollars and which will double the capacity of the existing gas pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is an exclusively economic project.
The Kremlin believes Washington is strongly opposed to the project only for economic reasons, which is an example of unfair competition.
"In my opinion, we share the view that energy resources cannot be a pressure tool and the consumer should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Oleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry, who took place in Moscow.
The U.S. position provoked a negative reaction from Germany, which confirmed its support for the project.
Germany’s leading industry organisation, the Federal Association of German Industry (BDI), has called on the United States not to interfere in the EU’s energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I don’t like when a third country interferes in our energy supplies,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federal Association of German Industry, after the last meeting of German Chancellor Angela Merkel with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren “will seriously think” about running for president in 2020.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would “think seriously” about running for president after the midterm elections.
During a public meeting in the city of Goliath, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering filing her candidacy.
According to The Hill Warren, “It’s time for women to go to Washington and set up government work, and for that, there should be a woman at the head of it.”
“After November 6th, I am seriously considering the nomination of my candidacy for president.”
During a meeting with the public, Warren expressed her appreciation of Donald Trump's presidency, saying that he "will lead his country in the wrong direction.
“I’m extremely concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren was frank in criticizing Trump and his proposed candidacy for the post of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet, Warren tweeted: “...undoubtedly, before the vote, the FBI should conduct an investigation.”
However, according to a poll released on Friday, a majority of Warren’s voters do not believe she should vote in 2020.
According to a poll conducted jointly by the Suffolk University Center for Political Research and The Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of potential voters in the state of Massachusetts opposed the nomination of a senator for their candidacy.
Thirty-two percent supported the nomination.
The results of the survey confirmed that the former governor, Deval Patrick, is more supportive. For his potential appointment to the post of President, 38%, against – 48%.
While discussing the candidacy of other well-known Democrats who may run in 2020, former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders are also named.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said he would make the decision by January.
Sarah Payline mentions PTSD track Payline during rally in support of Donald Trump
26-year-old Track Peylin spent a year in Iraq after joining the military in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence. The incident took place on the night of Monday.
“What my son is going through now, what he is going through after his return, can only be understood by other families who are experiencing the consequences of PTSD and other health problems with which our soldiers are returning home,” she said in a statement to the participants of the rally in support of Donald Trump.
Peylin called Track's arrest "a problem no one pays attention to" and said that her son and other war veterans "do not return home as they used to be, more cruel than the rest of the country, and want to know if they respect what their soldiers have done here.
According to a spokesperson for the Vasilla City Police Department, Dan Bennett, Trake was arrested on Monday in the town of Vasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence and assault on a raped woman, as well as for his obstruction of confession.
18 States and District of Columbia Support Complaints of Asylum Policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support appeals against a new U.S. policy that prohibits victims of gang violence and domestic violence from granting refugee status.
According to NBC News, representatives of 18 states and the district sent an analytical note of a court consultant to Washington to support the plaintiff who needed asylum and challenged the aforementioned policy in court.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grays v. Seshns case against the U.S. Civil Rights Protection Union, which appeals federal policy and was filed in August, is not disclosed.
The caller said her partner "and his cruel sons-bandits" beat her, but U.S. officials refused her when she asked for asylum on July 20.
He was illegally detained in Texas.
State prosecutors who support Grace’s lawsuit said residents of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala (of which refugees often seek asylum in the U.S.) are often faced with serious problems such as banditry and domestic violence.
The new policy of granting refugee status annuls the 2014 decision of the Appeals Board on Immigration, according to which immigrants without documents fleeing domestic violence could apply for asylum.
Attorney General of the District of Columbia General Carl Reisin said in his speech on Friday that the new policy "ignores a decade of state laws, federal and international laws."
“Federal law requires that the decision on applications for granting refugee status be based on consideration of the facts and circumstances set out in such a statement, and the ban violates this principle,” a court advisor’s analytical note reads.
Further in the analytical note, prosecutors argue that a policy that prohibits immigrants from entering the U.S. would harm the economy of the country, as they could potentially become entrepreneurs and "fill in the necessary labor resources."
Attorney General Jeff Seshns issued an order in June for immigration judges that they were no longer able to grant refugee status to those fleeing domestic violence and banditry.
“The annex is granted to persons who leave their country because of persecution or fear of persecution in connection with racial affiliation, religion, nationality, membership in certain public groups or political views,” said Ceshns.
The goal of providing asylum was never to solve all the problems, even those serious problems that people all over the world face on a daily basis.
Rescuers desperately try to find those who are still alive, while the number of deaths in Pal has doubled.
For those who remain alive, the situation continues to deteriorate.
“The situation is very tense,” says the 35-year-old mother, calming her boy with a fever in the evacuation center of the ruined city of Palu.
“Every minute, the ambulance brings the body.
There is not enough clean water.”
Some residents return to their destroyed homes, switching to submerged shelters, trying to save what they have found.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged as a result of the earthquake, the strength of which amounted to 7.5 points on the Richter scale, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Two Gerris with a fractured back and shoulder, rest near the building of the Palo Army Hospital, where patients are provided with open-air assistance due to constant repetitive shocks.
His eyes were filled with tears as he remembered how a strong shock shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time for rescue.
It seems to me that I was stuck in the cracks of the wall,” Gerris told an Associated Press correspondent, adding that he and his family had come to the city for the wedding.
“I heard my wife pleading for help, and then there was silence.
I don’t know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of “Exercising Psychological Pressure” With “Ads That Contain Propaganda”
A week after the state-run Chinese newspaper posted advertising material on four pages of the U.S. daily newspaper about the mutual benefit of trade between the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread the news.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the paid app of the China Daily in Des Moines Register – the most popular newspaper in the state of Iowa after accusing China of trying to influence the elections to Congress that will take place on November 6. China rejects.
According to Reuters, Trump’s statements, which he accuses Beijing of trying to interfere in the U.S. election, signify a new phase of escalation by Washington, which aims to put pressure on China.
While foreign governments may place advertisements to intensify trade, there is a timely escalation of the trade war between Beijing and Washington, as part of which they have already raised tariffs on imports.
According to experts from China and the United States, at the beginning of this war, the imposition of a repressive tariff in China was not intended to strike at exporters from states such as Iowa who supported the Republican party Trump.
Terry Brentstead, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, the largest exporter of agricultural products to China, said China had harmed U.S. workers, farmers and companies.
China, as Brentwood wrote in the column of the Sunday edition of the Des Moines Register, “intensifies the pressure by publishing advertising containing propaganda in our independent press.”
“To spread propaganda, the Chinese government is using the road to the American people the tradition of freedom of speech and press independence by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register,” Brentstead wrote.
"Contrary to this, on the street layouts here, in Beijing, you will find only individual voices of dissenters. Here you will not see a true reflection of what the Chinese people really think about the direction of the Kyuyi subtitles of the Chinese economy, which causes concern.
He also added that “one of the most respected Chinese publications offered to publish” his article, but did not name which one.
Analysts warn that by failing with Cavano, Republicans are setting themselves up against women-electors before midterm elections
Since many well-known Republicans support and defend the candidate for the post of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh after he has been made several counts of sexual harassment, analysts have warned pro-Bush personalities that this may cause an undesirable reaction.
Passions are raging around this situation, and the majority of Republicans publicly declare that they would like to go to the polls.
Such things can't just be played back then," Grant Riger, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, told The Hill.
Riger expressed doubts that the FBI investigation, on which Senator Jeff Flake (a Republican from Arizona) began to insist at the last minute, would be enough to reassure angry voters.
As reported by the Washington, D.C. newspaper, the chief advisor and spokeswoman of the progressive group MoveOn (Move on) Catherine Jean-Perrier said on Friday: "Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget about it tomorrow."
According to Mic, on Friday morning, protesters chanted “List of Fall is approaching!” during a demonstration in the Legal Committee, when Republicans decided to move to the approval of Kavanaugh’s candidacy, despite Dr. Christine’s testimony.
In an interview with the news website Stey Rotenberg, an out-of-party political reviewer, said: "People will be extremely interested and motivated."
“They say it’s happening now, and it’s true.
“However, the motivation may increase, especially among women voters aged 18-29 who have not yet been determined and often do not vote if they don’t like the president.”
Even before Ford gave testimony in connection with the accusations of a candidate for the post of a Supreme Court judge in a sexual crime, analysts predicted a negative voter reaction if Republicans insist on endorsement.
As reported by NBC News, earlier this week the former chairman of the National Committee of the Republican Party, Michael Steele, said: “This is an unpleasant story for the Republican Party.”
As noted in an interview with the news channel the director of Priorities USA (the group that assists in the election campaign for Democrats) Guy Cecil, "it is not a matter of voting for the committee, giving the final vote to the committee, or that they gave the vote."
However, the views of the Americans on who they believe, Ford or Cavano, have been divided. Ford has a little more support.
According to a new YouGov survey, 41% of respondents believe or believe Ford’s testimony, while 35% of respondents believe or believe Kavanaugh’s testimony.
In addition, 38% of respondents noted that, in their opinion, Cavano gave or rather gave false testimony, while 30% of respondents said the same about Ford.
According to The Guardian, after Flake’s efforts, the FBI is conducting a review of the charges filed by Ford and another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez.
Last week, Ford testified under oath to the Senate Legal Committee about how Cavano attacked her while in a state of alcoholic intoxication when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez said that the candidate for the post of Supreme Court judge showed her his genitals at a party during their study at the University of Yelp in the 1980s.
The inventor of the world’s Internet is planning to launch a “new Internet” to create competition between Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the global Internet, launches a new startup to create competition between Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology world legend, Inrupt, is engaged in the development of an open source platform Solid, the idea of which belongs to Berners-Lee.
With the Solid platform, users will be able to choose where to store data and to whom to provide access to some information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the goal of Inrupt was "world domination".
“We have to do it now,” he said of the startup.
This is a historic moment.”
In the application, Solid technology is used, which will allow users to create "personal online data storage" or POD.
It can store contact lists, lists of current affairs, calendar, library of audio recordings, and other tools for your own use and work.
It’s like using Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify at the same time in one browser.
The unique feature of this personal online data repository is that it fully meets the needs of the user, who can access any information.
The company calls it an “expansion of personal capabilities with the help of data.”
According to John Bruce, CEO of Inrupt, the company aims to engage resources, processes and relevant skills so that the Solid platform is accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired from IBM, several full-time developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own standalone apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not negotiating with Facebook and Google about whether to make a full replacement when all of their business models will undergo radical changes in a short period of time.
“We don’t ask for their permission.”
In a Saturday post on Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s mission was to “provide commercial energy and ecosystems and help protect the integrity and quality of the new network created on the Solid platform.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet network by founding the World Spider Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential figure in the debate over net neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remained the founder and director of the World Spider Consortium, The Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m very optimistic about the next era of network development,” Berners-Lee said.
Bernard Vann: Celebration on the occasion of the consecration of the Order of the "Cross of Victoria" to a representative of the Church in the years of the First World War
The only representative of the Anglican Church, who received the Order of the Cross of Victoria for his participation in hostilities during World War I, is honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded for his participation in the attack on Belanglis and Leocurus on September 29, 1918.
However, he died from a sniper bullet four days later and never learned that he had received the highest military award in Britain.
On Saturday, two of his grandsons opened a memorial stone during a parade in the town of Rashden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, called it "extremely symbolic" that the discovery of the memorial stone took place exactly 100 years after his grandfather performed the feat for which he received the award.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lt. Col. Vann transported his battalion through the Saint-Kathene Canal "through very dense fog and under dense fire of field guns and machine guns".
Later he rushed to the fire line and with "desperate courage" led the line forward, before which one broke into the field gun and destroyed three guns of the enemy unit.
Lieutenant Colonel Vanna was shot by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just over a month before the end of the war.
The 72-year-old Michael Vann said his grandfather had done what he himself would never have been able to do and deserved respect.
He and his brother Dr. James Vann put a wreath after a parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "very proud of taking part in this parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero demonstrates the honor that so many people show him."
MMA fans didn’t sleep all night to watch the Bellator 206 tournament, but instead showed them “Peppa Pig”
Imagine that you don’t sleep all night just to watch the events of the Bellator 206 tournament, and you are denied the opportunity to view the main event.
The posters of the tournament, which took place in San Jose, indicated 13 fights, including six matches of the main program, which were broadcast live at night in the UK on 5 channels.
At 6:00 a.m., just before Hegard Musassi and Rory McDonald were preparing for the match, television viewers in the UK died of wonder when Peppa's pig appeared on the screen instead of broadcasting the fight.
Some viewers were not thrilled by this, as they did not sleep until the very morning, waiting for the battle.
One of the fans wrote on Twitter that switching to a children's cartoon seemed to him "some kind of a failed joke".
"According to the government's order, the content that was broadcast at 6 a.m. was inappropriate, so they were forced to let the child broadcast," said Dave Schwarz, senior vice president of marketing and public relations, Bellitor, when asked when it was released.
"Peppa pig, yes."
Bellator President Scott Cocker has promised to work on a broadcast schedule to cover viewers in the UK in the future.
"I think if we talk about re-broadcasting, we can arrange it," Cooker said.
“But now it’s Sunday at 6am, and we can’t do anything until we have a Sunday and they have a Monday.
However, we are working on it.
Believe me, when the broadcast was turned off, we received a lot of messages that we responded to, and the text of those messages was not very friendly.
We thought it was a technical malfunction, and we tried to fix it.
However, it turned out to be an inconsistency with government regulations.
I can promise you that this will never happen again.
We're going to shorten the tournament to five instead of six, as usual. We tried to redirect the signal to the fans, but so far we've postponed these attempts.
It’s a really unpleasant situation.”
Previous articleDesert Island Discs: Tom Dale felt “worse” than others because of his sexual orientation
Olympic water jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling worse than others because of his sexual orientation, but this gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t understand that “not everyone looks like him” until he went to high school.
Taking part in the broadcast of Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, led by Lauren Laverne, he noted that he openly spoke about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that due to parenthood, he became less concerned about winning the Olympic Games.
The leader, who has been running the program for a long time, Kirsty Young, went to the hospital for several months.
Coming as a couple on Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "worse" than others in childhood because "the society didn't perceive when someone liked boys and girls."
He said: “Until then, a sense of inferiority and difference was precisely what gave me the drive and strength to succeed.”
According to him, he sought to prove that something was "worthy" so as not to disappoint all those who eventually learned about his orientation.
The two-time bronze Olympic winner became a well-known LGBT rights fighter and took advantage of his appearance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He stated that he spoke frankly about his views, as he felt happy that he could live openly without any consequences, and wanted to give this “hope” to others.
The three-time world champion admitted that the feeling to the man, American film director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, became a real surprise for him.
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but, according to him, age difference was never a problem.
"When you go through so much at such a young age" (at the first Olympic Games he performed at the age of 14, and three years later his father died of cancer), it's hard to find someone his age who would also have experienced similar takeoffs and falls.
In June, the couple had a son, who was named Robert Ray Black Dale, and since then, according to Dale, his "perception" has changed.
“If you asked me last year, I’d only think about what gold should be,” he said.
“You know, there are things that are much more important than the Olympic gold medals.
“My Olympic gold is Robbie.
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father could not accept the idea of the end and before he died asked if they had bought tickets to the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him ‘you won’t be sitting in the front row because you won’t be around anymore,’” Daley said.
“I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing, and it was only after he actually stopped breathing and died that I finally realized he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year Daley took part in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
“I knew that’s what I’ve dreamed of all my life: diving in front of my compatriots at the Olympics, and there was no feeling better than that,” Daley said.
This feeling also inspired him to choose his first song – Proud (Horror) performed by Giser Small – which resonated with him during the preparations for the Olympics and still causes ants.
Desert Island Discs will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 a.m. English Summer Time.
On Saturday, Michaelson, who was not in shape, was taken out of the Ryder Cup match.
American Phil Michaelson will set a record on Sunday by playing his 47th game in the Ryder Cup tournament, but he must get back in shape so that this event does not become unfortunate for him.
Michaelson, who is taking part in the tournament for the record 12th time, which takes place once every two years, took out the game captain Jim Furick for the time of holding forbolls and forces.
Instead of being at the center of events, as he often did, playing for the United States, the five-time winner encouraged the team all day and trained on the sidelines, hoping to master the emotions.
Because Michelson wasn’t famous for his blunt punches even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old athlete wasn’t quite suited for a complex golf course at Le Golf National, where the reef usually punishes for bluffing punches.
And if the field is not that much an obstacle, in the ninth game on Sunday Michelson will have to meet the champion of the Open and the master of the precise stroke Francesco Molinari, who in pairs with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood won all his matches.
If the Americans who are behind by three points after 12 singles games start well, Michaelson’s game could be decisive.
Fourik expressed confidence in his athlete, and probably, besides that, he had nothing to add.
“He finally understood his role today, slammed me on my back, hugged me and said he’d be ready tomorrow,” Fourik said.
“He doesn’t doubt his powers.
Michaelson is a member of the Hall of Fame who did so much for the teams last week and this week.
I didn’t expect him to play in two games.
“I predicted more matches, but that’s how it turned out, and that’s why we decided to act that way.
He wants to be there, on the field, like everyone else.”
If Michaelson comes out on Saturday, he will break the record of Nick Faldo, who played the most games in the Ryder Cup tournament.
On this, he may end his career in the Ryder Cup tournament, which never corresponded to his individual achievements.
On Michaelson's account of 18 victories, 20 defeats and 7 null results, however, Furick said his presence could play a decisive role for the team.
"He's funny, he's greedy, he likes to joke with others, he's a guy that's cool to have on the team," Fourik explained.
"I think the younger players had a good time riding on him, as well as this week, and it was interesting to watch.
He’s more than just a player.”
The captain of the European team Thomas Byorn knows that the big break does not solve anything
Thomas Byorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that a tangible break before the singles on the final day of the tournament for the Ryder Cup does not yet guarantee victory.
The Dane made his debut in 1997 in a match at the Walderram club field, where the team led by Sev Ballesteros outperformed the Americans by five points, but won the match with a minor break with a result of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2:131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You remind yourself that we had a big break in the game at the Walderrams field; a big break at Brooklyn where we lost, and at the Walderrams field where we won hard," Bjorn said after a review of the winning Golf Games, after a 10th season, to the Golf Club.
So the story teaches me and every player on the team that nothing has yet been resolved.
Tomorrow we have to play with the maximum return.
Go out into the field and do everything you need to do.
The game will be completed only after the result appears on the board.
We have a goal – to win this trophy, and that’s what we want.
As I said before, I will focus on the 12 players of our team, but we are well aware of who is against us – the best players in the world.”
Satisfied with the performance of his players on the difficult field, Bjorn added: "I will never run ahead.
Tomorrow, things may be different.
We’re going to play individual games tomorrow, and that’s a little different.
It’s cool to play on the field with a partner when everything goes well, but it’s just when you’re standing there alone and you can check what you’re worth as a golfer.
Here’s how to set the players to perform tomorrow: on the edge of opportunities.
You leave your partner without support and now he also has to show what he is capable of.”
Unlike Byorn, the opposite number Jim Fourick expects his partners to play better on an individual level, with the exception of Jordan Spyt and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
By the very end of the last day, Fourik's fate was returned by different sides: he was among the winners in Brooklyn, but suffered defeats when the team from Europe created "The Miracle in Medina".
“I remember every word you swear,” he said in response to a question about how Ben Cranshaw, captain of the 1999 team, organized the players before the final day of the competition.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we need to start as successful as it was in Brooklyn and Medina.
When the initiative moves to someone’s side, the players in the middle of the distance will experience special pressure.
We’ve properly placed the players on the team, so it’s like we’re going to do something incredible tomorrow.”
Thomas was tasked with trying to lead the counter-attack in the top-match against Rory McIlroy. Next in the first half of the list of the European teams were Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter.
"It was these partners and in this order I chose because I want to distribute the effort evenly throughout the game," Bjorn said, commenting on his choice of players in individual matches.
The introduction of a new German battleship has been postponed again
The most modern frigate of the German navy was to take effect in 2014 instead of the outdated battleships of the Cold War. However, according to local media, this will not happen at least until next year due to faulty systems and rapid outages.
According to the newspaper Die Zeit, received from the spokesman of the military department, the commissioning of the ship "Reinland-Pfalz", the main vessel of the series of the most modern frigates of the class "Baden-Württemberg", has been postponed until the first half of 2019.
This ship was due to join the rest of the fleet in 2014, but the problems that arose after the delivery damaged the implementation of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 are to be replaced by outdated Bremen-class frigates.
Of course, they will be equipped with a powerful gun, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some technologies to reduce visibility, in particular, radar, infrared and acoustic.
Another important feature is a longer period of technical maintenance. It is expected that new frigates will be able to not return to the base port within about two years.
However, Die Zeit warns that due to constant delays, the supermodern warships, which were supposed to strengthen Germany’s military capacity at sea, will also become obsolete at the time of commissioning.
The F125 frigate was in the headlines of the newspapers last year when the German naval forces officially refused to put the ship into action and returned it to the Blohm <0x2B> Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first case of the return of the military ship to the shipbuilding company after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media mentioned significant "defects of software and equipment", which made the battleship unsuitable for military operations.
The shortcomings of the software are of particular importance, as the crew of the Baden-Württemberg-class ship consists of approximately 120 sailors – this is only half the number of soldiers who served on the old Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it turned out that the ship has a significant excess weight, which deteriorates its performance and limits the possibilities for further modernization.
It is believed that the Rhineland-Palatinate frigate is twice as heavy (7,000 tons) as ships of the same class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the faulty equipment, another problem was the total cost of the project, which also includes the cost of training the crew.
The expected <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion turned into a colossal <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (USD 3.6 billion).
Problems with obtaining new frigates have gained particular weight in light of recent warnings about the decline of the naval forces of Germany.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the deputy of the Bundestag for the Armed Forces, said that the country's navy "has a small number of ships capable of carrying out combat tasks."
The official said that the situation quickly deteriorated over a certain period of time, as the old ships were withdrawn from operation, and the new ones did not arrive.
He expressed deep regret at the fact that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class was able to replenish the navy.
The National Trust will observe the secret life of the penguins
The new study, which is being carried out in land ownership in the Scottish Highlands, aims to establish how turkeys use the landscape in search of food.
Scientists hope that the data obtained will help shed light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals in order to carry out measures to preserve them in the future.
In the Inver Gardens in West Ross, scientists of the National Trust of Scotland will observe such species as dwarfs and pygmy moths, as well as the common and watery night owls.
Special registrars will be placed in strategic locations in the land ownership territory to observe the behavior of the penguins during the season.
Employees and volunteers of the National Trust of Scotland will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Expert analysis of all recorded sounds will help to determine the frequency and affiliation of the screams of cockroaches.
It is then planned to develop a detailed map of the animal habitat and prepare a report to link the behavior of the animals to their habitat.
Rob Dewear, Nature Adviser at the National Trust of Scotland, hopes that the results of the study will help determine which habitats are most important for penguins and how they are used for each of the species.
This information will help to assess the effectiveness of environmental care measures (e.g. meadow formation) and to identify optimal forest conservation methods for shrimp and other related species.
Over the last century, the population of peanuts has declined significantly in Scotland and in the United Kingdom.
They are threatened by the active construction and development of territories, which deprives them of their nesting places.
Other negative factors include wind installations and lighting, adhesive paper for flies, chemical treatment of building materials, as well as attacks of domestic cats.
They are not actually blind.
However, by hunting at night, the ears help them to catch prey more effectively than the eyes.
They use a complex echolocation technique to detect insects and obstacles to the flight path.
The National Trust of Scotland, which is run by more than 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens of special importance and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, is very serious about the problems of peas.
Ten specially trained experts regularly conduct research, inspections of nesting sites and sometimes even rescue operations, according to the report.
Efforts of the organization even created the first and only reserve in Scotland for shrimp. It is located on the territory of the site of Trives in the region of Damfries-en-Hallewey. It found shelter eight of the ten species of shrimp that live in Scotland.
The manager of the premises, David Thompson, claims that this is the perfect place for them.
"On the territory of the site of Triv excellent conditions for pupils," he assures.
“There are old buildings, many huge trees and other favourable living conditions.
However, we still need to learn a lot about peanuts. Thanks to the research we are conducting here and elsewhere, we will be able to learn more about what they need to thrive."
He insists that it is very important to check the territory for pupils before carrying out any technical work, because due to the accidental destruction of one place of nesting for the removal of a youngster can kill up to 400 females with a baby.
Penguins and their nests are protected by law. Animals are forbidden to kill, torture or disturb.
Elizabeth Ferrell, an officer at the Scottish Penalty Conservation Centre, called on the public to join the organization’s efforts.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our penguins. We have not yet revealed the characteristic features of populations of many species."
Ronaldo rejects accusations of rape, and his lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against the German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo called the accusations of rape a “promise” and said people were “trying to draw attention to themselves” using his name.
His lawyers are ready to file a lawsuit against the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published information on the suspicions.
The American Catherine Majorga has accused the Portuguese forward and the football club Juventus of the rape that took place in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
As reported by Der Spiegel magazine on Friday, Ronaldo allegedly paid her $375,000 for her silence.
A few hours after the charges were filed, 33-year-old Ronaldo turned to 142 million of his fans in an Instagram video, calling the relevant messages a “nodding.”
"No, no, no, no, no!
Today’s accusations are a mockery,” the five-time owner of the Golden Ball made a statement on camera.
“They want to draw attention to themselves, using my name.
It's natural.
These people want to touch me, but similar situations are part of my job.
I’m a happy person and I’m fine,” added the footballer, smiling.
According to the Reuters news agency, Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel for the published accusations, which they called an “inadmissible message of suspicion in the sphere of privacy.”
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the footballer would demand compensation for "moral damages to an extent consistent with the seriousness of the violation, which is likely to be one of the loudest cases of personal rights violations in recent years."
It is alleged that the incident occurred in June 2009 in the Palms Casino hotel room in Las Vegas.
It is reported that after a meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga returned to the player's number, where he allegedly raped her anal. Such testimony was transferred to the District Court of Clark County, Nevada.
Majorga claims that after the described incident, Ronaldo fell to his knees in front of her and said that he was a “99 percent good guy” who was “one percent.”
As stated in the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that he had sex with the model, but with mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims that she turned to the police, and then to the hospital, where the injuries she received were photographed. However, she later agreed to extrajudicial settlement, because she was "afraid of revenge" and warned of "public humiliation".
Now, a 34-year-old woman is seeking to cancel the preliminary agreement as she continues to suffer from an incident that, she said, took place.
At the time of the occurrence of this incident Ronaldo was preparing for the transition to FC "Real Madrid" from FC "Manchester United". This summer he became a player of the grand of Italian football, the team "Juventus", for 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain 'will forever regret' the loss of automakers
The UK will "forever regret" if it loses its status as a world leader in automotive manufacturing after Brexit. This is warned by the Minister of Economy Greg Clark.
He added that he was concerned by a statement by Toyota UK representatives, who told BBC journalists that in the event of Britain leaving the EU without a deal, the company would be forced to suspend production and work at its plant in Bernastone, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” said Minister Clarke.
The Japanese automaker said the consequences of delays at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The factory in Bernastone, which produces Toyota Auris and Avensis cars, produced about 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“In my view, if Britain leaves the EU urgently at the end of March, production at our plant will be halted,” said Marvin Cook, CEO of Toyota in Bernastone.
Other automakers, such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, are also concerned about Britain’s exit from the EU without an international trade deal.
For example, BMW said that the factory for the production of the Mini model in Oxford will be closed a month after Brexit.
The main fears of automakers are related to the fact that a no-deal Brexit could pose risks to supply chains.
Toyota’s production line operates in an operational delivery mode of parts and materials according to the needs – parts are delivered every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there may be disruptions in the supply of parts at the border, leading to delays and a shortage of materials.
According to the company, parts can be placed in Toyota warehouse for no more than one day. So production will have to stop.
Greg Clark noted that in the plan to organize relations with the EU, prepared by Theresa May (Chequers Plan), "separately envisaged schemes to avoid problems at the border".
"We need an agreement. We need to make an optimal agreement, which, in my opinion, will allow not only to achieve success at the present moment, but also to take advantage of the prospects that emerged," he said during the program Today on BBC Radio 4.
“Given the testimonies of representatives of Toyota and other car manufacturers, we absolutely need to preserve the highly efficient supply chains that have been formed.”
Toyota has not been able to say how long production will be halted, but in the long run, it is expected that the increase in costs will lead to a decrease in the factory’s competitiveness and, as a result, will reduce jobs.
Peter Tsovalaris, chairman of the organizing committee of the trade union Unite at the factory in Bernaston, who worked there for 24 years, said that the other participants were extremely concerned: "From experience, I can say that the reduced jobs are not being restored."
The representative of the government said: "We have put forward a precise and reliable plan for the formation of our future relations with the EU."
Trump and Rosenstein's meeting may be postponed again, White House says
As White House officials reported on Sunday, Donald Trump’s responsible meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed for another week” as discussions continue on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh’s candidacy for the trial.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special prosecutor Robert Müller, who is investigating Russia’s interference in the election, the ties between Trump and Russia’s aides and the potential obstruction of justice by the president.
For several months, Washington is discussing the possibility of the release of the deputy attorney general, which would jeopardize Mueller's independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein spoke about the use of microphones to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of early termination of the president’s powers under the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein did not confirm this information.
But last Monday he visited the White House amid reports that the official is going to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at UN Headquarters in New York, was scheduled for Thursday.
Trump said he "wouldn't want" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was then postponed to avoid a timely meeting of the Senate Legal Committee, at which Flavio Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weekly FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, which further suspended the vote in the Senate.
Trump’s spokesperson, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: "The date of the meeting is not scheduled. Perhaps it will take place this week. I expect it to be postponed for another week, given all the events related to the Supreme Court.
But let's see. I'm constantly watching to see that the press has the latest information."
Some journalists disagreed: Sanders has not held media briefings at the White House since September 10.
The leader, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders responded that the infrequentness of the briefings is not related to the dislike of "play in the public" by television reporters, although she added: "I will not deny that they play in the public."
She then assumed that Trump himself would communicate with the press more.
“The president gives answers to questions more often than any president to him,” she said, adding, without citing the source: “Statistics speak for themselves.”
Sanders noted that the briefings will still be held, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask a question to the President of the United States, it is better than talking to me."
We try to communicate with the press often. This should be especially noticeable over the past few weeks. The opportunity to talk to the US president is no worse than a press conference."
Trump regularly answers questions during events outside the White House, open meetings, or press conferences with the participation of high-ranking guests.
Personal press conferences are seldom held.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why this is so, in front of journalists, and sometimes oddly so.
Scotland’s Secretary of State for Health has sent a letter to EU workers in connection with fears of Brexit.
In a letter to citizens of other EU countries working at the National Health Service of Scotland, the Secretary of State for Health said in a letter to express gratitude for their work and ask for it to continue after Brexit.
Gene Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before Britain’s exit from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already made a commitment to cover the cost of applying for permanent resettlement status for EU citizens who work in autonomous public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman said: "During the summer negotiations between the UK and the EU on the issue of exit were ongoing. Already this autumn, we should wait for appropriate solutions.
But the UK government is stepping up its preparations for a possible exit without a deal.
I know this period can be very worrying for you.

Cristion Ebercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Defender of the Tennessee State Tigers team Cristion Ebercrombie underwent an emergency operation after receiving a head injury in a Sunday match against Vanderbilt Comodores, which his team lost with a score of 31:27. About this reported by the journalist Ten.
The head coach of the Tennessee State Tigers told reporters that the player was injured shortly before the break.
“He came up to the sideline where he got sick,” Reid said.
Behind the sidelines, coaches and medical staff gave Ebercrombie oxygen before taking it to the carriers for further examination.
An official representative of the Tennessee State Tigers team told Chris Harris of the WSMV (Nashville, Tennessee) that Ebercrombie had been operating at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
Harris added that "so far there is no evidence of the type and severity of the injury." The Tennessee State Tigers are trying to find out when the player was injured.
Ebercrombie, a second-classman, spent his first season at the Tennessee State Tigers after moving from the Illinois team.
He made five interceptions of the ball on Sunday before getting out of the game. So for the season he has 18 interceptions.
Foreign buyers will pay more state tax in case of purchase of real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will pay more taxes in case of purchase of real estate in the UK. According to the new Tori plans, additional funds will be spent to help the homeless
This event neutralizes all attempts by Corbyn to attract young voters
The higher state tax will be levied on those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Ministry of Finance hopes to attract an additional <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year to help the homeless
As announced today, Theresa May, foreigners who buy real estate in the UK, will pay more taxes. Additional funds will be spent to help the homeless.
This step can be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to engage young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing targeted at high-wage workers.
The tax increase will apply to individuals and legal entities who do not pay taxes in the UK. The additional funds will be directed by the government to help those who are forced to stay under the open sky.
The additional duty, which accompanies the increase of the two-year old age on the second housing and real estate, intended for the provision of rent, can be three percent.
The Ministry of Finance hopes to attract an additional <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
According to experts, 13% of the new real estate being built in London is owned by foreign citizens. This leads to higher prices and complicates the task for those who only dream about their own housing.
Many wealthy areas of the country, in particular, in the capital, are deserted, as a large number of foreign buyers most of the time live outside the country.
The new plan of action came just weeks after Boris Johnson called for lowering state tariffs to make housing more accessible to young people.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high prices for real estate by buying land without further use of it. He called on Theresa May to abandon quotas for affordable real estate in order to correct the "shameful situation in the housing market" in Great Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced a number of important reforms in the field of real estate, in particular the control of rent and the impossibility of eviction without substantial grounds.
It also proposes to extend the powers of local councils in the field of construction of new housing.
Theresa May said: “I have promised to dedicate my premiership to the restoration of the British dream – for every new generation of life to be better.
This requires a change in our imperfect housing market.
The United Kingdom will always remain open to those who want to live, work and build their future here.
However, it is not fair to call the fact that individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies, buy housing on the same terms as British citizens.
For too many people, the dream of their own housing has become unattainable. The problem of living under the open sky still remains very painful".
Jack Ross: "Overall, I want to be the head coach of the Scotland national team"
Sanderland head coach Jack Ross says he is “above all things” ever striving to lead the Scottish national team.
The 42-year-old Scottish has taken to restore the club from the north-east of the country, which now ranks third in the First Football League, by three points behind the leader.
Ross moved to the Stadion of Light this summer, returning last season of FC St. Mirren to the Scottish Premier League.
“I wanted to represent my country as a player.
I got to the second team of Scotland, but that was the end of it," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"When I was a kid, my father and I often watched the game of the Scottish national team at Hampton Park Stadium. It always attracted me.
The only hope for me remains to be successful in the position of head coach of the club."
Ross' predecessors at Sanderland FC, in particular, were Dick Lawyer, David Moes, Sam Ellardays, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keen, Gustavo Poet and Paolo Di Canio.
Former head coach Alloa Athletic claims that he was not excited about moving to a big club following such authoritative names, having previously rejected proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At the current stage, I will assume that I have achieved success if the club returns to the Premier League.
Due to its structure and material and technical support, this club, without a doubt, corresponds to the level of the Premier League," he said.
“It will be a difficult task, but another outcome I’m unlikely to consider successful.”
Ross only built a coaching career for three years. Before that, he worked as a second coach at FC Dambarton, and also spent 15 months in the coaching staff of FC Harts.
He then helped Alloa recover after FC reached the third division, and in the following season with Saint-Mirren, he made his way from the start stage to winning the first division title.
According to Ross, he now feels more comfortable than ever during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlpool, Folkerk, St. Myrren and Hamilton Academical.
“I was at a crossroads,” he recalls, talking about moving to Alloa FC.
"I honestly believed that coaching was more appropriate for me than playing.
It sounds strange, because I was successful, well earned on it and reached certain heights.
But playing is not easy.
There are many challenges that need to be overcome every week.
I still face them, experiencing stress and tension, but as the head coach I feel in my place.
I have always been interested in a coaching job. I have never felt as comfortable in my adult life as after I chose this profession."

Study: 17:30 on Sunday – the perfect time for a cup of beer
Summer heat has helped boost revenue for British pubs that are experiencing not the best times, but has increased the pressure on the restaurant network.
According to calculations, sales in pubs and bars in July increased by 2.7%, while restaurant profits decreased by 4.8%.
The author of calculations Peter Martin of the organization CGA, which is engaged in consulting on the issues of business development, noted: "Thanks to the sunny weather and longer than expected, a lot more than expected, the participation of England in the World Championship.
The June fall of 1.8% in July increased.
Pubs and bars focused on serving drinks, so far have the best indicators – the growth of their profits is equivalent to the losses of restaurants.
Pubs serving food also suffered from heat, but not as much as restaurants.
It seems that visitors are only interested in a drink.
In controlled pubs and bars, sales of beverages increased by 6.6% in a month. At the same time, food sales decreased by 3%".
Paul Newman, an analyst at RSM’s leisure and hotel business, said: “We’ve been seeing similar trends since the end of April.
Weather and large-scale social or sporting events remain the main factors influencing sales in the domestic market.
It is not surprising that groups of restaurants continue to lose profits. The annual drop in sales by 4.8% causes particular concern against the background of the need to reduce expenses.
The long hot summer was not the best time for food-providing establishments. We will see if the milder temperature, which we observed in August, can give them such a necessary break".
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including with new establishments, in July amounted to 2.7%, reflecting the slowdown in the market release of new brands.
The industry indicator of sales of Coffer Peach Tracker in the UK pubs, bars and restaurants sector is a reflection of the collected and analyzed performance indicators of 47 working groups, the total turnover of which is more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion.
One in five children has a hidden account from their parents on the social network.
According to the results of the study, one in five children, sometimes at least 11 years old, has a hidden account on social networks from parents and teachers.
A study that captured 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of fictitious pages on Instagram
This news heightened concern about the possible placement of content of a sexual nature
20% of students reported that they have a "basic account" that they show to parents
One in five children, sometimes no older than 11, creates an account on social networks that hides from adults.
The study, which captured 20,000 high school students, showed an increase in the number of fictitious pages on Instagram, a social network for sharing photos.
This news has heightened concerns about the possible posting of content of a sexual nature.
20% of students reported having a clean “basic” account that they show to their parents, as well as one or more private ones.
The mother, who accidentally stumbled on the secret page of her 13-year-old daughter, saw a call there “rape me.”
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) in private schools showed that 40% of children aged 11 to 18 have two social media profiles. Half of these children admitted that the additional account and accountability
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, said: “We are very concerned that many teenagers feel a desire to create an online space in which parents and teachers will not be able to find them.
Ailey Doyle will be the "representative of the interests of the athletes" in the Scottish Athletics Council
Doyle was elected to the board of Scottish Athletics as an independent director during the annual general meeting of members of the board.
Doyle is Scotland’s most-titled lightweight. Council Chairman Jen Bitty called this step a great opportunity for those who lead the sport movement to take advantage of its wide experience gained at the international level over the last decade.
"Elyde has a great deal of respect among athletes in Scotland, the UK and the world. We are convinced that by bringing her to the council, athletic sports in Scotland will benefit greatly," said Beatty.
Doyle said: "I will act with inspiration as a representative of the interests of athletes. I hope that I can really benefit and contribute to the development of the sport in Scotland."
The American, a four-time Olympic champion who won the 200- and 400-metre races at the 1996 Games in Atlanta, and is now a sports reviewer for the BBC, lost the opportunity to walk through a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: “I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors claimed that only time would show if I could recover and how much.
Thanks to the incredible efforts, I was able to recover completely. I learned to walk again and today I do dynamic exercises!
Thank you for your support!”
In the advertisement of the sucker of women compared to cows – the opinions of Internet users divided
The manufacturer of milk extractors faced an ambiguous reaction of internet users to advertising, in which young mothers are compared to actual cows.
To mark the release of the product, called "the world's first silent nodule milksucker", the technology company-manufacturer of consumer goods Elvie released an advertisement in the style of humorous music video to demonstrate the freedom that the new mater provides.
Four real mothers dance in a blue-filled cowboy under a song that contains the words: "Yes, I feed myself, but I have no tail" and "As you can see, it's not a name, but my chest."
Then the choir sings: "Suck it up, suck it up to feed the children. Suck it up, suck it up so the milk doesn't waste."
However, the commercial, published on the company’s Facebook page, caused a turbulent online discussion.
The video received 77,000 views and hundreds of comments. However, the reaction of Internet users was ambiguous. Many noted that the advertisement underestimated the "horrendous organization" of milk production in the industry.
“It’s not a very smart decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to give milk. However, their children are taken away from them a few days after birth,” – wrote one of the users.
The Elvie Milk Vacuum Cleaner can be easily hidden in the breastfeeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Here’s another comment: “Of course, it’s traumatic for both the mother and the child.
But why not attract them for the advertising of a sucker for women who need to feed their babies?"
Another added: “This advertising is far from reality.”
Other users defended the ad. One of the women video appeared to be "very fun".
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I would definitely buy something like that if I were still breastfeeding.
By sucking the milk, I really felt like a cow.
Advertisement is a bit crazy, but I wasn’t looking for the hidden content in it.
It’s a great product,” someone wrote.
Here’s another comment: “Funny advertising focused on moms who suck milk (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like cows.
This advertisement is not aimed at highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the women show the suckers, hidden in their bras.
The concept of an advertising campaign is based on information that many women who use similar products feel like cows.
However, the vacuum cleaner Elvie works absolutely silently, has no wires or tubes and easily hides in the bra for feeding. Thanks to this, women can move freely, keep children and even go out.
Ana Ballarin, partner and executive creative director of the advertising agency Mother, commented on the situation: “The Elvie vacuum cleaner is such a revolutionary product that it required a bright and provocative presentation.
Having made a parallel between the women who sativate the milk, and the real cows, we wanted to draw attention to the features of breastfeeding, in an exciting and interesting way, demonstrating an incredible sense of freedom that will bring a new suction.
The vacuum cleaner Elvie does not get in the headlines for the first time.
As part of Fashion Week in London, the mother of two children appeared on the podium with this product during a show of clothes from the fashion designer Marty Yakubovsky.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent town on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has risen sharply, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, in part because the harsh rhetoric and policies of the Trump administration have complicated the process of placing children in caregivers.
Traditionally, in most cases, caregivers were the immigrants themselves without documents. Now they are afraid to jeopardize their own opportunity to stay in the country, offering to take responsibility for the child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential custodians and other adult members of their households would be required to give fingerprints and that this data would be passed on to immigration services.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior official at the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified to Congress that Bureau staff had arrested dozens of people who applied for unaccompanied minor care.
Later, the Bureau confirmed that 70% of the arrested did not have a criminal past.
"About 80% of people who are carers or members of their households are in the country illegally. Many of them are foreigners who have committed crimes.
That’s why we continue to persecute these people,” Mr. Albens said.
According to the asylum workers, in order to deal more quickly with children’s cases, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of the children to appear in court within a month of detention, rather than 60 days as before.
Many of them will be able to use videoconferencing instead of coming to court in person to prove their legal status before immigrant judges.
Those who do not have the right to asylum by the court’s decision will be quickly deported.
According to asylum workers and official data from responsible officials in recent months, the longer children remain in custody, the more likely they will feel anxiety or depression. This can cause outbreaks of violence or attempts to escape.
Rights defenders argue that these problems are aggravated in larger institutions, such as Tornillo, where it is more difficult to monitor the psychological state of children.
They added that by moving children to a tent town and not giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to friends, we risk aggravating the injury that many of them have already suffered.
Syria ordered the “occupation forces” of the US, France and Turkey to withdraw troops immediately
In addition, speaking before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid al-Mualem called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country has been at war for eight years.
Mualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil under the auspices of counter-terrorism, so “the treatment of them will be appropriate.”
“They have to leave immediately and not set conditions,” he said at the assembly.
Mualem insisted that the “war on terrorism is actually over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions of people have left their homes.
He said Damascus would continue “this sacred battle until we clear all the Syrian territories” from terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence.”
The U.S. has deployed some 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training and consulting Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
In a war-torn country, France sent more than 1,000 soldiers.
As for the refugees, Mualem assured that the country has created the right conditions for their return. He also accused "some Western countries" of those "spreading unjustified fears" through which refugees do not dare to return.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to help ensure that people return,” he said.
"We are watching the efforts to politicize a purely humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union are warning that they will not provide aid to Syria in the country’s recovery until a political agreement has been reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a buffer zone around Idlib, the last major siege of rebels, has created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
Thanks to the Russian-Turkish deal, it was possible to prevent a large-scale offensive of the Russian-backed Syrian forces into the province, where three million people live.
Mualem, however, stressed that the deal had “clear deadlines” and expressed hope that military action would be directed against jihadists, including militants linked to al-Qaeda’s al-Nusra Front, who “will be destroyed.”
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee, which will include government and opposition representatives, in order to develop a post-war constitution for Syria and create the conditions for elections.
Mualem set out conditions for the Syrian government to participate in the committee, saying his work should be limited to “a review of the articles of the current constitution,” and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Be Re-elected
Under this logic, Trump may be re-elected in 2020, if, as many liberal viewers are likely to hope, he will not be in power soon after the scandal and impeachment.
Without a doubt, it would be “the most dramatic completion of the presidency of all time”!
At the moment, viewers do not show signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, the number of viewers in prime time has more than doubled (up to 1.05 million) on the CNN channel and actually tripled (up to 1.6 million) on the MSNBC channel.
According to Nielsen, Fox News averaged 2.4 million viewers in prime time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and The Rachel Maddow Show on the MSNBC cable channel was at the top of the ranking with 3.5 million new viewers in the evening.
“It’s a fire that attracts people because it’s beyond our understanding,” said Neil Ber, executive producer of ABC’s “Last Candidate” drama about the Secretary of State who becomes president after a devastating attack on the Capitol.
Nell Scowell, an experienced humorist writer and author of "Just Funny Moments: And Some Tough Truths About Penetrating the Hollywood Men's Club" offers another theory.
She recalled a trip in a Boston taxi before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Trump.
“Why?” she asked.
"Because he's making me laugh," he said. That's the story Mrs. Scowell told me.
Chaos is entertaining.
Of course, unlike any other content on TV, stories from Washington are able to determine the future of Rowe’s case against Wade, the possibility of reunification of immigrant families, and the state of the world economy.
Removal is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it is not possible to say that you are only trying to stay informed citizens of the Washington Post in the past, when six hours you observe how a group of experts discuss the use of Bob Woodward "well-known" sources in the book "Fear", Jacket Paul Manafort.
For me, for example, Super Mario will never be the same again.
"The feeling of the reality show is partly related to the fact that you will be fed something new every night", – said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment. The company's "Shuttle" and the author of the television program "Ibuprofen, the Stars of the Lombard", about the rotation in the cast of the actor.
If you allow yourself to miss just one episode, you can hopelessly lag behind.
When I was able to meet Mr. Flays at his house on the north coast of Kauai Island this week, the warm sunny weather (27 degrees Celsius) stood, but he was sitting at home watching MSNBC and recording CNN.
He could not break away from television – not when Brett Kavanaugh stood before the Senate Legal Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court hung on his head.
“I remember how we created all those crazy shows in our time, and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” Mr. Flays told me.
“I saw it as a joke, but it seems they were right.”

External fundraising in the toughest midterm elections in Congress <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Not surprisingly, the 17th District of Pennsylvania is targeting additional funding, because through a cross-sectional review of the electoral districts, two current congressmen compete for one chair.
A Democrat, a member of the House of Representatives Conor Lemb, who won in another district in the additional elections last spring, joins the fight for this suburban district of Pittsburgh, whose borders have been recently changed.
Lemb is opposed to another current congressman, Republican Keith Roths, who now represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, whose borders largely coincide with the new 17th.
The maps were revised after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old boundaries of the districts were drawn for the benefit of Republicans contrary to the constitution.
Election races in the new 17th district sparked a fierce confrontation between the financial divisions of the major parties, the Democratic Party Committee on Congressional Elections (DCCC) and the Republican National Committee (NRCC).
Lemba's name became well-known in Pennsylvania after a win with a minimal advantage in the 18th district during the March additional congressional elections, which enjoyed widespread public attention.
This place was owned by Republicans for over a decade. President Donald Trump won in this district with an advantage of 20 points.
Political experts have given a slight advantage to the Democrats.
The US considered the possibility of punishing El Salvador with the support of China, but changed its mind
The diplomats recalled Washington’s weak resistance to the actions of the Dominican Republic and Panama, which had previously supported Beijing’s position.
In June 2017, Trump held a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela. Previously, Trump also had a hotel in Panama, until the partners expelled staff hired by the Trump Organization.
State Department officials have decided to recall the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to “recent decisions on Taiwan’s non-recognition,” Department spokeswoman Gezer Neuert said earlier this month.
But sanctions were only seen against El Salvador, which received about $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, in particular in the area of drug control, as well as in support of social and economic development.
The proposed fines, which envisaged reductions in financial aid and targeted restrictions on visa issuance, would be painful for this Central American country with its high levels of unemployment and murder.
According to the results of the internal meetings, officials from the states of North and Central America postponed the conference at a high level, dedicated to security and economic prosperity. A similar event took place in the United States last year, and it was considered to be a step forward in action.
But by mid-September, high-ranking officials of the administration had made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place. In fact, the issue of sanctions against El Salvador has ceased to be considered.
According to diplomats, Vice President Mike Pence is now planning to speak at a conference scheduled for mid-October, a sign that the administration considers this event very important.
At the same time, three U.S. ambassadors quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, because there were no new harsh messages or punishments from Washington.
Mr. Bolton’s representative at the White House declined to comment on details of internal discussions reported by three U.S. officials, two of whom were diplomats, on condition of anonymity.
The information provided by them was confirmed by a third-party analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on conditions of anonymity.
Learn the history <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The next inconvenience may be the report of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller on possible obstruction of justice by Trump, a weighty confirmation of why it can be found in the now available public information.
As part of his investigation, Mueller is investigating the possible link between the Trump campaign and the attack on our voting system on the part of Russia.
If the influence in Congress passes into other hands, Trump will have to report to congressmen, as well as to voters and, ultimately, single-party voters.
There are a lot of “ifs” in this case, and I don’t want to say that Trump’s fall is inevitable, just like his colleagues in Europe.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic must make a choice that determines the duration of the struggle.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup d'état against Hitler, if only the West had begun to resist him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We have failed and lost the opportunity to avoid bloodshed.
The course of history is defined by such moments of change, and the unstoppable movement of democracy is accelerating or slowing down.
There are a number of such transformational tariffs now awaiting the Americans.
What are we going to do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man on whom Mueller’s fate depends?
Rosenstein was in the spotlight when the newspaper reported that he had secretly offered to record talks with the president last year and shared his thoughts on Trump’s inconsistency with the post.
Rosenstein called the information in The Times inaccurate.
"How will we respond if the investigation in the case against Brett Cavano, which the FBI recently started, will prove to be insufficiently thorough or honest, or if Cavano's candidacy for a post in the Supreme Court will be confirmed by the Supreme Court, despite the convictions and the convictions of the sex offenders?
And, above all, will we in the medium term vote for those members of Congress who will be able to hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, bad times will come for democracy.
But I don’t think we’re going to fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported in Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to light Saturday candles on the swastika table.
Having such a legacy, can I not look with optimism into the future?”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers with optimism awaits a meeting with the Vienna Rapids
F.C. Rangers takes Rapid (Vienna) on Thursday. After an impressive niche in Spain in a game with "Villarreal" at the beginning of this month a victory over the Austrians will provide the Scottish club with a good chance of exit from the G Group L.
Due to a knee injury, midfielder Graham Dorrans was able to play for his team for the first time in the season only in a game with the Willardreal, which ended with a score of 2:2. However, he believes that the Rangers FC could use this result as a trapping for the first time.
"For us, it was a good result because Villarreal is a strong team," the 31-year-old said.
“We went into the game with the hope of getting something and got one point.
Maybe at the end of the game we could go ahead, but in general nothing, probably, can be considered a fair result.
In the first half the opponent was better, but after the break we corrected the situation in our favor.
There will be another important match in the Europa League on Thursday.
I hope we can get three points, but it will not be easy. Our future opponents showed a good result in their last game. However, we can count on the support of the fans. I am sure that we will be able to give the fight and get a positive result.
Last year, of course, was difficult, starting with my injuries and ending with changes in the club itself. But now the situation has normalized.
We have a great team, and all the guys are satisfied. Training goes well.
I hope that we can move forward, leave behind last season and achieve success.”
Women Lose Their Sleep Due to Retirement Savings
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they would like to organize care for themselves, few people spoke about it with their family members.
About half of the people who participated in the Nationwide study said they had talked to their husband or wife about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% of respondents talked about it with children.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but don’t rush to talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of the nationwide life insurance division.
Here’s what to start with.
Talk to your husband or wife and children: Your family will not be able to provide you with the necessary care unless you inform your relatives of your wishes in advance.
Consult with your counselor and family to determine where and how to get care, as this choice can become an important factor in determining the cost.
Attract a financial advisor: he can advise on how to cover the appropriate expenses.
Long-term care funding sources include a traditional insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance accumulation policy, or self-insurance at the expense of your own funds (provided you have money).
Carefully prepare legal documents: this will allow you to avoid legal harassment in advance.
Prepare trust for your representative, who will monitor your medical care and will make sure that the specialists fulfill your wishes in case you are unable to do so in person.
In addition, we advise to arrange a trust on the disposal of cash costs.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and pay the bills in the event of your insolvency.
Do not forget about the minor details. Imagine that one of your elderly parents needs urgent medical attention, so he is taken to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write down this information to be ready.
"It's not just about finances. It's important who the doctors are," says Martin,
What medications can be taken and
Who takes care of the dog.
Prepare such a plan.”

The man was shot several times by a pneumatic rifle when he returned home from the party.
The 40-year-old was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and arm.
The officers described the shooting, which took place at 2:30 a.m. in British summer time, as an "accident."
The victim did not see the attacker.
His wounds are not life-threatening, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, government officials said, but the number of deaths could increase.
Due to the withdrawal of the means of communication, officials engaged in the provision of humanitarian assistance, can not receive any information from the regency of Dongala, an area north of Pal, which is located closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 bat.
After the natural disaster, 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
We will give a few basic facts about the city of Palu on the island of Sulawesi and the regency of Dongala.
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, located at the end of the narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an approximate population of 379,800 according to data for 2017.
When an earthquake triggered a tsunami, the city celebrated its 40th anniversary.
Dongala is a regency that extends over 300 km (180 miles) along the coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
According to data for 2017, in the regency, the administrative region, located in the lower part of the province, lives approximately 299,200 people.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main economic sectors of the Central Sulawesi Province, especially the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel production is also important in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Morovala, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian agency for mitigating the effects of natural disasters over the past 100 years, Palu and Dongala have suffered from a tsunami several times.
In 1938, a tsunami in Donggala killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, a tsunami also covered the western part of Dongala, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismicly active Pacific Ring of Fire and regularly suffers from earthquakes.
Below are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years.
2004: On December 26, a severe earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Acheg, located in the north of Sumatra, caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, as a result of which along the coast of the Indian Ocean died 226,000 people.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake shook southern Java, Indonesia’s most populous island, and caused a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing some 700 people.
2009: Near the city of Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra province, an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6 was recorded.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake rocked one of the Mentavai islands near Sumatra and caused a tsunami up to 10 meters high, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake hit the Podjaya regency in Acheg province, causing destruction and panic due to the fact that people have not yet managed to forget the devastating earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died under the ruins of the buildings.
2018: Severe earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed many houses, and thousands of tourists could not leave the island at once.
Sarah Paylin's eldest son was arrested on charges of domestic violence.
Track Paylin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for vice president Sarah Paylin, was arrested on charges of assault.
According to a report published on Saturday by the Alaska State Police, 29-year-old Peylin from Wassilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence and charged with obstructing the reporting of a case of violence and arrest.
According to a police report, when a familiar woman tried to call the police to report possible crimes, he picked up her phone.
According to KTUU, Peylin is in custody in the Matanuska-Susitna investigative insulator with the right to make a $500 bail.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared himself "innocent" when asked if he would confess his guilt, the network reported.
Peylin is accused of three Class A offenses, which include a one-year arrest and a $250,000 fine.
He is also accused of class B offenses, which is punishable by a $2,000 fine and imprisonment.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Peylin.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Payline.
His mother, Sarah Payline, called the police and reported a possible attack.
The case is currently under consideration by the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, as well as for obstructing the reporting of a case of domestic violence and carrying a weapon in a state of alcoholic intoxication when the incident occurred.
His girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Paylin was criticized by veteran groups for justifying her son's cruel behavior with post-traumatic stress disorder after serving in Iraq.
Earthquake In Indonesia Caused Tsunami: Hundreds of People Killed
At least 384 people died after the earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed hundreds of homes.
Communications and power grids have come out of order, and the number of victims may increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred near the center of the island of Sulawesi, located in the northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
The video, which is circulating on social networks, shows the moment when the element hit.
Hundreds of people gathered at a festival on the beach of the city of Palu, when a tsunami fell ashore.
Federal Prosecutors Demand Rare Death Penalty for Suspected Terrorist in New York City
In New York, federal prosecutors are demanding the death penalty of Saifullo Saipov, a suspect in the New York attack, which resulted in the deaths of eight people – a rare punishment that was not applied in the state for a year.
They claim that in October, 30-year-old Saipov driving a rented in Home Depot pickup went on a bicycle path along the highway in West Side, Lower Manhattan, and began to hit cyclists and pedestrians who hit him.
According to a report of intent to achieve execution filed in the Southern District of New York State to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight people and "intentionally" committed serious bodily harm.
According to the court documents, each of these charges provides for the possibility of the death penalty.
Several weeks after the attack, the Federal Judiciary Court filed a 22-point charge against Saipo, in particular eight counts of murder for the purpose of a lawsuit that federal prosecutors usually sue and sue in cases related to organized crime.
According to the prosecutors, who described the crime committed by Saipoh as "horrendous, cruel and malicious," this attack is the result of "careful planning and preconceived thought."
Victims to whom Saifula Habibullaevich Saipov inflicted injuries, injured or killed were Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, Ann-Laura Decadt, Darren Drake, Arnold Erlich, Ernand Ferrocchi.
Five of the dead were tourists from Argentina.
It has been ten years since a criminal case was last opened in the Southern District of New York, which is punishable by the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of murdering two drug suppliers, and was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty for the federal case was carried out in New York in 1953. The married couple of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, did not show any conscientious objections in the days and months following the attack.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he did not regret what was done.
According to the indictment, Saipov informed the authorities that he was inspired to carry out an attack on the video of ISIS, which he was watching on his phone.
The police say he also asked to hang the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He did not plead guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "very disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a guilty plea and to sentence a life sentence without the possibility of release will only intensify the psychological trauma caused by these events to all those affected,” Patton said.
The Saipov defense has also previously asked the defendants not to seek the death penalty.
MEP from the Conservative Party believes that INDEPENDENT FARADJA should be appointed responsible for negotiations on Brexit
Today, during a protest at the Conservative Party’s congress, Nigel Farage promised to “mobilize the People’s Army.”
The former leader of the UK Independence Party said politicians should “feel the pressure” of Eurosceptics, as one of the MPs Theresa May proposed her candidacy for negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bowen said at a march in Birmingham that the United Kingdom “would have come out already” if Mr Farage was Brexit secretary.
Paying attention to May’s problems in trying to reconcile her deeply divided lines has even more drawn attention to the fact that MPs from the Conservative Party who oppose the exit have joined a special protest in the city against Brexit.
The prime minister is working hard to implement the Chequers compromise plan, despite attacks by Brexit supporters, those against the exit, and the EU.
The Allies insist that it will not abandon attempts to negotiate with Brussels, despite a negative reaction, and will force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between what it proposes and “chaos.”
At a Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull, Mr. Bowen said he wanted "to give up Chequers".
He offered Mr. Faraday to step out of the shadows and take responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was responsible for this, we would have left,” he said.
Wellingboro added: “I will support Brexit, but we have to give up Chequers.”
Speaking against the EU, he said: “We fought in world wars not to submit.
We want to adopt our own laws in our own country.”
Mr Bowen rejected the assumption that after the 2016 vote, public opinion changed: "The idea that the British have changed their mind and do not want to leave is absolutely inconsistent with reality."
Conservative Party member and Brexit proponent Andrea Jenkins, who was also on the march, told reporters: “I’m just saying, ‘Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is unpopular among the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is not supported by our party and our activists, who are actually walking the streets and fighting for voters’ votes.
Please turn off the Chequers and start listening.”
In an address to Theresa May, she added: "Prime Ministers keep their positions when they keep their promises."
Farage said politicians should “feel the pressure” if they are going to give up the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s a question of trust between us, the people and our political elite,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and we’re here today to say it won’t come out of their hands.”
In a statement to the crowd full of enthusiasm, he added: “I want our political elite, which is planning to betray the idea of Brexit, to feel pressure on themselves.
We are mobilizing this country’s people’s army, which will lead us to victory in Brexit and will never calm down until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, opponents of the exit took place in Birmingham, and then held a two-hour rally in the city center.
Several activists waved “Conservatives against Brexit” banners after launching the group this weekend.
Labour’s Lord Adonis laughed at the Conservatives because after the opening of the conference because of their party program there were security problems.
“These are people who tell us that they can use the IT systems and technologies needed for Canada-plus, a well-organized border, free trade with Ireland,” he said.
"It's a complete farce.
There is nothing good about Brexit,” he added.
Warren Plans to “Seriously Think” About Voting for President
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has said that after the November election, she will “think seriously about running for president.”
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday, during a general meeting in West Massachusetts, a representative of the Democratic Party from Massachusetts spoke about her future.
Warren, who frequently criticizes President Donald Trump, is running for a second term in November against Republican Jeff Dela, who was a co-chair of Trump’s 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
It is considered to be the main candidate that can fight Trump in 2020.
On Saturday, her 36th meeting with the electorate in the form of general assemblies has taken place since Trump took office.
The participant asked her if she planned to take part in the presidential election.
Warren said, “It’s time for women to go to Washington and get the government to work, and for that, there should be a woman at the head.”
Suspect of Assassination of LSU Tigers Basketballer Sims Arrested
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on Saturday reported that they arrested the suspect in the murder of gun-armed basketball player LSU Tigers Wade Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Ditton Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m. Eastern Time.
On Friday, they published a video of the shooting with a request to help identify the person on it.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot on Friday morning near the campus of the University of Southtern.
"Vaid Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and died as a result," Murphy J. Paul, the police chief, told 247sports on Saturday.
Wade gave up on his friend, and Simpson shot him.
As a result of the interrogation, it was found that Simpson was at the scene of the crime, had a gun with him and shot Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incidents and taken into custody in the East Baton County Police Department.
Sims, whose height was 6 feet and 6 inches and who played in the junior league, grew up in Baton Rouge. He played 32 games with 10 stars last season and spent an average of 17.4 minutes per game on the field, scoring 5.6 points and 2,
Russia’s Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton has cut back on his fight for the World Champion title after the team decided to give him a victory over Sebastian Fattel.
From the moment Walter Bottas left behind Lewis Hemilton on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes’ team decisions would play a significant role in the race.
Bottas started well from the pole position and almost bypassed Hemilton, who was trying to keep his position in the first two laps and gave Fattel the opportunity to attack his teammate.
Fettel went on a pit stop first and left Hemilton on the track in the queue of the race, which had nothing to do with it.
The Mercedes team pilot passed another round and came out behind Fattel, but Hemilton broke out in the leader after a certain wheel-to-wheel maneuver, as a result of which the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the result in the back of the treble and the result in the internal space due to the risk, which then hit him.
On his 21st birthday, Max Ferstappen started from the back row of the grid and remained in seventh place until the end of the first round.
Sweat led most of the race as he did not change the tyre to quickly get to the finish and move Kimi Rykkonen from fourth place.
As a result, he stopped at the pit stop in the 44th round, but was unable to increase the pace to the last eight, so Raikkonen took fourth place.
“It’s a difficult day because Valtteri taught full-time on all weekends and showed nobility when he gave me the opportunity to pass.
The team did an exceptional job to take first and second place,” said Hemilton.
The body language was not impressed.
At a rally on Saturday, President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Diane Feinstein for her firm stance that she did not disclose the contents of a letter by Christine Blaise Ford, which accuses Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual violence.
During a speech at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly appeal to evidence given by Ford before the Senate Legal Committee, but instead expressed his opinion on the events in the Senate, which, according to him, demonstrated human "poorness, contempt and disgust".
“The only thing that could happen, and all the wonderful things that have happened in the last few days in the Senate, is anger, you see evil people showing stupidity, disgust and lies,” he said.
“You look at the publications and the published information, and then they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do that.
It's not me."
You remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you disclose the information?
Remember her answer... Did you publish the contents of the documents? – “What?
Oh, no.
I didn’t announce it.”
Hold on a second.
Did we announce?... No, we did not announce,” he added, copying the senator’s behavior.
In July, Feinstein received a letter detailing Ford’s accusations against Cavano, and in early September its content was made public, but Feinstein denied that the leak had occurred in her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s accusations, I didn’t disclose the information I received from her,” Feynstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep it a secret, and I didn’t break the promise.”
However, her denial seems to dislike the president, who commented during Saturday's rally: "I'll tell you, her body language wasn't impressed at all.
“Maybe she didn’t, but I haven’t seen anyone get worse.”
Continuing to defend a candidate for the Supreme Court, whom three women were accused of sexual violence, the president suggested that Democrats are using the accusations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to return to power by any means necessary.
You see stupidity, disgust, they all have one thing to insult, one that needs to be overcome to gain power and control,” the president said.
Elite League: "Dandy Stars" – "Belfast Jayants", 5:3
"Jayants" player Patrick Dwyer dropped two washers in a match against Dandy
The Dandy Stars were rehabilitated for Friday's Elite League defeat by the Belfast Jayants, winning a 5:3 match on Saturday.
The "Jayants" gained an early lead in two laps thanks to the throws of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bovilier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney matched the score in the home game, and then Dwyer again brought the Jayants forward.
Dandy player Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bushar equalized the score, and two goals by Lucas Lundwald Nielsen ensured their victory.
This is the third defeat of Adam Kif's team in the elite league season, who won a 2:1 victory over Dandy on Friday night in Belfast.
This is the fourth team meeting of the season. Three previous matches were won by the team of the Jayants.
Dwyer dropped the first scoop in the fourth minute (3:35) after the transfer of Kendall McFoll, and four minutes later Boville, who received the scoop from David Racerford, doubled the bill.
After a tense first period in the 14th minute (13:10) Sullivan returned the field owners to the game, and in the 16th minute (15:16) Couni, having received a towel from Matt Markward, equaled the score.
Dwyer secured the Jayants' lead ahead of the first break, dropping his second washer at the end of the first period.
The owners of the field regrouped, and Bushar on twenty-eight minutes (27:37) again equalized the count, throwing the washer when his team was numerically overpowered.
Thanks to the efforts of Cooney and Charles Corcoran Nielsen at the end of the second period, Dandy took the lead for the first time and secured his team's victory in the fifth half of the final period.
On Friday, the Jayants, who have already lost four of the last five games, will play an outing match against Milton Kines.
The air traffic controller died so that hundreds of people on the plane could avoid the earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller has been declared a hero after he helped take off a plane with hundreds of people at the cost of his own life.
More than 800 people were killed and many were missing after a powerful earthquake that caused a tsunami on the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
Strong underground shocks continue to shake the area, many people found themselves under siege in the city of Palu.
However, unlike his colleagues, who fled to save his life, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post in the heavily-dispersed control tower at the Mutiara SIS Al-Jufri airport in Palu.
He remained in place to make sure that flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was on the runway at the time, was safely lifted into the air.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it was being destroyed.
He later died in the hospital.
A spokesman for Indonesia’s aviation service provider, Johannes Sirait, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian news agency ABC News.
We have prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan, which is to deliver it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palo.
“We are very sorry to hear about this,” he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the number of casualties could reach thousands, as the agency to mitigate the consequences of the country’s natural disasters says that access to the cities of Dongala, Sighi and Butong is limited.
"The number of victims may increase because many of the bodies are still in ruins, and many of them cannot be reached," said agency representative Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
The waves, which reached a height of six meters, devastated the city of Palu, in which mass funerals will be held on Sunday.
Military and passenger aeroplanes deliver aid and foodstuffs.
Riza Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute ambulance brings the body.
There is not enough clean water.
Mini-markets are looted everywhere.”
The head of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Indonesia, Jan Gelfand, told CNN: "The Red Cross of Indonesia is in a hurry to help people who have survived this tragedy, but we do not know what they will find there.
It’s a tragedy, but it can get much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Vidodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
“Are you ready?” he told CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes on the island of Lombok, which killed more than 550 people.
A plane crash in Micronesia: as stated in Air Niugini, after the plane crashed into the lagoon one man disappeared unconscious
The airline, which carried out the flight, which suffered a disaster in the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia, now says that one person has disappeared, although previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the plane.
Air Niugini said it was not possible to find a single passenger on Saturday.
The airline reports that its representatives are trying to find a man and cooperate with local authorities, hospitals and investigators for this purpose.
The airline did not immediately respond to a request to provide more detailed information about the passenger, for example, about his age and nationality.
The local boats helped save other passengers and crew after the plane crashed when it tried to land at the Chuuk Island airport.
On Friday, officials said that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday, and all of them were in a stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events are unknown.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses believe that the plane has flown over the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Janes said the plane was flying very low above the ground.
"It's very good," said Janes.
Janes said that he and others managed to get to the emergency exits of the sinking plane while in the water.
He said the guards were panicking and screaming, and that he had a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that sailors who worked close to modernizing the dock also helped in the rescue operation, bringing people ashore using an inflatable boat before the plane sank at a depth of 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, over the past two decades, 111 people have died in plane crashes related to registered in PNG airlines, but Air Niugini is not included in this list.
Analyst restores chronology of the night in which a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the indictment filed a case against a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified as an expert in the field of operational development for several hours.
He told jury members how he used cell phone footage to reproduce the movement of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of the murder.
Roulett, as reported by The Clarion Ledger, said he had received location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was from Chambers the night she died, contradicting his previous claim.
When the data showed that his cell phone was near Chambers, although he said he was with his friend Michael Senford, the police went to talk to the latter.
On Saturday, Senford testified and declared that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was at the pickup that night in Senford, Senford said he was "lying because my pickup was at Nashville."
Another discrepancy was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers about two weeks before her death.
Recordings of phone conversations indicated that they knew each other for only a week.
Roulett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis had removed Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He's taking her out of his life," Gail said.
The defense is due to make its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge expects the trial to be handed over to the jury later on the same day.
The High Breed: What is Conscious Hip-Hop?
Trio hip-hop performers want to challenge a negative view of the genre, filling their music with constructive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol argues that hip hop has changed its nature – gone from political ideas and struggles to solve social problems.
They want to go back to the leaks and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently witnessed a revival of this direction in the United Kingdom thanks to bands such as Akala and Lowkey.
Is there another dark skin?
In New York, a nanny filed a lawsuit against a couple for dismissal, receiving a "racist" message
In New York, a nanny filed a lawsuit against a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving an incorrectly addressed message from her mother complaining that she was “another dark-skinned.”
The couple denies that they are racist, comparing the lawsuit with "demand".
Linsie Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed concern when she saw that the new nanny, Giselle Morris, who came on her first working day in 2016, was dark skin.
“NO, THERE’S ONE OTHER TIMES,” Ms. Plasco-Flaksman wrote to her husband in a message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Ms. Morris twice.
As reported by the New York Post, realizing her mistake, Mrs. Plaxon-Flaksman felt "uncomfortable" and fired Mrs. Morris. She stated that their previous nanny, who was an African-American, was poorly performing her job and that instead she was eye-catching.
Ms. Morris was paid for one day of work and then sent home on Uber.
Now Morris is suing the couple, hoping to receive a compensation for the discharge in the amount of pay that she would receive in six months of work with the spouse for whom she was originally hired, although without a contract. Her day had to be paid 350 nanar up to.
“I want to show them that you don’t have to do that,” she said Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
In response to accusations that they were racist, the couple said that the release of Morris was a sensible decision, as they feared they would not be able to trust her after being insulted.
“My wife didn’t mean what I sent her.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,” her husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But would you leave your children with the person you've been rude to, even if it wasn't intentional?
Your baby ?
A REVIEW."
Comparing the lawsuit with the "decrease", Plasco said that his wife gave birth to the child only two months ago and "hasn't recovered yet".
“Would you take revenge on someone after that?
This is a bad act,” added the investment banker.
While the trial is still ongoing, the public opinion court quickly condemned the couple on social media, criticizing their behavior and logic.
As told in the new letter, Paddington's publishers feared that readers would not understand the idea of a bear who is able to speak
Bond's daughter Karen Yankel, who was born almost immediately after they agreed to print the book, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it was published.
Now it’s funny because we know about the huge success that Paddington’s story has achieved.”
Telling that her father, who worked as a BBC operator before a small toy bear inspired him to write a children's book, optimistic that his work was rejected, she shared an adage, as on the 60th anniversary of the book's release at the same time.
Regarding Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family," Karen added that her father was quietly proud of the book's popularity.
“He was a very modest man and didn’t like to brag,” she said.
"But Paddington was as real to him as his own child! After all, when children achieve something, we are proud of them, although it is not theirs, not our victories.
I think he looked at Paddington's success just like that.
Although Paddington was the creation of his imagination, he always attributed success to him.”
My daughter died, and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
After landing her daughter was taken to 2 hospitals named Louis Pasteur in Nice, where doctors unsuccessfully tried to save her life.
"I called him regularly, said that everything was really bad, that she shouldn't have done it," Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz said.
"And then Nad called me and told me that she would die within the next two minutes and I should say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Daddy, I love you very much.
I'll be with you soon.
I will be with you.”
The medications that doctors gave her to keep her heart beating gradually stopped acting and left the body.
She died some time before everything was turned off.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing what was going on at this time.
I couldn’t complain, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really should have held it in my hands.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz, who was burning because of the loss of her daughter, sat on the plane along with other passengers, not paying attention to the severe trials that she had to endure.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
"I lowered my head and couldn't hold back tears.
It’s hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I began to deeply sympathize with Nada.
He needed my love and support.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Two Women Suffering Leave Postcards to Prevent Suicides on Bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones because of suicide work to prevent others from putting their hands on themselves.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys leave on the Wall Street Bridge postcards with phone numbers that people can call for support, as well as messages that would ask them to inspire.
Mrs. Davis Tyler’s son was 13 when he began suffering from depression, and at the age of 18 he put his hands on himself.
“I don’t want other parents to feel the same way I do every day,” she said.
The 45-year-old Miss Davis, who lives in Leeds, said her son was a promising chef with an attractive smile.
"Everyone knew him for a smile.
“They always said that this smile made any room brighter,” he said.
But he quit his job before he died because he was “like in the dark.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, then 11, found his brother’s body after he laid his hands on himself.
Ms. Davis says, “I’m constantly afraid that this will have consequences.”
Ms. Davis created postcards, "so that people know there are those they can talk to and talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don’t shut yourself up, you need to talk.”
Ms. Humphreys, who had been friends with Ms. Davis for many years, lost her husband, Mark, with whom she lived for 15 years, shortly after his mother’s death.
“He didn’t say he felt depressed, he had depression or anything like that,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed that it had changed.”
And on the day of Christmas he was finally disillusioned with the spirit. When the children opened their gifts, he did not look them in the eyes either."
She told me that his death was a huge trauma for them, but they have to go through it: "It's been devastating.
Follow the family.
But we must continue to live and fight.”

The future of Brett Kavanaugh hangs on his hair: FBI starts investigation
“I thought that if we could get what we asked for — limited in time and nature of the investigation — we might have reached a certain agreement,” Mr. Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee would “break down” against the backdrop of a hopeless loss.
Why did Mr. Cavano and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance has to do with time.
The midterm elections will be held in just five weeks, on November 6. If, as expected, Republicans will have problems, this will seriously complicate their attempts to hold their own person through elections to the Supreme Court of the country.
George W. Bush phoned the senators with a request to support Mr. Cavano, who was working at the White House under Mr. Bush and thanks to which he met his wife Ashley, who was working as Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI prepares its report?
In the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are sitting, the vote will take place.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes at a Senate meeting, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to solve the problem with the same number of votes and approve his candidacy for the post of Judge.
During Kim's rule, the number of North Korean runners "decreased"
After Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, the number of runners from North Korea to South Korea has shrunk, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Pak Pyong Seug, citing data from the Ministry of Unification of the Republic of South Korea, said that last year the number of runners was 1,127 compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Pak said the key factors were the strengthening of border controls between North Korea and China, as well as the fact that smugglers who transport illegals are now demanding more money for it.
In Pyongyang, they abstained from public comments.
The vast majority of runners from North Korea eventually offer South Korea’s nationality.
In Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans illegally crossed the border after the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea. It is easier to cross than a well-protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China views migrants as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are still formally at war, have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang and discussed the issues of denuclearization, the negotiations on which came to a halt.
This happened after the historic meeting of US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, where they agreed on a common ground to cooperate on nuclear disarmament on the Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the United States of failing to make any progress since.
“Without trust in the United States, we cannot be confident in the security of our country, so under these circumstances there can be no talk of unilateral disarmament,” Ri Yon-Ho said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Bretta Cavano "hysterical" and says he's not fit for Supreme Court work
The minority leader in the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi called the candidate for the post of Supreme Court Judge Brett Cavano "hysterical" and stated that he is temperamentally not suitable for work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi expressed her views in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I’ve always thought that if a woman ever acted like this, they would call her ‘hysterical’,” Pelosi commented on her response to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Legal Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations of sexual violence against Dr. Christine Blaise Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his introductory speech, Cavano behaved very emotionally, sometimes almost yelling and coughing, discussing his family and school years.
He also openly denounced the Democrats on the committee, calling the charges against him an “absurd and coordinated destruction of reputation” organized by liberals who were outraged by Hillary Clinton’s loss in the 2016 presidential election.
According to Pelosi, Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he cannot work in the Supreme Court, as it showed his bias toward Democrats.
"I think with these statements, as well as his speech against Clinton and the Democrats, he will personally run his candidacy," she said.
Pelosi was outraged when asked if she would try to declare Cavano impeachment if his guilt was confirmed and if Democrats would get a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’m going to say this: if he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, it’s not just for the Supreme Court, it’s for the court where he works right now,” Pelosi said.
Cavano is currently serving as a judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about possible decisions by Cavano against the “On Affordable Medical Care” law or the “Rou v. Wade” case because he is considered a conservative judge.
At his hearings on the issue of approval of the position, Kavanaugh sided with the question of whether he would annul some decisions of the Supreme Court.
“It’s not the time for a judge to become a hysterical, biased person and we’ll say how great that is,” Pelosi said.
Women should be able to have this weapon.
These are just words that contained accrued anger for months and years, and she could not pronounce them without tears.
“We cry when we get angry,” she told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, do you?"
She continued: "A woman who worked as an executive somewhere and helped me a lot, said that she was also crying when she got angry, but she had her own technique. When she got angry and started crying, she said to the interviewer through the window: "You can think that I'm sorry.
I am evil.”
After that, she just continued.
I thought it was unbelievable.”
Tears are considered an admissible outlet of anger in part because they are perceived differently.
One of my clearest memories of the first job in the office, in which mostly men worked, was a situation when one time I cried out with inexpressible anger, and an older woman – an unwelcome manager, which I was always a little afraid of.
“Never let them see you cry,” she told me.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They’ll think you’re sad, and they’ll be glad they got to you.”
Patricia Schröder, the then Democratic congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Garth in the presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Garth was caught on an extramarital liaison aboard a boat called Monkey Business, after which he got out of the race, deeply disappointed Ms. Schröder decided that there was no reason why she could not run for president.
“It wasn’t a very thoughtful decision,” she told me with a laugh after 30 years.
“There were seven other candidates in the race, and one more candidate is the last thing they needed.”
Someone called the situation "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
Since it was at the end of the campaign, she was left behind in the fundraising, so she promised herself that she would not take part in the race if she did not raise $2 million.
It was a hopeless struggle.
She found that some of her supporters, who did not regret the support of the men $1,000, gave her only $250.
“Do they think they’ll give me a discount?” she was surprised.
When she gave a speech and announced that she would not hold an official campaign, she was covered with emotions – gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system, which made it very difficult to raise money and forced the party to focus on voters as well as on members of the House of Representatives.
“You would think I had a nervous breakdown,” recalls Ms Schröder’s reaction to the press.
You would think that Kleenex is my corporate sponsor.
I was still thinking about what they were going to write on my tombstone?
“Did she cry?”
How the U.S.-China Trade War Could Benefit Beijing
Experts believe that the first steps in the trade war between the US and China have been desperate, and although far ahead of its completion, a long-term split between the countries could benefit Beijing.
U.S. President Donald Trump made the first warning shots earlier this year, taxing major Chinese export goods, including solar cells, steel and aluminum.
The worst situation this week has exacerbated by new tariffs on goods totalling $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), which actually tax half of all goods coming into the United States from China.
Beijing paid back the same coin each time, recently imposing tariffs ranging from five to ten percent on U.S. goods worth $60 billion.
China has pledged to take similar U.S. measures, and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to miss the opportunity to keep that promise anytime soon.
Forcing Washington to step down means agreeing to the demands, but for Chinese President Xi Jinping, U.S. public worship is too shameful.
However, experts believe that if Beijing takes the right advantage of the situation, the pressure in a trade war with the United States could give China an advantage in the long run, reducing the relationship between the two economies.
"A quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that will lead to a sharp economic downturn in any of the countries. And this actually poses a greater threat than New Center observers have previously recognized as a matter of concern to the Security," said Analyst Abigail Grays.
Foreign Minister Says Syria Is “Ready” to Return Refugees
In Syria, they say they are ready for the voluntary return of refugees and seek help in the recovery of a country devastated by a war that lasted more than seven years.
Speaking before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid al-Mualem said that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today, the real situation has become more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rebuild the areas destroyed by terrorists so that people can return to normal life.
All the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that they had to leave due to terrorism, as well as unilateral economic measures, which affected their daily lives and limited the means of existence, have now been created.
According to UN estimates, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
A further six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said the Syrian government would be pleased to receive assistance in restoring the war-torn country.
But he stressed that they would not accept conditional aid or assistance from countries that support the coup.
Europe confirms victory at the "Rider Cup" in Paris
The European team won the Rider Cup in 2018, when it defeated the U.S. team with a score of 16.5:10.5 at Le Golf National in the suburbs of Paris, France.
The U.S. team has suffered defeats in Europe for the sixth time in a row and has not won the Ryder Cup tournament since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when the team of Danish captain Thomas Byorn scored 14.5 points, which they needed to win over the United States.
American star Phil Michaelson, who has tried most of the tournament, broke his first long-distance hit on the 16th moon par-3 in the water and succumbed to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari won in all his rounds and became one of four players who have ever played 5–0–0 since the start of the tournament in the modern format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spit suffered defeats with an account of 5:4 from the player with the lowest rating in the European team Turbyern Olesen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, who ranks first in the world rankings, stepped down with a 2–1 score to Jan Poulter from England, who may have taken part in the Ryder Cup tournament last.
Spanish Sergio Garcia, a veteran of the Rider Cup, who has already participated in the tournament eight times, became the European, who won the tournament the most times of all time, bringing in 25.5 points in his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t do anything today.
It was a tough year.
Thank you Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, I'm so happy to turn the cup.
It’s a team’s merit and I’m glad I was able to help,” Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a said, not holding back his emotions after winning in Europe.
He gives the relay to his compatriot John Remus, who on Sunday defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods in a single game with a score of 2–1.
"I feel incredible pride in winning over Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this guy," Ram, 23, said in a statement.
In France, Woods lost all four games and now has a career record for the Ryder Cup tournament 13–21–3.
A strange statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 Major tournaments, outscoring only Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team has been trying to get to the fervey zone all weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finnau, who have shown high-class golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Fourick said of his team after an unsettling performance: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning, we did not dominate Europe for a long time.
We were fighting.
I take my hat off in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players played very well.
We are regrouping, I will work with the Association of Professional Golf Players of the United States and the Ryder Cup tournament committee, and we will move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You can't not praise them.
We've lost."
Up-to-date information about the red tide: reduction of concentration in the districts of Pinellas, Manat and Sarasota
