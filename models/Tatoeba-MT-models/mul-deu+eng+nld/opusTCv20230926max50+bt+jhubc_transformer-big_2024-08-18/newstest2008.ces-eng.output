Inflation in Europe is on the rise due to food
The accelerating inflation in the euro area is mainly due to the constant increase in food prices.
The November price increase in 13 eurozone countries was higher than expected, after 2.6 per cent annual inflation was recorded at 3.1 per cent in October, the Luxembourg Statistical Office of the Union said.
The official forecast was only 3%, Bloomberg reported.
Unlike the U.S., UK and Canadian issuing banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered the basic interest rate, with the reduction, along with rising commodity prices and falling unemployment, leading to an inflationary spiral.
The ECB would like to keep the inflation rate below 2%, but close to them.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in an absurd situation: it must “remove” inflation so that it does not have to do anything about it later.
In Germany, November’s inflation represents a 3.3 per cent 15-year record; in Spain it rose from 3.6 per cent to 4.1 per cent.
Inflation in the euro area has erupted due to sharply rising food and energy prices.
Term wheat prices have risen by 88 percent, and soybean prices have reached their highest since 1973.
In 2007, it was also necessary to pay significantly more for edible oil and dairy products.
The price of oil in the world markets this year rose by 52 percent and last month already cost one barrel of black gold almost $100.
According to the ECB, inflation will jump from 2.1 per cent this year to 2.5 per cent in 2008, but it will already fall to 1.9 per cent in 2009.
According to analysts, the level of 12-month inflation in the next 3-4 months will remain at about 3%, but its average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to immediately reduce interest rates twice during 2008.
Gallup sees government crisis
After a prolonged stagnation at the beginning of December, the Fidesz movement's supporters' circle has grown significantly, and now has the largest camp since 2002, while in the case of socialists the Gallup Institute has never measured such a low - 13 per cent support.
In the case of certain party voters, the difference - due to the greater determination of the opposition voters - would represent more than two-thirds (71%) of support against the fifth support of the ICTY.
According to the survey, the MDF and the USSR are below the threshold for entry into parliament: their support within the entire population is 2%.
Among some of the party’s voters, the supporters of both camps are one percent more.
Public opinion on the economy has also deteriorated from the previous low - there has never been a ratio of those who consider the economic situation of the country to be very bad, so high - 41 percent, while according to the other 46 percent, the situation is quite bad.
Families are now more pessimistic about changing their material situation after spring and summer prospects.
As for next year, the majority of the population expects further deterioration and only a tenth to improve.
In December, 71 percent of respondents judged, the most of all Gallup’s surveys to date, that the prime minister is doing his job rather badly than well.
Ferenc Gyurcs<0xC3><0xA1>ny believes or very believes 13 percent of the respondents, while Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n's share of the supporters is 38 percent.
The prime minister is not believed by 54 percent, the leader of the Fidesz movement by 27 percent.
One of the indicators of the development of the political situation is how much of the public believes that dissatisfaction with the prime minister can be resolved without changing the government.
While, after last October’s unrest, the continuation of the government and the prime minister was deemed desirable by 35 per cent, at present the share is only 20 per cent, with the relative majority (33 per cent) seeing a solution only in the run-off of new elections.
In the interest of the referendum, it is significant that 60 percent of respondents answered a question regarding their possible participation, that the referendum would certainly have come, and another 20 percent said that it would likely have come.
By comparison, the "parliamentary elections held this Sunday" would certainly only be attended by 55 percent and the other 15 percent would consider their participation probable. The success of the referendum would be unquestionable on the basis of current intentions.
He would say no to 74, to the doctor's fees 79, and to the hospital's fees 84 percent.
If we look at the same proportions only in the circle of people who certainly promise their participation, then the introduction of school fees, doctor fees and hospital stay fees would be rejected by 81, 84 and 89 percent.
The most expensive is Auchan, almost a fifth offset by Tesco
The hypermarkets in the Buda stock market triangle maintained last year an average of 16 per cent increase in price levels, with the difference that there was no increase in VAT this year.
Article of the Journal of the Daily Economy
The usual Christmas shopping basket of the newspaper Napi Gazdas<0xC3><0xA1>g in the Buda market triangle this year increased by an average of 16%, but in all hypermarkets the price showed an increase of notably over a thousand forints.
As food prices in supermarkets "exited" as early as last December, the percentage did not show such a drastic overdraft due to the previous high base.
However, it is certainly unfortunate for consumers that what they could buy last year quietly for the price of under nine thousand forints, they will not buy now even for ten thousand.
The consumer basket of the Daily Economy in the hypermarkets investigated exceeded the psychological limit of ten thousand forints by at least 91 forints.
The highest price of the basket was 10,573 forints.
(In 2003, the consumer basket cost 6,800 forints.)
The price of Unica and live fish remained almost at the level of last year, but of course they were very upset by cruel breasts, nuts and also maca.
The prices of bread and flour corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office, although in Auchan we found a kilogram of bread for 139 forints.
The competition did not go with the price of the product under 200 forints.
Similarly, it was surprising in this store that the price of two-liter Coca-Cola in a return bottle was under 200 forints, so the product cost only 257 forints.
However, this year, according to the consumer basket of Napi Gazdas<0xC3><0xA1>g Auchan appeared as the most expensive, while Cora as the cheapest.
According to our calculations, the prices listed in the consumer basket of the journal Napi Gazdas<0xC3><0xA1>g have increased in relation to the prices of the year on Christmas Cora by 15, while Tesco and Auchan by about 18 percent.
When comparing last year’s highest and this year’s lowest consumer basket value, the difference was 12 percent, while the increase between last year’s lowest and this year’s highest was 21 percent.
In forints, the average increase was 1,480.
The average increase in prices last year was 1,206 forints, with prices being influenced by the increase in VAT last year.
It is this process that has disrupted the trade, and it is obvious that retailers have not been able to decide how large price ranges are to be determined for individual products, since they have not been able to predict the effect of the change in prices on consumption.
(If a trader plans the speed of circulation of a given product incorrectly, the price range adjusted to the intensity of circulation may result in a significant loss of profit.)
Due to VAT, the increase in the price of the consumer basket of the Napi Gazdas<0xC3><0xA1>g newspaper last year was so extreme that the price of the most expensive basket was 1,720 forints higher than in 2006, while for the cheapest, the price difference was 844 forints everywhere.
This year did not show the extreme difference, the most expensive basket now cost 1,630 forints more than last year, and also the cheapest discounted by 1,284 forints.
Compared to the two Christmas seasons, a catastrophic rise in prices was seen, in less than 20 months, slumping the daily consumption of goods in hypermarkets by more than 30 percent.
(This is, among other things, not absolutely confirmed by the data of the Central Statistical Office: it measured, in the case of several basic foods, a price increase of more than 30 percent over the course of 12 months.
In addition to flour, for example, in the case of eggs.)
In the latter case, however, according to the consumer basket of the Daily Economy, this seems almost impossible, since the price level of the product, which was quite expensive already in the last year, showed a price increase of barely more than 10 per cent in relation to the basis, even in the worst case.
Meal suppliers are said to be in a stronger position than egg suppliers, and they have managed to push for a drastic increase in prices in international chains.
Hypermarkets in the trading golden triangle do not complain, they are still referring to a good year.
According to our experience, the majority of customers in the three visited stores no longer care about the prices.
They buy everything in quantity, they take sustainable foods on wages.
On Wednesday morning, all three supermarkets formed long fronts at the cash registers, as the number of visitors increased sharply.
However, as we know, in rural areas the turnover is lower, more and more international chains complain to research companies that sales are lagging behind their plans, not only in the case of food, but also in the case of durable consumer goods.
In many places, it is saved on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand cases of infection have been registered in hospitals, mainly due to inappropriate use of antibiotics.
The hygienic conditions of the hospitals, the overcrowding of the beds, the overload of the staff to stop the disease do not help, says the primary of the National Epidemiological Center.
In many places, it is also saved on disinfectants.
Recently, MRSA infection was diagnosed at the traumatological department of St. John's Hospital.
Bacteria resistant to antibiotics have been discovered in a man who got to the hospital after a serious traffic accident.
The patient was isolated.
A similar infection occurred at the same site at the beginning of the year.
The patient injured in a serious car accident was released home, but soon after he had to return with an MRSA infection and due to the bacteria in his body, one important operation could not be performed yet.
By December 10, 1,094 hospital infections caused by multi-resistent pathogens had been reported to the National Nesocomialis Surveillance System, said Karolina Böröczov<0xC3><0xA1>, mayor of the National Epidemiological Center.
This means that so many infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens have been recorded in hospitals with certainty, others are not known.
Nearly two-thirds (683) of infections were caused by MRSA, or methicillin-oxacilin resistant gold staphylococcus.
Bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (SA) carry a third of people in the nose without causing the disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g. throat inflammation, tonsillitis, skin infections, early infections) respond well to antibiotics and can be treated well.
However, if antibiotics are administered excessively or inappropriately, bacteria that react well to antibiotics develop into bacteria that are very resistant to antibiotics and that are rapidly spreading under inadequate hospital conditions.
Especially in the case of temporary or permanent malfunctioning of the immune system in patients with a weakened body, low body weight or in patients in years can cause serious hospital infections, such as acute infection or blood poisoning - sepsis.
According to the top doctor of St. John's Hospital, there is nothing special about MRSA infection, a similar infection is a daily practice in hospitals.
"Infection should not be confused with epidemics, MRSA is not only there," said Tibor Nyulasi, "where the presence of the cause of the disease is not investigated."
Resistant to antibiotics
"We are isolating these patients, treating them in rubber gloves and in a mask, and we have the antibiotics we need to treat them," said Tibor Nyulasi.
Patients admitted to the hospital are first tested for the presence of MRSA in their body, however, infection cannot always be avoided.
Sampling is not fashionable
The vast majority of hospital infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, but the current conditions and conditions in home hospitals are not conducive to the prevention of the emergence and spread of multi-resistant pathogens, says Karolina Böröczov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Since this infection occurs symptomatically in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should monitor admitted patients and isolate MRSA carriers immediately.
However, sampling of microbiological samples in Hungarian hospitals is not in fashion.
It also plays a role in the fact that the National Health Insurance Fund does not finance this examination.
Most cases are detected if the patient suffers from a noticeable MRSA infection, said the primary epidemiological center.
The European Union has strict recommendations for the appropriate treatment of antibiotics in the field of human medicine and there are also domestic directives for the treatment of individual infections, epidemiologists.
It is necessary to strive for antibiotic therapy to be targeted, i.e. microbiological examinations should be carried out to prevent the development of drug resistance, but even hospitals do not comply with this in all cases.
Drawings of microbiological samples are even rarer in basic and outpatient treatment of patients, Karolina Böröczov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
Save on disinfectants
According to scientific evidence, MRSA is most often spread among patients through health care personnel.
Therefore, hand washing and the use of gloves and masks play a very important role, but even in hospitals there are serious deficiencies.
MRSA is transmitted by capillary infection and touch, but it is not always possible to isolate infected patients under the conditions of home hospitals.
On the contrary, the rooms are often crowded, the beds are often very close to each other, although from an epidemiological point of view, patients should be at least 1.5 meters away from each other.
As Karolina Böröczov<0xC3><0xA1> noted, unfortunately, we can also meet with the fact that in hospitals that are in an adverse material situation, they save on disinfectants, there are few nurses and many patients, so there is a chance of infection again.
According to Karolina Böröczov, where the necessary protective measures are followed, similar infections are demonstrably less or the further spread of the cause of the disease can be stopped.
Government Programme against MRSA
Treatment of MRSA infection is a huge expense for health insurance companies, which is why it is being fought everywhere.
For example, in England, the government has written a program to prevent MRSA and reduce its incidence.
As it appears, the program is successful, according to published data, MRSA infections in England show a decreasing trend.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) ranks prevention of multi-resistent pathogens (including MRSA), and hospital infections caused by these pathogens, among its priorities.
The Police Captain Who Caused the Deathly Accident Wasn't Drunk
The official expert judgment in the case of the police captain of the XXIIth district, who caused the fatal accident, is completed.
It can be ruled out that the police captain of the XXIIth district, who killed a pedestrian on Tuesday and who in the meantime resigned from his position, would drive under the influence of alcohol or intoxicating substances, the spokesman of the Supreme State Prosecutor's Office of the capital Attila Morvai informed the acquaintance on Friday, even after he was in the capital.
The indictment confirmed the result of the initial investigation, which already found that the former police captain had not drunk any alcohol before he sat at the wheel.
The then Director of the Police Directorate of the XXII District met on Tuesday in Lajose Kossuth Street in the XXII District with his own personal car while turning off a fifty-year-old man who entered before him while crossing the road outside the marked crossing.
(The last mentioned fact that a pedestrian passed outside the zebra, in fact, according to the rules of road traffic is not a mitigating circumstance, the turning away car must still give preference.)
After being transported to the hospital, the pedestrian died.
Due to these events, the district police director resigned and asked to be transferred to the service, according to a police statement, because he was so shaken by the case.
The case is being investigated by the Budapest State Prosecutor’s Office.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police captain had been cooperating with state prosecutors carrying out the investigations from the outset.
Another <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 million for infrastructure
J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed the agreement on three credit frameworks totaling <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 million to support education, transport and environmental infrastructure as well as energy on Friday in Budapest.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million framework for the Hungarian budget financing of transport and environment projects supported by the Cohesion Fund, with the parties already contracting 200 million euros from a 100-member loan agreement.
A loan agreement worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 million is also used for budget financing of education-related projects.
The EIB has approved for Hungary a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million for these purposes, the remaining <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 million may be used later, with the extension of the loan agreement.
In the area of innovation, the parties signed a EUR 50 million contract, which the budget will use mainly for the research and development project of the University of Debrecen.
There was also talk of the 4th metro line.
The parties agreed that once Hungary has agreed with the EU on the details of subway financing, they will return to whether and how the original agreement should be amended.
According to J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Veres, this could happen in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects in Hungary of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8.4 billion.
The interest on loans granted by the EIB with an eight-year waiting period and without a binding commission is fixed at the Euribor rate.
Bulgaria is the real estate paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is staggering - the attention of the whole of Europe is turning to the previously somewhat neglected Balkan country.
What, where, and who buys for the ever-cheapest yet fast-moving EU market?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The most sought-after destination for real estate purchases in Eastern Europe is now without a doubt Bulgaria with its cheap ski apartments and houses on the sea coast.
The mountains are mostly in the course of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vito<0xC5><0xA1>a, on the sea coast then Albena, Golden Sands, Sunny Coast, the ancient cities of Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are also looking for properties near Kavarna and Bal<0xC4><0x8D>ika.
According to analysts from Re/Max Bulgaria, sooner or later the interest of investors in the central part of the country - for example Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - and more and more interested people are also shopping in the vicinity of the heavily inexpensive city of Russia.
Also the capital of Sofia is a promise of attractive possibilities, business and office spaces promise the highest return.
Bulgaria is on its way to becoming one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe, becoming a sought-after destination in addition to the summer and winter seasons for the next two seasons.
Foreseeable investors are already shopping in a large area, for example in the vicinity of Banska.
According to analysts, real estate buyers in Bulgaria are simultaneously trying to change their lives and lifestyles.
Most customers come from England, but also buyers from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more often also from Romania.
There are also Maltese and Cypriot investors present, at the Black Sea and in the ski paradises there are traditionally many Russian customers.
Foreign buyers are divided into three groups, says Georgi Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Settling people buy either renovated properties worth 50-100 thousand euros, or collapsed old houses for 5-15 thousand euros, which they then renovate.
They require good accessibility and communication options, for them it is important to be close to the big city, shops and, as a rule, a local doctor.
The second category is chat shoppers (Bulgaria ranked among the top 10 German holiday destinations in December).
The third group is made up of commercial investors who buy in the hope of a value increase in the medium or long term.
The sale of real estate in the capital is continuous, as the demand is growing stronger.
Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices in the European Union, but has grown by 21 per cent per annum over the past five years.
The increase in property prices significantly outweighs wage growth.
Fodor and the Hungarian six percent
According to information from the Minister of Environment and Water Management G<0xC3><0xA1>bor Fodor, the meeting of experts will be closed on Tuesday and after the official launch on Wednesday, the international conference on the climate regime will continue with the ministerial talks after 2012.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world are discussing the Bali Travel Map, which addresses efforts following the emission reduction period defined by the Kyoto Protocol, which is valid until 2012.
At this point, there is a turbulent debate between developing and developed countries about them.
The United States has also announced that it now does not want to negotiate exact figures, although it adheres to an agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020, given the state of 1990.
Another major issue of the conference is whether the developed countries will, in addition to reducing emissions, also be able to provide both material and technological assistance to the countries that are referred to it.
The agreement also came about subsidies for developing countries.
The grant fund, established by the Kyoto Protocol, will be managed by the 16-member Management Board, probably within the framework of the World Environment Programme (GEF) at the United Nations - we can read in the magazine Piac és Profit.
Hungary's 6 percent
Minister of Environment and Water Management G<0xC3><0xA1>bor Fodor, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU's efforts to maintain a leading role in the global climate protection effort and to help create a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent by 2020 compared to 1990, regardless of the success of the "post-2012 agreement", and is ready to commit itself to a possible reduction of up to 30 per cent in the event that they are respected and out of the reach of the rest of the world.
G<0xC3><0xA1>bor Fodor pointed out that the countries that acceded to the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 had set themselves the target of a reduction of 5.2 per cent, with the then 15 EU Member States committing to 8 per cent.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6% compared to the years 1985-87, which our country will meet. - recalls in the press report of the Ministry of the Environment.
In Bali, there is a lot of work to be done, because in two years’ time it is necessary to adopt an international agreement on a long-term climate change policy, otherwise its entry into force would certainly have been postponed until 2012.In such a case, its commitments to reduce would not be subject to the Kyoto Protocol.
This would lead to a delay in reducing emissions and an inevitable increase in the Earth’s average temperature by more than 2 degrees Celsius, which scientists believe would have extremely serious and irreversible consequences.
British Army Recruits on YouTube
British military units are posting on the video-sharing server footage of the events in Iraq and Afghanistan, with which they are popularizing themselves.
First, YouTube was favored by the British Air Force (RAF): Special Forces operating in Afghanistan have been recording videos of actions against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC reported.
The footage, taken by a miniature camera attached to the helmet, is checked by the air force command of combat operations in the Kandahar area and then sent on to London, where they are transmitted to the Internet.
The political message is unavoidable.
In this form, 139 recordings of British Air Force soldiers have already been made on the Internet and more than 75,000 people have been watching their “channel”.
The British Ministry of Defence registered in the spring of 2007 as the "defenseheadquarters" and publishes footage of events in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Commonwealth Office) and the international peacekeeping forces in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube channel.
Category: Settlements in Afghanistan
The air forces have released videos according to their original intention for recruitment, and according to the Ministry of Defense, they are also good for getting to know the general public with the real purpose of the presence of the army abroad.
"The propaganda published in this form versus traditional television recruiting advertisements costs almost nothing," said defense expert Gordon Mackenzie, "but it also necessarily carries a certain political message, for the special decision-making in the form of acquiescence confirms them rightly."
The Americans made the game.
The army is concerned that, in addition to carefully edited, censored recordings, amateur videos are also being sent to the server, capturing, for example, the death of soldiers: in a bit of covert, "official" promotional films, the officers are not at all talking about him, they are lost.
By the way, many videos of the battlefields in Iraq and Afghanistan have already been accessed on the Internet, but the British army has come to them until now.
Americans perform the recruitment a little differently - using a shooting game called America's Army, which is free to download and in which the player can get directly into the skin of the soldiers through a more or less faithful simulation.
At the ministries will be Christmas with tombola and pagans
Work Minister M<0xC3><0xB3>nika Lamperthova is apparently not sentimental: instead of a Christmas party, she organizes a final working meeting for her colleagues, at which she will say goodbye to pagans and coffee in 2007.
In some ministries there will be a celebration with live music, while in other places it will enchant officials with a Christmas tomb and a drink.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and a Swedish table - so enjoy the powerful.
State authorities are also preparing for Christmas.
The most expensive ministerial Christmas celebration this year is organized by the Ministry of Defense, but it does not expect its employees to do so.
On Christmas orphanages will receive gifts from the children of fallen soldiers, at Mission Christmas they will host family members of soldiers, currently serving on foreign missions, but they will also arrange a reception for journalists.
The resort devotes 25 million to the atmosphere at the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) will kick themselves out of the cove compared to the other resorts.
The GKM party is held in the center of Jöv<0xC3><0xB8> H<0xC3><0xA1>za, for a total of 4 320 000 forints and out of six hundred employees of the Ministry approximately three hundred and fifty guests are expected.
The resort will adhere to the Christmas traditions at its celebration, but there will also be various performances and will also be lotteries.
The NFÜ Christmas cost 4,700,000 forints and took place on Wednesday in the building of the State Justice Council (OIT) - there were concerts and dinners on the program.
The rent of the hall cost a million forints, the rest was spent on more than four hundred guests.
It seems that one department of the NFÜ is invited to another Christmas celebration: here is the company that arranges the course of the tenders, the Hungarian Centre for Economic Development (MAG) from EU money.
For this purpose, the building of the V<0xC3><0xAD>gsz<0xC3><0xAD>nh<0xC3><0xA1>z Theatre was rented.
MAG a. s. did not confirm this information, as we were unable to reach the person concerned.
No clothes needed.
The building of the ILO was not only hosted by the NFÜ, but also by the Ministry of Justice and Security, which hosted the St. Lucie’s Ball on December 7.
However, the ILO did not want money from him for using its halls.
Five hundred people took part in the dance.
The party was started by the Minister of Health, after dinner it was possible to dance with live music.
According to the answer to the question of the portal [origo] on the dance were not mandatory evening dress or dress at all.
The Puritan party is being held by health, labour and local authorities.
The Ministry of Health organizes a program and celebration for employees for 400,000 forints in their own building.
Minister of Labor M<0xC3><0xB3>nika Lamperthov<0xC3><0xA1>'s employees are not even officially invited to the Christmas party, but to the final working meeting.
There are one hundred and eighty guests who, according to the press department, will receive only coffee and pagans, so only 350,000 forints will be enough for the party.
The Minister of Local Self-Government, Gordon Bajnai, and his collaborators simply joins in the hall of the Ministry of Local Self-Government and Regional Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) is holding a Christmas meeting, where it expects 436 workers, in its own large hall.
The Christmas party costs 2,500 forints per guest - the total amount includes a reception with Swedish tables and a drink.
Since he is Minister J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Veres, PM Christmas workers have been celebrating in a similar way every year.
However, the atmosphere of the party will be missing, the officiality is reinforced not only by the ministerial speech, but also by the afternoon time of the event.
The farm resort will hold a New Year's reception on January 20, ministerial Christmas will not take place.
The reception will take place in the Vajdahunyadv<0xC3><0xA1>r Castle in the City Gardens and according to the Ministry’s communication, for a hundred guests are allocated 1,000 forints per person.
According to the press department, it will be a very simple reception, to which only relevant foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary are invited.
These annual receptions start with a short health ministry and end with a small reception.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture do not organize the Christmas party at all, the relevant press department told the portal [origo].
The price of the Christmas celebrations of the environmental resort in the press department could not be communicated.
In any case, four hundred people were invited to the party held in the Artistic Industry Museum.
He is on the verge of a huge strike.
The League of Trade Unions and the All-State Union of Workers’ Councils (MOSZ) will set up their strike committee on Friday to coordinate Monday’s timeless strike.
On Saturday, a public protest meeting is held, on Monday - on the day of the final vote on the Health Insurance Act - work will be stopped.
The action will certainly cause a serious disruption of transport, as railway traffic will almost completely stop and employees of the Budapest Transport Company (BKV) will also strike within 13 hours.
On Friday afternoon, the League Association will meet with the All-State Union of Workers’ Councils with details of the jointly organized Monday strikes.
There will also be a LIGA-MOZ strike committee, which will coordinate Monday’s action.
On Saturday, a public protest meeting is held, and from Monday, trade unions joining the strike will stop working indefinitely unless an agreement is reached with the government.
This means that no deadline has been set for the end of the strike, which starts on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act.
If Parliament does not finally pass the Health Insurance Act, the unions will immediately withdraw the call to strike.
However, if the legislation is passed, the strike committees will meet and decide on the next procedure.
According to Monday's agenda, it is also possible that the Health Insurance Act will be voted on only in the late evenings, possibly at night.
Due to the strike starting on Monday, it is possible to count on serious transport disruptions: on the railway work will be stopped indefinitely, in the morning part of Budapest public transport and more than half of the companies Vol<0xC3><0xA1>n can stop.
At the same time, in many parts of the country, half of the runway will also be closed.
Numerous trade unions and civil society organisations have joined the call for the strike, the list of which is constantly updated on the Liga website.
Some organizations announced the strike indefinitely, while others announced a temporary cessation of work.
By Thursday afternoon, the Hungarian State Railways (MAV) and the Independent Trade Union of Railway Employees (VDSZSZ) could not agree on sufficient services, while at the beginning of the Christmas holidays they travel by rail.
According to the previous announcements, from the start of operation to 1 p.m. at BKV, from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. at Budapest Airport, a four-hour strike is organized by the Trade Unions of Workers in the energy industry LIGA, to 2, 2 and 8 hours of work stoppage.
The Hungarian Physicians’ Union will strike alternately across the country, and the Democratic Trade Union of Health and Social Workers (EDDSZ), part of the Cooperation Forum of Trade Unions (SZEF), is holding a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands formulated by the League association is for the government to withdraw the proposal for health insurance reform and submit a new concept for public discussion.
The second requirement is that a new way of calculating pensions, effective from next year, be introduced gradually.
Thirdly, in the case of early retirement for the relevant occupations, the possibility of inclusion in the system is ensured already before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is that the Independent Trade Union of Railway Employees (VDSZSZ), which falls under the trade union of the League, does not accept the offer of the Ministry of Economy and Transport relating to railway branches, and expects a different offer.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guards Increase Country's Risk
The activity of the Hungarian Guard, founded with the support of the Jobbik Hungaryr<0xC3><0xA1>sz<0xC3><0xB3>w movement in August this year, according to the Risk Analysis Division of the Institute of Political Capital, increased the political risk of Hungary and the whole region in several respects.
In the "risk warning" drawn up by the firm, it says: in the context of the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is that "by tightening the already existing ethnic tension between the Roma and non-Roma populations" Hungary may already be able to escape in a short time.
The main reason is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard is likely to be aimed at provoking such an event, the research institute adds.
As he writes, all this can be explained by one of the greatest negligences of Hungarian political representatives: "public debate on the Roma question was left by representatives of public life to representatives of radical and extremist political groups, who could have been on the Roma-Hungarian strategist side."
This problem deepens, disables normal dialogue, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts – the institute says.
In addition, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, according to the research institute, influenced by the great attention of the domestic and foreign media "to a great extent corrupted the image of Hungary abroad, especially in terms of the faith in the stability of the country and its democratic development".
As part of the reorganization of Hungarian radical and ultra-right groups, which has been receiving increasing publicity and vehemence since the fall of 2006, several organisations have been formed in Hungary since the summer of 2007, which themselves call themselves "national homegrown" associations.
"The common feature of these groups is that they define themselves as civil associations, while openly proclaiming - even armed - the readiness of their members to carry out defensive tasks (in the case of a life disaster, a coup d'état, a coup d'état, a coup d'état, a coup d'état),
He further notes: all this is done in a way that seeks to wrap the various political efforts built on the resistance of society to politics and parties into civil dress.
The emphasis on civility and the form of society in the case of these groups is therefore not only used to avoid the legal hurdles of judicial registration, but is also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guards are also an increasing risk factor in terms of neighbouring relations.
“In recent months, they have pointed to the Hungarian Guard in several neighbouring states as a potential source of danger, and ultra-nationalist political representatives of some neighbouring countries want to apologise for their own anti-Hungarian policy by referring to the formation of the Hungarian Guard.
All of this can affect the political stability of the region," he added.
According to the research institute, the formation of the Hungarian Guard in Central and Eastern Europe is not a unique phenomenon, so the political risks to the region as a whole have increased.
The activities of the Hungarian Guard are similar to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, which was announced by the ultra-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU) in August 2007.
Against the background of the formation of the Bulgarian guard stands mass Roma riots, which erupted in one of the Sofia districts (Krasna Poljana).
This was used by the BNU to establish a guard with the goal of the organization being "national home defense".
In the last 17 years, according to her, there has been “gypsy terror” in Bulgaria, but the state has remained inactive and indifferent, according to the Institute of Political Capital.
He adds that the initiative sparked a tumultuous debate among the Bulgarian public.
As it further writes, the increased risk of ethnic clashes signals the announcement by some Bulgarian Roma organizations that they will create their own guard on the signs of resistance.
Since the activity of the Hungarian Guard to date is similar to the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is not excluded that even Hungarian Roma will respond to the threat in a similar way, by setting up their own home defence, we can read in the warning of the risks developed by the Institute of Political Capital.
Attila Juh<0xC3><0xA1>sz, Research Director of the Institute of Political Capital, told the press office: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, they issue a risk analysis every year and if they find anything that could affect the change in risk, they inform the public, as in this case by issuing a risk warning.
Holidays are not free everywhere.
In Hungary, holidays are precisely defined by law, and it has become a common practice that work days are moved around the holidays, which awaits us less often next year.
In the European Union and in the United States, the holidays are not uniform.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between national and state holidays and working days of rest.
The days of work rest are usually linked to church holidays or to important historical events.
We also celebrate the New Year: the last day of the old and the first day of the new year is free to work - for the New Year already so that people can rest after New Year's Eve.
There are a total of 11 free holidays throughout the year.
March 15 is a national holiday commemorating the revolution of 1848 and October 23, the commemoration of the revolution of 1956.
On August 20th we celebrate the founding of the state, on May 1st we work, on November 1st and 2nd we remember the deceased relatives and friends.
In addition, there are two-day Easter, Summer and Christmas holidays here.
Since our state, national, or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, it has become the practice of moving the working day in cases where we work only one day before or after the holiday.
However, the price for extended weekends is that we stay at the workplace and at school on previous Saturdays.
When the day that immediately precedes or follows the holiday, we work out, it has for many years been regulated by the Minister of Labour in a special decree.
The legislation applies equally to all employers and the employees employed by them, to public servants and to persons in the public service.
However, it does not apply to companies and institutions that are in operation without interruption or operate even on working days of rest due to their destination.
This year, there will be a change in the working schedule only around the holidays at the end of the year: from December 24, life in the country will almost stop, because according to previous experience, most people "work" or use the saved time in advance between Christmas and New Year.
Next year, several of our holidays fall in the middle, respectively, for the end of the week, so the shifts of the working day will be less than this year.
For the first time, the calendar is transformed around the holiday of work, so that workers can stay at home for four days of taste.
Saturday 26 April will be a working day so that Friday 2 May can be a day of rest.
Another move relates to the holiday of October 23: on Saturday, October 18 will be working instead of Friday 24.
The end of next year, however, will be able to take place entirely in the sign of the holidays, because from December 24 they will have almost everywhere nonstop holidays even though New Year's Eve falls on Wednesday.
Six terrifying little things that you can make your colleagues angry
The emails we forget to send, the voice messages we never receive, the innocent lies that we hardly ever notice: it all “intensifies” the workdays.
The question is whether you will get used to these minor inconveniences, or put on gloves and vague situations that others may be angry about, you will deliberately avoid.
Tips.
"I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you they were looking for you from the marketing department," a colleague will inform you.
That's why you missed the meeting?
At best, he regrets and tries to fix it, or he calls the marketing department and says that the message has forgotten to pass (this is a less common solution).
Most often, an issue is solved with an apology.
Before making an embarrassing apology, it’s good to think about what you can do to prepare your colleagues for unpleasant moments, and consciously try to avoid it.
Are you borrowing something that is not yours?
There’s nothing more unpleasant than pulling for some writing, office supplies, or for your phone, and they’re not there.
Do you remember lying on a sewing machine last night, but he's gone by morning?
Or have you discovered your pen on the desk of one of your colleagues, which you considered to be lost?
Don’t take anything from your colleagues without permission, otherwise they’ll be rightly angry at you for harassing them about things.
Do not take an envelope or adhesive paper out of the office, as it can be uncomfortable when you get them prematurely, and you will immediately need them.
Talking about the private life of your colleagues?
There is no good way to stop the spread of ticks.
Who, who, what did he do?
Where and why?
Don’t tell everyone your (domestic) messages about the private lives of colleagues!
When one of them shares his innermost secrets with you, don’t abuse his trust!
Lock in yourself what you have heard, and in his absence do not discuss it with your colleagues, even when others know about his things.
Are you unreasonably reporting your absence?
If you call the office and with a reference to severe headaches you report your absence because you are not well, or you say that you would rather rest today, think of your work, urgent tasks and the work that they have a certain term to do, will be for you.
Take care of your colleagues!
If you know in advance that you won’t go to work the next day, or that something may happen that will make you stay home, let your colleagues and leaders know that you won’t be confronted with your absence until the next day.
Crawling, shoving, telephoning
Did you dive into a job where you'd be ripped off by your colleagues' sniffing?
Did you unwittingly witness a phone conversation that would be better not to hear at all?
Don’t disturb your coworkers by clapping, chanting, talking loudly (above them), or by banging, swearing constantly, or loud dissatisfaction.
All this can be disruptive even when they are not included in any project (writing, planning, organization).
Are you blaming others for mistakes?
If something is not in time or you have forgotten to send an important letter or message, do not blame the other for your forgetfulness!
Do not resort to any chaos prevailing in the office and noisy colleagues!
Admit if you made a mistake and someone paid for it, and repair the damage!
Ask how you can put things right, correct the negligence!
Do you feel at home in your office?
Warmers and shoes: comfortable clothes at home, but not suitable for the office!
Don’t wear clothes for your free time, even if it’s allowed by your profession!
Do not be negligent, honor your colleagues and yourself by coming to the office in ordinary clothes - and if your profession requires it, nicely and elegantly!
When a man wants to meet, he ceases to be interesting.
Constipation in the usual morning constipation.
A special tune is heard from the radio: the sound of violins, to which electronic effects are attached.
I'm adding volume.
The music changes the tempo and the bass is added to the previous tonal coloring, then the female choir joins as a real jewel.
On mr2 there is a song by Zagar called Wings of Love.
The music life at home has not just wiped us out with a quality electronic pop.
Suddenly, however, the addiction looks quite different because you are listening to the new album Zagaru.
The emergence of Yonderboy, a couple of new and interesting productions from the home digital underground, slowly changes the overall picture, and although garage rock is back in fashion with its bass into the guitar, even home electropop proves that it is something new under the sun.
Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger started at the Pentecostal Church and also played in Yonderboio's band until finally - perhaps because the two dude don't fit in the same spell - he went his own way.
However, with his project (Zagar) and music that combines elements of jazz, electronic dance styles and pop, he only began to shine when he was invited to compose film soundtracks (e.g.
The Turkish film "Season" by Ference.
His formation, initially playing in smaller clubs, became known to a wider audience after wan2 magazine ranked their first album of 2002 among the fifty most important domestic albums and declared Zagar at Yonderboye to be almost the only domestic entities determining the development that could be.
Zagar and his band are without a doubt "on course", although of course no one asked if they were satisfied with this label.
The band reacted as it should: they made a new, better album.
The now-released album Cannot Walk Fly Instead may open up new paths for them, although the name itself is trying to create a continuity with the initial flights in the Five Stars.
This is one of the songs of the old band Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger.
The reference to ethereal, flying would have been in place, but next to the ethereal breath of this music now appeared - in accordance with the spirit, trend of the time - louder guitars, the influence of rock and roll.
In these songs, singer György Ligeti, currently working in England with The Puzzle, was introduced at the debut of the album in the Millen<0xC3><0xA1>ris Park.
The album also produced one real radio hit, thanks to the mr2 Pet<0xC5><0x91>fi station, playing popular music lately from morning to evening, we began to blossom the melodies of the song Wings of Love, recorded with six domestic singers ("Underground Divas").
So all is well (?).
Portal hvg.hu Confessions Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zse Zs<0xC3><0xA1>gara.
hvg.hu: In connection with this new hit, the question is, how much of what you play remains, marginal music?
Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger: The definition of marginal music means nothing to me.
In my opinion, there are two different castes of light music; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even so-called alternative, underground music can be flat, say nothing, and just as it can be created only because of sales, which makes it commercial.
Of course, even a good pop song can come from a sincere inner need.
In this spirit, the attitude as it is adopted works, regardless of language and state borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audiences to your music?
B. Zs.: In abroad, especially from us to the west, light music has a greater tradition.
There are not only teenagers and people in their twenties going to concerts, but also older people.
Much more they observe the changes of light music going on around them, because they also consider it a part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the audience in your work?
Do you care about who, where, and how much of your music you listen to?
B. Zs.: Of course, it’s a good feeling that more and more people are going to our concerts.
But we never made music for the market.
Music is not born with a purpose, but for a reason.
The role of the audience can be perceived rather at concerts where there is already a mutual influence, but the one is hidden only in the intangible changes of the moment.
Yet I noticed that when one wants to meet an audience, from that moment on, one ceases to be interesting.
hvg.hu: How far are you going to follow the example of Yonderboy?
He works solo and has built his career rather than us to the west.
B. Zs.: We don’t actually go his way, regardless of the fact that they try to explain our music that way.
We are rather team players who rely on the other person’s musical presence and let it evolve.
At first, of course, there was no way to avoid that our works were not aligned with the songs of Yonderboy, as some of us separated from his band and went a different way.
hvg.hu: Wings of Love came first in the mr2 Pet<0xC5><0x91>fi series.
Many heard the name Zagar for the first time in connection with this song.
In the more popular style, have you deliberately opened up to wider layers?
B.Zs.: We weren’t planning on writing a hit to sell the album.
There's more to this song.
We thought of it as the finale of the album, with which we tried to unleash the previous sound orgy and more complex themes.
hvg.hu: How did you pick those six singers?
Why is it - what was the main principle?
B.Zs.: The idea was to create such a gospel congregation.
Then came the idea to compose this choir of soloists from the home music scene with a good voice.
So we put together this six-member choir - Sena, Edina Kutzor, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enik<0xC5><0x91> Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - which we then renamed into Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Is that exactly how you thought of the song, or did the girls change something about it?
B.Zs.: The composition has long existed in the instrumental version, and when the material on the album came together, we thought that there would be something else needed for this composition.
A trace of the chords led to the addition of a singing part.
That night, I sang to him a melody that the girls later learned.
The whole thing came out almost for the first time and very spontaneously.
I remember how it came to life, but of course, there was a need for a diva.
With my voice, it wouldn't work that energetic.
hvg.hu: Both on the album and at the concert seemed to be the girls in the background.
They don’t have a solo (except for Judy Jay), they don’t have their own role, they sing completely together, and they’re no louder than music, so the music just doesn’t accompany their singing.
They were also on stage in the back.
Is that intentional?
B.Zs.: The fact that they were standing behind was only because of technical problems.
The fact that we didn’t want to split the solo roles, on the contrary, is deliberate.
The song is also about forgetting our ego, where it comes from, where it belongs, and just letting those wings, the wings of love rise.
I wished that this euphoric state, which we felt when the song was born, could be felt by others.
HVG: What was the most important job?
B.Zs.: In fact, during the composition of the music, even with one, heavier pieces occurred rather during mixing.
For example, Dorian Gray's Dilemma, in which I play a concert wing, or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where he didn't want grooves to work for a long time, then all of a sudden he found his place as in some sort of comb.
hvg.hu: Which song from the new album is your favorite?
B.Zs.: That’s always changing with the concert, even when I’ve already “released” the album.
Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same
Betrayal broker risked billions from undervalue
A fraudulent fraud.
That’s what Jerome Kerviela, a French bank giant called Société Générale, says, the owner of the domestic commercial bank.
That’s why it came for nearly five billion euros.
It seems, however, that Kerviel was just a big player who wanted to make up for his colleagues and certainly not incapacitated.
Unlike all major banking houses, he recognized the crisis in the US mortgage market in an early stage.
'He's mentally weaker, 'said his superiors, who were sent to him by the police.
But according to Kerviell’s remarks by French media, such as Le Monde, he was a man who at the end of last year had a profit of 1.6 billion euros from his trades.
Crisis not only in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he said in a statement.
In the summer, he managed to make half a billion euros in the US crisis.
He felt the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
In February, reports began to appear that so-called sub-prime mortgages, provided to low-income clients or those who have had repayment problems in the past, will have problems.
This crisis had no impact on the economy as a whole.
Kerviel did not believe it and bet correctly.
At the end of the year, its profit reached <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.6 billion.
"When I made the first half a billion, I didn't know how to announce it," Kerviel admits, adding that he had absolutely nothing for himself.
Throughout the interrogation, he admits that he falsified the records so that he could not be found.
He even managed to shake his bosses, even though she began to be interested in his trades with the Eurex stock exchange.
Risk was a profit
Was he afraid he'd come to see him?
No, I don't.
"I thought the simple fact that I made $1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them."
Where did he take so much risk?
He had to work on his position gradually.
He joined the Société Générale in 2000 shortly after graduating from the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was around $51,000.
Two years later, he was already an assistant broker and in 2005 he became an independent broker with an annual salary of $90,000.
Yet he knew that he would never make as much money as the others.
"In my first interview in 2005, I knew they were looking at me.
Because of my education and also because of my professional and personal development," Kerviel told investigators.
But shortly after the start came the first great success.
Thanks to the shares, the Allianz made a profit, in the bombing of London bet on the decline of this title half a billion euros.
And that was the trigger mechanism - he wanted more.
As long as you make money, we'll leave you
"It's like a snowball," he told the police.
But the bosses said they knew everything, or rather they knew it.
"As long as I made money, they closed their eyes."
But then came the morning at the beginning of this year.
He lost a billion euros in one day.
After the weekend in mid-January, he wanted to freeze it.
When he came to work on Monday, he no longer worked at the bank.
And the bank announced a few days later that it had lost five billion euros.
And how did they find him?
He became a suspect because of his vacation.
"I've only chosen four days over the past year.
A broker who does not have a vacation is a broker who does not want anyone to look at his records," Kerviel concluded.
The Czech Republic has a chance to win 365 billion
Ministers of the Czech government signed a total of nine operational programmes yesterday with representatives of the European Commission, from which the Czech Republic can earn 14 billion euros (approximately 365 billion kroner) in the coming years.
This is about half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels between 2007 and 2013.
Approximately CZK 125 billion will go from seven operational programmes to regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain around 100 billion kroner from the Entrepreneurship and Innovation program.
Most of the money, up to 150 billion, will go to transportation.
The Transport Programme is the largest operational programme and represents up to 22 percent of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the funds.
This money will increase the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will be managed next year with an amount of 90.8 billion kroner.
The Entrepreneurship and Innovation program is intended to serve entrepreneurs and companies to raise funds for innovative entrepreneurship.
Firms should obtain funding for the introduction of new technologies, for industrial research, but also for the implementation of more effective organizational methods.
The Czech Republic has so far been among the least successful countries in drawing money from EU funds in the newly-received countries.
A 20-year sentence for ex-president of Nicaragua has been confirmed by a court
A Nicaraguan appeals court on Thursday confirmed a 20-year sentence for former president Arnold Alem<0xC3><0xA1>n, who was convicted in 2003 of financial fraud of up to $100 million (approximately 1.8 billion kroner).
However, he was later released from prison and lived in a domestic prison on his hacienda near the Nicaraguan metropolis.
If the former head of this Central American state from 1997 to 2002 will return behind bars, it is not clear at this time, according to the AP.
According to the president of the appeals court, Ileana Pérez, it will now be up to the inmates to let the German serve his sentence at home, or to go to jail.
Four years ago, the court proved to Aleman that it regularly transferred government money to the accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictitious and the accounts actually belonged to his relatives and closest supporters.
Some of this money then ended up in a fund that German founded to fund his election campaign in 2001.
So we approved the budget.
That's right.
The state budget was adopted.
What makes this budget so special?
It is the first budget drawn up by this government and adopted by a coalition majority without the support of the opposition.
Last year, he passed with the support of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, because it was prepared by Minister Sobotka and the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD could not afford to accept it.
Unlike the hectic debate before the vote of no confidence in the government, nothing dramatic was done this time.
The House of Representatives passed the law, which has traditionally been ignored, although the most influential.
It is a certain paradox.
Every rule begins and ends with individual chapters and budget items, whether someone likes it or not.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but it is hidden behind the government’s powerful rivalry with the opposition.
This is more medialy grateful and therefore much more attention is paid to him in the media.
The riddle of politicians is much more interesting to the public than the strict numbers.
The state budgets in the past socially democratic governments have suffered from three misfortunes that the 2008 government is not able to solve at once:
The first of these is a high share of the law of compulsory, so-called compulsory expenditures, which are not only pensions, but also social benefits, which was approved last year before the elections by the silent "coalition" of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and the KS<0xC4><0x8C>M.
The second of these is the deficit management as a result of the failure of the first.
The third limit is the deficits of public finances, i.e. the deficits of the budgets of cities and municipalities.
The biggest risk, however, is not the state budget deficit.
It is public and relatively under control.
The time bomb, however, is the budget deficit of cities and municipalities.
Many mayors, in addition to the money from taxes, fees, and loans from banks, get other sources of investment, often headless issue bonds with which they disproportionately owed their councillors.
In recent years, they have been able to repay these debts by mass sale of shares of energy and other distribution networks that they received from the state from in privatization.
They no longer have this resource.
If we stick to only official and verifiable facts, we will find that:
Our economy has been going through a growth phase for several years, as well as the rest of the world, which is constantly boasting the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD.
It was a unique opportunity for her governments to put public finances in order.
Instead, they were increasingly indebted to the state.
Other countries, with a few exceptions, such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have managed much more intelligently than our republic.
It is a great shame, which falls mainly on previous governments.
We are among the countries that are, on a global scale, least endangered by poverty.
Therefore, there is no need for massive social programs, which, unfortunately, in recent years have become quite unnecessary inflated into gigantic dimensions.
Although it has succeeded in abolishing some of the senseless populist spending approved before the elections this year, so if there is no sooner to move the retirement and pension reform boundary, then in fact any politics in this country will end and whoever will govern it.
With a small surplus, it can be said that the ruling politicians will become officials, mechanically dividing the majority of the taxed money into pensions and social benefits.
Therefore, this year’s budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the expulsion of normal expenditures by mandatory expenditures.
The planned deficit of 70 billion for 2008 would be absolutely useless if previous governments hadn’t managed to do what they could in the last ten years.
If we don’t really want it to happen that the ruling politicians become mere officials, then we have to be patient and give this not-so-strong coalition government, which realizes that the state can only issue as many bills as it can get on taxes and taxes.
Only these will make it possible to gradually achieve a balanced state budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to jointly fight the financial market crisis.
This means that more than $100 billion will be delivered to the currency markets through auctions.
In these auctions, banks charge an interest rate at which they are willing to borrow money.
For example, the U.S. Fed will send $40 billion to auction, and then another $40 billion will be made available to European and Swiss central banks.
It is the first time since the attacks of September 11 that the central banks of individual states have agreed on a coordinated procedure to prevent or mitigate the consequences of the financial crisis.
“This move is aimed at addressing the biggest problems of the economy, the growing lack of free capital that banks could borrow,” wrote Bernard Baumohl of the Economic Outlook Group in a report to clients.
“Coordinated actions by the central banks have reduced the likelihood of a recession in the United States from 65 percent to 50 percent,” Baumohl said in the report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion due to unpaid loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect billions more losses.
“Central banks need to be really afraid of what else might follow when they decide to do this,” said ABN chief economist Amro Kieran Davies.
"It looks like the situation is really bad," he added.
Central banks are concerned that if banks themselves have difficult access to loans, they will be more likely to lend to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and put the U.S. economy in a recession with potential impacts on global economic growth.
The central banks thus decided after failing to reduce the so-called LIBOR rate, the London interbank rate, which is used to lend money on the interbank market.
This meant that banks were still concerned about borrowing money from each other, despite the fact that the central banks of the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom lowered their interest rates several times during the fall.
“It will have the same effect as another interest rate drop,” Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some analysts do not think that a move by the central banks will contribute to settling the crisis because it does not solve the underlying problem, and that is the collapse of the US real estate market.
Klaus: The debates of ecologists are unbelievable
Global climate change is most likely to harm developing countries.
President V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Klaus once again spoke on the issue of global warming.
Criticism has now been expressed at the end of the UN’s international conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, not Green Planet, he said that the debates of ecologists are unbelievable.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference, which is made up of a strange mixture of representatives of governments and non-governmental organizations, but also a fundamental difference between the rhetoric that accompanies it, and the reality.
"The debate there is completely unstructured, it's just a firework of words that are a substitute for solving current problems," Klaus said.
When presenting his book, the Czech President stressed that its theme is very important to him, and therefore he is committed to them.
He also expressed satisfaction with the fact that the book also appears in the German translation, because, as he said, "often I only encounter cartoons of my own opinions".
Now, therefore, the interested ones can read his unspoken attitudes.
Klaus noted that while he is not a climatologist, in his opinion he has enough prerequisites to write such a book.
He is an academic, able to monitor and assess professional negotiations, has experience in statistics and is also a national economist.
As the main conclusions of the book, he pointed out the thesis that the climate is constantly changing and its changes are normal, that there is no consensus on the warming of the planet by all scientists, that the consequences of the current changes are not too great and not too serious and therefore they are not a threat and therefore not a threat to the climate, and that efforts are an influence on the warming of the planet.
Moreover, as a person with experience with totality, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which he feels is a dangerous limitation of freedom.
On the questions of those present, he repeatedly explained that he is not against "smart environmental protection, but against a militant environmentalism that does not take into account the relationship between costs and their benefits."
Klaus spoke on the same subject in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
The driver could not replace 600,000 people.
Six hundred thousand drivers missed the deadline and could not replace the old driver’s license, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day people can apply for an exchange so that the authorities can issue them a new passport by the end of the year.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that after the New Year hundreds of thousands of drivers would go on the road without a valid license.
According to the authorities, the card has not been exchanged mainly by those who do not even want to drive anymore.
While the municipality reports a sharp drop in interest in the exchange of a driver’s license, authorities in the metropolis are overwhelmed with applications and interest in the exchange of a passport has increased this week.
The master's degree caters to around 2,000 clients a day.
It takes about half an hour at the front.
In Prague, about 140,000 drivers have not yet exchanged their driver’s license.
The issue of a new card takes 20 days.
However, it is possible to apply for the issuance within a shorter period of five days.
In this case, the driver will pay five hundred crowns.
Drivers who do not reach the mandatory exchange of their passport by the end of the year and go on the road without a valid driver’s license will face a penalty from January.
Provenile pays a maximum of two thousand kroner.
However, a police officer can also deal with a breach of contract.
In the case of an administrative offense, the fine will amount to 2500 kroner.
According to earlier information, he may have received a fine from the mayor and a person who is not going anywhere.
He was able to pay 30,000 kroner.
The ministry has previously called on the authorities to be moderate and impose a fine of up to CZK 1,000.
According to the spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport Karl Hanzelka, however, tens of thousands of fines are not threatened.
According to him, a driver's license is a document where people can decide whether they want it or not.
It’s not a passport that every person has to have.
People who no longer want to drive should give up their driver's license.
It is sufficient to take it away or to send it by post to the relevant municipal authority.
By the end of the year, passports issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be valid.
However, drivers have to gradually change other types of driving licences as well.
People with documents from 1994 to 2000 have three more years to exchange.
The visas issued between 2001 and 2004 will expire in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, it is about 2.6 million other documents.
Court Cuts Penalties for Detectives Associated with Berdych
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Kona<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k, who are accused of criminal association with the David Berdych gang, will go to jail for thirteen and ten years.
With final validity, the Prague Supreme Court decided on this, which thus reduced their sentences, one by a year and the other by two years.
Originally, it threatened the detectives of the Prague Committee for Combating Organized Crime for 14 and 12 years.
Today’s decision can no longer be appealed, it is only possible to appeal to the Supreme Court.
Berdych is also indicted in this case, but he is still awaiting a preliminary ruling.
In other cases, however, he has already received sentences of more than 16 years.
He can't get more.
In January, the regional court acknowledged, in particular, the involvement in the robbery of 19 people guilty of theft, the apex court today decided to appeal 16 of them.
Most of the defendants have denied since the start of the investigation that it was a constructed case.
According to the Central Bohemian Senate, according to the agreement with Berdych, police officers handed over information from police sources to the criminals, covered up individual robbery raids and helped the gang members avoid criminal liability.
The gang gave 30 percent of the lupus for Opava and the Horseman.
The indictment concerns the criminal activity of the gang from 1999 to 2001.
In particular, thefts, the victims of which have often suffered serious damage to health, but also the abuse of the authority of the public agent and illegal armaments.
During home inspections, police discovered illegally held pistols, steel core shots, laser pointers or self-propelled shots.
The gang has been accused of robbery for tens of millions of crowns.
In addition to nearly twenty men in this trial, the courts have already found guilty of the robbery of Berdych and a number of other people.
Other men from around Berdych are still in court in another trial, some cases have not yet been brought before the court.
The main prosecution has so far been avoided by Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> P<0xC5><0xAF>t and Maro<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0xA0>ulej, who are in Irish custody, where they are waiting for a final decision on their extradition to the Czech Republic.
Account for children's miscarriage: 12 million
For the confusion of children in the nursery, the lawyer of the damaged families Igor Veleba after the T<0xC5><0x99>ebice hospital wants compensation of 12 million kroner, plus court fees.
For each of the mothers for three million, for the fathers for two million, and for the children for a million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Dost<0xC3><0xA1>l, a legal representative of the hospital, therefore disagrees with Veleby’s proposal.
"We refuse such a demand, it is very high," Dost<0xC3><0xA1>l said after today's meeting.
"But in order to make an opinion on the counter-proposal, we need an expert assessment that has been given to the opposing party.
We'll find out if it's worth anything at all.
But we remain in the opinion that it will be in the hundreds of thousands for everyone," Dost<0xC3><0xA1>l stressed.
According to him, the share should be between CZK 100,000 and CZK 200,000 for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the causa, the Jablo<0xC5><0x88>ov family wanted a million kroner for each month when they did not raise their biological daughter.
Veleb served as the basis for the negotiation of a compensation expert assessment, which was developed for him by the Faculty Hospital in Prague-Motole.
The parents of the children, according to experts in psychology and psychiatry, suffered psychological damage and stress at different levels and depths.
The stressful situation was better tolerated by men, even though they faced remorse that they did not prevent the confusion of newborns.
Women are again worse off with the actuality of the trauma experienced and with what is happening right now, summarized Veleba’s content.
Veronica and Nikola were replaced by nurses at the Trebic maternity hospital on December 9.
Last week the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to <0xC4><0x8C>erm<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xBD> in Pribyslavic and Veronika to Libor Bro<0xC5><0xBE>ov and Jaroslava Trojans in Jablo<0xC5><0x88>ov.
At the end of October, Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Vystr<0xC4><0x8D>il handed over each of the families 100,000 kroner to compensate for the expenses incurred by them due to the error of the T<0xC5><0x99>ebice hospital set up by the region.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally insured for damages.
In the event of an error, they must contact the reserve fund, exceptionally they can request the help of the founder.
So far, the courts have admitted relatively low compensation to the people, the sums were calculated according to the tables in the order of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions of crowns.
Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka lost the kingdom of Wallachia
Bolek Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka lost the dispute over the Wallachian Kingdom.
According to the judge of the Ostrava Regional Court, the designation was used for the first time by the King of Wales, but the project was built by a team around Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Harabis, who collaborated with the actor.
The police did not take part in the negotiations today.
According to his lawyer, however, the case is unlikely to end and the client will appeal.
"The dispute is that Mr. Harabish and his team are parasitizing on the popularity of Bolka Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka," Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vk's lawyer said after the trial.
According to him, everyone in the words of the Kingdom of Wallachia will be equipped with actors and comedians.
Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> has the same opinion.
“We have almost a decade of work ahead of us.
"Creating money and inventing actions," he said.
According to him, they are the cause of the money dispute.
“After years, they realized that the project was a success and could have something from it.
They want to parasitize on our work," he added.
Lucrative business
According to the designation court, the Welsh King used Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka for the first time in his television show.
In 1993, it was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohat<0xC3><0xBD>.
At the time, however, it had nothing to do with the intention of building a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabish came up with the idea of issuing Wallachian passports.
From the original recessionist event, trade and lucrative business activity emerged, on which Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> then established the company of the Kingdom of Wallachia.
In 1997 Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka agreed to put his name and signature in passports and even offered their holders a discount when visiting his farm and theatre performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also said today that Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> only used the naked idea that Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka published in the maneuver for his business intention.
"The popularity of Boleslav Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka's Wallachian Kingdom project certainly helped," the judge said.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was Harabish and his team, who were intensely dedicated to him.
The cooperation of today’s undisputed parties continued until 2000, when Harabish organized an official coronation for Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka in Vset<0xC3><0xAD>n.
Since then, however, disputes between Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka and Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> have been accumulating, culminating in the siege of "King Boles<0xC5><0x82>aw I, elected for the Furt".
The leading role in the kingdom was then taken by the singer Jarmila <0xC5><0xA0>ul<0xC3><0xA1>k as the queen's mother at the behest of Harabish.
In 2002, Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka filed a lawsuit against Harabish and his company, which the court rejected today.
Clearly, Harabish's intended plea for the throne and a half of the princess could bring into dispute.
A new king should come out of him.
The details and the date have not yet been disclosed.
"We don't want to rush anything.
It's supposed to be like the Kings Ride in Slovakia.
The king should be elected for a time.
Mr. Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka can also log in," added Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: missing prejudices
In fact, I never really liked the Peugeot 206.
Its driving characteristics were not much, the quality of the tuning, control and also production could be referred to as under-average.
But there is now a successor to the Peugeot 207 on the market, and the one is much better.
And a van called SW goes a little further and I don't have much left to think about.
When I tested the classic hatchback of the Peugeot 207, I complained, for example, of a headroom in the rear seats.
This is the end of the complaint, because the bodywork of the van means that in this direction they will not suffer even two meters long.
Flying around the world
The interior will pass very quickly, so that I do not repeat too much.
This is a rather successful design, where I have the only outlet to the poor middle tunnel.
Here I would appreciate a little more design invention, since the car already looks so elegant.
Seats are comfortable and there are times when we could complain about short seats or backrests.
The lateral steering has also improved significantly against the 206.
As for the space, there is also a sense of an increase in the dimensions of the body.
The already mentioned lack of space above the head then disappears in the van.
Suitcases for the suitcase
So the main thing on this car is its trunk.
I have to rate it as very accessible (and even thanks to the folding rear window) and as decent storage.
The noisy places are equipped with retaining tyres, which are an ideal compromise.
It does not prevent, it can be stretched, while keeping even heavier objects.
But let's pause together over the hug.
According to the tables, it is in the basic arrangement 428 l, which is a rather average value against the competition.
However, not against the best-selling car of this class in the Czech Republic - the <0xC5><0xA0>koda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the young Boleslav product, then we will find that Peugeot is lagging by a lot of noticeable 52 liters.
For holidays abroad or when loading a trolley, this value is critical.
But if I were to highlight the positive, then I still have to mention a completely flat floor after folding the backrests of the second row or a very low threshold.
120 horses in four rows.
Our tested car was equipped with a 1.6 l four-cylinder combustion engine with an output of 88 kW.
And to tell the truth, this is what a 16-year-old girl should look like, who drives a family hatchback.
It is quiet, has low consumption and above all stretches.
If I compare it to a pest, which looks like it has a stuffed cloth in the exhaust, then I can only be enthusiastic about it.
The price list will tell
The price of the car is not popular.
However, we must bear in mind that we tested a decently equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with a combustion engine for CZK 329,900 will still fall.
Our aggregate costs from 410 900 CZK, which is quite enough.
The tested equipment Premium then comes with the equipment for an additional 80,000 CZK.
But we still had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic wiper start, electric control of the rear windows...
The car costs 531,900 CZK everywhere.
It's a lot, but count the extras at Fabia and you'll come up with a very similar number.
So it's not until you decide for the brand.
Integration of Slovak pupils in British schools fails
In British schools, children from Eastern European countries are growing, which raises concerns about the further development of local education among local residents.
The integration of Eastern Europeans is currently facing a number of obstacles.
British schools even register cases where disputes between immigrants and the children of the natives are growing in violence.
The problem of integration of children from Eastern Europe in British schools is well illustrated by the case in northern Kent, where disputes between local settlers and Slovak immigrants are beginning to escalate.
Conflicts, harassment and quarrels between the students have also moved into relationships between the parents.
The situation went so far that in Chatham, police arrested a Slovak woman who beat a ten-year-old student with an iron rod.
The provinyl prevents the boy from insulting her with racist pretensions.
Police had to intervene after the attack of two teenage girls on a Slovak immigrant.
The girls of the men reportedly respected racist remarks and threw stones at him.
"When we went home, a boy climbed up to the bus stop and started spitting at us.
When I told him to let go, he fired at us with apples and pears, and then he revealed his ass," she described another unpleasant incident for The Times, the mother of Slovak pupils.
Complaints are on both sides.
One of the local settlers even labeled disputes with immigrants from Eastern Europe for the struggle for survival.
The above-mentioned cases suggest that the atmosphere in British schools between locals and immigrants is starting to get tense.
There are 70,000 Slovaks registered in the UK who have moved here for work.
About 30,000 Slovak pupils then attend British schools.
Cuba is the most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For visitors, it is truly an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your vacation, it can come true if you choose the right one.
Goldy and white beaches, high waves, or the sea, quiet as a pond.
Palms and all inclusive with waiters offering pizza, ice cream and drunken cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean Sea you will find it in a complete and even richer list.
There is only one island, but you will find much more and the island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Greater Antilles.
For the Spaniards, Cuba was the bastion of their conquest of America.
Columbus described it as the most beautiful place that the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became a treasure trove and translation store that the Spaniards in America plundered and transported to Europe.
And then came the American era.
Hotel Nacional grew up in the late 1920s.
He let him build one of the bosses of the American mafia Lucky Luciano, because everything that was a crime in the United States (especially for prohibition) was welcomed and promoted in Cuba by drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were MJ.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high-rise houses grew, and cars were driving on wide boulevards, which were among the iconic symbols of the 1950s.
Ernest Hemingway bought a settlement in San Francisco de Paula, not far from Havana, and had his yacht in Cojimar.
On the walls of Bodeguita del Medio, they left their signatures with show business stars and politicians from all over America.
What about today?
You can leave your autograph on the walls of the Havana Bodeguita.
In the bar of the expensive hotel Nacional you can mix a cocktail according to your wishes.
And those iconic cars from the 1950s are still driving around Havana because the once-imported snails and fiats in the salty and humid air have long since shuddered.
Although Havana, especially its oldest part, is quite declining, there are not as many beautiful colonial monuments in the area as there.
Other places are also turning into beauty, such as Trinidad.
Since tourism brings in so much needed money, its development has a green one.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana, but especially in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holgu<0xC3><0xAD>n and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers yet another habitat that is unique in the world and is especially appreciated by smugglers.
A third of the extensive plantations were tied to the sugar mills along narrow steam and motor train tracks.
Their fleet has not been refurbished for many decades, so there are working machines there, the layers of which are elsewhere only in museums.
Where to go?
The most famous places most visitors to Cuba do not mine.
So there is no need to write too much about Varadero or Havana.
Let’s just remember that in the Hemingway settlement already mentioned there is a museum and who likes this writer should not miss the visit.
Vinales Valley One of the most picturesque corners of Cuba is the Vinales Valley in the west of the island.
The lush vegetation grows from the limestone floor.
Mogoths, limestone homolas and rocks rise steeply from the bottom of the valley and fertile soils are trapped in their cavities, thanks to which the windy rocks are also covered with dense vegetation.
The valley is the place where perhaps the best quality Cuban tobacco is grown.
Its final form can be seen when you visit one of Havana’s cigar factories.
It may also be interesting to see that the Chilean part of Major Zeman was filmed there.
Trinidad
An ancient city that was founded not long after the Spanish colonized the island.
His fame and wealth were brought to him by the slave trade and the sugar trade.
Wealth has transformed into the beauty and exposition of a small city.
Colonial Spanish architecture, strongly influenced by the later French settlers, has almost not changed in the course of four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, is a place so remote that in the 1950s there was no road that would connect that country with the rest of the country.
Isolation helped him stay away.
Nothing was built there, and therefore nothing was done, everyone was happy to have a roof over his head.
If one has more time on Trinidad than one afternoon, then it is also worth a look at interesting places nearby, such as Playa Anc<0xC3><0xB3>n beach, or the valley of the Sugarloaf.
In the evening you will go to the Casa de la M<0xC3><0xBA>sica, which comes to life after dark and the music in it will be quiet in the morning.
Baracoa
The town in the very east of Cuba is considered by some to be the most beautiful on the island.
Such an opinion is already affecting the road itself.
The two roads that lead from Guant<0xC3><0xA1>namo must cross the high and rugged mountains and walk through nature that human activity has hardly noticed.
The eastern outskirts of Cuba have been listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site thanks to its intact nature.
They make the best chocolate there, in the church they have the Columbus Cross (in fact, it was created about a hundred years after Columbus's voyage) and from the hill, where stands the former castle and the present hotel El Castillo, you can see several table mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, cigarettes, Sierra Maestra, about the Bay of Pigs and Isla de Pinos, about the Tropicana cabaret, about the shrine of the Cuban patron Caridad del Cobre, about santeria, about African religions, about the descendants of all the descendants of these former slaves.
But, as they say, it is better to see once.
Afghanistan's Allies Are Passive, U.S. Says
Few troops and a lack of necessary equipment affect the course of the mission in Afghanistan, according to the United States.
NATO Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said he was planning a plan for the next few years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not as planned, the representatives of the countries that have units in the southern part of the country agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland.
In addition to the growing resistance from the Taliban movement, the eight participating states are currently discussing other plans and the coordination of the allies.
While the United States this week, through Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, called for greater activity by NATO forces, Britain sees priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and strengthening development assistance.
“The development in Afghanistan is tangible, but military strength can only be part of the solution.
The next step is to enable the population to initiate further development of the economy and security on their own," British Defense Minister Des Browne told the BBC.
Ninety percent
The activity of the Afghan insurgents is, according to the U.S. military, the highest in the last five years.
The number of violent incidents rose by 27 percent compared to last year, and in the southern province of Helmand by 60 percent.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, of which about a quarter are in the southern territory.
However, according to the United States, the Allies got to the same limit in the organization and equipment of the units.
Specifically, they are asking for additional helicopters, soldiers and experts for training Afghan troops.
“We’re going to have to seriously think about specific goals for the future and ways to achieve them,” Gates said.
NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop also spoke in a similar way today.
“I’m not happy with what we have in Afghanistan on the ground and in the air.
We have about ninety percent of the troops and equipment we would need, and that's not enough," De Hoop told Reuters at the end of a three-day interview with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
In recent months, there has also been controversy among the countries involved as to whether allies are making the most of Afghanistan.
For example, Germany has been criticized for its passivity.
“The Germans have a relatively large number of representations in Afghanistan.
But they are deployed in areas where there is a minimum of violence and the combat demands for them are not as high as for us in the southern and eastern parts of the country," Gates said.
British newspaper Sun this week labeled German soldiers as sleazy.
"Afghan thugs revealed: Germans are playing while our guys are fighting," Sun wrote in the material, supplemented by images of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild went into counterattack and imprinted a picture of the British unit during a rugby match in southern Afghanistan.
Government Debt Expected to Go Down to One Billion in 2009
For each Czech Republic, the state debt amounts to over 84,000 kroner.
Total debt rose to SEK 842.7 billion at the end of September.
The government is planning to borrow 159.2 billion kroner this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to CZK 152.8 billion thanks to better development of the state budget.
The Czech Republic’s state debt rose to SEK 842.7 billion at the end of September.
In the nine months of this year, it increased by 40.2 billion kroner.
Since June, however, it has decreased by 13.4 billion kroner.
The Ministry of Finance today confirmed its data on the state debt at the beginning of October.
For each Czech, there is a debt of over 84,000 kroner.
For the whole of the year, the state owed more than 111 billion kroner.
"For now, it seems that the lower deficit for next year will allow us to exceed the limit of trillion kroner until 2009.
The debt is expected to be between 900 billion and one trillion kroner next year,” Patria Finance analyst David Marek told iHNed.cz.
Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Pikora, an analyst at Next Finance, said: “We could get over one trillion in 2009.
When exactly will it depend on the next budget, which we do not yet know.
If it turns out that the situation on the political scene would change, politicians would be willing to save more, it could move to 2010.
But I don't expect that change," he said.
Debts are growing
The state debt is the debt of the central government and is mainly caused by the accumulation of the deficits of the state budget.
The state debt is financed by treasury notes, government bonds, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
Domestic government debt has so far increased by 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion kroner.
The state’s foreign debt has so far increased by CZK 1.7 billion to CZK 123.3 billion.
The so-called marketable government debt at the end of September reached CZK 803.3 billion and has fallen by CZK 13.7 billion since June.
The average repayment of state debt increased to 6.5 years.
“Total debt increased by 13 per cent year-on-year in the first to third quarter, which is really a lot about how the economy prospers.
Interestingly, the increase is generated mainly in bonds, where the increase is 20 percent.
It’s bad that debt is growing, but on the other hand, it shows that there will be a pension reform here,” Pikora said.
Better than expected.
According to the 2007 State Debt Financing and Management Strategy, the government has planned to borrow CZK 159.2 billion this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to CZK 152.8 billion thanks to better development of the state budget.
This is mainly due to the state budget deficit, which is expected to reach CZK 76 billion this year instead of the projected CZK 91.3 billion.
Furthermore, these are the planned maximum resources for the Czech Consolidation Agency of CZK 13.3 billion, the ten billion reserve for payment of pensions, the financing of government bonds of CZK 43 billion and the repayment of loans from the European Investment Bank of CZK 1.8 billion.
A woman is due to appear in court today in Cart<0xC3><0xBA>m for giving a name to a teddy bear
A British teacher, convicted in Sudan for insulting Islam, was sentenced to fifteen days in prison by a Charter Court on Thursday evening and expelled, according to her lawyer.
The British woman was accused of allowing six to seven-year-olds to name a plush bear Muhammad despite the fact that any depiction of the Prophet of Islam is prohibited.
She was subjected to a whiplash penalty.
This British forty-year-old teacher, working at Unity High School in the Sudanese Charter, was arrested at her home on Sunday and charged with insulting Islam and rebelling, in accordance with article 125 of the school's <0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>k <0xC5><0x9E><0xC3><0xAD>l<0xC3><0xA1>k under the Sudanese Criminal Code.
Our story actually begins in September, when the teacher in question asks her six- to seven-year-old pupils to choose a name for a classy teddy bear.
“The children will hear eight names from their mouths, including Hasan, Abdullah and Mohamed,” said Robert Boulos, the school’s director.
After a class vote, 20 of the 23 children will eventually choose Mohamed as their favorite name.
Of course, Mohammed is the name of a Muslim prophet, but it is a very common name in Sudan.
The children then created a book for their class with a picture of a bear accompanied by a caption: "My name is Mohamed".
The bear itself did not have a label with this name, but the difficulty is in the depiction of the prophet itself considered an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons’ Muslim colleagues, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, said she knew her well and that she would never do anything that would be offensive to any religious faith: “I regret only that she had asked the children to vote for her.”
This view is also shared by many pupils of the teacher, who describe it as "very attentive to their pupils" and add that "never in the classroom is talking about religion".
Remember, Mohamed's first name is also the second most commonly given first name in the United Kingdom, in English it is written in fourteen different ways.
This name, often chosen by Muslim families, is a way of worshipping a prophet (often given to the firstborn).
What, though, are the rules regarding the use of this baptismal name?
Is it possible to give a toy?
Of course, it is a question of interpretation.
At the last round of negotiations this Wednesday in Vienna did not reach an agreement on the future status of the province.
In the end, failure.
Serbian and Kosovo Albanians ended the sixth and final round of talks in Baden, Austria, on Wednesday morning, without being able to overcome differing views on the future status of this separatist province.
"It is regrettable that both sides were not able to reach a status agreement," European negotiator Wolfgang Ischinger said at a press conference in Vienna.
His U.S. counterpart, Frank Wisner, stressed that peace in the region is "at stake" and called on Belgrade and Pristina to ensure that their commitments to respect peace are respected and that they are ready for dialogue even after the negotiations are over.
"We do not expect violence in the near future, but we are entering a challenging period," he added, adding that "it is obvious that the situation is tense."
Negotiations will end on December 10
The Troika negotiators, consisting of representatives of the European Union, the United States and Russia, will travel to Kosovo for the last time on Monday.
The future of the province, where 90 percent of the Albanian-speaking population is present, could be shown in a brighter light by December 10, when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian negotiator Alexander Bocan-Charchenko are to hand over their report to the UN Security Council.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, are the sixth and final round of negotiations since the UN, in August of this year, commissioned the Troika to renegotiate.
The U.S. and Europeans expect the talks to end on Dec. 10.
The Russians, who have previously blocked the granting of independence to Kosovo in the UN Security Council, insist, however, that the negotiations continue even after this deadline.
“Russia has been and remains inclined to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution,” Bocan-Charchenko said.
One-sided declaration of independence?
After eight years of administration of the international community, the West considers Kosovo’s independence under the supervision of the EU as the only concomitant solution.
Pristina declares that if the Security Council does not decide in its favour, it is prepared to declare independence unilaterally.
Belgrade insists on a broader autonomy.
"Unfortunately, we have not reached any agreement," Kosovo self-government president Fatmir Sejdiu said in a hotel in Baden-Württemberg, where the "last chance" negotiations took place since Monday.
Hashim Tha<0xC3><0xA7>i, a former rebel commander of the Kosovo Albanians and future prime minister of the province, expressed regret.
However, he added that the plan of autonomy presented by Belgrade "belongs to the past that led to murders and deportations".
"Domain effect"
Serbian President Boris Tadi<0xC4><0x87>, on the other hand, believes that the compromise is still being considered and warned the Albanian majority in Kosovo of the consequences of a possible unilaterally declared independence of the province.
In particular, Belgrade is concerned about the "domestic effect" in an area that is still unstable due to the independence wars of the 1990s.
"But for Serbia it does not mean," he said, "that a compromise is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that all decisions be exclusively the responsibility of the Security Council, in which its Russian ally has the right to veto.
"The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word"
"For Serbia, the only solution received from the Security Council is acceptable," said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
"This negotiation lasted two years.
It must end as it began: on the ground of the Security Council."
Fatmir Sedjiu told reporters that "the Kosovo parliament will have the final word on the status" and added that if a unilateral declaration of independence by Albanian-speaking residents were made, it would take place "by agreement" with the West.
Bush has signed a deal with Israelis and Palestinians.
At the start of the international peace conference in Annapolis, Maryland, convened at his urging, U.S. President George Bush announced that the Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint statement.
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas agreed to immediately start negotiations with the intention of resolving a 60-year-old dispute between the two nations.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised to do everything he could to help them conclude a “peace deal” before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians must destroy the “terrorist infrastructure” and Israel must stop colonial activities, Bush said, recalling the obligations that flow from the “travel map” for both sides to the peace they accepted in 2003.
The White House chief stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, led by Abbas, are aimed at "the conclusion of a peace treaty that would solve all the unresolved issues without exception, including central issues."
This statement includes three issues at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees displaced in the 1948 conflict from their homes on the territory of today’s state of Israel.
Abbas took the words after the US president, emphasizing that the subsequent negotiations were "total and thorough" and that they touched on all aspects of the solution, mentioning "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among others".
Then, Olmert took the stand, who expressed the view that the subsequent negotiations should be "direct and continuous" and that "it is necessary to ensure that it is closed during 2008".
Bush set the end of 2008 as the deadline for the realization of his “two-state vision”, Palestinian and Israeli, existing alongside each other.
Saudi Arabia has revealed that it has accepted a commitment from Bush in this sense before it decided to attend the conference.
Saudi Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, initiated a proposal adopted by all Arab countries that offers peace to Israel in exchange for leaving all Arab territories taken over during the 1967 wars, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis means “a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it fights against the roots of the conflict and its central aspects,” the Saudi prince said in an interview with an Arabic-speaking newspaper covered by Saudi capital.
According to the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As is always the case with such small news from the Black Chronicle, the official versions do not agree with what is said among people.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of an investigation by the Inspection générale de la police nationale (IGPN), a police car was driven by Louise-Michel street in the village of Villiers-le-Bel on Sunday.
"The vehicle was not in interception mode, but was on patrol and traveled at speeds of 40 to 50 km/h, while the side lights were not on," the police source explained.
The green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, "unregistered, and therefore without permission to drive on public roads" (read below), driven by two youngsters without a helmet, passed "very high speed".
“The motorcycle hit a police car from the left after not giving preference to the right,” one police officer said.
The blood alcohol test performed on the vehicle's crew turned out to be negative.
The condition of the car (propelled front, split windscreen, broken bumpers) indicates the severity of the impact.
Marie-Thér<0xC3><0xA8>se de Givry, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise (République de Pontoise) reacted very quickly and announced yesterday morning that the IGPN had commissioned an investigation into the "acts of unintentional murder and the police department of Valdipart<0xC3><0xA8> du'eOparté duPr<0xC3><0xA8>me (the police department of Valdiment-dé-dé-dé-de-de-dé-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>-d<0xC3><0xA0>
On the occasion of the afternoon press conference, the prosecutor stated that the investigation conducted by the IGPN excludes, at this stage, the responsibility of the police officers for the accident.
Three witnesses who were interrogated on Sunday night confirmed "the version of the policemen, which is that the mini-girl approached them quite quickly from the left."
What a ripple, undoubtedly caused by rubbing the clips over the ground, showed yesterday that both vehicles remained tilted until the moment when the police car was able to brake.
The vehicles have been secured and will pass through technical expertise.
The bodies of the two victims were stabbed yesterday.
What happened, right after?
Yesterday, in Villiers-le-Bel, people quickly spread the word that police officers should quickly leave the scene of the crime without providing first aid to two young people.
The IGPN should, with all caution, also rule out “any serious culpability” at this point.
"This is a more demanding aspect of the investigation, which requires more search and with which we need to be very careful," the police source said.
The newspaper "Libération" met with an eyewitness for the few moments that followed the accident.
One of his windows leads directly to where the accident took place.
“Immediately, my cousin, who is a nurse in the hospital, and I ran downstairs to try to resurrect them,” the witness said.
I couldn't do anything."
Then he saw a "flying, completely frightened policeman.
Two others tried to resurrect one of the young men, and the fourth was on the phone.”
Faced with the rapidly increasing tension and the certainty of the young people present that the situation is hopeless, the policemen were driven by the car of the colleagues, who in the meantime arrived at the site.
According to the same witness, the rescue arrived "about twenty minutes after the departure of the police".
They also performed a heart massage, but in vain.
"Let no one claim that the police authorities have not rushed to help the young people.
First aid was provided to these young people.
The firefighters arrived immediately.
“Everything has been done to save them,” the prosecutor said.
Tension in Pakistan is on the rise
Pakistani police on Monday suppressed the first demonstration since the declaration of a state of emergency by General Musharraf, two days earlier.
In the city of Lahore, in the east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers protesting against measures taken under the state of emergency, were wounded by tear gas grenades that, according to witnesses, used law enforcement.
The latter responded with stones, injuring several police officers.
At least 350 lawyers have been called in.
Similar scenarios as in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where policemen attacked and wounded lawyers.
Several of them had to be called.
In Islamabad, Supreme Court lawyers called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, as a result of a wave of about five hundred arrests of opponents, human rights fighters and lawyers over the weekend.
The access streets to the Supreme Court were overcrowded on Monday morning in order to prevent gatherings.
Further demonstrations were to take place in Multan (center) and Peshawar (northwest).
On Monday, the movement won the support of the religious parties grouped into the politically strong alliance Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, whose president "requested the population to send flowers to judges who opposed the state of emergency" and inflicted a blow on those who were in the forefront.
"Musharaf's promise doesn't apply"
Pakistan’s Supreme Court is the direct target of an emergency measure announced on Saturday night.
In the coming days, he was expected to comment on the legality of President Musharraf’s re-election in the indirect presidential election that took place on October 6.
Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry has been removed and replaced.
"All we have seen is illegal, unconstitutional, and against the Supreme Court's rulings," the official said in a statement.
Parv<0xC3><0xAD>z Musharraf's promise to give up the leadership of the army and become a civilian president "will not apply" after the introduction of the state of emergency, Deputy Information Minister Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
He was expected to give up his military uniform until November 15, when his first presidential term ended.
The Deputy Information Minister also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
The Pakistani government has also refuted ongoing speculation in the country that a deputy army chief had ordered President Musharraf to be held under house arrest.
More than a third of pregnancies still make up an unexpected pregnancy
This calculation includes unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as misplanned or unplanned pregnancies.
More than one in three pregnancies (36%) is still unexpected today, according to a study conducted by the French Institut national d'études d'émographiques (Ined) - the State Institute of Demographic Studies, forty years after the adoption of the so-called Neuwirth Act, which in France has been anticipating the adoption of the law.
This calculation includes unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as misplanned or unplanned pregnancies.
Various methods of contraception, such as hormonal contraception or sterilization, still show 5% to 6% of the rate of failure, Ined estimates.
The law of contraception has only allowed for better "fertility control", the institute claims, and notes that the rate of hormonal contraception in women between the ages of 20 and 44 has risen from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Finally, eight out of ten births are well-planned today.
One in five couples even have a birth calculated on the month exactly and, if possible, in the spring, which is considered the most pleasant period of the year for the birth of a child.
Remarkable repair of the space station
For more than seven hours of space work, astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crew from the International Space Station (ISS) needed a remarkable repair of the ruptured solar panel necessary for the station’s further scientific activity.
It was a risky outing into space that set records as to the duration, distance from the residential modules, the speed at which it was planned, and the rates of "cosmicity" that the astronauts spent on repairing.
Troubles surfaced on Tuesday as astronauts from the Discovery launched the Harmony module, a large cylindrical unit designed to install a European and Japanese scientific laboratory (see box).
This module is some kind of landing pier for modules-laboratories.
They need to be able to supply electricity.
The second task of the crew, therefore, was to relocate the seventeen-and-a-half-tonne power-generating module using solar panels already on the ISS to anchor at its final station.
After moving it, the crew began to dismantle the module's seventy-foot solar panels.
And in it, one of the panels, decomposing as a towing harmonica, due to the tightening of the cable, was damaged on the surface of almost one meter.
Disassembly was suspended to prevent further damage to the panel.
The astronauts, who were originally to perform a checkout on the ship Discovery, and subsequently go to repair another solar panel, whose rotation system had a malfunction, were forced to devote to the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was chosen to fly to the end of the robotic shoulder of the ship, added to the shoulder of the station, and did the repair.
It is one of the best "spacewalkers" (spacewalkers) of the American Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).
Tall, slender, very neat, has a very elaborate chest and long arms.
At the age of 46, this original profession was entrusted to the doctor by "operating" the "polarized" solar panel.
After scrutinizing the damage, he cut off the faulty cable and attached some "threads" to the damaged places.
He was assisted by a second "spacewalker" who remained near the reconnaissance chamber, as well as from within, by other astronauts, including Peggy Witson, the crew commander.
The tools he used, a mini-hockey hockey with insulating means, to prevent electroshocks on the solar panels producing several hundred volts, were invented and "after the coupling" made by astronauts on board the station.
After the operation was over, Scott Parazynski waited until the panel was completely dismantled and then inventoried his tools and returned to the inner part of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed a half-day rest before today, when seven astronauts return to the Discovery ship to return to Earth on Wednesday, as planned.
EADS shares weaken
EADS shares are losing significantly on the Paris Stock Exchange after the airline, operating in the aviation and defense industry, announced it would have to spend <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.2 to 1.4 billion to face the delay of the A400M.
EADS lost 4% and is now on the Paris Stock Exchange at 21.96 euros.
The Financial Group was forced to re-evaluate its expected production results for 2007 as a result of delays arising from the slow progress in the development of the A400M aircraft engine, which is a prerequisite for the start of the flight.
The price for mitigating delays in deliveries of a military cargo aircraft, announced in October, was calculated “at 1.2 to 1.4 billion euros, of which more than one billion for Airbus,” the parent company of European constructor EADS said in a statement.
Due to these costs, EADS will be forced to announce a new earnings outlook before deducting interest and tax (EBIT) on Thursday, when it presents its quarterly results.
The group also revealed that the new cost estimate corresponds to a six-month delay.
It should be recalled that EADS’s production performance in 2006 fell by 86 %, in particular due to the costs associated with the delay of another programme, namely the giant A380.
Initially, the group assumed that the first delivery of the A400M to the French Army would be in October 2009.
Decision for the status quo
Sunday’s election will take place without strained expectations: Russians will vote for President Putin’s party, United Russia.
Confirming thus, after the end of very little free election campaign, its tendency towards stability, even to authoritarianism.
Today, three days before the elections to the House of Representatives, Russian President Vladimir Putin will communicate to voters on public law stations a pre-arranged television message, but the content of which is kept secret.
It is thus out of the position of the leader of the United Russia, the pro-Kremlin party, which is supposed to celebrate a crushing victory.
When he received foreign ambassadors yesterday, the president left nothing out of him and was content with another attack on the West accused of meddling – his favorite theme during the campaign.
“We know the price of true democracy and we wish for the fairest, most transparent and open choices possible, choices without the slightest flaw in beauty,” he said.
In the eyes of the opposition, this is by no means the case.
They condemn a campaign marked by various pressures.
Communist leader Gennady Zjuganov says that “there have never been such a dirty election, not even for Yeltsin.”
Following the repression accompanying last weekend’s demonstrations, former World Chess Champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for an illegal demonstration, continues to be banned, according to his lawyers.
"Russians still have a homo sovietica mentality"
Against the backdrop of these simple, tense parliamentary elections, there are two far more open questions:
"Who will become Putin's successor in the presidential office?
The Official Gazette yesterday published the date of the first round of the presidential election, March 2, 2008; candidates can be presented to the public by December 23.
Vladimir Putin, elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, cannot seek a third term in a row.
However, no successors appear to be present.
"What role will Putin play after March?"
Will he be prime minister?
Or the head of the parliamentary majority and the omnipotent United Russia party, who will elect the government and the president?
Either way, the outgoing ruling power will win over the entire line in the parliamentary, as well as in the presidential elections.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians still have a homo soviet mentality, they don't feel like they're master of their destiny," says sociologist Lev Gudkov, director of the independent center of Levada.
Historian Nikolai Kopossov of the State University of St. Petersburg observes the more distant contexts of time: civil society, in this Christian country five centuries after Europe, has been delayed; that famous common spirit has delayed the formation of individuals.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Putin has attached to the paternalistic model of the state, perfectly accepted by the population, rather than that this new paternalism was caused by terror, but a certain economic well-being," believes Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians "voluntarily give up personal responsibilities", which they proved briefly after the collapse of the USSR.
"What to think about?"
This phenomenon applies to all social strata, including the business world.
The official elite also intends to maintain the status quo: 65 governors (out of a total of 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local candidates of the United Russia.
New freedoms taken from the West are often, as in the 1990s, synonymous with chaos.
Public opinion prefers stability.
Also, in the name of stability, the Russians will not vote for extremists.
Conclusion of Tamara Cherednichenko, a forty-year-old professor: "What to think?
Those who are in power are not so bad, so why change them?"
Compulsive memory
After more than sixty years in a confidential regime, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which depict the fate of the 17.5 million victims of Hitler’s regime, are opening to the public.
The 47 million archival documents stored for 27 km in Bad Arolsen (Hesse) were accessible to date only for "humanitarian" purposes, that is, individually and specifically, at the request of the former victim or his authorized persons.
Eleven states responsible for managing the archives - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May to open them to scientists and historians.
Since the process of ratification of this agreement by all States is at an end, yesterday’s opening took effect.
Sensitive Information
The free access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow to explore "particularly the movements of prisoners, the population of camps and the health of forced workers", explains Reto Meistern, director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (Comité international de la Croix-rouge).
Until recently, several states, including Germany, were opposed to making these naming documents available to the public, due to the sensitive nature of some information.
What are the alleged homosexuality or mental disabilities of some victims of deportation?
After the war, the registers of concentration camps or detainees compiled by the Gestapo were collected for the practical purpose of finding deported or forced labor of civilians subjected to them, bringing them proof of their internment in order to open the way for their compensation.
Today, more than 300 permanent employees in Bad Arolsen are still dealing with tens of thousands of individual applications.
However, for part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is only a limited benefit.
"We cannot expect anything fundamentally new from these documents," said Prof. Wolfgang Benz, director of the Center for the Study of Anti-Semitism at the Technische Universität Berlin in 2006.
The EU and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
Bilateral trade between Europe and India is now at least <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 billion a year.
The EU is India’s first trading partner, accounting for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India are expected to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath said.
In April last year, the EU’s foreign ministers gave the European Commission a green letter to start negotiations to sign free trade agreements (ALE) with India, South Korea, Europe, and the Association of South-East Asian and Non-Asean Countries.
The EU is India’s first trading partner, accounting for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is, according to the European Commission, the EU’s ninth trading partner.
“The free trade agreement is hugely complementary to both economies,” and “India will gain better market access for 450 million thriving Europeans,” Mandelson said.
Europe presents the first or second of the European Commission’s European Commission for the first of the first ten products exported by India, the European Commissioner has specified the European Commission’s European Commission for the first or second time. The European Commission for the first of the first ten products exported by India. The Asian and European giants exchange together “47 billion euros in goods” and “ten billion euros in services”.

The Bank of England took note of the concerns and offered <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion in a five-week auction
The Bank of England revealed on Thursday that it intends to mitigate current concerns about the deterioration of conditions in the credit market again and has announced a <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion bid in a five-week auction at a basic interest rate of 5.75%, an unusually valid bid.
"In an effort to alleviate concerns that conditions on the financial markets will be very unfavorable at the end of the year and to give banks greater certainty in the way to secure their cash position for this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant part of its planned reserves for the period of operation," the Bank intends to maintain a period of operation for the period of six months.
The Bank specifies that <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>14 billion) will be placed on the financial market on December 6 at 12.15 GMT until January 10, at the basic interest rate.
It seems to be the first time that BOE has pumped cash into the financial market in a five-week open-market operation.
They usually take a week.
BOE adds in its communiqué that it "remains prepared to take additional measures to keep inter-day interest rates" on interbank loans at the same level as its base rate.
The inter-day interbank interest rate stood at 5.829 percent on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate stood at 6.6 per cent, the highest since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the amounts placed on the financial market by the Bank of England have been linked to fees that have discouraged the banks from using this offer.
According to certain speculations intensified by the development of the pound against the euro, many prefer to opt for sums placed on the financial market by the European Central Bank with lower rates and more guaranteed discretion.
UMP (Union pour un mouvement populare, Union for People's Movement) and NC (Nouveau Centre, Nov<0xC3><0xBD> m<0xC5><0x99>ed) refuse to deal with the proposals of the Socialists (PS) on purchasing power
Clubs UMP and Nouveau Centre on Thursday refused to discuss individual sections of the socialist draft law on purchasing power, which is equivalent to rejecting the text.
On the agenda of the day, the text of the draft law was received within the framework of the so-called socialist "nest" (meetings initiated by each member's club) and contained ten measures adopted on Tuesday by the PS presidency, among which were an increase in the employment premium by 50% by the PP or PP.
Since the UMP and the NC voted against the deliberations of individual paragraphs (180 votes to 115), the meeting was closed after a general debate, which became an opportunity for an exchange of views, sometimes more lively, between the majority and the opposition.
PS MEP Jean-Marc Ayrault has announced that his club will re-submit these proposals in their entirety in the form of appendices to the amending bill on finance, which the House will discuss next week.
A new festival is born
As a result of much speculation that C3 Presents is setting up a new festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer of the Vineland Festival in New Jersey announced in collaboration with the Republic Festival of British Organizer Melvin Benn.
“It’s an honor for our company to work with a person who has inspired the current festival movement in America without any effort,” Charlie Jones of C3 told Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Chicago Lollapalooza Festival and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland in New Jersey is the summer destination for campers.
The festival is scheduled to take place from August 8-10 on a 500-acre private farm, about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of the Republic Festival, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the world’s most renowned festival organizers.
In 1989, he took the helm of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio, and in 2006, the Festival Republic founded the Latitude Festival in Henham Park, Suffolk.
Starting in 2002, Melvin Benn, as co-owner, has also been in charge of production, licensing and organizing tasks at the Glastonbury Festival, which today has a capacity of up to 177,500 people.
C3’s Charlie Jones calls Glastonbury the “most inspiring event” he’s ever had and says his firm and Melvin Benna are working simultaneously to give the region a European-style festival event.
“We originally chose Philadelphia as a market, and together with the Fairmount Parks Commission, we worked hard to found the festival in downtown Philadelphia,” says Charlie Jones.
“I had a conversation with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited about the project.
Unfortunately, however, due to the current leadership of the city, we have been prevented from politicizing, adds Charlie Jones.
"Fortunately, we had the opportunity to discuss with Melvin Benn, and we are going to set up a great festival in an exceptional place that will ultimately serve the people of Philadelphia."
C3 Presents revived the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago's Grant Park in 2005, after appearing on the festival scene in 2002 by hosting the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Gross sales for both events for 2007 were $9.8M and $11.3M.
Both of these festivals take place in the urban environment.
“The European model of the Melvin Benna Festival takes place in the countryside, while our festivals take place in the green spaces of cities,” says Charlie Jones.
Our goal is to somehow combine the two concepts so that we can create the impression of a rural festival in Europe as well as urban in America.”
Vineland is located about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“Obec Vineland, including the mayor, is excited to support this event,” says Charlie Jones.
The latter, however, refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, stating that they are "convenient enough to allow them to invest in such an event and welcome a festival that will, hopefully, have a long duration".
Charlie Jones says the capacity of this festival is "very high," similar to the capacity of the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee, which accommodates 80,000 people.
He says that invitations have already been sent to the groups, but nothing can be confirmed yet at the time the program is just being printed.
“Vineland will have a rock feel, but the music will be crowded there to attract a wide range of viewers if possible,” says Carlie Jones.
C3’s partners, who won the Top Independent Promoter award at the Billboard Touring Awards last year, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal is facing the Terminators.
It’s not easy to attract Hollywood film studios to Montreal when Terminator confronts it.
This persuasion mission is one of the tasks of the delegate.
However, his mandate is "politically demanding" because California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger denounces "runaway productions".
Is it difficult to fall into the trap of the "Governor"?
“You have to be careful, it’s the industry that decides where it’s going.
If he finds that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, he will go there.
Our job is to offer those that they will consider to be the best,” he said.
Homba for festivals
For now, however, Denise Turcotte's priority is to promote the local film.
The hunt for the Oscars has begun.
At all West Coast festivals, whether it’s festivals in Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it’s about introducing Quebec films, notifying them and making sure the directors provide interviews.
The Age of Darkness had good publicity at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on offer in Santa Monica and will be presented in November at the 30th annual Starz Denver Film Festival.
This month, Québec also presented four short films and four full-length films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Will there be a marathon at the end of the year on the stock market? Experts split 'subprime' crisis
Less than five weeks are left until the end of the management year and investors are already holding hands with me in the expectation that there will be a traditional marathon at the end of the year.
This year, however, the experts are not so sure that it will happen.
Banif believes that "the month of December is statistically positive on the exchange".
However, it is not appropriate to create forecasts solely on the basis of statistics, especially because in the current context, at least in the short term, there are certain doubts."
These experts do not predict that the stock market will fluctuate in the last few weeks of the year, stating that "the stock market is maintained by the existence of liquidity, which is ready to invest due to the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially the gains of a fixed income as a result of a price effect affected by a qualitative turnover".
Therefore, they believe that the stock market will have a rather quiet course, not without volatility, "primarily because there is no known impact of the likely collapse of the Fed's (Federal Reserve System) rates, given the high level of oil prices and the risk of inflationary pressures".
Javier Barrio, the head of BPI’s sales in Spain, agrees that it’s not the right time to make a bold statement about the marathon.
"There's not much reason to be happy," the expert assures.
Ibex lost almost 4% of its record highs on November 8, when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
However, not all experts have such a negative opinion.
Juan Solana, an Intermoney analyst, believes that Ibex 35 could end the year by a little closer to 16,000 points thanks to the regrouping of portfolios and traditional pension contributions that occur each year at this time.
However, this expert suggests that this year everything will be a little different, as he believes that the marathon will take place earlier, in the second week of December after an extended weekend on the occasion of Constitution Day.
The analyst mentioned does not think that volatility would affect the direction of the market.
Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, also estimates that we are approaching the technical level and "so we could observe a reflection of the index triggered by US reports of the effects of the crisis on the credit market."
Analysts believe that these consequences will be positive.
Analysts agree on selecting titles to take Ibex to new maximum odds.
Solana of Intermoney confirms that "this year is the turn for strong titles".
This expert would include both major banks and some construction companies in the portfolio, “because when this period comes, the energy industry will be very expensive.”
Federico Olucha from Inversis Banco, on the other hand, assures that the increases will go hand in hand with the banking and industrial sector.
Construction companies will also be able to get rich on this marathon if it happens.
“ACS has been taking positions for several months now and we hope that other construction companies such as Ferrovial and the FCC will follow the same path,” the expert explains.
Cycle consumption will be at the forefront in the last part of the year thanks to the increase in sales during the Christmas sale period.
This expert, on the other hand, believes that the technologies will also perform very well, even if they are not too represented in the Spanish market in this field.
Five times in seven years.
In the last seven years, December has only been a month of collapses in two cases.
The actual marathon at the end of the year took place in 2003, in the administrative year when the stock market ended the crisis caused by the leakage of the technology bubble.
This year, when Ibex 35 regained 28.17%, December saw an increase of 6.68%.
We will also see if 2007 will be the fifth year of profitability (Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and whether it will manage to have its marathon at the end of the year.
Two hundred branches of Popular Bank will be open 12 hours from Friday to Saturday
Banka Popular has decided to modernize most of its branches.
A total of two hundred, located in the most economical parts of Spain.
These branches operated under the brand Popular Max are a big change for the bank.
The same goes for other Spanish entities, as it is the first group to make such a jump and bet on the continuous opening hours of their branches until 20.30 hours and open on Saturdays from 10 to 20.30 hours.
BBVA, another group that has also repeatedly assured that it wants to extend the opening hours of its branches, has not yet decided on this step.
In the meantime, it intends to conclude an agreement with trade unions to cancel 75% of its branches on Saturday in exchange for an extension of opening hours by one afternoon, albeit not for the public.
The results of this experience of Popular Bank will be crucial for other entities to join this initiative, which promotes opening hours of trade, or not.
This is exactly the goal of the project that Bank Popular has set itself.
Get individual clients who go to these places for their purchases, small and medium-sized companies, grocers and shops from the selected streets, where there will be opening branches.
The Bank wants to open 200 of these branches across Spain in about 18 months, as it is not about opening new branches, but only about adjusting the existing ones.
For this reason, the bank modernizes the branches it already has in the commercial zones by adapting them to the profile of clients in the individual streets.
This extension of the opening time is complemented by a different concept of the branch space and a new, more up-to-date design in lighter colors.
<0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivera, the bank’s chief commercial officer, said the restructuring would not mean a big investment, but a larger recruitment of staff, as it shifted from six employees at the branch to eight to nine.
The branches will even be equipped with meeting rooms for small and medium-sized companies and will also sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group.
Banka Popular has already tested this initiative in three branches in Madrid.
And it was a positive experience, as <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivera explains.
Branch offices were selected in Madrid's streets of Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran V<0xC3><0xAD>a, and according to Rivera, it seems to have been a happy choice.
Banka Popular currently has 2,500 branches.
And another 60 specialised immigrants, which are operated under the Mundocredit brand, also have very long opening hours and are open even on Sundays and holidays.
PopularMax branches will not follow the BBVA model, when a number of its branches offer a wide range of non-financial products for sale.
“We don’t want to compete with our clients,” says Rivera.
They have just agreed with Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nica to sell mobile phones through external staff.
Telecinco doubles the value of its rival Antena 3 for the first time on the stock exchange
We've done it.
With this sentence, yesterday Paolo Vasile, CEO of Telecinco, expressed his satisfaction at the conclusion of the trade, when he found that the TV he runs, doubled the value of his rival Antenna 3.
“There was only one thing that made him happy: ‘What I regret is that it didn’t happen because we grew more, but because we fell less,’” he said.
And he stressed that because of the weak market, 'we've fallen less'.
Telecinco ended trading by a 2.54% shift yesterday.
This profit pushed their loss over the past part of the year to 15.66%.
The stock market value of this company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) with the participation of Vocent (another 13%) is thus, according to Bloomberg data, 4 488.88 million euros.
Its competitor Antena 3, which fell by 1.52 percent yesterday and has fallen by 40.5 percent since January, has a half value of 2,193.46 million.
The value of the other telecom companies that were evaluated is 3.571 billion in the case of Sogecable, 2,518.53 million Prisa (published by Cinco D<0xC3><0xAD>as) and 1.779 billion Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenna 3 offers, because 'we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do in the same market, at what price and how we evaluate it in terms of tracking.
Telecinco announced last week that it expects this year to be the first television channel to surpass billions of gross advertising revenues, according to Giuseppe Tringali, executive chairman of Telecinco and Publiespa<0xC3><0xB1>a, the company’s advertising subsidiary.
If the projected data were actually reached, this TV channel would see an increase in advertising turnover of 3.6% this year, compared to 965.4 million in 2006.
At the same time, in the first nine months of the year, the net turnover of Antena 3 increased by 1.6% (to reach 734.4 million), while the net revenue of this television increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts focus on for the best relative development of Telecinco on the stock market is the increased pay out, which it has so far retained: in 2006, the company, chaired by Alejandro Echevarr<0xC3><0xAD>a, shared 100% of its profit among its shareholders.
Vasile says that although it is early to decide, this coefficient could change after the purchase of 33% of Endemol together with its parent company Mediaset.
“We have an official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always announced much more.
I hope that this year we will be able to satisfy our shareholders, with whom we have already increased the value of Endemola by 33%."
According to analysts, the market at these moments is showing some fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently lowered its estimate of Telecinco’s profits by 4% in 2008 and 7% in 2009.
This is due to the fact that the projected revenue growth stopped from 0,5 % to 8,4 % in 2008 and from 5,5 % to 5,1 % in 2009.
The same company reduced the expected profit of Antena 3 by 4,5 % in 2008 and 7,5 % in 2009.

Congress approves MiFID transposition effective November 1st
At the same time as the parliamentary hearings, which ended today with a Congressional vote on the amendments incorporated by the Senate into the bill, the government submitted to a public hearing of regulations developing the new law, with the aim of both coming into force before the end of the year.
Representatives of the parties have consistently highlighted the efforts of MPs and senators to negotiate and agree on the best standard to ensure the protection of investors and the detailed regulation of the activities of entities necessary for the effective functioning of the markets.
The MiFID Directive, which regulates the Securities Trading Act, provides for the modernization of financial markets and at the same time strengthens investor protection, improves the supervisory powers of the State Securities Markets Commission (CNMV) and promotes cooperation between European institutions.
This new regulation will enable financial advisory services to be provided to both specialised firms and natural or legal persons and will create a new type of financial service provider (ESSI), financial advisory firms (AFI), which connect to the companies with securities and securities brokers.
In addition, the number of systems for performing transactions with financial instruments is being expanded by joining regulated secondary markets through multilateral trading systems and order internalisation systems that will compete with current exchange brokers.
The law further obliges investment services companies to disseminate information on key aspects of their business profile, exposure to risk and ways of dealing with risk in the market, and requires a report of all operations performed to simplify supervision by CNMV.
During the discussion in the Congressional Trade Commission, a number of amendments were included, among which stands out that securitised receivables are considered to be a "complex" financial instrument due to the high risk posed to the investor by the risks that have been shown to be high by the US.
In addition, the transposition of the directive was used to legalize functions that may be held by bachelors in economics and business management 30 years after the Royal Decree was approved in 1977, which outlines professional functions reserved for economists.
At the same time, the Senate has ordered the creation of new professions in the financial sector, such as an intermediary that will work externally, will not require permission from CNMV and will be able to provide product trading and customer acquisition services for different investment firms at the same time.
Harmonized ISC increased by five tenths to 4.1% in November
This indicator, which will later be used by Eurostat to calculate the European Union’s inflation index, provides preliminary information on how prices developed in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication corresponds to the policies of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) to provide data in a timely and quality comparable to those achieved in the United States.
This preliminary indicator is calculated using the same process as used for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, but using different statistical modelling methods for estimating information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The Spanish INE (State Statistical Institute) recalled that the information provided by this preliminary indicator is indicative only and may therefore not necessarily correspond to the final data, which will become available on 14 December of this year.
“The ISC will remain at a relatively high level.”
Second Deputy Prime Minister and Economy Minister Pedro Solbes said the November increase in the ISC to 4.1% was a "temporary figure", but at the same time predicted that the price index would remain at a relatively "high level" in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes in the ballot box of Congress stated that "although it will not be a favorable figure", Spain's inflation differential towards the monetary union is still "more or less" the same over the past two years.
He also explained that November was "less surprising" than the previous month, when the government did not expect such a high increase.
“We expected a value of about 4%,” the Minister of Economy said in a statement.
Virgin plans to make <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>42 billion with Northern Rock in three years
Since Northern Rock went into crisis in mid-September and had to resort to emergency lending from the Bank of England, its deposits have fallen by more than 50% to <0xC2><0xA3>12 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>16.8 billion).
The bank then handled record deposits worth more than <0xC2><0xA3>25 billion, which gradually fell over two and a half months by clients’ distrust despite the government offering a 100% guarantee for the money and prolonging it until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which will replace the entity’s name with its Virgin Money brand, needs to earn about a quarter of the revenue invested in UK banks over the next three years to earn the remaining <0xC2><0xA3>18 billion to reach its target of $30 billion.
Richard Branson, a group known in the United Kingdom for its impressive advertising campaigns, plans to spend <0xC2><0xA3>50 million (about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>70 million) a year on advertising and marketing to achieve its purpose.
Northern Rock Bank this week marked an offer by the Virgin consortium, which consists of three other companies, as one that prefers to save them from bankruptcy.
Mayor of Totana Arrested for Alleged Corruption in Construction
The Civil Guard has detained the current mayor of the Murcian city of Totana (from the People's Party) today in the early hours of the morning for his alleged involvement in the construction corruption practices, which were revealed this week.
One of the city’s secretaries and the local police chief were also arrested.
José Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez Andreo replaced Juan Morales, the current MEP and mayor of the municipality, in May this year, who, according to investigative sources addressed by Cadena TV SER, could have been the 'head' of the entire company.
Police continue to monitor the buildings of the town hall and the construction commission and no further arrests are excluded in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer Juan Morales, the chief suspect of corruption in construction practices, was accused, which were revealed earlier this week.
Yesterday, Cadena SER, a lawyer for the 'people's' member of parliament Juan Morales, who was examined, was arrested on departure from Morales' residence with important documents related to corruption.
According to investigative sources, the subject of Morales’ investigation is the alleged collection of commissions for his signing of a construction agreement with a Galician construction company, which requalified 200 hectares of land.
Eight people are currently being detained.
Bono accepted an offer to lead the Toledo candidate PSOE and, if they win, to chair Congress
Former Defense Minister José Bono accepted the offer of Prime Minister and Secretary-General of Socialists José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero to stand at the head of the PSOE (Spanish Labour Party) candidacy charter in Toledo and in the event that the Kongreis wins.
This was announced by the PSOE secretary for José Blanco and Bono himself at a press conference after a meeting with Zapater, which took place this afternoon at the party’s federal headquarters.
The chief executive of the proposal to the former minister argued that in political life "it is important to count on the best" and Bono "is among the best".
He further noted that "yes, it seems" that this politician from La Mancha will be the Socialist Party's candidate for President of Congress if the Socialists win the next election.
Bono would replace Manuel Mar<0xC3><0xAD>n, who on November 15 announced his decision not to run in the upcoming general election and to leave his active political career in order to engage in the fight against climate change in university education.
The former minister admitted that the prime minister was constantly insisting on him to return to the apex politics he left two years ago.
He also said that just as citizens know who will be the deputy minister of economy if the PSOE wins the election, his party wanted to announce in a “transparent form” who will chair the Congress.
If Bono gains this position, he hopes that he will turn the House into a "house of respect, not a bribe or a scream" and achieve that "he will be more and more like the citizens".
"Sometimes, unfortunately, the only place in Madrid where you can't speak in peace is Congress, the prime minister in the Senate has been interrupted 26 times on one occasion."
Similarly, he gave commendable words to the address of the current president, Manuel Mar<0xC3><0xAD>n, and "his good work", and so far did not want to present himself in his place, so as not to be reduced to what his opponents might consider to be "majesty".
Climate Propaganda
Given that the movement against climate change is subject to relentless persecution, both those who look sceptically at its predictions and those who prefer other political and social struggles must demonstrate firm coherence.
In addition, the leader of the movement, who is the head of government like Zapatero, believes that this fight is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even intends to sign a “new treaty with the planet.”
This proposal obliges him to explain why his government’s actions or inactions have contributed significantly to Spain’s leading in the European Union in non-compliance with the Kyoto Protocol.
Who is responsible for this failure, in which sectors this is happening and why his government, the government of the treaty, has not prevented it.
In addition, it forces him to explain to the Spaniards as clearly as possible what measures he intends to take to curb climate change.
Which companies will be harmed by this, which habits of the population will have to be changed, what energy savings, individual and collective, we will have to accept and what economic consequences it will have.
In other words, who is sacrificing and who is paying for saving the planet.
But we did not expect such explanations, nor do we expect them.
That’s because we have to sacrifice and pay.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are unpopular.
Expensive, inconvenient and threatening business and private accounts.
Even one cent from the price of gasoline, proposed by the PSOE (Spanish Socialist Workers’ Party), seemed to Zapater so risky in terms of the elections that he hastened to reject it.
In other words, it’s about saving the planet so that it doesn’t cost anything, pure propaganda, passwords that lack any real meaning.
Impressive phrases, commissions, committees, protocols and new posts.
And contracts with the planet; this master so useful for the election campaign, who does not even speak, does not accuse, does not demand anything, but adorns it with rallies and arouses tenderness.
If it's limited to being just a virtual contracting party and doesn't want us to ride a bike and cool off with a waiter.
Mayor and local police chief of Totana arrested on suspicion of corruption in construction practices
According to investigative sources, the Civil Guard arrested the mayor of the Murcian city of Totana, the “people’s” José Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the city hall and one businessman in the hospitality sector, on suspicion of committing criminal acts during construction.
The mayor was arrested in his residence and transferred to the town hall, where he is now located along with a number of police officers, who also arrived at the Commission for Construction and the City Enterprise for the Management of Industrial Lands and Apartments.
These three arrests added to the six that took place last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, during an operation linked to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land on land suitable for construction, so that the Galician company Nuaria, after the payment of 4 deposits in illegal proceeds.
In addition, two other people have not been arrested, but are charged in a shortened trial in the first instance of the city of Totana.
The first six suspects were handed over to the court today.
According to information sources, the former mayor of Totana and now a member of the Autonomous Parliament for the People's Party (PP), Juan Morales, is being investigated.
His ex-wife, the owner of a real estate agency, registered today in Totana, and his current girlfriend, who lives in Murcia, the capital of the autonomous region, were also charged.
Manuel N. A., director and owner of the Nuaria Group, a lawyer and businessman from Viga, was arrested in Niger (Pontévedra province), as well as Pablo José M. G., director of Suelo de Inmonuar, which belongs to the group and through which the fees were transferred.
The investigation is carried out by a group for criminal offences in the construction of the Central Operational Unit of the Civil Guard, whose members, in addition to the arrests, also carried out eleven inspections, mostly in companies related to the arrested, with headquarters in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Tovedra, Las Roz.
At the time, only one person was imprisoned in Totana, a very well-known owner of the company for poultry products, who could serve as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was commissioned to build the largest residential complex in the Murcia town of Totana, which would represent the construction of more than 5,000 houses, a golf course and two hotels with a "spa".
The company acquired 2.2 million square meters of land in Totana, which was requalified and its project was to double the settlement of the municipality, which has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group consists of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which are dedicated to the promotion of the real estate market, Conycase, which manages parking in the streets of Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a, Venezuela and on the square Fernando el Cat<0xC3><0xB3>lico in the city of Vigo, Hogartel, which is dedicated to direct marketing, becoming a proprietor for and Preconiza.

Our Finnish correspondent sends us this comment from yesterday’s edition of the most important Finnish newspapers Helsingin Sanomat (by the way, at the beginning of the PISA report on the level of education in the world), which refers to what the newspapers printed on November 18th, the same day.
"The content of the subject of philosophy has penetrated into public discussions in connection with the tragedy at the school in the city of Jokela.
The thief of the victims, a high school student, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
Pekka Elo, the education councilor in charge of the subject of philosophy, called on the website of the Helsingin Sanomat newspaper for professors to take a critical view of Plato and argued that it was not necessary to discuss Nietzsche's compulsory basic course of philosophy in high school.

One colleague informs about the introduction of the criminal offence of downloading from the internet into the criminal code:
A. Downloading a single song would be a criminal offence at a rate of six months to one year.
Conversely, if you cut a plate in a store at a price of less than 400 euros, this is considered a mere violation (<0xC2><0xA7> 623.1).
B. If you withdraw up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,000 in the store, theft is already a criminal offence, but the criminal rate is lower than for the withdrawal (<0xC2><0xA7> 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it after 40 hours, the penalty rate is still lower than for downloading (<0xC2><0xA7> 244.1)
D. It is less important to participate in fights than to change compacts.
Participation in the felony has a rate from three months to one year (<0xC2><0xA7> 154 of the Criminal Code) and for the exchange of compacts would be a rate from six months to two years
(Section 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment in employment is considered to be less serious under section 184.2 of the Criminal Code than downloading the film on DVD.
F. Unauthorized distribution of copyrighted films is punishable more than the provision of pornographic material to adolescents (<0xC2><0xA7> 186).
So if my colleague isn't mistaken, someone's hand's been hit, and that's all right.
Four.
My treating doctor puts me in one of his articles about weird research called "Money causes brain activation, especially if others get less."
Or the feelings that are caused by the monthly salary of employees depend on how much they earn from their colleagues.
The research was carried out at the University of Bonn using magnetic resonance imaging on a tomograph and the results are published in the latest issue of the journal Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and head of the Imaging Neurocognition group at the Life&Brain Institute in Germany: “The greatest activation occurred when the research participant reacted correctly and his colleague erroneously.”
Researchers observed that if both were successful, they received the same salary, the activation was mild, but when one got doubled, the activation was higher.
I really don't know if this conclusion required so much science.

What kind of insurance is suitable for me?
Car insurance that protects the driver in the event of an accident. represents a significant expense, which depends on various factors such as age, condition, sex, length of possession of the driver's license, type of vehicle to be insured or its use, etc.
Having a car is just the beginning.
Choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing a car model.
First of all, we need to clarify what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between the insurance company and the insurer.
This commitment takes the form of an insurance contract, which stipulates that the insurer will receive the agreed amount of insurance in a certain amount for taking responsibility for the payment of damages in the event of an insurance event.
Insurance is the price of insurance, which is determined taking into account various factors such as age, condition, sex, length of possession of a driver's license, the type of vehicle that is insured or its use, etc.
Insurance companies determine their prices based on statistics, so the more likely it is that an accident will occur, the higher the insurance rate.
For this reason, both people over the age of 25 and women have to pay lower insurance rates, as statistics show that they have a lower risk index due to their precautionary nature.
In the same way, on the basis of checks, insurance companies have concluded that people living in marriage have fewer accidents than free drivers.
The way in which the vehicle is used will affect the frequency of driving, and thus the likelihood that it will have an accident.
As the frequency of driving increases, the probability increases.
There are many variables that insurers consider when determining the price of insurance.
Therefore, the driver must study the situation well in order to choose the insurance that best corresponds to his insurer profile.
Here we will show you the most important variables for the choice of this or that type of insurance, which, in addition to meeting the type of insurer, will also be at a reasonable price.
People under the age of twenty-five face a variety of disadvantages such as little driving experience and short driving licenses when they want to negotiate insurance at an affordable price.
While insurance against all risks is ideal for good coverage, there are also cheaper options.
The most cautious drivers can choose insurance against all risks with an insurance discount in order to obtain insurance coverage for all risks, but at a more acceptable price.
This type of contract would entail the client’s participation in the payment of the insurance event.
“The part of the reimbursement of the insurance event provided by the client will be pre-determined in determining the price of the insurance, which will be higher, the lower the participation would be,” explains Luis Noguera, Head of First Europe in Spain, an internet intermediary.
Another option is insurance extended to other participants of the operation so that the client is insured against damage caused to other people, but not against damage to his own car.
In addition, he would be insured against theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Recommendations.
If you are under the age of twenty-five, try to be careful and avoid accidents as much as possible, as it will affect your bonus and allow you to reduce insurance in the future.
The bonus is the reduction of the basic rate that an insurance company has.
On the other hand, small is the increase of the mentioned basic rate.
"Bonus and minor will depend on the insurance company and its profits.
If the insurance company has had a good year, it will be able to afford to increase the bonus," explains Noguera.
After crossing the twenty-five-year limit, it makes it easier for drivers to negotiate insurance, as the customer’s risk index decreases, thanks to the experience gained.
For this reason, it is most recommended to arrange insurance against all risks with a discount.
"Young people usually can't take advantage of the pre-experienced experience at the time of an accident, or even when driving," says the director of a European company in Spain, adding that most of the accidents occur in the second year of the accident.
However, if the client is married but has no children yet, it is better to arrange insurance against all risks, if, of course, his economic situation allows.
Families with children are considered to be the clientele with the lowest risk index and therefore their surcharges will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be insurance against all risks with a discount of insurance (which could be 300 euros) or with a high bonus, insurance extended to other operators, starting in the third year after the purchase of the vehicle.
“Their handling is calmer and their purchasing power is higher, so they can afford to get the highest discount,” said Luis Noguera.
Retirement insurance is recommended against all risks with a discount of insurance (which amounts to 150 euros) or insurance extended to other participants of the operation, if a high bonus has been achieved.
It must be said that car insurance is something important not only because it protects the driver in the event of an accident, but also because it represents a significant expense, which is a good reason to properly study the insurance options that would best suit us given our personal situation.
Celtic tries to score on AC Milan point, which means the eight-finals
AC Milan and Celtic will measure their strengths this Tuesday at San Siro in an effort to score a point that they lack to reach their respective goals in the Champions League final, as for Italy it would be the first and for the Scots it would decide to place.
The Italians have ten points and have already secured the proceeds in the fifth draw in Portugal, while Celtic has nine points, but he needs another one to be sure that he will not get a six-pointer ahead of him, who will play with Benfica, who has four.
These two Group D matches will be played a week before the sixth round ends, as AC Milan must play in the Intercontinental Cup in Japan, where it will first enter the thirteenth in the semi-final, in an attempt to advance to the final, which is played the sixteenth.
So this group will be closed sooner than the others and the undecided result at the Giuseppe Meazzy stadium seems to be the most likely, even though both teams will try to fight for victory, because the Italians will not want to tactic on the spots in the home ground and Celtic would be the first to know after the win.
Gordon Strachan's team could even lose if Schachtor does not win, but he can't count on it, because with the same number of nine points, the Ukrainians who lost in Glasgow (2:1) last week, but won in the first round (2:0 straight).
And so AC Milan players will try to spoil the evening for the Scots, who believe they will get to the semi-finals of the reorganized Champions League for the second time just as they defeated them in the same game in the previous game by the Kak<0xC3><0xA1> Goal in extension (1:0) after 0:0 in the base game.
Hopefully, the Rossoners will win will be the Chess Player, for whom he has the prize to win, only if Celtic has lost, both to advance to the finals and to remain in UEFA.
Although Benfica is the last and has no chance to continue in the highest European competition, it could reach third place in a single victory, so it would play in UEFA.

The Spice Girls started their first tour in Vancouver, Canada, 20,000 spectators ahead of their first time since they broke up in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sporty Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Ginger Spice" (Geri Halliwell) shortly before their group began their concert at the GM Place Vancouve Stadium.
About 20,000 people bought tickets to attend a concert, which also included a video depicting the group’s history, which sparked a sensation in the late 1990s.
The return and world tours take place at the same time as the release of a new album released by EMI in Spain, which brings a selection of their main hit tracks, as well as two new songs, "Headlines" and "Voodoo".
Five Spice Girls appeared on stage decorated with bracelets given to them by their husband "Posh Spice", British footballer David Beckham.
This athlete was in an audience that flooded GM Place, although the nervous Victoria banned him a few days ago.
Before the show, Victoria Beckham said of the British star that “he hadn’t seen our costumes at all, so I’m nervous about what he thinks about the show.”
"Sporty Spice", whose departure from the group in 1998 "because of the contradictions between us" caused the dissolution of the five-member group two years later, also revealed her nervousness when she met with reporters two hours before the show began.
"I was scared.
I was nervous, but I saw the world's public opinion changed, the opinion of the Spice Girls changed.
And I thought, why not, so I'm glad I made my decision," Chisholm said of the reunion of the group, which she disbanded nine years ago.
The singer also noted that over time "things have settled and we all like each other very much".
However, a lot has changed since the Spice Girls last performed together in 1998.
So in the beginning, according to CTV, the group flew to Vancouver with a special Virgin Airlines.
When they arrived at the airport, the army was waiting for them.
Five of them have a total of seven children.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will perform in California (USA), San José (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
It will take place in Madrid on December 23.
Concerns over new gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
Russia and Ukraine are currently in a dispute over the prices of natural gas, thus increasing the risk that Russian supplies of this fuel to Western Europe may be affected.
Most of the Russian fuel exported to the European Union (EU) is piped through Ukraine and any dispute between the two countries is closely monitored.
Kyiv warned that if Moscow raises gas prices to Ukraine, Russia will be charged higher transit fees.
The previous dispute between the two countries last year reduced deliveries to EU countries.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian state-owned gas monopoly, Gazprom, are trying to agree on how much Ukraine will have to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom says it will have to charge more to Ukraine, as it has agreed to pay up to 50% more for the gas it receives from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say this could mean that Ukraine will have to pay 40% more for its supplies from Gazprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states during the negotiations," Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinach told Reuters.
"The changes in gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the amount of transit fees (to Western Europe) through Ukraine," he said.
The last major dispute between Moscow and Kiev led to a reduction in supplies from Gazprom to Ukraine in January 2006.
This caused a sharp drop in exports to Western Europe, which sharply raised prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of all deliveries to the European Union.
Russia has the largest supply of gas in the world, but a large part of it remains underutilized.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own gas supplies from Turkmenistan and other former Central Asian Soviet republics.
The NHS “must control foreign employees”
The inspector said the Scottish chambers of the NHS must improve checks on criminal records of non-European employees.
The recommendation from the president of the supreme supervisory authority, Robert Black, came after a foreign doctor in Scotland was linked to the June attacks on Glasgow Airport.
Mr. Black also fears that the Scottish NHS has no exact idea of the amount of foreign staff it employs.
But his report emphasized that the other key checks were carried out in order on a sample of five health authorities.
The President of the Supreme Audit Office immediately after the June attacks on Glasgow Airport was interested in personnel from countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA).
Bilal Abdullah, an eighty-year-old Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after someone hired a Jeep to the door of the main terminal building.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in the Central Criminal Court using a video bridge accused of linking to bombing attempts in the UK.
The NHS Chambers are expected to inspect foreign personnel in terms of qualifications, experience and authorization for work in the UK prior to their employment.
Although the Scottish Health Commission uses Disclosure Scotland for criminal records checks, the agency has no authority to obtain such information outside the UK.
The president’s report says, among other recommendations, that the commission should be led by the Criminal Records Bureau, which assists employers with checks in several countries.
“Although we found that some of the staff records contained evidence of these checks, they are not carried out on a regular basis,” the report said.
Mr Black said the Scottish NHS is in many ways in line with its own pre-employment screening policy, but also added: "Our report highlights areas where the system could be improved to ensure accurate information about the amount of foreign personnel available."
BMA Scotland President Dr Peter Terry said it was “very unlikely” that pre-employment checks would identify potential NHS employees who could commit a terrorist act in the future.
"The report suggests that the current pre-employment controls at the Scottish NHS are working well and it is not clear what additional value those comments will bring," he said.
The Scottish health authorities have announced that they currently have 1,161 foreign workers, the vast majority of whom are doctors and nurses.
However, the president of the supreme control authority pointed out that these numbers will probably be higher also because the commissions had a problem identifying staff with a residence permit.
The survey also found that the NHS controls in the areas of Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian are largely carried out.
They included passport checks, work permits and qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently revising the policies and directives on pre-employment controls for NHS foreign workers.
Health Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: “I wanted to do this work immediately after the terrorist attack on Glasgow Airport.”
She also added that the Scottish government, in agreement with the health committees, is considering the recommendations of this report and will ensure that best practices are reflected in the updated pre-employment checks on all staff - including those abroad - that it plans to release next month.
Joy Division wins film awards
Control, a biographical film about late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis, has won five awards at the British Independent Film Awards, including the Best Picture Award.
The prizes were also won by Sam Riley, who worked in the warehouse until Curtis, director Anton Corbijn and co-star Toby Kebell.
Lady Judi Dench was named the best actress for the thriller Notes on the Scandal.
And band star Daniel Craig won the Variety Award for getting the British film on the world stage.
The awards were ceremonially presented at the London Roundhouse.
Control describes Curtis' journey to fame with the Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
This black-and-white film – whose soundtrack includes The Killers, David Bowie and New Order – cost just <0xC2><0xA3>3 million.
But the Dutch photographer Corbijn, previously known for the iconic U2 Joshua Tree album packaging, won two awards – for best director and best debut director.
Rock music was the focus of another award-winning film, Julien Temple, about singer Clash Joe Strummer.
Viggo Mortensen won the Best Actor Award for his role as the driver of the Russian Mafia boss in the London thriller David Cronenberg's East Oath.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation built on the roles of tough guys, won the Richard Harris Award for an extraordinary contribution to the British film.
This fiftieth-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming another part of Indiana Jones - The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Winstone said he is proud of this award, which is named after film star Camelot and Harry Potter Harris, who died in 2002.
"People like Richard Harris and Albert Finney have opened doors for people like me," he added.
"I was lucky enough to have met Richard Harris several times.
He's my man, a great actor of his time, I'm very honored."
Independent film awards, known as Biffy, are awarded by a jury, in which filmmakers, actors and festival organizers meet.
Supporters and patrons of Bif include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia Arrests 208 People for Terrorist Conspiracy
Saudi Arabia announced yesterday that it had arrested 208 militants for membership in the cells preparing an immediate attack on the oil facilities as well as on spiritual and security components.
State TV, the largest oil exporter, said one of the cells wanted to infiltrate the country with rockets.
Al-Qaida sympathizers have been campaigning against the monarchy, the allies of the United States, since 2003, i.e. since the invasion of Iraq.
A television report reported that a cell of eight militants, led by a foreigner, had planned an attack on an oil facility in Ash-Sharqiyah province.
Saudi Arabia is building a rapid response force of 35,000 members to defend the equipment from the unsuccessful al-Qaida attack on the world’s largest oil processing plant in Abqaiqu in 2006.
The report quoted the ministry’s internal statement as saying that 18 of the detainees belonged to a cell led by a “missile expert” who slipped into the country.
She also said the militants planned to smuggle eight bullets into the kingdom.
22 detainees were to prepare for the murders of clergy and security personnel.
The government urged clergymen to make more efforts to prevent the Saudis from leaving for Iraq in order to join al-Qaeda militants fighting the Allied forces and the US-backed Shiite government, which the conservative Sunni Saudis consider to be coffee.
Al-Qaeda militants believe the authorities have bribed many of Saudi Arabia’s clergy to support the royal family that controls the government.
Militants - backed by calls by al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden to target the pro-Western Saudi government - targeted foreign residential complexes, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This war has been a huge effort by the security forces in the past ... five months," the interior ministry's spokesman told state television.
A 16-member “media cell” in Medina was also arrested to promote “Takfirian thinking” – an ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals that promotes violence against Muslims labeled as non-believers and apostates.
Among the detainees were 32 people accused of providing financial support to the militants.
The climate on Venus may be a prospect for the future of the Earth
Scientists announced yesterday that Venus may have once been a pleasant place to live.
Data from a European orbiting station show that the planet is even more similar to the Earth's twin head than previously thought.
Venus is Earth's closest planetary neighbor.
These two worlds are about the same size and orbit along similar paths, but Venus is a little closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, conditions on Venus were similar to those on Earth and could have been habitable.
But the depleted greenhouse effect caused by carbon dioxide, the atmospheric erosion of solar radiation and the lower speed of rotation sent Venus on a completely different path of development.
Today, the planet is waterless, the surface temperature is hot enough to melt lead, and it is devastated by storms and hurricane-force winds.
The findings from the European Space Agency’s Venus Express probe, which studied the planet for a year, offer a poor view of how Earth could evolve in the event of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor from the Department of Physics at the University of Oxford and one of the lead missions of Venus Express said: “It is becoming clearer why the climate on Venus is so different from that on Earth, even though the planets themselves are quite similar.
"Our new data allows us to compose a scenario in which Venus began as well as Earth, perhaps even with the habitable environment, billions of years ago."
Police Arrested ‘Enriched Uranium’
A kilo of radioactive material, allegedly enriched with uranium, was detained yesterday by Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said three people had been arrested and the material was being investigated.
He did not confirm that it was enriched uranium, but said the substance could be sold for $1 million (<0xC2><0xA3>480,000).
Continuously
Mitt Romney said that for presidential candidates it is not worthy to answer questions from the snowman.
Despite this, Republican presidential candidates later agreed to a debate on YouTube, in which ordinary voters recorded their queries on the video and handed them over for broadcasts to the candidates.
None of the questions aired on Wednesday, Nov. 28, was as comical as the snowman who asked Democrats about global warming in the other party’s debate on YouTube.
But the questions and even the answers this time reflected many about the state of the Republican Party heading for elections next year.
It is not clear how exactly the producers of CNN, one of the sponsors of the debate, selected the clips, which were then shown to the aspiring candidates.
But the first half-hour of the debate, the longest time devoted to a single topic, was focused on immigration.
This topic is one of the most powerful Republican themes.
CNN asked a panel of undecided voters to turn the wheel when they heard something pleasing: the voter recorded the peaks of consent when the candidates spoke of a hard-line approach at the borders.
The toughest and longest exchange of views took place between Rudy Giuliani, the main nationwide candidate, and Mr. Romney, who advanced in the key early elections in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to shake the reputation of a man who was as a New York Mayor soft on illegal immigrants.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of the state of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants to work at his home.
The two fought particularly hard when the questioners asked if any of the candidates would support "amnesty" (giving illegal immigrants a normal status and citizenship option).
Other candidates, such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, were able to get their bit into the mill on the subject.
None of the two have a chance to nominate, but both remain in the game perhaps because they started to hit the alarm due to immigration earlier and stronger than the others.
At least on immigration, the candidates have roughly the same opinion: more stringent border controls, no tolerance for illegal migrants.
This theme, along with concerns about toxic toys from China and other concerns with the surrounding world, helps Republicans forget or minimize the discrepancy between libertarians and Christian conservatives.
But the debate started to get very uncomfortable when it came to other topics.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why in the past he supported the possession of firearms.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether the simulated heating technique should be considered torture.
One questioner asked if the candidates believed every word in the Bible.
Mr. Giuliani made it clear that although the Bible is his favorite book, he probably just doesn’t believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another rapist asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee – who is now at the forefront of all assumptions in the recent survey in Iowa thanks to his long-term Christian conservatism – said the death penalty is unpleasant but necessary.
Under pressure to decide whether or not Jesus would agree, he said that Jesus was too smart to run for office, so he deserved a laugh.
The battle remains unpretentiously open.
Mr Huckabee’s rise in Iowa is covered by recent successes in earning money and Ron Paul’s loud cheer at Wednesday’s debate.
The two have withdrawn from the bottom because both sides are still unable to agree on more well-known and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, one of the candidates unified the party very soon and convincingly with the winning news of the American size on the lips, flashing on both sides.
This time the side is fragmented and the result is far from unambiguous.
The Workers' Pain
Gordon Brown once again found a trap into which he could fall; his way out remains the same.
Although it is a custom in British political scandals, this is not particularly spicy.
It doesn’t seem that any orders would have been sold, no bills in the Paris hotel were mysteriously paid, no extramarital fingers were sucked.
But the barricaded Gordon Brown would walk around without it being discovered that some wealthy businessman for four years masked the ruling Labour Party’s <0xC2><0xA3>650,000 ($1.3 million) contributions on behalf of other people, and that the party did not report it.
Two months ago, when the prime minister avoided an election call and offended British intelligence by claiming that the decision was unaffected by the investigation, there was hope that it would secure a resilient and effective government.
Instead of the ever more humorous wording of the Liberal Democrats, the once-afraid Mr. Brown changed from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The ruthless rescue of the problem bank Northern Rock showed weaknesses in the procedure and a bad judgment under fire.
Poorly thought-out proposals to change the tax code have put the companies together against the government.
The loss of personal data in 25 million people revealed an unimaginable administrative alarm.
The three retired generals began a revolt in the House of Lords; they protested against the cuts in military spending, as they argued that being a commander of the armed forces is part-time work.
Now there are numerous gifts from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Secretary General of the Labour (and their former guardian of the internal discipline), has already resigned.
None of this means that Mr. Brown would be irreversibly heading towards his end.
Despite this, governments can reach a point of transition, which they find to be difficult to govern.
People don’t trust politicians, and they don’t like them, but they will usually take away their distrust when a new party takes over.
When it seems clear that some prime minister is probably not going to improve anything, and he doesn’t even have to be in office for a long time, this is a move away: the state administration becomes a hole, the ministers start doing briefings, the press is looking for bad news, and the government doesn’t become defunct.
In one direction, Mr. Brown's position is particularly complex, because, unlike other political leaders, he cannot take the position of a new broomstick.
No matter how much he wanted to distance himself from Tony Blair, he was his first officer.
For example, problems with Northern Rock and financial records are associated with decisions made by Mr. Brown as Minister of Finance.
And even though he wasn’t directly involved in Blair’s scandals, such as a long investigation into political party funding caused by “values for money,” voters can safely judge that he did.
Yet Mr. Brown's inconveniences are not as bad as they look.
These braces aren't as horrible as conservatives do them.
As far as Mr. Bean is concerned, no one has died or been misled.
And the treatment, however painful it may be, is to provide what Mr. Brown’s Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable, firm and slightly brutal government.
The recent upheaval around political donations is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, who compares his gifts with charity, says he did not want any publicity for his charity.
That may be true, but the decision was not on him.
The laws against the anonymity of large political donors are clear and exist for a simple reason: the public has the right to know who could buy access to those who rule the country.
Mr. Watt, who said he knew about Mr. Abraham’s course of action, but did not know that it was illegal, will certainly be questioned in depth; so will Jon Mendlesohn, the chief laborer of money who learned about the bribes in October.
But so far Mr. Brown is not in any way complicated; there is nothing to suggest that he knew about these furs, even though the bulk of the payments took place only after his onset in June.
The Prime Minister has done half of the work.
He very quickly condemned this violation of the laws by his own party, but he diluted his resolve by reaching for a proven instrument, the commission to investigate this matter - also led by a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the lessons are not complicated.
If the law has been violated, it is a police matter.
In addition, there are other things Mr. Brown has to do, such as finding an independent permanent chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has not had one for six months, and moving forward with a real reform of the funding of political parties.
This would require the workers who are in a tight position to cooperate with the Conservatives and perhaps even give up their special financial relationship with the trade unions – bitter pills for a devoted party like Mr. Brown.
But he should face a few simple facts.
Conservatives now have a decent leap forward in polls; he has two years to get back the voters; and the only way to clear the victory is unobtrusive integrity and high competence.
Carnet Sharks
Does the subprime mortgage crisis affect the American credit card market?
When there is blood in the water, naturally, the spinal cords begin to flush excitedly around.
Now that the U.S. real estate market is booming, predators have focused on the credit card market there.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs say credit card losses could reach $99 billion if subordinated mortgages infect other variants of consumer loans.
The signs of tension are clear.
Increasing number of insolvency cases (with more than 30-day payment delays) and debited accounts (accounts that the provider deems unenforceable).
HSBC Bank announced last month that it had lost $1.4 billion in the U.S. consumer credit market - also due to insolvent credit card loans.
However, it is too early to panic.
Deprecated accounts and inability to pay are still few.
According to Moody’s, the third-quarter insolvency rate was 3.89% below average by almost a whole percentage point.
The deteriorating rates can be explained in part by technical reasons.
The change in the U.S. Personal Bankruptcy Act of 2005 led to a sharp decline in the number of reported bankruptcies, which make up a large part of the losses on credit cards; therefore, the number of reports (and thus the number of debits) would increase regardless of whether the general conditions for defaults were met.
The sector also shows a good maturity rate, which shows how many consumers pay monthly off their debts.
And confidence in the securities of secured credit cards is solid, despite the paralysis in other corners of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup predicts that their emissions in 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
There are definitely direct ways to spread the infection between the subprime mortgage crisis and the credit card market: when property loans dry up in real estate, consumers are more likely to be indebted through credit cards.
Credit card issuers, however, are more likely to look at cash flow than at the values of the deposits, so falling home prices may not necessarily mean a change in the creditworthiness of lenders.
They may even be beneficial to lenders.
Consumers’ motivation to repay mortgages decreases when the value of their assets falls below the value of the loan; as a result, the debt on the cards moves up on the list of priorities to repay.
Card issuers will also be able to respond more quickly and flexibly to more stormy conditions than mortgage providers by changing interest rates or debt limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risks of a rapid change in the price of pledged items.
“It’s not going to happen that one beautiful morning we’ll just reevaluate all the loans,” said Gary Perlin, chief financial officer at Capital One.
Although the risk of a sub-mortgage-style explosion is low, the risk of gradual weakening is far more real.
If lower home prices and debt reductions push America into a recession, the credit card industry will face a darker future.
Watch out for those spinal cords.
British bankers plead guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers, who were to be tried for their role in a fraud involving former chief financial officer Enron Andrew Fastow, changed their resignation on Wednesday and pleaded guilty.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were originally guilty of seven counts of fraud when, together with Fastow, they were to participate in financial fraud in 2000 -- to get rich at the expense of their employers -- they denied.
They were scheduled to appear in court in January.
However, during a court hearing before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., everyone confessed to one fraud.
The case of these three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, was on the front page for the entire two years of the issuing process.
In the United States, their case is one of the unclosed parts of an investigation initiated after the Enron crash in 2001.
The charges against them in 2002 alerted Mr Fastow that he was the target of a government investigation into the Enron crash.
The indictment against the bankers -- who earned the nickname "NatWest Troika" -- claims that they came to Houston in 2000 to plot a fraud along with Fastow and his former main affiliate, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich NatWest invested in Enron’s partner branch controlled by Fastow, which was the architect of many Enron scams that pushed Enron down the spiral towards bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank rated its stake in this branch at zero, but our three Britons knew it was actually of considerable value.
The company under Kopper's control bought the bank's stake in this branch for $1 million.
Incriminated bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for his stake in the company.
According to the indictment, Fastow falsely informed Enron that the energy company would pay $20 million for its stake in the Greenwich branch of NatWest.
Of course, those 20 million actually went to those British bankers, Fastow and others.
Bankers were charged with $7.3 million and Fastow, Kopper and others improved by about $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy for his role in the collapse of Enron.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently serving a six-year sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is serving a three-year and one-month sentence at a facility in Texarkana.
All three Britons were on the move for a $1 million bail, which ordered them to stay in the United States for the upcoming trial.
Enron, once the country’s seventh-largest company, went bankrupt in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks when it was no longer possible to hide billions of debts or report failing speculation as profits.
The collapse has eroded thousands of jobs, more than $60 billion in market value and more than $2 billion in pension insurance.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former chief executive Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their roles in the downfall of the company.
Skilling is serving a sentence of more than forty years.
Lay's convictions for conspiracy, fraud, and other charges were erased after he died of heart disease last year.
Moscow's non-impotence
The price of the Gulfstream G550, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and with a sufficient volume of fuel for nonstop flights from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
For some of the Russians, however, it is small to return.
“It can carry up to 18 passengers,” says Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"But none of them are interested in so many places because it's for a close family or a corporate president."
Mr. Firer sat at the Gulfstream booth last Friday at the Millionaire Show, a four-day orgy of showcasing consumption at the mammoth exhibition center on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury suppliers have built their booths, hoping that the freshly-rich Russians will attract everything from mahogany-drawn yachts to diamond-decorated shutters to cars for which they would not be ashamed even 50 Cent.
Mr. Firer looked carefully at the bright orange Porsche in the side stand.
"It's a nice car, but it's fives and tens against us," he said.
“After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private jets.”
On the waves of oil, the Russian capital is piling up money just as it was when Dallas had its days.
“We went through the same stage in the 1980s when some Americans were enormously wealthy and dragged to Europe, where they looked at them as materialists,” said Marshall Goldman, a fourth-year student at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard.
Just like the Saudis of the 1970s and the Japanese of the 1990s, the Russians are becoming the most prominent spenders in the world.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their part on this Klondik.
At another venue in Moscow this week, the luxury industry conference attracted Donatello Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, chairman of the LVMH Group, to exchange ideas on how to sell expensive goods in markets such as the Russian one.
(The conference is hosted by The International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times Company.)
According to the list of richest people, Russia has Forbes magazine 53 billionaires with a total wealth of 282 billion dollars.
In addition, the Center for Economic and Financial Research’s local main institute has issued a report on the development of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, according to which there are 103,000 “different” millionaires in Russia, with a total wealth of $670 billion.
(The World Bank states that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians lived below the existential minimum.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow -- and that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative for London jewellery David Morris.
It was at the fair for the first time, together with the Russian distributor of the brand, Soho Jewelry Group.
"All women are perfectly well-adjusted, and men are each for all their wealth."
When they walked in the evening dresses on Sunday evening halls, twenty-one-year-old Evgenia Yumatov<0xC3><0xA1> and five-year-old Svetlana Turovtsov<0xC3><0xA1> identified themselves and their clients as millionaires.
"I've been looking at those cars and I can't decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Miss Yumatov, who slid into a branded outfit as a veteran of the red carpet, next to which Joan Rivers looks like a home runner.
The trade fair seemed to be aimed mainly at the freshly rich, branded Russian buyers who are willing to sit for several hours in the road traffic, so that they can walk through the warehouse, which yells at the m<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0x99>ko<0xC3><0xBA> m<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xA1>ko.
Members of the public could buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in which brand is the most expensive and the best," said Mr. Gijrath, who patriotically occupied the stand of Dutch porcelain maker Royal Delft before reproducing Rembrandt's hand-painted blue duck in superlative size.
"Of course, the Russians are more interested in gold."
And in fact, local sellers say that the Russians with old money (according to Russian standards it is 10 to 15 years old) have moved from flashy logos to little-known limited edition brands that would never appear at the trade fair.
Even a few thousand people, whether millionaires, millionaires’ ambassadors or mere tourists, flooded the fair halls every day.
And some of them bought it.
The first day of the exhibition, last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the local general manager of King Koil beds, said that he sold two sets of mattresses made of silk, cashmere and cotton, intertwined with gold threads, for $70,000.
Also on the first day, Mikhail Lyubimov, sales manager of A1 Moto, which equips high-end cars with high-end alarms, said his company sold a bright orange Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrej Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, which customizes luxury cars, said he sold three grids for cars in the style of connected chain bracelets for Rolls-Royce Phantomy for $55,000.
He showed the reporter the wheel of a car designed for the Russian casino owner, which had a splinter coated with Swarovski crystals so that it looked like roulette.
Price: $22,000 for four of those.
"The Russian millionaire who wants a sledge-skin wheel or a portrait of his cubic zirconia woman may not be riding on those wheels yet," Mr Karapetian said.
"He'll put them in his garage for thirty to forty cars."
Although many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Mr Karapetian said that the phrase “Russian millionaire” currently means nothing very exclusive, given the large rise in the prices of local properties.
“If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you’re probably already a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash,” he said.
"There are more than you think."
Those who are not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich at a booth run by the Russian company Alliance Continental, which deals with asset management.
The company has raised four red British-style telephone boxes, stamped with a million-dollar column of counterfeit banknotes.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing manager, said his team had printed 500,000 fake banknotes for the Millionaires’ Fair.
The passers-by stopped to throw a pile of money around, or to let friends take pictures of themselves on their mobile phone, resting in the middle of a spare fortune, or just toss out a few million dollars in their pockets.
"You know, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire," Mr. Karryev said.
Death in New Jersey May Be Caused by Corrupted Surgery
It was the day before Thanksgiving, when Roland Livingston looked out of the big windows of the local restaurant A little healthier and watched an ambulance arrive at a white New England house two houses down West Scott Avenue.
Soon, a police car was connected to the police station.
And then another one.
"Then I saw the delivery of the forensic doctor," said Mr Livingston, the restaurant controller.
"At that moment, I knew someone was dead."
Authorities learned that the dead woman was Olga Arroya, 41, the executive assistant to the director of the New Warsaw Police Department.
Investigators are now trying to determine if she died from a procedure performed by an unlicensed plastic surgeon, whose identity police refused to provide, who was working at house number 212 on West Scott Avenue.
Authorities have not yet figured out what caused Ms. Arroy's death, and hope that toxicological tests, the results of which may not have been known for weeks, will help solve the mysterious death that sent a wave of sadness under the direction of the New Warsaw police.
Ms. Arroy has been an assistant to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice has been known to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hard-working and hard-working," Mr. McCarthy said of Miss Arroy in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my shield.
It would protect me."
Mr. McCarthy said that Ms. Arroya was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former New York police officer who works for the Alcohol Control Commission, and that she is leaving behind two sons aged 14 and 11 and an unmarried daughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokeswoman for the Union District Attorney, Theodora J. Romankov, said the detectives were trying to find out if Miss Arroyo died as a result of an unlicensed surgery.
"It's one of the options," said Ms. Walsh.
"The investigation is still underway."
Authorities said they arrived at the house at about three o’clock in the afternoon.
In November, they found Miss Arroyo on the couch.
She was pronounced dead on the spot.
More than a week later, authorities still said little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, allegedly Flor Margarita Castro.
Ms. Walsh didn't say if the authorities heard Ms. Castro.
Investigators are trying to determine if part of the house was used as an office.
In the middle of Miss Castro's house, with a ruined rose bush in the foreground and a dalmatian blinking behind, no one answered
Next to the door that led to the cellar, a blue barrel with the inscription "Ethyl Vanillin" throbbed in the open garage - a substance used as a substitute for vanilla in food and cosmetics.
Two mountain bikes hung on the hooks on one side.
Mr. McCarthy recalled that when he first came to New York City in 25 years, Miss Arroyo gave him invaluable help in tackling the intolerable and harsh political culture of his new city.
"She said, 'You should be careful about this or that,'" he said.
"She was always there when I came, and she was always there when I left.
It was embarrassing."
The hope that the Fed will lower interest rates leads to a strengthening of the world's stock exchanges
Stock prices on both sides of the Atlantic surged yesterday after market hopes that the Federal Bank will try to calm borrowing conditions by further lowering interest rates were amplified by the reassuring remarks of the vice president of the U.S. central bank.
The storms surged in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, the second in line to Ben Bernanke, the Fed chairman, said that in response to continued pressure on financial markets, regulators must be “flexible and pragmatic.”
As part of a clear effort to soothe the irritated markets amid signs of revitalising credit effort, Mr Kohn said recent stimuli "partially reversed some improvements in the functioning of markets by the end of September and October".
He also said that if the increased instability persists, the chances of worsening the financial conditions of households and businesses will increase.
Investors consider these statements to be a signal that the Fed is ready to deliver additional fresh installments of capital to U.S. markets, and possibly further interest rate cuts, to stabilize credit conditions.
These remarks also helped calm Wall Street amid other bad news about the U.S. economy, when home sales in October showed record lows.
The consequences of the financial credence were underlined by the announcement by investment bank Bear Stearns that it will abolish 650 jobs, which is 4% of its global workforce, as part of the cost reduction due to the compensatory heavy losses caused by unincorporated housing and subsistence wagers.
Only 20 of these jobs are expected to be cancelled in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York City, the Dow Jones Industrial Index grew by 331 points, or 2.55 percent, to 13,289.40, while the more widely used S&P 500 index increased by 2.65 percent.
The London FTSE 100 index increased by 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent, and closed to 6,306.2, with the value of British blue chips rising by more than <0xC2><0xA3>39 billion.
The German Dax index increased by 2.6 percent and the French CAC40 increased by 2.3 percent.
Some time ago, credit tensions in the markets showed full strength after the European Central Bank’s three-month money-back auctions lent these funds to European commercial banks at a rate of 4.7%, the highest since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow the Fed and the ECB and release over-standard money on London’s money markets has increased as the rates of the three-month British interbank loans “Libor” rose after a 6 per cent rise from its record high on November 12.
England must decide: Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
We have two dilemmas, one almost as heavy as the other.
Who's going to be number six for England this weekend in Kandy, Owais Shah, or Ravi Bopara?
And, in a broader context, no less relevant than the first Test against Sri Lanka, who is to make this decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the chairman of the selection committee, who holds this position at the best in borrowed time, has Peter Moores, the head coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain's mana, with the decision not to help, and because the table is held by Hugh H. Morris.
He who will not be built in the sixth place on his thumb will be unhappy, but life is often not fair and sport is no longer at all.
It is not easy to find what will get one to the top of his profession, while someone else will never get over a lower level, sometimes because of a lack of luck rather than ability.
Not only in cricket, selection is challenging and requires judgment, which in the end must always be subjective.
Is it the right time for Bopara to move up?
Is it fair to Shah, if so?
The same could be asked in another area, let's say here: John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both smart young executives with good education and insight in the field, should be promoted to the commission - instead of just one.
Who is to say which level is right for a cricketer when he is not given a chance to fall or swim to the next level?
Of course, numbers have a great influence on decision-making, but they also have opportunities.
In the team, the cricketer must capture the captain’s gaze at the right moment if he is to take the wicket, and the batsman needs a regular chance at starting positions if he is ever to impress as a one-day cricketer.
Capturing the view of the selector is more complicated.
For example, last season there were a lot better than James Anderson, whose place in the first Test seems to be certain, even if Stephen Harmison declared himself healthy and slammed himself as an artilleryman.
Anderson took 32 wickets in the first class with 33 overs each.
Chris Tremlett took just 29 at an equally modest average, but both had their moments at the highest level and hope for the next one.
Whether he will play in the Asgiriya Shah stadium or Bopara can only be a matter of opinion.
The choice can either start or end the career of both, or it may not have a big impact.
Four years ago on Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every Test and in the first-class gave good performances, five wickets and 40 free passes, but it was Paul Collingwood who at the same time fought for his place in the Austr<0xC3><0xA1>cea, who eventually scored a hundred points for the Austr<0xC3><0xA1>cea.
It is more likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after another discussion following today’s training purely at Asirgya Stadium, will follow their conservative instincts and give preference to Shah’s greater experience over Bopar’s youthful generosity.
There are arguments for both.
His brilliant and valuable debut Test changes at 88 points in Bombay and 32 hundred in the first class speak for Shah, who is twenty-seven years younger and has excellent statistics against spin overcoats.
However, Shah made in two shifts in May against the Caribbean in the Test at Lord's, his home field in Middlesex, only ten passes, and this, along with the immediate rejection of the so-called electorate, when Vaughan was forced to retake Boco from his seat.
On the other hand, the Essex universal has joy of living in its bones.
On the cricket field, nothing stands out for him and his behavior outside the field symbolizes a recently overturned car with a four-wheel drive on the day of the exhibition of the car sponsor of the English team, Volkswagen.
He ran away with minor injuries and probably shock, but the first thing he pulled out of his Vodafone (of course also sponsored) and called Alastair Cook, his co-player, who was watching it lately, to ask him excitedly, "Did you see that?"
Bopara is definitely better in the field, his medium-fast sliding overcoats on the local pitches, which he seems to fit, effectively distributes and fires confidently and handily.
Choosing the right person is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Perhaps this is the real art of choice.
I personally clone to have Bopara get his chance now, which of course I don’t want to say that Shah won’t excel unless, as the Ceylon tea tickets suggest, he’ll be the one to play next weekend.
Buses Bring Refugees Back to Work - and Fighting Al-Qaeda
The first buses full of Iraqi refugees from Syria began arriving in Baghdad yesterday and smuggled out refugees who had received money or expired their visas, and others who hoped the city would return to normal life.
Some even came back to fight the gunmen who drove them out of their homes.
The Mansour bus station was already before 800 people arrived from Damascus in an official government convoy of dozens of buses, full of refugees from Syria and Jordan, who returned by private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad," said Sabah al-Kubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
“Today I came back because of what I saw on television and what I read in the newspapers, because of what was happening in Baghdad and how safe it is now.
"They say Mahdi's army has stopped killing people," he said, referring to the Shi'ite militia of militant spiritualist Muqtada al-Sadra, who temporarily ordered his people to stop fighting.
Kasim al-Atwani, an eighty-year-old Shiite teacher from the predominantly Sunni region of Amariya, returned with his two children because he could no longer renew his Syrian visa and because the regime there did not allow Iraqis to work.
His Shi'ite neighbors in Amariyah called him with the idea that a U.S.-backed local housekeeper helped push al Qaeda out of its positions west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan is the leader of the Sunni and Shiite tribe, who was driven out of his home in Sleikhu, northern Baghdad by a grenade attack after urging his compatriots to rebel against al-Qaeda.
He came back to fight.
“The day before, a few friends called me and told me that he was going to Sleikh to launch a militia against al-Qaeda and that he needed me and the support of my men.
That's why I came back today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, a man in his twenties.
Many have spoken of the appeal of calming in the capital after strengthening the U.S. military presence and the growth of local “groups of concerned citizens” who are armed with weapons on the side of the U.S. military defending their quarters.
But more was said to have been brought back by obstructions around visas and money loss in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarraj, the father of three children at the age of eleven, voiced the suspicion shared among the refugees that Nuri al-Maliki, the Shia prime minister, had asked the Syrian government to impose restrictions on refugees' visas and thus forced them to return.
According to available data, more than two and a half million people have fled from Iraqi sectarian killers.
"Everything was fine before al-Maliki visited Syria and pressed the government to stop giving Iraqis visas to have to return to Iraq," the Sunni pensioner said.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned my house after I left."
Part of the reason for the weakening of the violence is the fact that the Sunnis were expelled from Shia areas and vice versa, which reduces tensions in many places.
There are fears that the sudden influx of refugees will again excite sectarian tensions and lead to further fighting.
Little S<0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xA1>, good education
The smallest federal country in Germany plays a leading role in vocational education, excels even in the international focus of its higher education institutions.
Only in one area of education, S<0xC3><0xA1>rska is concerned by the same deficiency as the rest of Germany.
"To a man who is not from Sarskoye, I explained yesterday after the fiftieth that we are not French" - this self-absorbed slogan appears in Sarskoye on the posters on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of this smallest federal country.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in the S<0xC3><0xA1>r education system, which is the fifth most important in monitoring the education of the Cologne Institute for Economic Research (IW).
Universities have traditionally cooperated closely with the surrounding countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded by the French in 1948.
To this day, students can complete their studies with a double or even a triple degree.
This corresponds to a reasonably high proportion of foreign students, which is 15.6%.
After all, the above-average number of S<0xC3><0xA1>r's children is admitted to college - many of them even without studying at the gymnasium.
“In S<0xC3><0xA1>rsk, a professional education system is used,” says Axel Plünnecke, an education expert at IW.
With more than one in five young people getting the right to study at a vocational school, S<0xC3><0xA1>rsko is more than 7% above the German average.
Compared to the rest of Germany, S<0xC3><0xA1>rsk has a wealth of opportunities to combine practical and academic education.
Opportunities to study two disciplines are the second best in all of Germany in terms of population.
Despite practically oriented education and increasing demand, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by a third in recent years.
That is why the S<0xC3><0xA1>r Ministry of Education has now ordered the higher education institutions to create a promotional campaign for the engineering fields.
“After the first study of Pisa, we have carried out several reforms in the general education schools,” says a spokesperson for the Ministry of Education.
Therefore, the government has put in place comparison tests all over Germany.
In order for children to start learning as soon as possible, the final year of primary school is free - a model that is also taken over by other federal countries.
If the results of the pupils are significantly improved, then future comparative studies will show up.
When the Pisa study was conducted in 2003, the proportion of risk pupils decreased from 29 to 20%.
Overall, however, Sarskoye did not improve as much as any other federal state.
Bavarians can count better.
And to S<0xC3><0xA1>rsk’s disappointment, Pisa’s studies do not compare the knowledge of foreign languages – otherwise S<0xC3><0xA1>rsk could score in this area.
The language of the neighbours is compulsory in gymnasiums - even though the inhabitants of Sarskoye are not French.
Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez moves the clock
What not to see will go hours in Venezuela differently than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez will move the clock in this South American country by half an hour.
In Spain, Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez has become a ridiculous figure.
The Venezuelan newspaper reported that the clocks will shift by less than four and a half hours, according to the new law.
The South American state will be this step in a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, the enemy of the United States, justified his decision, among other things, by forcing the United States to divide the world’s time zones for hours.
On Wednesday, Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez announced that he was disrupting relations with neighboring Colombia due to the case with the hostages.
This left-wing nationalist has said that while conservative Alvaro Uribe is the president of Colombia, he will not maintain any relations with him or the Colombian government.
"I can't because of my self-esteem anymore," said Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, who is pushing for constitutional reform, which the citizens of this oil country must vote in Sunday's referendum.
With this reform, Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez would greatly strengthen his power in the country.
Uribe’s decision to withdraw Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez’s mandate to negotiate in Colombia with the Marxist rebels to release the hostages sparked controversy.
Uribe, in his decision, "was spitting in the face" of Venezuela, Uribe Chavez criticized Sunday.
In Spain, too, everyone is talking about Chavez.
A new mobile phone call here has sparked a stir: "Por qué no te callas" - that's the phrase that more than half a million people have already downloaded from the internet.
It was uttered by the Spanish King Juan Carlos, who, at the recent Ibero-American summit, was so enraged by the vocal remarks of this left-wing populist that he silenced him in this way.
The Germans are at risk of lower salaries in 2007
According to the forecast, this year German employees are threatened with a reduction in real wages despite a strong economic downturn.
Experts have justified their pessimistic prognosis for a number of reasons.
According to estimates from the Hans Böckler Foundation, in 2007, employees can actually expect to receive a lower salary than last year.
"The wine is borne by a small increase in wages, an increase in value added tax and an increase in food and energy prices," said Bild Gustav Horn of the IMK (Institut für Macroökonomie und Konjunkturforschung).
The new burden on employees may also be expected in the area of unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung that the planned reduction in unemployment insurance contributions to 3.3% for the new year is correct and reasonable in this situation.
However, the Federal Labor Agency should not fall into such difficulties again that it would have to demand loans or contributions from the Federal Youth, quoting the newspapers of this socially democratic policy.
On Tuesday, it was announced that the price explosion in food and petroleum products has driven inflation to its highest level in the last thirteen years.
In year-on-year comparison, prices rose by three per cent.
Venus is the hellish twin of Earth.
Despite its hostile atmosphere, Venus Earth is more similar than previously thought. The European space probe Venus Express on Venus has recorded phenomena that also occur on Earth in winter: lightning in the atmosphere and wind gusts on the poles.
For nearly three decades, scientists have known that Venus is shining.
Now the European probe Venus Express has brought evidence - it has captured electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere. On Venus are flashing from cloud to cloud at an altitude of about 56 kilometers, writes in the scientific journal Nature Christopher Russell of the University of California, Los Angeles.
According to the known theory of the origin of the original matter, life could have been created on Earth by lightning. Storms are said to have triggered reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, the cornerstones of life.
There was no such thing on Venus: “If life ever existed there, it must have been a very long time ago,” explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institute in Washington.
Today, there would be hardly anything alive on the surface of Venus. The atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth and sometimes there are temperatures around 500 <0xC2><0xB0>C.
"Venus may be Earth's hellish twin, but it's a twin," Russell said.
Why Venus, which is so similar in mass and size to Earth, has begun to evolve in a completely different way, is a fundamental question of Esa’s mission.
Since no probes have been sent exclusively for the study of Venus since the early 1990s, the launch of the Venus Express probe in November 2005 was a milestone in the planet's research.
According to scientists, the latest research results, which brought several articles of the journal Nature closer, did not only emphasize the uniqueness of Venus in the solar system.
“They also showed that our neighbouring planet is more Earth-like than previously thought,” said Esa.
In addition to the already known wind gusts at the north pole, scientists have found a cloud gust at the south pole that rotates much faster.
This phenomenon resembles air currents on the Earth's northern hemisphere, writes a research team led by Guiseppe Piccioni of the Italian Institute of Astrophysics Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second innermost planet in our solar system is almost the same mass as Earth, and with a diameter of 12,100 km it is almost the same size.
This planet, known as Jupiter or Evening, will orbit the Sun in as little as 225 days.
However, it rotates much slower around its own axis. One day on Venus takes 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus does not resemble the surface temperature of 460 <0xC2><0xB0>C and the Earth's pressure of 92 bar, scientists believe that the two planets formed under very similar conditions.
On both, water accumulated, but on Earth it remained in the oceans, while from Venus it evaporated into space.
While carbon dioxide on Earth is bound in carbonates, it makes up most of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel’s meeting with Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler has called for an end to party disputes over the admission of the Dalai Lama to the Chancellery.
He indirectly criticized the SPD for its attacks on the chancellor after a meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany’s reputation and calls on the big coalition to end the fight over the adoption of the Dalai Lama.
"We should not present ourselves externally as a nation that is not united on this issue," Köhler told the Wirtschaftsblatt.
At the same time, he expressed sympathy for German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s (CDU) decision to adopt the Dalai Lama in September.
“Although I respect cultural differences, human rights have universal validity for me,” Köhler said.
The Federal President stressed that everyone knows that Germany must maintain a reasonable balance in foreign policy, but that did not stop Merkel from stopping when she was told she was creating a new policy towards China.
"The Gender Chancellor has not strayed from the traditional policy of a unified China.
China knows that too," Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) indirectly expressed his disagreement with the adoption of the Dalai Lama, and was therefore attacked by the coalition.
Steinmeier complained, among other things, about the “leading” foreign policy of the coalition.
After the adoption of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellor’s Office, German-Chinese relations deteriorated.
Not only has the Chinese government cancelled the invitation of the German finance minister Peer Steinbrücke (SPD), but the SPIEGEL also frozen the so-called strategic dialogue of the foreign ministries of the two countries.
Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao has called on Chancellor Angela Merkel to acknowledge that accepting the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China does not approve when European politicians officially accept the Tibetan spiritual leader, Wen Jiabao stressed China’s position.
The words and actions of the Dalai Lama have shown that Tibet, along with other Tibetan areas, which are also located in China, is trying to separate from China.
Schäuble warns of similar unrest that erupted in France
Street battles with police, shootings, burning cars. Wolfgang Schäuble warns of similar riots that erupted in France.
We must do everything we can to ensure that social discontent in Germany does not become violent on the streets, the German interior minister said.
The barricades were on fire, the snipers fired arrows at the police, and after serious youth riots in France, the Federal Minister of the Interior Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) is worried about a similar development in Germany.
“We need to be careful not to create social tensions in our country that break through in violence.
We have to take it seriously," he told the Neue Presse in Hannover.
Not every young person is said to be able to cope with the rapid change in social reality.
The federal government, countries and municipalities are already working hard to resolve the problems, Schäuble said.
This is not just about integrating migrants.
"From the summit on integration to the conference on Islam, we record the first successes."
However, caution is still in place.
Schäuble also pointed out that the planning and sociological problems of the German suburbs are not comparable to those of the French.
Last night, young people and police in the northern suburbs of Paris were seduced by tough street fights.
In Toulouse, cars and public buildings burned down.
Greater integration efforts by the German government were demanded by the chairman of the Turkish municipality in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In light of the unrest in France, Kolat warned of a "imitation effect".
The situation in Germany should not be as explosive as it is in France.
Nevertheless, it should be done.
Kolat pointed out that among people under the age of 25 who come from migrant families, the unemployment rate is "over-averagely high".
First of all, it is necessary to provide a greater number of study opportunities.
Kolat emphasized: "We must give hope to the youth."
However, the president of the Turkish municipality added that in Germany, unlike France, there is greater social control of families.
In addition, many young people from migrant families do not want to destroy what their parents built here.
Kolat said, "Yet we have to be careful."
We need to "make young people quick to start working and getting educated."
Meanwhile, the night in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel was mostly quiet.
Hundreds of police officers were deployed and a helicopter with lights flew over the area.
Authorized authorities have reported three arrests and several burnt waste bins and cars.
Since yesterday, the peace of mind has been taken care of by about 1,000 law enforcement officers.
Police will intervene for as long as necessary, said Michelle Alliot-Marie, the interior minister, after a visit to the suburbs.
In the riots in the suburb of Villiers-le-Bel, about 80 police officers were injured on Tuesday night.
The next night, the riots of Toulouse were appalled.
A car accident on Sunday caused the deaths of two young people.
According to the initial findings of the State Prosecutor's Office, the police are not to blame for the deaths of young people.
In the realm of Angels "Oblasts"
The chancellor’s far-flung exit documents that the coalition is programmed at the end and that we can no longer expect anything more from it.
In what country does the Chancellor actually live?
After her merciless, indifferent and content poor speech at the general debate of the Federal House, we have to say: not here - not in this country, which she should manage after all.
To the lamentation that she is too focused on foreign policy, Angela Merkel responded with a very arrogant sentence.
That's provincial, she said, showing that she doesn't want to understand what critics are talking about.
In the House of Commons, she made it clear to everyone how much she deserved the remorse.
There was no real interest from Merkel, let alone a feeling for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela "Oblakov<0xC3><0xA1>" was presented: a politician who stands out above others, who flees to foreign policy and even there expresses herself only in a fog.
For example, climate protection: it constantly praises the conclusions of the Heiligendamm summit, but no longer says how the climate goals are to be achieved in Germany.
And at all, such self-acceptance - so much indifference the CDU president would have forgiven herself two years ago.
Now it is limited to flat phrases that could increase its popularity among people.
This approach damages his image of a pragmatist who does not need to flatter because he solves problems.
But in the realm of the Angels "Oblakové" internal political problems are a marginal matter.
Child poverty and concern for low-wage people?
She has a few more words to say about these issues.
It is worth noting how often Merkel, when it comes to child allowances, is oversold.
“Three times Merkel has to start from the beginning in order to be able to say at least partially the right sentence.
As soon as things start to become very specific, it sniffs like in a completely foreign terrain.
the Department of Attack
The debate over Republican presidential candidates on YouTube was sparked by a fierce debate over the favorites of Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney - and both must now fear an outsider candidate.
The tension between the two candidates is already evident in the first issue.
Mitt Romney has accused his rival, Rudy Guilian, of making New York a "refugee for illegal immigrants".
Giuliani quickly responds with sharp remarks: “I think his own house was just one such refuge,” responds, presuming to the former governor of Massachusetts that he had privately employed immigrants without documents.
Since the Republican base does not yet have a clear favorite, eight presidential candidates are using these debates on CNN primarily to discredit their rivals, and the Republican base is not yet a clear favorite.
Half-minute videos shot by Internet users and sent via Youtube serve only as such help on a key topic.
“This is exactly the kind of isolationist policy that we have allowed Hitler to seize power,” McCain told rival Ron Paul, who is the only one who advocates the immediate withdrawal of troops from Iraq.
Vietnam veteran McCain has not spared Romney's remorse for refusing to condemn a torture interrogation method called "Waterboarding" in which heating is simulated.
The reaction of the public in St. Petersburg, Florida, shows that neither the war in Iraq nor the methods of torture are among the important themes of the campaign.
The audience is swayed by applause whenever conservative values are invoked and future tax increases are rejected.
This is where the weaknesses of both favorites lie.
"I was wrong at the time," Romney explains, and asks the party base and television audience for forgiveness for being a supporter of abortions back in 1994.
Giuliani is in despair when it comes to the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharaf for the first time in a civil war
The day after his resignation as army chief, Pakistani ruler Musharaf took an oath of office.
This is the end of eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan's President Parviz Musharaf took an oath of office on Thursday and will remain in office for another five years.
Pakistani television broadcast live a ceremony held at the presidential palace in the capital, Islamabad.
Musharaf vowed to honor the constitution and strive for the welfare of the nation.
On Wednesday, he handed over his office to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani, which put him under international pressure, particularly from the United States.
Eight years after taking power in a bloodless military coup, the former general rules for the first time as a civilian head of state.
With his resignation from the position of commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharaf met one of the main demands of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the abolition of the state of emergency, which Musharraf declared on November 3.
According to the Supreme Prosecutor, Malik Muhammad Qayyum, Musharraf will abolish the state of emergency soon after he has sworn in, fulfilling another of the demands of the West.
The country’s highest court, which Musharaf, after declaring a state of emergency in early November, had been occupied by prone lawyers, last week rejected all objections to the controversial re-election of the head of state on October 6.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed and four others wounded in an attack on a military convoy in the North Vaziristan tribal area.
A military spokesman said the bomb exploded on a road near the border with Afghanistan.
Father's Crack is Back
The famous German band of the 1970s is playing again. Three members of the band Harmonia have again taken their electronic synthesizers at a concert in Berlin.
Revival will also include Live 1974, a sister from the band's most successful period.
At the time, they were much more familiar abroad.
The announced sensation then consists in the performance of three sitting gentlemen, who at first look like they are just enjoying dinner.
Everyone has a box, cables and, above all, buttons in front of them.
Thirty-year-old Dieter Moebius in a snow-white shirt sits in the middle.
Behind him is seventeen-year-old Michael Rother, who has a laptop and guitar in front of him.
The thirty-seven-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius, who is focusing on synthesizers, is on the right from the viewer’s point of view.
Everyone contributes sounds, sometimes even beats.
Sometimes, by not taking care of them, a traditional composition is formed.
It doesn’t seem to bother the musicians very much.
The revival of the band Harmonia caused a considerable stir among the lovers of crochet.
One thing is worth noting here. Repeated questions have shown that this name is part of the collective awareness of pop, but it is certainly not far enough for anyone to miss this band painfully for twenty-three years.
But why couldn’t even the German celebrate his still-living legends of the 1970s?
And especially when it comes to the musical style, mistakenly called krautrock, it is worth more in England and America than it is in its own country.
When the music business awarded the remaining members of the Cologne group Can the Echo Award for a lifetime work in 2003, the hall was full of intriguing views of German pop fans.
In addition, when the Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked La Düsseldorf and Neu! in their speech, the audience’s admiration no longer knew the boundaries.
Michael Rother later sat on stage with the Red Hot Chili Peppers as their old friend at the concerts.
The problem of ignorance at home and worship abroad is one thing.
By recalling the band Harmonia, we overload the memory unnecessarily, this trio only existed for two years and not even at that time had such an influence as others later attributed to them.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously played with artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
Initially, they played in the basement of the Berliner Schaubühne.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons, at a church-run gramophone company.
Rother briefly assisted with Kraftwerk, but he gained a reputation as a guitarist for Neu!, which at the time was perhaps the most radical German band.
In 1973, Rother followed Cluster to exile in Forest, Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, a 16th-century ruin, they lived as members of the commune who fled the city.
They did not live here as ideologically as in Commune I, where Roedelius was still allowed to steal as a nanny.
It was rather a life in such a spitzwegian artistic being.
The name for the art is supposedly derived from the name of the singing choir Harmonia Ottenstein, whose badge was allegedly found in the ashtray.
A lot of that harmonies.
The first album was called "Music from Harmony" and the next "De Luxe".
Although their music sounded so calm and modest, the band suffered from financial difficulties.
The collection of roasts did not serve only self-recognition.
The now released CD "Live 1974" was said to have been disbanded at a concert in Griessem in front of a record-breaking, barely fifty-piece backdrop.
At that time, Rothera expressed the wish that Harmony members would be elevated and occasionally exercised.
For Roedlia and Moebia, it was a totally indecent request.
In 1975, the band announced their break-up.
Rother ended up in the esoteric realm and secured his future with the album "The Burning Heart".
The band Cluster revived in the 1980s and has been more successful since then than Harmonia ever was.
For the live album from Griessemer we can be grateful to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His recording company, Grönland, set out to treat krautrock as an original German contribution to live music.
The band Neu! was considered Roedeli's solo work at the time.
The bodily rebirth of Harmony will take place at the Berlin House of World Cultures.
The performance at the Woldtronics festival will be publicly sponsored.
Brit, Julian Cope, the old punk and author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler" will be present.
The founder of Love Parade, Dr. Motte, will also attend.
In this way, we have planned the overall breadth of the influence of karutrock on future pop music.
The empty space of the famous group will fill Harmony.
Brian Ena’s voice, accompanied by the strangest sounds, echoes in the hall: “Unique true music, its future belongs to it.”
There are paintings on which the producer is with Harmonia in a farmhouse.
The creation of the legend also contributes to the projection of other black and white photographs, on which a set of devices are wildly connected cables.
Before that, the three veterans are again engaged in improvisation.
No more gluing microphones to organ and drums to eject the never-before-heard self-made tones from the instruments.
Today, electronic music is like electronic music.
Three in the technique of playing dots.
Even the House of World Cultures does not change that.
Under the leadership of Barbara Morgenstern, she whispers under the sound clouds and in one beautiful place, she sings emphatically "Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Krautrock has always been a very English term.
It's never been about rock.
We would find roots rather than in blues in music colleges (Can), in technology (Kraftwerk) or in escape from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
The one who shouts "68!" in this place is not so far from the truth, but Harmony is not even now allowed to be brought out of peace.
Even the most self-evident thing is thoroughly thought out on the stage.
Where does music begin and when does it end?
This question either prepares the person for the nerves or allows him to experience the transient moments of happiness.
Richard Gere just isn't cynical enough.
With the introduction of the films The Hunting Party and Morderischer Frieden, two films about the war in the Balkans appeared immediately.
But not one of them is convincing.
The template of the films either places too much emphasis on sharpness and shooting, or they are too touching.
Even an actor like Richard Gere won’t stop that at The Hunting Party.
The good news first: War criminals Karadzi<0xC4><0x87> and Mladi<0xC4><0x87> are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but it is there, in the cloudy background of the Bosnian War, that actor Richard Gere will be acquitted.
In recent times, we have lost sight of this most beautiful man of the eighties, not only because he played many likes, rude roles in comfortable women's films, but in conjunction with his press conferences on the subject of Buddhism, man will take a taste for the next film.
And yet, Richard Gere is suddenly the strongest argument for watching The Hunting Party - Where the Hunter Becomes a Snake (Why do movie titles have to be so long and twisted these days?).
His war reporter Simon Hunt is essentially the one who could have become Gere if fate and the film industry hadn’t been so merciful: a man who has had his best years long ago, but as a ruinous monument like the ruins, he is still haunting them.
But despite this trump, The Hunting Party, along with the German film Morderischer Frieden, which is also entering cinemas this week, is just a continuation of an endless series of unsuccessful films about the war in the Balkans.
With the film Morderischer Frieden we can make a short process: This film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who save a Serbian girl from a Kosovo shooter, one of them falling in love with her.
Although it is commendable that here the Serbs are not presented as the cause of all evil, this TV tile film changes too early in shooting and action.
The film will remain very similar to the Cobra 11 series, although without a motorway, but for that with the war.
In The Hunting Party, one can explain why a really good film about the Balkan War has not been made so far.
The story of three U.S. war reporters who turn out to be a “little”, Serbian top war criminal, could at some other time and under the guidance of another director and screenwriter (here is both Richard Shepard) perhaps become a new “Apocalypse.”
After all, the two stories are surprisingly similar: small groups go to the forest to do something the army is unable to do, but their journey becomes a path to madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of The Hunting Party is that Simon Hunt is not the vicious and sentimental cynical portrayed in the beginning.
On the contrary, the proposal will also prescribe a romantic affair with a later murdered Bosnian Muslim.
The Hunting Party can be written down with final validity after the reporters in the last five minutes of the film are led by what NATO, the CIA, and all the world’s criminal hunters have failed in the last five years: to catch criminals and leave them fair.
This is so contrary to the logic of filmmaking that it would be worth turning to the International Court of Justice in The Hague.
This film has a profound human message.
It condemns Karadzi<0xC4><0x87> and Mladi<0xC4><0x87> still at liberty, and suspects the Americans and the French (here they are exceptionally united) that they do not engage in persecution intensively enough on the basis of secret political agreements.
But good and evil are sometimes so similar, we are attacked by women by Brecht's famous poem.
It is about the wooden mask of an Asian demon on the writer's desk: "I look with compassion at the running veins on the forehead, note: how laborious it is to be evil."
In movies like The Hunting Party, there are exactly such swollen heads that indicate how strenuous it is to be good.
This problem is not limited to the issue of war in the Balkans.
It was recently reported in these newspapers that all of the Hollywood films about Iraq were major failures.
One thing to add to this is that there has never been a good film about South Africa.
Almost always true: When a star crawls through a crisis area or walks through a minefield, a film like Rangoon with Patricia Arquette, The Borders of Breaking with Angelina Jolie or Blood Diamond with Leonard DiCaprio will emerge.
Maybe all those conflicts are just too close in time.
After all, it had to be decades before Hollywood could make a good film about the Holocaust - Schindler's List.
Many films must have matured - films that are now considered classic Vietnamese works - "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse" or "The Fisherman's Vest" - were by no means celebrated as masterpieces at the time.
But maybe today, when every mass murder at home appears on two screens right away, we know too much about the conflicts of this world.
The writers then don’t have the ability to tell good stories flawlessly.
"To be or not to be" or "The Great Dictator" became so good, because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how terrible the Nazi regime really ruled.
Maybe you don’t want to be good when you want to make good movies.
Perhaps he has to form a sarcastically measured artistic view as the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
Asked about the parallel between his historical novel "Lemprier's Dictionary" and "The Balkan War", he said: "Similarity lies only in the fact that some things never change.
The big cities will always be very dangerous, people will always be murdered in a terrible way, and there will always be a war in Yugoslavia.”
Von Beust has been criticised for renouncing the Olympics.
The mayor’s resignation from the holding of the Summer Olympics in Hamburg has come face to face with severe criticism of politics and the economy.
Many want to continue to fight for the organization of games by the water.
Von Beust, however, invites realism in the estimation of chances.
Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, chief executive of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, on Wednesday called the decision "unfortunate from the point of view of business".
No other project in recent times has awaken in the city as much motivation as the Olympic idea.
“Without this goal, it would not be possible to maintain this sporting political enthusiasm to such a high degree.”
Schmidt-Trenz urged the Senate not to bury this project, but to create a new long-term concept for it, "based on a modified timetable."
Mayor Ole von Beust has stayed on Wednesday with his earlier statements that Hamburg’s Olympic ambitions are unrealistic until at least 2028.
"Not Hamburg, but the German Olympic Sports Association will decide on the Olympic candidacy," von Beust told WELT ONLINE.
He pointed out that at the beginning of December the Sports Association will decide on Munich’s candidacy for the Winter Games in 2018.
“This preference for us means that with the 2028 schedule, we don’t have any realistic chances.”
Yet this dream is not yet over, von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) called von Beust's statements regrettable.
It would seem that Hamburg does not want to go to the Olympics in the next twenty-five years.
"It is too soon to destroy our chances by marking the plans as buried at this early stage," HSB President Günter Ploss said on Wednesday.
The resignation would be contrary to the resignation of the head of the Senate, which he delivered at the General Assembly of the German Higher Education Sports Association.
Von Beust did not announce Hamburg's candidacy for the 2015 Olympic Games as a substitute.
The Hamburg University of Applied Sciences (HAM) nominated for the city of Hamburg last week.
The SPD faction in the Hamburg Senate insisted that it was wasting valuable time that could be used to build apartments in Hamburg.
"The development of the Klein Grasbrook area has been slowed by the Senate for years because it has invested in hosting the Olympics and excluding the construction of apartments," SPD MPs Carola Veit and Jan Quast said.
While the SPD for the Klein Grasbrook area was still planning the Olympics with the entire area being later used for residential purposes, the CDU unanimously bet on an "olympic factor".
At the 2012 Summer Olympics, he was very enthusiastic about his time in Hamburg.
Hamburg, however, failed in Leipzig.
It's not Warhol's box.
The one who combines the expressions of Sweden and the wooden boxes, does not think of Andy Warhol, but of Ikea.
Or what?
Wooden boxes currently produced in Sweden are on Warhol's list of works of dark shadows.
Most of his listed ninety-four "Brillo boxes" of the Stockholm type are counterfeits.
After the Swedish newspapers "Expressen" a few months ago expressed doubts about the authenticity of Warhol's "Brillo Boxes" from 1968, comes the internal research of the Museum of Moderna Museet in Stockholm with the result that brought the "Pon<0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xBD> b<0xC3><0xBD>t<0xC3><0xBD>" to me a disappointment; the six "Brillo Boxes" in the "Br<0xC3><0xBD>l<0xC3><0xBD>" in the "Hue" in the "Muse" in the "Modern Museum in 1995.
The previous events are a tangled, confusing chain of artistic and curatorial events.
Warhol produced his first Brillo boxes in New York City in 1964, painting wooden boxes that were based on the red-and-white design of paper boxes of Brillo soap powder.
The exhibition of his works at the Moderna Museet in 1968 presented - with the consent of Warhol - hundreds of Brillo boxes from cardboard. These did not come (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo factory.
It wasn’t about artworks, it was about their templates, just exhibition pieces.
Warhol apparently also gave permission in 1968 to make several Brillo wooden beads in Sweden, but they are not on display in the Moderna Museet.
Witnesses at the time are now talking about fifteen boxes that rightly entered the art and auction history as authorized originals - "Andy Warhol's Brillo Boxes" with the designation Type Stockholm.
Some of them were auctioned off for more than $100,000.
The problem now lies in the fact that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that in 1968 it was made in Sweden and exhibited about a hundred beads, which Warhol then handed over to him.
In fact, 105 Hulténov<0xC3><0xBD> bedes were produced in Malmö for the exhibition in St. Petersburg only in 1990.
At the time, Warhol was already three years after his death.
Lars Byström, the top conservator of the Moderna Museet, explored in addition to the six Brillo boxes owned by the museum, also three Brillo boxes from a Swedish private collection, two of which would have been made by bar stools in 1968 and made by bar stools in Sweden.
On the contrary, from the structure of the 1990 copies it was revealed that the paint was applied to the plywood board directly by a painting role without the previous basic coating - in addition, it is acrylic rather than oil paint.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from Warhol's official Brillo box charter," said Lars Nittve, director of the Moderna Museet: "If the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board's organization copies of the New York Art Authentication Board "will not be construed with other conclusions.
In July, the Authentication Board announced that it would deal with these “complaints” made in the case of soapboxes.
However, the organization remains in unfailing silence.
Rebel soldiers in Manila give up
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers have resigned from a hotel in Manila demanding the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Antonio Trillanes, the commander of the insurgents, who slammed the president for manipulation and corruption in the election, told reporters at the hotel that he denied responsibility for the bloodshed.
Soldiers devoted to the government have previously attacked the hotel with tear gas.
A few hours earlier, about two dozen soldiers had been fortified in the building.
On Thursday, about half of them were in court over a failed coup attempt in 2003, including Trillanes.
He took advantage of the negotiations to run away with about 30 of his sympathizers.
The military police officers, who were supposed to be guarding him, apparently crossed over to his side and joined the insurgency.
They entered the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the resignation of President Glorie Macapagal Arroyo.
The Government of Loyalty Units closed the area around the selected hotel.
The president called an emergency meeting of the security cabinet.
National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the act of soldiers.
"People have had enough," Triallnes said.
"We're calling on people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, the commander of the former elite Scout Rangers unit, said that other military units will join the march in a short time.
Critics of the government have called for a big demonstration against the president on Friday.
Corruption has been rampant for months now.
As early as 2003, the Manilla financial area became the main scene of the uprising of about 200 soldiers against Arroyo.
Because the army refused to join the rebels, the rebellion failed after less than 24 hours.
Since 1986, the Philippines has attempted to overthrow a democratically elected government at least seven times.
United Internet becomes the majority shareholder of Versatel
United Internet has secured more than a 20 percent stake in the telecommunications company Versatel.
The company announced on Wednesday that the average price per share is 14.46 euros.
It is said that the company now owns 20.05% of the share capital.
Previously, there was speculation about the takeover.
The company still counts on the possibility of further increasing its stake in Versatel.
United Internet has announced that it is seeking to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market.
After Berenberg increased its stake in the Düsseldorf network operator’s company by an additional 5 % to 15.1 %, there were speculations on Wednesday about its entry.
In the financial market, it is said that this monetary institution holds shares only for a third party.
Yesterday, United Internet had a nearly 10% stake in Drillisch, a mobile telecommunication network provider.
As part of the capital increase, Drillisch has sold an additional 17.4 million new shares worth 106.4 million euros.
Of this, 5.15 million shares were bought for 31.4 million euros by United Internet.
The companies discussed marketing cooperation in the area of DSL products and mobile networks.
"We are strengthening our partnership," a United Internet spokesperson explained.
In order to take over the competitor Freenet, the companies together established the SME Joint Undertaking.
United Internet announced on Thursday that both companies are currently satisfied with more than 10 percent of Freenet and will not exercise their right to take over another 18.49 percent of Freenet.
It is considered that the companies remain open to all possibilities, in particular the possibility of further increasing their share in Freenet AG.
The talks between United Internet and Freenet on the strategic partnership were closed in mid-November.
This months-long and difficult-to-transparent Freenet game is part of the consolidation of the German telecommunications market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million contracted mobile customers and 1.27 million customers with a complete or DSL connection.
Holding United Internet and Drillische still held a 6.01% stake in Freenet.
Now it has been agreed that Drillisch will get an additional 4%.
The right to buy 18.49% of the investment company Vatas was already agreed in August.
