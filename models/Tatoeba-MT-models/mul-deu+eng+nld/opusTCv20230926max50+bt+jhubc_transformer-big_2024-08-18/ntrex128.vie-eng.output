Members of the Parliament of Wales (AM) worried about ‘looking like bugs’
There are certain concerns of some Members of Congress regarding the change of their name to MWP (Member of the Parliament of Wales).
The problem arose due to plans to change the name of Parliament to the Parliament of Wales.
Congressional deputies on the floor are concerned that this may be a problem that raises left-wing remarks.
A Labour MP said his Party was concerned that "the phrase would be consonant with Twp and Pwp."
For readers who are not native to Wales: In Wales, twp means temporary and pwp means segregation.
One Party Representative pointed out that the whole Party was "unprecedented" and suggested other names.
Another Conservative MP said his party had “no idea” about changing its name, but did not forget to mention how to abbreviate MWP easily into Muppet (disturbance).
On the face of the Welsh w is pronounced similar to the English Yorkshire u.
The Committee of Parliament is currently drafting a bill on the change of name, stating: "The final decision on any identification of the Members of Parliament will, of course, be of interest to the Members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 entitles the Welsh parliament to change its name.
In June, the Commission announced the results of a referendum on proposals aimed at finding a consensus basis for naming the parliament as the Parliament of Wales.
Considering the official history of the Members of Parliament, the Welsh Parliamentary Committee or WMP, the results of the petition show a trend towards the Welsh Parliamentary.
Congressional MPs are publicly making other options, but efforts to reach consensus may be a concern for Electoral Commissioner Elin Jones, who will be tasked with drafting the bill in the next few weeks.
The draft amendment will include other changes to the way parliament operates, including the rules on how Congressional Representatives function and the design of government machinery.
Congressional Deputies will cast the final vote on the question of what they should be renamed when they contribute to the amendment bill.
Macedonians vote in referendum on renaming the country <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Voters went to vote on Sunday on whether they would change the country's name to "the Republic of North Macedonia."
The comprehensive vote was set in an effort to resolve the decades-long dispute with Greece’s neighbouring country, where there is also a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long asserted that the name of its northern neighbour corresponds to its own territory and has repeatedly opposed becoming a member of your country’s EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, a member of the opposition party on the renaming of the country, has announced that he will cancel the results of the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, said the change of nationality was the price to pay to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Church's ringing sound falls into silence when a crisis unfolds in Harlem
“Historically speaking, the seniors to whom I was exposed shared that every corner of the street had a bar and a church,” Adams said.
“Until today, there is no church and there is no bar.”
He found that the disappearance of the bars was acceptable.
He said that today "People have many ways to promote."
“The bars are no longer the public lounges where people often come back.”
As for the churches, he was concerned that the money from the sale of the property would not be as sustainable as what the leaders expected "and not sooner or later will all return to the starting line."
He added that these churches could be replaced by condominiums with many apartments of dozens of people, which would not help in preserving the local religion.
"Some of the people who buy apartments in those condos will be white, and then the prospect of closed churches will come faster than ever because there's no reason for the residents in those apartments to become clergymen," he said.
Both churches were built by white denominations before Harlem became a city for blacks - the Metropolitan Community in the 1870s, becoming St. Martin's a decade later.
The first white-leaved dioceses moved in the 1930s.
A nearby worship group of colored clergy took over the site.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black church under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a retail sales reprisal on 125th Street, a shopping mall in Harlem, which opposed hiring or inciting blacks.
A fire in 1939 caused the building to be badly damaged, but when Father Johnson’s clergy planned to rebuild it, they set the bell to ring.
Pastor David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the bell ringing "the bell of the poor".
In July, the bell ringing expert preferred another name: "A cultural treasure" and "an immutable historical treasure."
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first bell ringing in the world played by a colored musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who pursued the larger bell ringing at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's did not replace him.
What has happened at St. Martin’s in the past few months is a complex story of architects and contractors, some of which were given by church clergy, others by the diocese.
The diocesan administration — the diocesan governing body, including the populist leaders — referred to the diocese in July with concerns that the diocesan “will seek to hand over the costs” to the diocesan administration, even though they are not involved in hiring architects.
Some clergy are dissatisfied with the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Sharks attack 13-year-old boy scuba diving in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while diving in California on Saturday, just the first day of the snail season, officials said.
The incident took place before 7 a.m., just off Beacon's beach at Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told San Diego's KSWB-TV that he was driving with his friends for about half an hour that Saturday morning when he heard the boy cry for help and then all of a sudden pulled him out of the water.
Hammel shared that he initially thought it was just a funny scream when he caught the shrimp, but then he "accepted that the boy was screaming: 'You're bitten!
“You were bitten!”
The whole of the boy’s skeleton was revealed,” Hammel noticed as soon as he reached the boy’s place.
“I urge everyone to get out of the water right away, ‘There are sharks there!’” Hammel added.
The boy was transported by plane to Nhi Rady Hospital in San Diego, where he was insured, in a tragic condition.
The shark's name was the perpetrator of the unidentified attack.
Rescue personnel, Major Larry Giles, told a news conference that they discovered a shark in the area a few weeks ago, but they determined that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered a serious injury to the upper part of his body.
Officials have closed the entrances to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas within 48 hours of serving the purpose of investigation and safety.
Giles reveals that there are more than 135 sharks in the area, but most of them are not dangerous.
Sainsbury’s Strategy to Enter the UK Beauty Market
Sainsbury's is pushing for Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams with traditional beauty stores, where there are always helpers.
As part of the massive push into the <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion beauty market, which is continuing to grow as the fashion and household goods turnover declines, more beauty stores than ever before will be tested at 11 stores across the country and become more humane.
Investing in the beauty industry comes when supermarkets are looking for ways to take advantage of the counters as a substitute for TV counters, microwaves and household appliances.
Sainsbury's said it was first to double the size of its beauty products to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Available brands such as L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also have more space with the same brand sales areas as the store displays in Boots.
Supermarkets are also reinforcing their boutique makeup product line so that most of the products are purely plant-based – which is increasingly being hunted by young customers.
In addition, fragrance retailer Fragrance Shop will test the discount at two Sainsbury's stores, the first store opened in Croydon, south London, last week and the second store opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, late this year.
Shopping online and switching to buying a small amount of food every day at local convenience stores means that supermarkets have to be more focused on attracting customers.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, said the warehouses will increasingly resemble grocery stores as supermarket chains try to cope with Aldi and Lidl's offerings with more non-food services and items.
Sainsbury’s, which has put Argos’s counters in hundreds of stores and has also introduced several Habitats counters since they bought both brand chains two years ago, has boosted grocery sales and helped make the acquisition more profitable.
The supermarket has previously tried to upgrade its beauty and pharmaceutical ranges but has failed.
Sainsbury's tested joint ventures with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration ended after problems related to how to divide revenues from grocery stores in supermarkets.
The new strategy was launched after Sainsbury's sold out 281 of its pharmaceuticals to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
Lloyds is known to contribute part of the plan, by strengthening a range of luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s Chief Commercial Officer, said: “We have transformed the look and feel of the beauty line to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specialised training for the employees, who will be able to give the advice directly.
Our range of brands are designed to fit every need and charming environment as well as convenient locations that mean that we are currently a fascinating, challenging stopover for traditional shopping.”
Peter Jones 'rings up' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from <0xC2><0xA3>11m contract
Dragons Den's star, Peter Jones, has been "ringing in" after TV host Holly Willoughby pulled out of an <0xC2><0xA3>11 million contract in doing her style brand business to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn’t have time for their Truly furniture and accessories brand.
The couple's business was ported to as Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
This Morning’s 37-year-old show has been on Instagram to announce that she is leaving.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons' Den, making stars Peter Jones angry as she pulls out of their super-profit-style brand business at the last minute - to focus on her own new open-ended contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
In a tense meeting on Tuesday at his empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, sources said Jones had "ringed up" when the show's golden girl admitted that her new contracts - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5m - were awarded to her for a temporary grant.
The business is referred to as Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and is expected to double Willoughby’s estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million assets.
When 37-year-old Willoughby went on Instagram to announce that she was leaving Truly, Jones quickly left the UK to visit one of his vacation homes.
A source said: “At the moment, Truly is Holly’s top priority.
It should have been her long-term future that will probably accompany her in the next few decades.
Her decision to leave makes the people who are involved incredibly astonishing.
No one can believe what happened on Tuesday, a time very close to the launch.
“There’s a warehouse full of goods at Marlow Headquarters ready to launch.”
Experts believe that the departure of the show host This Morning, one of the UK’s most iconic stars, could cause the company to pay millions of dollars due to strong hands-on investments in products from pillows and candles to clothing and interiors, and the ability to reverse the launch time of production.
And that could be the end of a long-term friendship.
Willoughby's parents and husband Dan Baldwin became close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
The couple went on vacation together and Jones had a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin to become the host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones shared last night that "We're not going to comment on anything about his business issue."
We are “deeply in love” with each other.
He joked about the criticism he would receive from media outlets for making a comment that some would consider "not to be in the form of a ruler" because he saw the possibility of a North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in a retaliatory voice “the show’s host.”
“I’m not giving up anything.”
He mentioned that Kim was interested in the second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June when Trump welcomed this as a major step forward in de-nuclearization in North Korea.
But the de-nuclearization negotiations have been stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, the head of North Korea’s Foreign Ministry, Ri Yong Ho, spoke to world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea’s initial demands were not seen as a “compromising response” to the United States.
Instead, he said, the United States is continuing sanctions measures to increase the pressure.
Trump had a much more optimistic outlook in his speech in his campaign.
“We are doing very well with North Korea,” he said.
“We’re going to fight North Korea.
Millions of people are likely to be killed.
We’re in a good relationship now.”
He said that efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results — ending missile tests, helping to liberate and bringing the American military’s core back home.
And he defended his extraordinary approach when talking about his relationship with Mr. Kim.
“It’s easy to become president, but instead of 10,000 people outside trying to get their feet into this hard-hitting area, we have about 200 people standing right there,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Earthquakes and Waves in Indonesia Destroyed the Island and Killed Many People
For example, after the disaster from the Lombok earthquake, foreign non-governmental organizations said they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has disappeared, no statement on the national disaster has been made, a prerequisite for international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they were very determined not to ask for international assistance, so it was very challenging," she said.
While Save the Children is gathering a group to move to Palu, they are still unsure whether foreign employees can work in the area.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials were evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international agencies were allowed to contribute to relief efforts.
Despite the ongoing earthquake situation that Indonesia has to undergo, the country has not yet been fully prepared for the wrath of nature.
While shelters for gods were built in Aceh, such places were not very popular in other places.
Although the warnings were effective, the lack of sound warnings in Palu could lead to human damage.
At peak times, moving between Indonesia’s many islands is a challenge.
Accidents make the construction work even more complex.
An ambulance has been stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims on their way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to get to the scene of the disaster.
President Joko Widodo has turned the improvement of Indonesia’s old infrastructure into a centerpiece of his election campaign and he has wasted money on road and rail construction.
But the lack of finances has made it difficult for Joko's administration to face re-election next year.
Mr. Joko is also facing pressure from tensions between sects that have not yet ended in Indonesia, as members of the majority of Muslims pursue a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were smuggled out of their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs wrestled on the streets, using knives, armor, and other crude weapons.
Daniel Sturridge gives Liverpool a rematch against Chelsea.
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a loss to Chelsea in the English Premier League on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London by a goal in the 89th minute.
Sturridge took the lead from Xherdan Shaqiri in the position away from Chelsea 30m when his team was led 1-0.
He handled the ball with his left foot before kicking a shot at the long column.
Shoot the grant and head to the upper right corner of the frame.
The ball exceeded the reach of Kepa Arrizabalaga and flew straight into the net.
"It's just that I'm in the right position, getting the ball and the players in which Shaq are always trying to get up so I just have to try to get up."
"I see Kante coming in so he handles a hit and shoots right away without much consideration."
Chelsea lead almost halfway through the opening match of Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
In this phase, the K<0xE1><0xB9><0x9B><0xE1><0xB9><0xA3><0xE1><0xB9><0x87>a K<0xE1><0xB9><0x9B><0xE1><0xB9><0xA3><0xE1><0xB9><0x87>a forwards the ball to Mateo Kovacic before moving around the area between the pitch and the pitch of Liverpool.
Kovacic had a hit on the wall from the middle of the yard.
You've had a beautiful slot chip, heading for Hazard's sweeping up the ban zone.
Hazard eliminated the defensive line and scored with his left foot in the corner, surpassing Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
The match between Liverpool and Naples in the Champions League will take place at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton at the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. in London.
The damage caused by the Indonesian wave reached 832.
The death toll from earthquakes and waves in Indonesia has risen to 832, the National Disaster Center said on Sunday.
Many are said to have been trapped in the debris pile of buildings brought by the 7.5-degree earthquake on Friday, following waves as high as 20 feet, according to Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesperson for the center's sharing at a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 people, is sinking into the rubble of buildings.

The Cromwell statue of Congress becomes the latest monument to the story of 'rewriting history'
The exclusion would be like a poem of justice for the destruction of the Taliban’s character by many of his clergy, when they destroyed England’s innumerable architectural and religious structures.
But the Cromwell Association described Mr. Crick's words as "crazy" and "an effort to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Association, said: “It is inevitable that the debates about leaving Oliver Cromwell’s statues outside Westminster Palace will become the focus of the moment.
The symbol of the civil war in Britain should not be ordered or carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps Cromwell's wrong will be replaced by the actions of his father Thomas in the last century.
Representative of Cromwell, William Hamo Thassycroft is evidence of the opinion of the 19th century and is part of the history of a character that many believe is still worthy of honour.
Mr. Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Perhaps by the end of the 19th century it will be more than now, Cromwell is seen by many as a protector of parliament against external pressure, in his opinion it is natural.
Whether it’s a perfectly accurate typo for the topic in the ongoing historical debate.
It is certain that the conflict between the 17th century shaped the next development of our country and Cromwell was a typical figure in the division.
His achievements as God’s protector are also worthy of honor and recognition.”
Chinese Farmer Kills Swine Kills Vong
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a south-western Chinese market, according to local media reports.
The man, known as "Yuan" was found dead with a broken artery, with his whole body covered with blood at a cell near a market in Qingdao, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig-breeder prepares vaccinations for pigs in a pit on May 30, 2005 in Tianjin, Tianjin province, China.
He is said to have moved with his cousin from nearby Van Nam province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, his cousin discovers he is dead, and sees a door of a pig’s cage open next to the door.
He said there was a huge male pig in the cage with blood stains around the mucus.
A report from a medical examine confirmed that the 550-pound pig attacked the farmers to the death.
“My two legs are full of blood and are no longer intact,” the cousin is known as “Wu” according to the Guiyang Evening News.
Photos from security cameras show that Mr. Yuan arrived at the market about 4.40 am to feed the pigs.
About an hour later, he was found dead.
The killer pig is not the pig in the pig of the two brothers.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been locked up to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while police collected evidence on the scene.
Yuan's family and the market's governing body are said to be negotiating compensation for his death.
Although not common, the case of a pig attacking people has been recorded previously.
In 2016, a pig attacked a couple on their farm in Massachusetts, causing the husband to suffer a serious injury.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig dumped a Welsh farmer on his tractor until his wife threatened to run away.
After a farmer in Oregon was meat-eaten in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs don’t usually bark, but the odor of blood can play a “smell.”
“They just want to be close.
“They’re very curious, they don’t want to hurt anyone.
You just have to cut them in the right direction,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa carry heavy rains on a wide surface to the Southwestern United States.
According to the forecast, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves to a cooler seafront off the north coast of Mexico.
Rosa, however, will carry rains across northern Mexico and the Southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rosa has a wind speed of 85 mph, Hurricane Phong Level 1, as of 05:00 a.m. on Sunday, and is located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a low pressure begins to form on the Pacific Ocean and moves eastward to the West Coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday when a tropical storm forms, it will begin to bring much of the North's humidity to the North.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Subsequently, low-pressure humidity will cause large amounts of rain to spread in the Southwest in the coming days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous scanning floods, debris flows, and even the ability to clean up the desert.
Humidity will cause rainfall of up to 2 to 3 inches per hour at peaks, especially in the southern regions of Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall is projected to reach 2 to 4 inches in southwestern areas, especially in the vast area of Arizona.
The scanning can occur when the situation deteriorates rapidly due to the dispersal nature of the rainfall.
The situation would be extremely dire if you risk walking into the desert when there is a threat from tropical rains.
Heavy rains can turn mountain gorges into violent rivers, and storms will carry local winds and gusts of dust.
The low pressure will bring with it some local heavy rainfall in many places on the southern coast of California.
Total rainfall can reach more than half an inch, easily causing debris and slippery lines.
This will be the first rainfall in the area during the rainy season.
Several scattered tropical storms began pouring into Arizona at the end of Sunday and early Monday, before the rain became more common at the end of Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will hit the Four Corners on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
It is possible to see some extreme temperatures throughout the United States in October when the Arctic is colder, but the tropical regions are still quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to significant changes in the temperature at the locals close to each other.
A typical wallet for a significant temperature difference in the central U.S. region on Sunday.
The temperature difference is about 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, a little warmer summer the king will be regenerated and reinforcing again.
Much of the central and eastern U.S. region is expected to have a warm start in October with temperatures common at around 80 in the Southern Plains to the northeast.
The temperature of New York City can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, about 10 degrees higher than average.
The long-term weather forecast is showing that high temperatures are likely to be above average in the eastern U.S. during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh’s audition.
More than 20 million people watched Thursday's hearing on six television systems of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault alleged to have occurred in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political turmoil continues, with television stations interrupting regular broadcasts with last-minute whistleblowing on Friday: an agreement made by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to prosecute the FBI for a felony.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100% certain that Kavanaugh was drunk and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a calm motion, said he was 100% certain that it did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people have followed the hearing, Nielsen said in the report on Friday.
The company has averaged viewers on ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Data not included right away for other TV stations including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often encounters some problems when calculating the viewers in the office.
In order to establish a correlation, the number of spectators is similar to that of a final ticket ball or an Oscar.
Fox News, the show’s host who strongly endorsed the appointment of Kavanaugh, led all stations with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the hearing all day, Nielsen said.
ABC ranked second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS with 3.1 million, NBC with 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million and CNN with 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
There is still a lot of concern after the hearing.
Flake is the central character in Friday's noise.
After the Republican philanthropist just announced that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, he was tracked by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning that he was slammed by protesters as he tried to move the elevator to the session.
He stood with his eyes downwards for a few minutes when being interrogated, being televised live on CNN.
“I’m standing in front of you,” said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the whole country?"
He was condemned that, "you have power while too many women are powerless."
Flake said before the elevator closed that his office had made a statement, that he would have much to say at the hearing of the committee.
All cable and television stations were covered for hours straight after, when the Judiciary Committee would have to vote on whether or not Brett Kavanaugh was nominated.
But Flake said he would only do so when he learned that the FBI would consider allegations against the candidates next week, which some in the minority Democrats have urged.
Flake was partly persuaded by conversations with his colleague, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with the Coons and a number of later senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice was heavy, as it was clear that the Republicans would have no vote to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
Prime Minister May Rejects Criticisms of ‘Politic Papers’ on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May repudiated criticism of plans to leave the European Union as a "political blow" to Britain's future and undermined national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will attend the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, England, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview, alongside an interview with her on the front page of the newspaper, Secretary of State Boris Johnson stressed his rebuttal to the so-called Chequers deal in its entirety for Brexit, saying that the UK and EU proposals should agree.
Wayde Sims: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson for LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player who plays for LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and detained for a second-degree murder, Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials have released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police say that Sims fell off their glasses during the crackdown.
Police discovered the glass from the scene and said they detected Simpson's DNA on the glass, according to CBS's WAFB station.
After Simpson's interrogation, the police said he admitted to having shot Wayde.
The bail was set at $350,000, the lawyer said.
The Baton Rouge County Office of Execution Tests released a preliminary report on Friday, saying the cause of the death was a round-the-clock bullet from head to toe.
The department is looking after the Louisiana state police, the evacuation task force, the state police crime lab, the Southern University police and local residents in support of the investigation into the arrest.
LSU's physical director Joe Alleva thanked the regional law enforcement for his "foolishness and pursuit of justice".
Sims are only 20 years old.
He grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points with 2.6 hits per game in the previous season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was “depressed” and “shocked” before Wayde’s death.
Mr. Wade said, “That’s what you’ll always have to watch out for.”
Volcano moves into Mexico City.
The plume from the Popocatepetl volcano has flowed into the southern neighborhoods of Mexico’s capital.
The National Hurricane Center warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the volcanic eruptions were active and they recorded 183 emissions and dust within 24 hours.
The center has been tracking a lot of tremors and vibrations.
Social media footage shows thin layers of dust obscuring car windshields in Mexico City’s neighborhoods such as Xochimilco.
Geologists have noted an increase in activity at the volcano 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital since a 7.1-degree earthquake rocked central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, named Don Goyo, has been in operation since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independent protesters clashed with anti-violence police, as thousands of protesters on the occasion marked the first time Catalonia's two-party vote on the declaration.
A group of detainees wearing masks were detained by anti-violence police with eggs and powder coatings, causing black dust clouds on the streets that are often crowded with tourists.
The chaos erupted at the end of the day as police used a spear to suppress the strike.
For hours, independent supporters chanted “Don’t forget, don’t forgive” against protesters, saying, “Great Spain.”
Fourteen people have been treated for minor wounds during the protests, local media reported.
Tensions remain high in the region a year after the October 1 referendum was deemed illegal with Madrid but were welcomed by Catalan separatists.
Independently-oriented voters occupy the island, despite the low support rate for those who oppose the secessionist majority sweeping the election.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the vote from taking place at polling stations in the region amid violent clashes.
The independent supporter camped over Friday night to stop a demonstration in support of the national police force.
The protests took place earlier, but were forced to take place with other events.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who attended a divorce protest with his wife, said he no longer had hopes of Catalonia’s prospects of gaining independence.
“Last year we had the happiest moments.
“I watched my parents cry for joy when they could vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite winning important victories in the regional election last December, Catalan independents have struggled to keep the momentum this year with many of their most well-known leaders in the aftermath of their resignation or segregation or imprisonment.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who returned to the police demonstration by phone, said the conflict had been stalled by politicians on both sides.
“The story is getting more and more stressful,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in prison before being tried since the end of last year, said he would run for the European Parliament elections next year.
"Thamas as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to prosecute the deterioration in democratic values and the repression we have witnessed from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men Arrested When Cars Enter Home
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after the car repeatedly hit a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19:30 BST.
Investigator Bob Blemmings said the incident caused damage to the gates and the building itself.
There were a few gunshot wounds to the car at some point.
Menga's shot brought Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's lead lead helped Livingston win
Livingston came as a surprise to the Rangers when the Ibrox home field team was led by Steven Gerrard with only two losses in 18 games.
Dolly Menga's scoreline showed a difference when Gary Holt's side raised the range with Hibernian in just a few seconds.
Gerrard's team has yet to score a separate goal in this season's Premier League and will face eight-point lead Hearts on Sunday.
Earlier, the Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, has extended his undefeated series in six games, as head coach Holt has tasted the scent of failure since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses the chance to play with the underside team
Holt’s team should have been leading before they scored, with their face-to-face tactics making the Rangers more difficult.
Scott Robinson narrowed but outscored the goal, then Alan Lithgow could only direct his efforts stronger after leading the ball to Craig Halkett on the field.
The home team is confident to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they can trouble the team with personal techniques.
And that's the strategy for a set score.
The Rangers made a penalty kick and Livingston led ahead, Declan Gallagher and Robinson co-ordinated on the Menga side, who had already touched the ball and scored right in the middle of the field.
At this point, the Rangers dominated keeping the ball but noticed that the defensive line was impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was almost without difficulty,
The match continued into the second round, although Alfredo Morelos received help from Kelly.
Scott Pittman failed under Rangers Allan McGregor's feet and Lithgow switched to another Livingston game scenario.
Continuously leading the ball into the frame into Livingston and continuously being summed up, when there were two temple penalties - following Halkett's challenge to Glenn Middleton's replacement, one due to a touch of the ball - were all successfully hampered.
'Label' with Livingston - analysis
from BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Stadium
A result and a match of good quality for Livingston.
The team was very good, continued to long-awaited in the turn of the line.
The style of play and their players have rarely changed since they returned to the top position, but the status is significant to Holt because of the way he grinds the team since he appears.
You have too many strong players.
Halkett's teammates were generals, arranging an excellently organized defensive line-up, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall's feet.
But the Rangers were not inspired.
Just as when under Gerrard, they did not meet those standards.
The final shot was missing – the only chance to open the home team’s pitch – and that was a wake-up call for the Rangers, the midfield team.
Erdogan received a warm welcome in Cologne.
There were good smiles and favorable weather on Saturday (29 September) when the Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany – with the aim of sealing ties between NATO allies.
They discussed issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Erdogan then moved to Cologne to attend the ceremony as a new-scale Muslim church.
The city is the place with the largest population of Turkey outside of Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to stop the crowd of 25,000 people gathering in front of the mosque, but a lot of supporters were also nearby to meet their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an protesters, many of them Kurds, also spoke out, condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him to the country.
The two-pronged protests reflect the division of a guest who was hailed as a hero by some Turkish people in Germany and who was mocked by others as an authority.
Deptford Accident: Bicycle Accident Killed in Car Crash
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred near three Bestwood and Evelyn Streets, a slum in Deptford, southeast of the city, at about 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped and the medical staff arrived, but the man died on the scene.
The accident occurred months after another cyclist was killed in a car crash and ran off on Childers Street, about a mile away from the accident on Saturday.
Police said they were working to determine the identity of the man and notify his relatives.
Roads are blocked and buses are taken advantage of and participants are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin: Six Officers Injured in Violence
Six employees were injured in a violence in a prison for male offenders with strict security, the Prison Secretary said.
The riots erupted at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9:30 a.m. on Sunday morning and are still ongoing.
The Tornado experts were brought to the scene of the war, ending at about 5:30 p.m.
Officers were spotted on the scene with small wounds.
A spokesman for the Prison Management Board said: “Specially trained prison staff have been deployed to deal with the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six of the injured were treated.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and it is clear that the individuals involved will be transferred to the police and may be able to spend more time after a stroke.”
HM Long Lartin prison holds more than 500 prisoners, including the nation’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the Chief of Staff had been treated at the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, anti-violence officers were called to prison to deal with a serious uprising in which employees were attacked with bullets.

It’s rare for low-temperature storms to hit Arizona, but that’s exactly what could happen early next week when the energy surges of Hurricane Rosa in the Southwest Desert remain, following the risks of flooding.
The National Meteorological Department released scanning tracking on Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to go along a straight line through Phoenix on Tuesday, but before that on Monday night there was thunderstorms.
The National Meteorological Department of Phoenix has mentioned in a news release that only "ten tropical cyclones have formed a tropical storm or low-temperature storm within 200 miles of adding to the Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) is a storm within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest forecast models from the National Hurricane Center predict a rainfall of about 2 to 4 inches, with flooding levels separating up to 6 inches at the Mogollon Belt in Arizona.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert include central Rockies and the Greater Basin may flood from 1 to 2 inches, with separate flooding levels of up to 4 inches.
With areas that are not flooded suddenly, the rains from Hurricane Rosa can be good because the area is dehydrated.
While flooding is a deep concern, some waterfalls may still be happily welcomed because the South-Eastern region is in a state of drought.
According to weather.com, the U.S. drought watchdog said that only more than 40 percent of Arizona’s regions are experiencing the lowest extreme drought, but it is still the second highest in the same category.
First, the B<0xC3><0xA3>o Rosa road passes through leaving open land across the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa is still in the storm’s range with a maximum wind speed of 85 miles per hour, south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico 385 miles, and moving north with a speed of 12 miles per hour.
The storms hit the colder seas in the Pacific Ocean and gradually weakened.
Therefore, it is predicted that there will be a landslide in Mexico when the low-temperature rainfall passes by on Monday afternoon.
Rainfall in areas over Mexico can be significant, signaling that flooding is not likely to be minor.
According to Weather.com, “The total estimated rainfall is 3 to 6 inches from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, possibly up to 10 inches.”
Rosa will head north across Mexico as a tropical storm before arriving at the Arizona border early on Tuesday in the form of a low temperature, then scanning across Arizona and landing in southern Utah on Tuesday night.
"The main danger forecast from Rosa or its residuals is huge amounts of rainfall in Baja California, Northwestern Sonora and the Southwestern Desert of the United States," the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to cause floods and waterfalls that are life-threatening in deserts and landslides in mountainous terrain.
The Midsomer Norton Massacre: Four Suspects Intentionally Killed Have Been Arrested
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old were arrested on suspicion of murder after a 16-year-old was found to have been beaten in Somerset.
The boy was found injured at Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton at around 4am BST on Saturday morning.
You were taken to the hospital in a "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested overnight in the Radstock, Avon and Somerset areas, police said.
Officers have called on everyone if they can keep any footage related to the case, go to the emergency room.
Trump says Kavanaugh tolerates ‘the selfishness, the anger’ of the Democratic Party
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote of rejection of the Democratic Party’s ruthless and excessive tactics,” Trump said in a campaign in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Mr Kavanaugh had “suffered the selfishness and anger” of the Democratic Party throughout the course of his election.
Kavanaugh opposed Congress on Thursday, strongly and resolutely denying an allegation from Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually assaulted her decades before they were still a teenager.
Ford also testified at the hearing on her accusations.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people have witnessed Kavanaugh's excellence and quality and courage" that day.
“A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to affirm that one of the most erroneous legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a basic curriculum vitae serving the real public,” he said to a crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president mentioned the details of Brett Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke of the importance of voting for the Republican Party in the interim election.
It’s only five more weeks to go to one of the most important elections in life.
I'm not running, but I'm running," he said.
“That’s why I’m going all over the place to fight for the bright candidates.”
Trump said the Democrats wanted to “restrict and obstruct.”
"The first procedural ballot on the floor of the Senate on Kavanaugh's candidacy is expected to take place no later than Friday," a senior Republican deputy told CNN.
Hundreds of deaths from earthquakes, floods in Indonesia, damages increased
At least 384 people have been killed, many stranded as huge waves plunged into beaches, as a massive earthquake and devastation struck Indonesia’s Sulawesi island, officials said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday as waves as high as six feet (18 feet) hit the shore at dawn, sweeping homes that killed many and destroying everything on its way.
The wave followed a strong 7.5-degree earthquake.
"When the threat of a wave of gods appeared yesterday, people were still participating in their activities on the beach and did not leave immediately and they became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the National Bureau of Counter-Terrorism (BNPB) said in a statement.
“The wave did not come by itself, it dragged cars, wood, houses, scanned everything on land,” Nugroho said, adding that the wave had passed through the open sea at 800 kph (497 mph) before landing.
Some climbed trees to escape the tidal wave and survive, he said.
About 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Photographs taken from the air by the disaster agency revealed that many buildings and shops were destroyed, bridges were torn down and collapsed, and a mosque was submerged in the water.
The shockwaves continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes have been observed in an area with 2.4 million people.
Indonesia’s BPPT (Indonesia’s BPPT) pricing and technology agency said in a statement that the energy released by the strong earthquake on Friday was about 200 times the energy of the atomic bomb that fell on the city of Hiroshima during the Second World War.
The location of the city, located at the end of a long, narrow bay, may have increased the size of the wave, it said.
Nugroho described the damage as "too big" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, with an additional 540 injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said the deaths and damage could not have stopped as he walked along the coast 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala, where he was close to the epicenter of the quake.
The media was "completely exhausted with no news" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, at the same time saying that their employees and volunteers are coming to the affected areas.
“This has been a tragedy, but the tragedy can become much more terrifying,” they said.
The agency was widely condemned on Saturday for not announcing that the wave had fallen to Palu, although officials said the wave had arrived by the time the warning was issued.
In a non-specialized video posted on social media, it was possible to hear a man standing on top shouting panic for those under the road about the approaching tidal wave.
A few minutes later, a water wall flooded into the shore, scanning buildings and cars.
Reuters has not been able to confirm the film.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that disrupted the area around Palu, making it difficult for the government to coordinate rescue efforts.
Officials said the military had begun to disembark cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, but the deportees were still in desperate need of food and other basic supplies.
The city’s airport has been reopened for relief efforts and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo plans to visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The number of people killed in the Indonesian wave has increased by more than 800.
It's a very bad sex.
While World Vision employees coming from Donggala arrived safely in the city of Palu, where employees were staying in the rooftops built in the office yard, they had gone through the shattered scenery on the road, Doseba said.
“They told me that they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
It's a very bad situation.
Even as aid groups began significant moves when disaster relief tools began, some complained that high-skilled foreign aid workers had been barred from moving to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, personnel and personnel from abroad can only be started if the site of the disaster is declared as a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a provincial disaster," Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross, said in a statement.
"Once the government decides, 'Yes, this is a national disaster,' we can only be ready with international support, but there is no speech."
As the second night descends into Palu after the earthquake and the tidal wave on Friday, friends and family of those who are still missing are hoping that their loved ones will be magically mesmerizing the horror stories of the natural disaster.
On Saturday, a boy was pulled up from the pipe.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman trapped under a pile of rubble for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, Indonesia's national ice hockey coach, coached two of the missing players for the Asian Games, which was held earlier this month in Indonesia.
The others trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Ang Mandagi, were his students.
“As an ex-employee in the field of skiing, I carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon said in the hours after news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel spread in the skiing community, he was desperate to send a WhatsApp message to rivals in Palu, who are attending the beach festival.
However, his message indicated that there was a gray tint instead of two blue tints.
“I think that means the messages weren’t sent,” he said.
The robbers took $26,750 when the ATM was loaded at Newport in Levee.
According to reports from the Newport Police Department, the burglars took $26,750 from a bank employee Brink when they were depositing money at an ATM in Newport, Leveee.
The driver on the car cleaned up the ATM in the entertainment area and prepared for extra money, Detective Dennis McCarthy reported in the article.
When he was busy, a man "came in from behind the Brink employee" and took the purse had to be delivered.
According to the report, witnesses saw many suspects on the scene, but police have not yet determined the exact number of people involved in the case.
Anyone who has any information about the identity of the suspected suspect, please contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
He wrote in a tweet on Saturday: "Before that, people still knew me was Kanye West."
West, 41, has set the name Ye for a while and uses this name as the eighth album to be released in June.
The change took place before he appeared on Saturday Night Live, when he was expected to release a new album Yandhi.
He was a guest on the show for Dr. Ariana Grande when she announced her "emotional disorder," the show's creator said.
As well as the abbreviation in his current art, West has previously said this word has religious meaning for him.
"I believe that 'yes' is the most commonly used word in the Bible and in the Bible this word means 'you'," West shared earlier this year, as he was talking about his album title with Big Boy radio.
“So I am a friend, I am us, it is us.
The transformation goes from Kanye, meaning the only one, to Ye – a reflection of good, evil, regression, everything.
The album is more than our own reflection.
You're one of the famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs is widely known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he said he was targeting Love and Brother Love.
An artist who collaborated with West, JAY-Z, was also worried about having or not having a horizontal tile and writing flowers.
Mexico's President Says He Won't Put Military Against Civilians
President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has announced he will never use military force against civilians as the country celebrates the 50th anniversary of the bloody retaliation of students.
Lopez Obrador pledged on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square that "never bring an army of oppressors to the Mexican people."
The military fired in a demonstration for peace in the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people as left-wing student movements were taking root across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has vowed to support Mexican youth by providing monthly grants to students and opening up free public universities.
He shared that the problem of unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities had led young people to become attached to disadvantages.
The U.S. should double its A.I. aid.
As China becomes more active in the artificial intelligence sector, the U.S. should double the amount spent on research in the field, investors and practitioners of AI Kai-Fu Lee, who once worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple, shared.
Opinions were made after various departments of the U.S. government issued notices on AI, even while the entire U.S. side is lacking an official AI strategy.
China, meanwhile, introduced its plan last year: the country’s goal to become a leader in AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubling AI research budgets will be a positive start, as all other countries are falling far behind the United States, and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
Doubling the cost could double the chances that the next huge AI achievement will be made in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, author of the book “Super Strengthening Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, has invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked at an AI system that beats top-ranked Othello players in the U.S., then he was chief executive officer at Microsoft Research and chief executive officer of Google's branch in China.
Lee approached previous U.S. government technology competitions such as the Advanced Project Research Agency’s Machine Test and was interested in when the next competition would take place, in order to help determine the next vision.
Researchers in the United States often have to make an extreme effort to get government support, Lee said.
“It’s not China that’s calling for all scholars to take the lead; it’s corporations,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired bright stars from universities to work on AI in recent years.
Lee shared the changes in immigration policy that could also help the U.S. strengthen its efforts on AI.
He added: “I think the green card should be automatically issued to the Doctors of AI.”
The Chinese Ministry of Interior issued the next-generation Human-Creating Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
Lee added: China’s National Science Foundation provides support to those who belong to academic institutions in the same way that the Foundation and other government institutions donate funds to U.S. researchers, but the quality of research in China is lower.
Earlier this year, in the United States, the Department of Homeland Security established a Center for the Association of Humanities, with the aim of intervening with partners from industry and education, and the White House announced the establishment of the Committee on the Selection of Artificial Intelligence.
This month, the Defense Research Projects Directorate announced a $2 billion investment in a project called AI Next.
At the National Science Foundation, they are currently investing more than $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. law has sought to establish a National Security Council on Human Intelligence but has not seen any move for months.
Macedonians voted in the referendum on renaming the country
Macedonians have voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether or not to change the name to “North Macedonia,” a decades-long dispute settlement move with Greece aimed at preventing NATO and the European Union from joining.
Greece, which has a province of Macedonia, asserts that the name of its northern neighbour corresponds to its own territory and has ruled out NATO and EU membership.
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but opponents of nationalism said the change would weaken the ethnic identity of the majority of the Slavs in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov declared that he would not vote in the referendum and a campaign of clearance raised doubts as to whether voters met at least 50% of the demands for the validity of the referendum.
The question on the ballot included the content: “You agree to become a member of NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece.”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, said it was a price to pay to pursue the accession of institutions such as the EU and NATO of Macedonia, one of the countries emerging from the collapse of the Republic of Azerbaijan.
Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje, said: "Today I come to vote for the future of the country, for the young people in Macedonia so that they can freely enjoy the protection of the European Union because it leads to a safer life for all of us."
Although members of parliament are not legally bound, they have said they will comply with the result of the vote to make a decision.
The change of name will require two-thirds of the vote in parliament.
The National Electoral Commission said there were no reports of any irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, the voter turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% in last year’s parliamentary election when 66% of voters registered to vote.
Voter Gjose Tanevski, 62, in the capital Skopje, said: “I go to vote for my children, because our position is in Europe.”
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in a referendum in Macedonia to change the country’s name, which will pave the way for NATO and European Union membership in Strumica, Macedonia on September 30, 2018.
Before the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small stool and pulling the chair in front of the tent set up by those who would sweep the referendum.
Kavadarkov said: “We support NATO and the EU, but we want to engage in a main way, not through the back door.”
“We are a poor country, but poor to clean.
If they don’t see us as Macedonia, then we can move to other countries like China and Russia and become part of the Asian-European alliance.”
Prime Minister Zaev said that as a NATO member, it would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
"I believe that the majority will agree because more than 80 percent of us support the EU and NATO," Zaev said after the vote.
He shared that a "no deal" result would be "confirmation for our future."
A poll published Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Studies said about 30 to 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum - lower than the obligatory level of voting.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonia’s Telma TV, said 57 percent of the people asked were planning to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they made a deal.
A successful referendum must have a vote rate of 50 per cent and one vote.
The failure of the referendum shows the first serious blow to the Western self-government’s policy since it took place in May last year.
Sergio Aguero at Manchester City has breached all of Brighton's defensive line to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke Brighton's defensive line with Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero is on par with a score in the 65th minute.
The Argentine precursor received the line from the middle of the field when the ball started to lead.
He jumped up in front of the three Brighton defenders before throwing up around the empty yard.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four blue shirt players.
He jumped up a defender before blocking other opponents at the edge of the frame in Brighton.
The line to the left, leading the ball straight to Sterling.
The Englishman led his first touchdown in the ban to Aguero, who kicked his right foot with a shot to knock down Brighton's city captain Mathew Ryan from the right side of the net.
Coach Pep Guardiola told reporters: "Aguero has had some injuries to his leg."
“We’re talking about just letting him play for about 55, 60 minutes.
It's happened.
We were very lucky to have him score at the time.”
But it was Sterling who brought the first advantage to the Blues players in the match at the British Open."
You scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero took the ball deep into Brighton's wing in the match.
He took an extreme ball to the left side of the field to Leroy Sane.

Scherzer wants to burn himself up against the Rockies.
With the Nationals being eliminated from the final round of ticketing, there’s not much reason to start over.
But a fight-hardened Scherzer hopes to win the game on Sunday with the Colorado Rockies, but this only makes sense when there is a round of competition for the Rockies, the team leading ahead of a game with the Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
The Rockies won at least one special performance with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still looking to secure the top scorer.
“Although playing is meaningless, at least we were kicked when we learned about the atmosphere in Denver together with the crowd and the other teams will play with any top styling I can match this year.
Why don’t I want to play in a game like that?
The Nationals have not yet announced the opening game for Sunday, but it looks like Scherzer will be shot in this situation.
Scherzer, his 34th starter, will have a practice throwing the ball on Thursday and playing on his Sunday break.
Washington's right-hand side scored 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 of this season's matches.
Trump's campaign in West Virginia
The president mentioned the details of the situation around his Supreme Court, selecting Brett Kavanaugh when speaking of the importance of voting for the Republican Party in the interim election.
“Everything we’ve done has had potential in November.
It’s only five more weeks to go to one of the most important elections in life.
“This is one of the big, big things – no contests, but executives are the reason why I go everywhere to fight for the bright candidates.”
Trump went on to say, “You’re going to see the negative, negative Democratic Party that’s in place right now.
And they're determined to suppress the rule of law by using any chapter, and then you'll see selfishness, chapter.
They don’t care who hurts, they have to step up to gain power and control, they just want power and control, and we won’t give it to them.”
He added, "Democrats are wanting to "restrict and hinder."
"You've seen that for the past four days." He added and suggested that the Democratic Party is "angrily and selfish and chapters and lies."
He pointed out that the Senate Judiciary Committee had identified Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which had hit the bullying from the bottom.
“Do you remember her answer, sir?
Do you have to disclose information?
What's up.
No, no, no, I'm looking -- that's not an excellent body language -- that's rightly the weakest body language I've ever seen.
The Labour Party is no longer an open party.
Making an opinion is an unacceptable thing.
I’m not surprised when Momentum’s activists, in my local party, voted to check me out.
After all, I am the latest in a series of Labour MPs who have been announced that I am not welcome — because I have made an opinion.
As a member of parliament with me, Joan Ryan also received the same treatment because she was determined to support anti-racism.
In my case, the screening move was aimed at me for not being in agreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
With regard to the importance of a large-scale economic policy, on national security, in Europe, the same unsettling issues that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement to the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday stated that "we want meetings to be meaningful and effective."
For nearly eight years as MP for the local Labour Party, Friday night’s Leaders’ meetings took place in such a way.
Sadly, today, that’s not the tone in many meetings and the promise of “better, softer” politics that has long been forgotten and actually whether that’s ever started.”
It is becoming increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that all opinions are judged on whether the party leaders are acceptable or not.
This started right after Jeremy became the leader, because my colleagues in the past thought that the political perspective with me had begun to expect me to change my mind and take positions that I would never accept — whether in terms of national security or the EU market.
Whenever I make a public statement — and really whatever I say — to follow the abuses on social media calls for elimination, the central political charges, tell me that I should not join the Labour Party.
And not only do I see it that way.
In fact, I know I’m more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments that seem to me are politically biased.
I am surprised by the professionalism and determination of my colleagues, who are faced with a flow that leads to abuse of sex or racial discrimination every day but is never avoided.
One of the saddest aspects of this political era is that the level of abuse has become normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn announced last week that the Labour Party should embrace a culture of tolerance.
The fact that we are no longer that wide open Party and with every “distrust” move or change in the rule of choice, the Party has become narrower.
I’ve had a lot of advice over the last two years about encouraging me to stay calm, not to say too many words, and then I’ll be “okay”.
But that’s not why I’m involved in politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years before I was just a boy, I have been driven by the Thatcher government’s misguidance, which has literally brought down my entire school, I’ve sought to bring better public services to those who need them — whether it’s a commissioner.
I’ve never hidden my political views, even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East can be misunderstood about my political positions and my disagreements with the current leadership.
For those who have been pushing the move on Friday, all I want to share is when the country gets stuck in Brexit, it will hurt our families, businesses and our public services, I don’t want to waste my time and energy on it.
But actually, a message outside of Nottingham Momentum that I watch over, sent to my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to be served and I promise that I will not be intimidated by any threats I may pose to you or any political means.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr invincible lead
The following two attempts may have misjudged the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this prestigious Tennent Premiership match of the day.
Now they are at the head of the table, the only infected king in the ten teams.
In other words, it’s also their super-class self-defense, as well as much as a better chance for them, bringing home team name and coach Peter Murchie fully entitled to be satisfied.
He said: "Until now, we've gone through our games so far and we're still unbeaten, so I'm satisfied."
Melrose's Robyn Christie said: "Accepting Ayr, they're taking better chances than us."
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute goal, scored by Frazier Climo, led by Ayr, but, a yellow card for Scotland captain Rory Hughes, opened the game for the Warriors, allowing Melrose to show his hand and Jason Baggot to make a touchdown.
Climo advanced ahead of Ayr with a penalty kick, before, just in the first half, he then scored an extra point with a solo phase raising the score to 17-5 for Ayr before the break.
But Melrose started the two in a favorable way and Patrick Anderson scored, Baggot scoring extra points, shortening the percentage to five points.
After a long period of serious injury to Ruairidh Knott, who was depressed, and since rebooting, Ayr has led the lead thanks to Stafford McDowall's promotion, Climo scoring additional points.
Ayr's captain Blair Macpherson was then on the yellow card, and once again, Melrose made the top scorer by a touchdown not scoring Bruce Colvine's top scorer, in the face of a strained pressure.
However, the home team was back, and when Struan Hutchinson got a gold card for Climo without a ball, from the temple penalty line, MacPherson scored on Ayr's support advantage.
Climo scored more points, as he had done almost since relegation, after Kyle Rowe received a shot from David Armstrong and passed to wingman Gregor Henry after scoring the host's fifth.

‘The coast is ours’: Bolivia’s unarmed nation hopes the court will reopen its way to the Pacific
The sailors inspected a naval base in La Paz.
The public buildings all hung the blue flags of the sea.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon were all painted with the slogan: “The sea is our right.
“Getting back to the sea is our job.”
All the corners of Bolivia, the memory of a coast lost to Chile in the bloody 19th-century conflict of resources, remain alive – as well as the desire to be sailed out into the Pacific once again.
Those hopes are perhaps the most burning in decades, as Bolivia is awaiting a judgement by the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five considerations.
Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat, said: "Bolivia is motivated, united and calm, and of course expects in a positive outlook on the results."
Many Bolivians will follow the ICJ’s ruling on big screens across the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will back Bolivia’s claim that – decades after tense exchanges – Chile has a duty to negotiate for Bolivia.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s most convincing prime minister, is facing a fierce debate for re-election next year — there are plenty of votes in Monday’s ruling.
At the end of August, he resolutely said, “We are about to return to the Pacific Ocean.”
But some analysts argue that the court is not likely to decide in favor of Bolivia — and this is unlikely to change.
The Netherlands-based UN has no right to return territory to Chile and has stipulated that they will not determine the outcome of potential exchanges.
The ICJ’s ruling came just six months after the final debates revealed the situation was “not complicated,” Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean international law expert, said.
And even further, Bolivia’s lawsuit, the past four years, could be reversed.
Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said: "The problem of approach to the sea has been attacked by the current Bolivian government."
She added that Morales's declarations of war had turned off all Chile's remaining goodwill.
At some point, Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate with each other, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the view that the court’s decision was quickly unusual.
Monday will give Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era with relations with Chile" and an opportunity to end 139 years of mutual disinterest," he said.
Calzadilla also denies that Morales — still one of the most famous presidents in Latin America — is using the maritime issue as a political lifeline.
Bolivia added: “Bolivia will never give up the right to access the Pacific.”
“Judgement is an opportunity to see that we need to go through the past.”
North Korea says there will never be a nuclear disarmament unless it can be trusted by the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has revealed that his country will never disarm nuclear weapons unless they can trust Washington in advance.
Ri made a speech on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to deliver on the promises made at the Singapore summit between the leaders of the two sides.
He made comments as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared to be preparing to restart nuclear foreign policy more than three months after a meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was a "mythical dream" to continue U.S. sanctions and objections to the declaration of the end of the Korean War to make North Korea subjugated.
Washington is cautiously agreeing to a declaration without Pyongyang taking noteworthy steps to withdraw arms first.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump are looking forward to a second summit.
But there is little doubt that Pyongyang is very serious about abandoning a stockpile of weapons that the country can see as the only way to ensure security.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Fashion Paris launches the latest line of wide-brimmed hats on the big streets near you.
If you want to get comfortable with your hat collection or completely avoid the sunshine, you don’t have to go far.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveil a range of other extraordinarily large-sized team designs in their SS19 collection on the ice that will spark the design style at the Paris Fashion Week.
The high-end hats have been scanning Instagram this summer and the designers mentioned above have brought their eye-catching creations to the stage.
Valentino’s standout item is a beige hat with oversized rims fitted with feather-like accessories, covered on the model’s head.
Other oversized accessories include seasonal peaches, witch hats, and even an apricot — but they’re not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a series of monstrous masks – either in time for Halloween.
Many of the special masks are embroidered in the same style as Hannibal Lecter rather than high-end fashion.
One design is like a complete marine diving device with a breather tube and protective glasses, while another device looks like a melting bucket of ice cream.
And if you keep catching up with the huge fashion trend – then you’re in luck.
Graveyards predict that large-sized earbuds may be able to cover waves across the big streets near you.
The large hats became hot on the heels of the ‘La Bomba’ shoe, the hat that Rihanna used for Emily Ratajkowski with a few rims wide.
The gravemark behind the extremely impractical hat that was launched across social media has brought another big innovation to the show floor – a big bag that goes to the beach close by with a bathing suit.
The fiery orange raffia yarn bag, lined with raffia yarn with white leather handles, is a highlight in Jacquemus’ La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous model maker Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: ‘I expect to see large-sized hats and seabags flooded on the big streets next summer – because the designer has made a huge impact that can hardly ignore the demands.
John Edward: Foreign Language Skills Are Essential to Global Citizens
Private schools in Scotland still maintain their excellent academic stance, this event continued in 2018 with a string of commendable learning outcomes, reinforced by both individuals and collectively in terms of sport, art, music and community activities.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, sponsored by the Scottish Private School Association (SCIS), are striving to bring the best quality of service to students and parents.
Independent schools are geared towards equipping students with deep and broad knowledge, as well as orienting their students’ careers and positions as global citizens.
As a branch of education that can design and run the school’s specific teaching program, we see modern foreign languages continue to be a popular and chosen topic in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you talk to someone in a language he understands, the things he says will go into his mind.
If you talk to him in his own language, what he says will go into his feelings.”
This is a convincing message that we don’t just rely on English when we want to establish relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From recent exams this year, we can see that foreign languages are at the top of the rankings with the best passing scores in private schools.
A total of 68 percent of foreign-language biologists have achieved higher scores than A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students scored more than A in Chinese, in addition to 72 percent learning German, 69 percent learning French, and 63 percent learning Spanish also scored A.
This shows that private schools in Scotland are moving in the direction of seeing foreign language as essential skills that children and adolescents will not be able to have in the future.
Selective foreign language courses are being considered as STEM majors (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in private school curricula as well as in other places.
A 2014 survey conducted by the British Council on Engineering and Crafts shows that for reasons that employers have difficulty finding people, it is due to a lack of foreign language skills.
As a result, more and more foreign language skills become more practical in order to equip young people to enter career paths in the future.
With more and more opportunities for career prospects in need of foreign language, these skills become practical in an increasingly flat world.
No matter how people choose to work, if they learn a second foreign language, they will get a real advantage in the future when they have such a lifelong skill.
Being able to communicate directly in their native language, a multilingual person will obviously lead the way for every challenge.
According to a YouGov survey of 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent of them were unable to practice a simple session in another foreign language, and only French was the only foreign language with a percentage of a single number, 15 percent.
That’s why investing in foreign language teaching is essential for today’s children.
Holding in the hands of multilinguals, especially the languages of developing economies, will equip children with the brighter potential in finding a real job.
In Scotland, each school teaches different foreign languages.
Some schools will focus on more modern foreign languages, while others will teach foreign languages that are deemed important to the UK in the 2020 outlook, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever the child likes, there are also a variety of foreign languages to choose from within the range of private schools, along with a team of teachers who specialize in the profession.
Private schools in Scotland focus on providing an academic environment that prepares and equips children with the essential skills for success, no matter what the future holds.
It cannot be denied that, in an international business environment, foreign language will continue to be an extremely important factor for the future of the country, this should be replicated in education.
In fact, modern foreign languages should be assessed as “international communication skills.”
Private schools will continue to offer this opportunity to young people in Scotland: diversified and exported.
There can be no other choice.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Secret School Council.
LeBron made his debut at the Lakers last Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is coming to an end for fans looking forward to seeing LeBron James play the lead for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in a preseason game with the Denver Nuggets on Sunday in San Diego.
But it’s not yet clear how long he’ll be in the game.
Walton said on Lakers' official website: "It will only be in less than 48 minutes."
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said it was likely that James would be in the game for a limited time.
Following the practice this week, James was asked about plans for the six-game preseason schedule at the Lakers.
He said: “I don’t need to play a few start-up games before the season at this stage in my career anymore.”
TT. Trump’s campaign campaign in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
Tonight, in Wheeling, West Virginia, President Donald Trump began his campaign campaign.
This is the first stop on Trump’s five-year campaign trail next week, including stops in support states such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the standard vote for the candidate he nominated for the vacant Supreme Court seat being delayed, President Trump is trying to vote in favor of the vote ahead of the coming midterm elections, when the Republican Party is in the forefront.
TT. Trump’s campaign in West Virginia starts at what time tonight and how can you watch it online?
TT. Trump’s campaign in Wheeling, West Virginia is expected to begin at 7 p.m. Eastern Time on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch TT. Trump’s campaign in West Virginia live on YouTube.
President Trump will likely refer to this week's hearing of Brett Kavanaugh - the Supreme Court nominee - who is currently facing allegations of sexual assault and the Senate's vote of approval has to postpone a week for the FBI to prosecute.
However, the main purpose of these mass campaigns is to draw back the support of the Republican candidates before the election in November. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Therefore, according to Reuters, the campaign’s goal is through 05 campaigns next week to “strengthen the volunteers and supporters of the Republican Party in the race to defend and expand the majority of the votes they hold in the Senate and the House.”
"Congress control vessels are an important issue in the agenda, so the president will visit as many states as possible before entering the busy election season," a campaign spokesman for TT. Trump said he wished to be concealed from Reuters.
Planned to take place at Wesbanco Stadium, Wheeling City, the campaign tonight could attract supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania, while also attracting Pittsburgh media to report,” West Virginia Metro News reported.
Saturday will be Trump’s second visit last month to West Virginia, the state in which he won a 40 percent victory in 2016.
Trump is trying to support Patrick Morrisey, the Republican nominee for the West Virginia U.S. Senator, as he is currently behind in the polls.
According to Reuters, Simon Haeder, a political science researcher at the University of West Virginia, said: “The president’s having to visit the state to fight back in the vote for candidates is not a good sign with Morrisey.”
2018 Ryder Cup: The U.S. team expresses its determination to keep the cup in singles on Sunday
After three unbalanced games, a dual game on Saturday afternoon may be necessary for the Ryder Cup.
Turning your wrists in the form of a shaker to create a rock is an entirely new sporting concept, but it’s also an impetus that athletes truly believe in, especially in games like this.
Where is the current motivator?
“They’ve led ahead of 6 points, flying only 4 hours left, and I think that’s motivation for us,” Jordan Spieth said on a relaxing walk.
Of course, the European team has an advantage, ahead of 4 points, and they have 12 more games.
As Spieth says, the U.S. team still has little hope and they are very encouraged, especially with the pairs of Spieth and Justin Thomas. These two players have played many times and each have three points.
Spieth is a former golfer in bowling from the starting position to the hole and he always leads as a mirror.
The shouts of joy were growing as he reached his play, especially kicking the ball to unleash the match when he and Thomas in turn slammed the ball into the hole.
The goalkeeper who won the match on the 15th was also the same, meaning that he had full confidence in the U.S. team’s rebound.
Spieth said, “You have to think very carefully and worry about your own game.”
All of the athletes have left.
There are 18 holes left to score.
In the past two days, only Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, an undeniable legend of the Ryder Cup, have been the only pair to score higher than Spieth and Thomas.
This bizarre but remarkable pair of the European team have won 4-0 and can’t make any mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only pair not to hit the bogey on Saturday afternoons, but also avoided being bogeyed on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons and the next nine holes on Friday mornings.
That victory and the source of energy from them spread to the crowd of enthusiastic fans that gave people the feeling that the two of them were the rivals they needed to beat on Sunday; and no other golfer deserved more than Fleetwood or Molinari in the National Squadron to defend the victory of my team.
I hope that both of them appear at the same time in different gong holes.
However, it’s still too early to confirm the European team’s victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson defeated Sergio Garcia, the hero of the fourball series in the morning, when they played a pair with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles in the first nine holes have caused the Spanish and Swedish players to completely lose their chances of retaliation.
On Sunday, no one was able to pull them out of that failure.
The fourball and foursome games are always the most worth seeing because of the interaction between the pairs, their advice and the observation of the playing strategy changes only in the puzzle.
The European team played better and led well ahead of the last match day, but this series of foursomes showed that the American team still had a perfect chance of winning.
The European team lead 10-6 before the start of the final day of the Ryder Cup.
The European team will take advantage of the Ryder Cup’s final matchday after a spectacular fourball and foursome series, ahead of the U.S. team 10-6.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the lead with two Tiger Woods wins to earn an additional 4 points at Le Golf National.
European side Thomas Bjorn, determined to win the cup again to lose to your team at Hazeltine two years ago, won the U.S. side in the morning fourball match, leading 3-1.
The American team competed rather in a series of foursomes, winning two games, but could not win the final victory.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points in a single-game series on Sunday to win the cup again.
Fleetwood was the first European player to win four points in a row when he and Molinari, often referred to as the "Molliwood" pair, were the second pair after the tragic weekends that earned four points in four opener games in history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourball game, they had an even more convincing victory over Woods and U.S. rookie Bryson Dechambeau with a score of 5–4.
Woods played two games on Saturday and sometimes had moments of light, but so far, he has lost 19/29 games in the fourball and foursome series, including 7 consecutive losses.
Justin Rose, after resting in the morning fourball series, returned to Henrik Stenson in the foursome, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, two players who are ranked 1st and 3rd in the world, with a score of 2&1.
However, even though the south-western weather in Paris is extremely pleasant, the European team has never had an easy match day.
The once-biggest three-time Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set an important milestone for the U.S. team with two points on Saturday.
They won convincing 2&1 against Spanish goalkeepers Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourball, and then went on to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy with a 4&3 in the foursome, despite missing the first 2 losses.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, only twice a team led in front of the four points could start the singles matches, however, the Furyk team has only been able to hold the cup.
After only being considered second in two days, Sunday is likely to be a setback for the team.
North Korea declares 'no life' to disarm unilaterally when it lacks confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday, saying sanctions were still being maintained increasingly deepening their suspicions about the United States and, in this situation, no country has ever unilaterally given up arms.
Ri Yong Ho, speaking at the annual meeting of the United Nations General Assembly, said North Korea had implemented “many goodwill measures” over the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear and nuclear test bases.
"However, we don't see the same move from the United States," he said.
“If we can’t trust the U.S. side, we won’t be able to confidently ensure national security, and in such a situation, we will never be able to unilaterally disarm first.”
Although Mr Ri reiterated North Korea’s well-known complaint that Washington refused to withdraw nuclear weapons “at every stage” and that North Korea would receive a corresponding benefit from the reciprocal action, this time his speech had a point.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a current U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, in which he said in a statement that he "committed his efforts to the
North Korea is still trying to find a way to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the U.S. insists that Pyongyang should give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington is also opposed to calls for the easing of the international sanctions that have already been imposed on Korea.
"The U.S. insists on "preliminary nuclear disarmament" and increased pressure by sanctions to achieve its purpose in a coercive manner, even opposing the "statement of the end of the war," Ri said.
“When it comes to the idea that the sanctions could make us kneel down to submission, it’s just a dream of the path of those who don’t understand anything about us.
But the problem here is that the sanctions that are still sustaining these continue to discredit us.”
Ri did not mention the plan to hold a second summit between President Kim and President Trump as the U.S. leader presented at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the foreign minister referred to three meetings between President Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: “If the negotiating side is to dismantle the issue of nuclear disarmament, it is not the United States, it is not Korea.”
However, Ri’s voice was quite different from last year, when he told the General Assembly that North Korea’s launch of missiles into the U.S. mainland was inevitable in a psychic mission after the “Evil President” Trump called him “Kim.”
Last year at the U.N., Trump threatened to “destroy” North Korea, but this year he praised Kim for taking the courage to take steps to disarm, but he also underlined that there is a lot to be done, and that there is a lot to be done.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not set a deadline for this: "Two years, three years or just five months are not a problem either."
China and Russia believe that the United Nations Security Council should reward Pyongyang for their efforts, the report said.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the United Nations Security Council on Thursday: “The Security Council’s sanctions must continue to be enforced vigorously and uncompromisingly until we can confirm the inhumane outcome.”
The Security Council has agreed to tighten sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in order to curb funding for Pyongyang’s ballistic missile and nuclear missile programs.
Pompeo spoke to Foreign Minister Ri on the sidelines of the official meetings of the United Nations General Assembly and said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the end result of the visit is not very interesting.
He left Pyongyang after a visit in July and said the talks had made some progress, but just hours later, North Korea accused the foreign minister of making "black-society-like demands."
North Korea has pledged to attend a meeting with South Korean President Moon Jae-In this month to dismantle a missile test base and a nuclear complex if the United States has “similar moves.”
He said President Kim directed that the "similar move" he was looking for was the security assurance that Trump pledged in the talks in Singapore and progressed toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard Students Attend Full Rest Courses <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
In an effort to counter machine pressure learning culture, with 'night students' drinking coffee instead of water, a new course at Harvard University this year has encouraged all university students to sleep more.
Students who study at the number one university in the world often don’t know the basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard University, is an expert at the Women’s Hospital and Brigham is the one who designed the course and he himself believes it is the first course of its kind in the United States.
The feeling of starting this course came after he attended a talk session about the impact of sleep deprivation on the learning process.
'After the end of the talk, a student came to me and said, 'Why do you know this at the end of the year?'
She said no one told her about the importance of sleep, which really surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course was introduced for the first time this year, explaining to students the importance of good sleep habits that help improve learning and sports outcomes, as well as how to improve your overall health.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychology at Harvard Medical University and the university’s executive director of medical services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering students who were seriously sleep deprived during the week.
The one-hour course consists of a range of interactive assignments.
In part there is a picture of the dorm room, where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, workout machines and books to learn about the effects of caffeine, light and sleep deprivation affect the performance of any kind of sports workout.
In another part, participants who studied long-term sleep deprivation could increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
Then, the university campus map, with interactive symbols, encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
“We know that this course cannot immediately change the behavior of the students.
But we believe that you have the right to know - just as you have the right to know the impact on health when choosing to smoke," Professor Czeisler added.
He said: “Proud culture of ‘night strike students’ still exists, while modern technologies and increasing pressure on students leading to a state of sleep deprivation are an increasingly serious problem.
Ensuring enough sleep, good sleep quality should become a student’s ‘secret weapon’ to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety – even to avoid weight gain, because lack of sleep causes the brain to fall into a state of starvation.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student studying biology, chemistry, and physics, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, and he also attended one of last year’s classes in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course helped him ‘open his eyes’ and inspired him to try to call for a school-wide course to be held.
He hoped that the next step would be to offer all postgraduate students to participate in a similar study program before starting to compete in the main course.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students consider setting an alarm at bedtime, wake-up hours, and at the same time need to be aware of the harmful ‘blue light’ emitted by electronic screens and LEDs, which can cause your rhythm disorder, leading to discomfort.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga defeats Gerrard's boys
The Rangers had an unsuccessful match day when Dolly Menga's rematch led Steven Gerrard's team to a 1-0 defeat to Livingston.
Ibrox hopes to score their first win since a 4-1 win at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second loss in 18 games as a midfielder with a Premiership coach, pulling back.
Menga maintained the attack position seven minutes before the end of the 1st round, but the Rangers' air conditioner seemed never to have been crushed.
The Rangers have now fallen to sixth place, while Livingston has climbed to third place, and only after Hibernian on goal difference.
And the Rangers had to deal with another problem after referee Calum Spence had to treat the head wound after a clear object was thrown from the head of the patio.
Gerrard has changed the squad eight times compared to the team that passed Ayr to enter the Betfred Cup semifinals.
On the other hand, Holt retained the Livi 11 and scored a point ahead of the Hearts team last week and he must have been extremely happy with the way his students beat the opponents in each attack.
Although the Rangers hold the ball more, Livingston is the only team that actually poses danger when there is a ball.
They should have scored just two minutes after Menga first kicked Scott Pittman into the pitch, attacking Allan McGregor's midfielder but the defender missed this opportunity.
A deep kick by Keaghan Jacobs brought the ball to Captain Craig Halkett's leg, but defender Alan Lithgow could only take the ball out of the back of the frame.
The Rangers take control of the ball on the pitch, but their gameplay is mainly based on hope rather than trust, especially in 1/3 of the final time of the match.
Alfredo Morelos is certain that he must be fined on the temple penalty because he and Steven Lawless had a collision but referee Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian player's claim.
The Rangers only scored twice in the first round, but former Ibrox forward Liam Kelly barely had a hard time with Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's rematch.
Although Livi's opening in the 34th minute was thought to be an advantage, no one can deny that their win is entirely worth it.
Once again, the Rangers couldn't handle Jacobs' deep edge shot.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher kicked the ball for Scott Robinson, and Scott calmly chose Menga to make a simple knockout.
Gerrard immediately had an option during the break, by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the replacement of this person almost immediately had an impact when the runner kicked the ball for Morelos but Kelly was impressed when he immediately blocked the ball.
But Livingston was successful in luring the team to the right course of play they wanted, as Lithgow and Halkett continually launched long lines.
Holt's team had a chance to lead ahead in the final minutes of the match, but unfortunately McGregor chose the right spot to stop Jacobs before Lithgow slammed his head from the corner.
The new player at the Rangers' Glenn Middleton field continued to complain of a temple penalty after clashing with the Jacobs, but was once again denied by referee Thomson.
Juvenile: Inventor of the Geiger Counter
From a page from the "Sunday Sunday" Juvenile: On September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radiation, inventing the foundation for a device called the Geiger Counter.
Since then, the Geiger Counting Department has not only become a scientific pillar, but also a pillar of popular culture. For example, the following is a talk piece in the film "Bells of Coronado", screened in 1950, with the participation of the scientist Ele and Rog<0xC3><0xA8>re Rog<0xC3><0xA8>s.
The man said, "What is this?"
Rogers: "This is the Geiger Counter, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these earbuds in, the sentence can actually hear the impact of the atoms emitted by radiation in the mineral.”
Evans: “Yes, there’s a sneeze going on here!”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days after his 63rd birthday.
However, the invention of his name remains with time to come.
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach Your Immune System How to ‘Search’ Your Corrupted Cells
New Cancer Vaccines Can Teach Your Immune System How To ‘Search’ Damaged Cells And Destroy Them
Vaccine teaches the immune system how to recognize damaged cells during treatment.
This method includes taking the immune cells from the patient, changing the cells in the laboratory.
These cells can then ‘see’ the proteins that are common in many cancers and are re-injected into the body.
A type of test vaccine is giving tangible results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who was treated with the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize damaged cells and her ovarian cancer cells disappear after more than 18 months.
This method includes taking immune cells from patients, changing cells in the laboratory, so that these cells can "see" the proteins common in many cancers, called HER2, and then the cells are injected back into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our research results show that we are in the hands of a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "promotes the development of several types of cancer", including breast, ovarian, lung and rectum cancer, Professor Berzofsky explains.
A similar research method, taking immune cells from the patient’s body and “teaching” them how to target the destruction of cancer cells, has once had an effect in the course of treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye receives many "stones" as he expresses his mad support for TT. Trump, the MAGA (Make America Great Again) band after Saturday Live Music Night (SNL)
It's not all right.
Kanye West received numerous vocals in the recording room throughout SNL Music Night, following his popular performance. During the performance, he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and confirmed that he would run for office in 2020.
After performing the third song, Ghost Town, still wearing the Make America Great Again hat, he was furiously protesting the Democratic Party and asserting his support for TT.Trump.
“A lot of times I talk to white friends, they say, ‘Why do you like Trump, he’s a racist?’
“If I’m worried about racial discrimination, I’ve been leaving America for a long time,” he said.
SNL began the show with a product featuring Matt Damon. In the product, the Hollywood star mocks Brett Kavanaugh's swearing-in to the Senate Judiciary Committee on allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the show wasn’t broadcast, the film recorded West’s angry remarks that comedian Chris Rock was posted on social media.
It’s not clear whether Rock intentionally made West laugh at this post.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he was uncomfortable being behind the chicken wing just because of his hat.
“They bullied me in the backyard.
They said, 'Don't go on the show with that hat.'
They've bullied me!
Then they said I was raped,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on: "Do you know what mud is like?", he asserted that he would "set up my hero's iconic hat, because no one can force me to do anything. If you want the world to move forward?
Let's love."
Variety reported: “His speech made the audience at least twice angry, and members of the SNL turned out to be confused, one person shared: “The entire recording room was silent.”
West was chosen to replace singer Ariana Grande, as her boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West made many savages carry with the performance of the song I Love it, in a dress like a Bottle Perrier.
West received the support of the head of the TPUSA conservative group, Candace Turner. He once posted on Twitter: "Giving one of the bravest hearts: THE HIGHEST TIME."
But the show's host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply "acting by his nature, and this is really great."
"But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying music products or clothing, or supporting his 'art') because I believe that person is chasing and spreading bad morals to my community.
He has the right to freedom.
We do too,” she added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, officially "named Kanye West."
He was not the first artist to change his name, but only to follow the path of Diddy, formerly known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg previously named Snoop Lion; or the music legend Prince, also changed his name to an icon and later changed his name to another artist to Prince.

Star Film Game Kingdom Angry Criticism of Toxic Masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as the swordman Jon Snow in the medieval fantasy television series, Kingdom Games.
But the 31-year-old actor is quite angry with this heroine’s prototype and mentions that the male characters on screen like this will make young men feel strong and respectable.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture reporter, Kit said he believed there was "something wrong here" and asked how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit is newly married to you in Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, 31 years old. He admits to himself feeling 'very necessary' to solve this problem.
“At this point, I personally feel I don’t know what we’ve done wrong with what’s called masculinity,” he said.
“What did we teach men when we were grown up about the problems that were before our eyes?”
Kit believes that television may also be partly responsible for the increasing toxicity of males due to the extremely masculine characters they build.
He continued, “What are the characteristics of birth and what are the characteristics of education?
What is taught on TV and off the road that makes boys feel like they have to become male models?
I think this is really a problem solving this era – how do we change?
Because it’s clear that there’s been something irrational with our young guys.”
During the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in any further prequels or extra-narratives about the Game of Thrones, after the series ended next summer, while asserting that he was “dead on the battlefield and the plot.”
From November, Kit will play the lead role in Sam Shepard's remake of True West, which tells the story of a filmmaker and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his wife, Rose, was the most wonderful thing when he decided to stop playing the Game of Thrones.
“I’ve met my wife in this series, that’s where my future family and my life start from now on,” he said.
Rose plays Ygritte, the lover of Jon Snow, who plays Kit in the Emmy-winning fantasy film series.
The couple held their wedding in June 2018, at the Leslie family's residential campus in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China Reports 14% Increase in New Infections
China has just announced that the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14%.
Health officials say the country has more than 820,000 people with the disease.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, the number of new cases was 40,000.
Most of the new infections are due to sexually transmitted infections. This is a big change compared to before.
Previously, HIV spread rapidly in some areas of China due to blood transfusions.
However, the number of HIV-infected people along this route has dropped to almost zero. This is a speech by Chinese health officials at a conference in Wan Nam province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China each year has increased by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV infection is a serious problem that is occurring in the LGBT community in China.
Although homosexuality has no longer been considered illegal in China since 1997, in fact, discrimination against the LGBT community is still very common.
Due to the country’s traditional conservative values, the study estimated that 70-90% of men eventually married, despite having sex with men.
Many people are infected with the century’s disease because they don’t use adequate protective measures when having same-sex sex.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has committed to administering HIV treatment drugs to all infected patients to cope with the disease.
Maxine Waters denies her staff to reveal data of Republican senators, stressing "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy".
On Saturday, U.S. Democratic Representative Maxine Waters denied allegations that a member of her staff had posted the personal information of three Republican senators on the Wikipedia page about legislators.
The Democratic Party in Los Angeles asserted that these complaints were caused by "extremely" experts and websites.
“Lies, lies, and lies are even more contemptible,” Waters wrote in a tweet.
According to the report, the leaks included a private home address and U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham's phone number from South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, from Utah.
This information began to appear online on Thursday, due to an unidentified person in the Capitol Hill House during a Senate hearing on charges of sexual assault against the candidate for the post of Supreme Court Justice Ka Brett Hill.
This information was revealed a short time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
The Hill newspaper wrote: Conservative party websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identified the source of posts related to Ms. Waters’s office and disclosed information about one of Ms. Waters’ employees.
Ms. Waters went on to say, “This baseless accusation is absolutely false and is absolutely a lie.”
“The staff in my office have been infringed on identity, personal information and even security due to these false allegations and misrepresentation of the person who disclosed the information.
This baseless imposition is absolutely inaccurate and is absolutely a lie.”
Waters’s statement immediately attracted criticism on the internet, including the White House’s former press secretary, Ari Fleischer.
“This rebuttal is an expression of anger,” Fleischer wrote.
“This shows that she has no qualifications to become a congressional commissioner.
When someone is accused of an act that they don’t do, they shouldn’t be angry.
They are not challenged.
They were not questioned about the motive of the accused.
They need to be calm and calm.”
Fleischer seems to be comparing Waters' reaction to Judge Kavanaugh's reaction to Democratic criticism and critics also allege that he was too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is running for the position of Waters in the midterm election, also expressed his views on Twitter.
“Big if true,” he wrote on Twitter.
Ms. Waters stated that her office had warned "the authorities and law enforcement agencies of these allegations of misconduct.
“We will make sure the perpetrators are given the light,” she continued, “and they will be held accountable for all the actions that could cause harm and danger to any of my employees.”
Review: Johnny English Re-Employment – Rowan Atkinson’s Useless Funny Spy
Now, it is possible to notice a fairly traditional trend in 2011 in any new film that has the British element is the search for the meaning of Brexit. And the next episode of the comedy-action series about spying Johnny English - the year of the spy Johnny is also no exception.
Would self-deprecating actions on how useless we ourselves are become a new export opportunity for this country?
Anyway, the power-limited spy Johnny English with round eyes and a flexible face is again allowed to shake things up again - his name is simply representative of a comic book that is designed for non-regions.
Of course, he is a secret agent, although he always sniffs strangely in the style of Inspector Clouseau, mixing the humor of Mr. Bean and a little bit of the 2012 London Symphony O in the theme of Chariots of Firiots.
The character’s prototype also relies on the international traveler and mysterious man Atkinson once featured in Barclaycard’s television commercial, which has now plunged into oblivion and chaos when he wakes up.
There are some pretty interesting scenes in the latest episode of Johnny English.
I liked the scene of Johnny English coming close to the helicopter while wearing a medieval armor and the fan wings hitting his hat.
Although Atkinson's humor is fully expressed, the humor factor here does not seem to be heavy enough and a bit overstated, especially when the "serious" films such as the 007 series and the Impossible Mission have been performed.
The humor in this film can only make children laugh, and I myself believe that Johnny English’s stupid mistakes are not as creative and noteworthy as the jokes in Atkinson’s Mr. Bean.
The situation leading up to the story is that the UK is in serious trouble.
The hacker has infiltrated the network of British super-secret spies, revealing the identity of all British spies operating outside, resulting in the loss of the spirit of a spy on a mission, a very unfortunate little role of Kevin Eldon.
This is the prime minister's last chance, a proud and powerful character, who is currently facing this gruesome political crisis: Emma Thompson has portrayed very well the character of Prime Minister Teresa May's version, but according to the script she doesn't have much.
The intelligence advisers reported that the closeness of all the active spies had been revealed and she would have to mobilize an exterminated spy.
And that guy is Johnny English, who is currently teaching in a rural area, but in fact is teaching lessons outside the program to become a secret spy: here are some pretty interesting jokes, because English teaches students to be a spy in the style of academia.
English was summoned back to the Whitehall Court for an emergency meeting and teamed up with the former accomplice Bough, played by actor Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, please overwhelm a charming luxury submarine commander. Vicki Pepperdine takes on the role of this little waste of talent.
So the Batman and Robin couple specialize in trouble with the Queen's Order back on duty and meet Olga Kurylenko in the role of beautiful spy Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is in a state of peril under the curse of a charming tech billionaire after claiming he can solve all of Britain’s computer headaches: Jason Volta is in danger, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their adventures with extraordinarily imaginary adventures: after dressing up as a tablecloth, they burn a French restaurant in the blink of an eye; causing chaos on Volta's luxury boat; and English-style hiccups.
By the end of the movie, the buttons will definitely be removed, but such a boiling point is quite similar to television channels for children.
It's a pretty ordinary work.
And like the other parts of Johnny English, I can’t help but ask the question: can the British film industry really not give Rowan Atkinson a fair role, worthy of his talent?
The Labour Party rejects the information it is planning to allow the British people to work four days but receive five days of pay.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party will consider an advanced plan, allowing British citizens to work four days a week but receiving five days a week.
According to the information received, the party wants entrepreneurs to transfer the money saved by the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers by giving them an extra day off.
This means that employees are off the weekend for three days but still receive the salary as before.
Sources said the idea was "compliant" with the party's economic agenda and expected to increase support for the country's workers.
The Congress of the British Confederation has confirmed the shift to work four days a week is a way for workers to enjoy the benefits of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: “The process of reviewing the policies is expected to be announced by the end of this year.
“This goal cannot be achieved in a short period of time, but working four days a week is an aspiration in line with this party’s leadership in rebalancing the economy that benefits workers as well as the party’s common industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party will not be the first to adopt this idea. The British Green Party is committed to working four days a week in the 2017 election campaign.
However, this idea has not yet been adopted by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour spokesperson said: “The four-day/week policy is not the policy of the party and the party is not currently considering this policy.”
Dark Prime Minister John McDonnell took advantage of last week’s Labour conference to boost the outlook for a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from the hands of “anonymous managers” and “beneficiaries” at utility companies.
These plans by the shadow prime minister also mean that current shareholders in the state granting companies may not get their full share back because the Labour Party government may apply 'deductions' based on behavior deemed wrong.
He also confirmed plans for employees to join the company's board of directors and set up a comprehensive ownership fund to give 10% of private company shares to company employees, from which they are able to receive annual shares of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy shared in the "60 Minutes" show about whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh caused them to change their decision.
The FBI's investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote to appoint him to the post of Supreme Court Justice for at least a week, and has raised questions about whether the Supreme Court's results of the investigation have been confirmed.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, "60 Minutes" reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find any evidence that could make these senators irreplaceable.
Mr. Kennedy was more open-minded than his classmates from South Carolina.
“I think so,” Kennedy said.
“I said during the hearing, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the incident took place, that is, after the accusation was made and asked, ‘Do you do that?’
He responded very decisively, definitively and resolutely.”
However, Graham’s vote seems to be entirely certain.
He said: “I’ve decided on Brett Kavanaugh and there’s only one allegation that I’ve had the power to make a change.”
“Professor Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I do know one thing: Brett denied it very strongly,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And all the people she told her name couldn’t verify the story.
It's been 36 years.
I don’t see anything new.”
What is the Global Civic Festival and does it contribute to the Eradication of Poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizens’ Festival, an annual music event with the participation of an impressive star band to carry out an equally impressive mission: ending poverty in the world.
In the seventh year of the event, the Global Citizens’ Festival will see tens of thousands of people dropping onto the Great Lawn Grass of Central Park not only to enjoy the performance of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes’s 20th anniversary, but also to raise awareness.
The Global Citizens’ Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Eradication Project, an international campaign group with the hopes of ending poverty by increasing the number of active people fighting it.
To get tickets for this event free of charge (unless you’re willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the music night attendees must complete a series of tasks or “activities” such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to a world leader who would like to think about it, calling a phone or whatever.
But how did this Global Citizens’ Festival achieve such successes, when there are now only 12 years left to achieve its goal?
The idea of rewarding a free music night for people is a practical way to persuade people to call for action, or just another form of “keyboard movement” – people feel like they’re making a real difference on Twitter or a tweet they’re making a real difference by signing a petition.
Since 2011, the Global Civic Organization has said there are over 10 million "activities" from registered supporters, pushing a variety of different goals.
They say these actions have helped drive leaders around the world to make commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion set up to implement intervention measures to improve the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements arising from the group’s actions, with at least $10 billion being disbursed or raised.
To date, it has been estimated that the funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partner organization that includes investors and performers, committed to “helping children to develop their full potential,” vowing to donate $25 million in Twitter to Rwanda as soon as it comes to an end.
“With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can turn social injustice into a state of malnutrition into a milestone in London’s year in history,” the 2018 London Ambassador to the 4th Anniversary of the Empowerment Program.
The group also said, after more than 5,000 actions calling for the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government has announced funding for a project called The Nutrition Power, which ensures nutrition intervention for 5 million women and children.
Answering one of the Frequently Asked Questions on the group’s website, “What makes you believe that we can end poverty with extremes?”
The Global Citizens’ Group responded: “This will be a long and difficult road – sometimes we will fail.
But just as the civil rights movement and the anti-racism movement in the past, we will succeed because together, we will become stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are some of the artists who will perform at this year’s event in New York, led by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. Could Use Navy to "Block" Russia's Energy Exports - Home Secretary
The Washington Examiner quoted U.S. Secretary of State Ryan Zinke as revealing that Washington could mobilize naval forces “if necessary” to prevent Russian energy from being brought into the market, including the Middle East market.
Zinke alleged that Russia’s involvement in Syria – more notably than at the invitation of the legitimate government – was only an excuse to explore new energy markets.
According to the report, he said: “I believe that the reason they invaded the Middle East is because they wanted to trade in energy as in Eastern Europe, the valley in southern Europe.”
And according to official news, there are many ways and means to stop this.
“The United States has the ability to use the naval force to ensure that seamless shipping lines remain open and will be closed, if necessary, to ensure that their energy resources are not put into the market.”
Zinke called on attendees to attend the event organized by the Consumer Energy Union, a self-described non-profit group as the “voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He continued to compare Washington’s practices with Russia and Iran, while noting that the two methods of doing so were equally effective.
“The economic project that Iran and Russia can choose is to take advantage of and change fuels,” he said, while calling Russia “one that has only one strength” with an economy that relies solely on fossil fuels.
The claims were made when the Trump administration was looking to increase exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, in order to replace Russia’s position, a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To achieve this goal, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the North Stream 2 North Stream oil project, which, according to Trump, “incompletely inappropriately” caused Moscow to “recognize.”
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which is being built to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s vehement opposition to the project simply stems from economic reasons and is an example of unhealthy competition.
“I believe we have a common view that energy cannot be a tool for pressure and consumers must be chosen as suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. military has provoked a strong reaction from Germany, then the country has reaffirmed its commitment to participate in the project.
Germany's top industrial organisation, the German Industrial Federation (BDI), has called on the United States not to interfere in the European Union's energy policy, as well as bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third country is trying to intervene in our energy supply,” Dieter Kempf, president of the German Federation of Industry (BDI), said after a meeting between German Prime Minister Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren Will “Seriously Consider” the 2020 Presidential Election, Massachusetts State Senator Says
On Saturday, Massachusetts State Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would “seriously consider” the presidential election after the interim election.
During a meeting at the mayoral court in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed she would consider running for office.
“It’s time for women to come to Washington and fix government flaws, and so you need a woman at the top.”
“After November 6th, I will seriously consider the presidential election.”
Warren criticized President Donald Trump at a meeting in the mayoral court and said he was “making the country go in the wrong direction.
“I’m really worried about what Donald Trump is going to do for our democracy,” she said.
Ms. Warren frankly criticized Trump and his nominee for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
In a Twitter post on Friday, Warren said "of course the FBI must investigate before voting."
However, a poll on Thursday showed that Ms. Warren’s majority did not believe she should run in 2020.
According to a poll conducted by the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe Political Research Center, 58% of Massachusetts state "possible" voters said that senators should not run for office.
Thirty-two percent voted for her.
The poll found that more voters voted for former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% of the vote in favor and 48% of the vote in opposition.
Other potential Democratic nominees are named when referring to the 2020 presidential election, including former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
The Associated Press reported that Biden said he would make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin leads evidence of Track Palin's Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) at Donald Trump's campaign
Track Palin, 26, served one year in Iraq after re-recording in September.
He was arrested and charged in a domestic violence incident on Monday night.
“What my son is going through, what I’m going through when I come back, I can totally relate to other families who are also suffering the consequences of PTSD and the injuries our soldiers bring when they come back,” she told the crowd at the Trump campaign.
Palin called the arrest of his son "a clear problem but no one wants to mention" and argued that her son and the other former warriors returned after the war "had a change, a better angle, and doubted that they had no respect for themselves and their fellow soldiers."
According to Dan Bennett, a spokesperson for the Wasilla Police Department, the man was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with assaulting a woman with domestic violence, preventing others from reporting domestic violence and possessing weapons of honour.
18 states and D.C. support the challenge of new refugee policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are in favor of challenging the new U.S. policy of refusing asylum for victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
NBC News reported that representatives of 18 states and D.C. sent a brief collective text on Friday in Washington to support asylum seekers who objected to the policy.
The full names of the plaintiffs in the Grace and Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Federation in August to oppose the current federal policy have yet to be revealed.
She said her lover "and the sons of members of his violent gang" abused her, but U.S. officials refused to ask for her asylum on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
Prosecutors of pro-Grace states described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which have a large number of asylum seekers in the U.S., as when countries face problems of gangs and domestic violence quite common.
The new U.S. refugee policy reversed the 2014 decision of the Council on Immigration Advocacy that allowed immigrants without a personal ID to flee domestic violence to seek asylum.
District Attorney General Karl Racine said on Friday that the new policy "ignores the system of state, federal and international law that has been around for decades."
“Federal law requires that all applications for asylum be considered based on the specific events and circumstances of the applicant and this obstruction policy violates that principle,” the brief statement said.
Prosecutors also disputed in the short text that the immigrant refusal policy was detrimental to the U.S. economy, because immigrants were more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide full necessary labor."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has called on judiciary judges to request that immigrants not continue to allow asylum for victims fleeing domestic violence and gang abuse in June, according to Reuters.
“Only allow asylum to those who leave their country because of oppression or fear of race, religion, nationality or members of a specific social group or political viewpoint,” Sessions said in a June 11 policy statement.
Accidents are never a means of minimizing all the problems – even all the serious ones – that people face on a daily basis all over the world.
Efforts to rescue in desperation in Palu as the death toll doubled in the search for survivors
For the survivors, the situation is becoming increasingly catastrophic.
“It’s really stressful,” Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother shared while applause for her son being fevered at an evacuation center in the desperate city of Palu.
“Every minute, the ambulance is bringing more people in.
“Clean water is very rare.”
Residents returning home have been destroyed by their own, picking up delicate items flooded in the water, trying to rescue anything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals were completely overloaded, following damage from a strong 7.5-degree earthquake.
Several people were injured, including Dwi Haris with a broken back and shoulder resting outside the Palu Army Hospital, where the patient was treated outdoors due to severe trauma.
His eyes moved as he recalled the feeling of a violent earthquake that shook the five-storey hotel room where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
“We don’t even have enough time to save ourselves.
I think I was thrown into the rubble of the wall,” Haris told the Associated Press and added that his family went to town to attend the wedding.
“I heard my wife crying and crying for help, but then I didn’t hear anything else.
I don’t know what happened to my son’s wife.
I hope they’re all safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of ‘Mobbing’ With ‘Advertising Advertisement’
A week after an official Chinese newspaper ran a four-page advertisement on a U.S. newspaper mentioning the common interest of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to make a statement.
Last Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump referred to an additional China Daily sum to the Des Moines Register — the state's best-selling newspaper — after accusing China of seeking to interfere in the U.S. parliamentary election on Nov. 6.
Trump’s accusations that Beijing is seeking to interfere in the U.S. election mark a new phase in a campaign to intensify pressure with Washington’s China, according to what U.S. officials share with Reuters.
Although foreign governments’ placing of commercial promotions is perfectly normal, Beijing and Washington are now stuck in escalating trade, with evidence that they have imposed high tariffs on imports of goods from both sides.
Chinese and U.S. experts say China’s tariff policy to retaliate in the early stages of the war has been designed to target exporters in states that support the TT. Trump Republicans like the state of Iowa.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa State, a state that exports large agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had harmed U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote an opinion piece in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, saying that China “is continuing that bullying behavior by running advertising in our own free press.”
“In an effort to preach, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the American tradition of free speech and free press when placing a paid advertisement on the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, at the newsstands on the streets of Beijing, you rarely find any disagreements and will not see any genuine reflections on the Chinese's differing views on China's difficult economic orbit," he said in a statement.
He added that "one of China's most popular newspapers has ignored the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper it was.
Analysts warn Republicans are driving women away before the midterm elections with the Kavanaugh case. . . .
When several Republican party leaders stand up to defend candidates for the position of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh in front of a number of sexual assault allegations, analysts come to warn that they may be subject to severe, especially severe, reaction from the psychiatrist.
Emotions surrounding the incident were quite strong and most Republican candidates on the ballots all expressed their desire to continue to vote.
There are things we can't do again," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse, told The Hill in an article posted on Saturday.
Reeher said he didn’t think it was Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) pressing the button for the FBI to carry out an investigation enough to soothe the angry voters.
The Washington, D.C. newspaper quoted Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the MoveOn Progressive Group on Friday as saying: “Women will not forget what happened yesterday – tomorrow they will not forget and by November they will not forget.”
Mic reported: On Friday morning, protesters chanted "Sunday 11 is coming!" during a parade in the Senate hallway because the Republican Party was taking control of the Justice Committee that had chosen to continue to vote for Christ's nominee, Forvanaugh.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be pushed higher than ever," Stu Rothenberg, a non-party political analyst, told the news page.
“It’s been said that this motivation is now very high; that’s right.
But it could be even higher, especially among women in the suburbs and young voters, between the ages of 18 and 29 usually not voting because they don’t like the president.”
Even before Ms. Ford publicly swore details of allegations of sexual assault against Supreme Court officials, analysts said the public would be likely to react strongly if the Republicans continued to confirm the case.
NBC News quoted Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, as saying last week: “This could become a mess that the Republican Party has to deal with.”
"The issue is not just whether the committee votes or the official vote, or whether Kavanaugh becomes a Supreme Court Judge, but rather how Republican MPs treat the House, the House of Representatives, the House of Representatives, and the way they treat the defendants," he said.
However, the American people disagreed on whether to trust either Ford or Kavanaugh’s statement, and many seemed to be more suspicious of Kavanaugh.
A new YouGov survey found that 41% of respondents said they were confident or could believe Ford’s statement, while 35% said they were confident or could believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% of respondents thought that Kavanaugh may or may have lied when making the statement, while only 30% believed that Ford was certain or could have lied.
After Flake presses the spread button, the FBI is investigating Ford’s indictment and at least one other indictee, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Ford swore to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh had attacked her when she was 17 years old.

World Wide Web Inventor Plans to Start Building New Internet to Receive Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is now launching a startup project to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technology legend is called Inrupt, a construction company based on Berners-Lee’s Solid open source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where the data is stored and people are given the right to access the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind the Inrupt project was "world domination."
“We have to get started right away,” he said of the startup project.
"Now is the moment of history."
The application uses Solid technology, which allows users to create their own "online personal data collection" or POD.
This data box may include contact lists, lists of things to do, calendars, music libraries, other personal and professional tools.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, they are all available on one browser and display at the same time.
The unique thing about this online personal data repository is that users have the full right to decide which type of information they can access.
The company calls it “assigning control of data to individuals.”
According to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, the idea of the Inrupt project is to ensure the company has the right resources, processes and skills to help provide Solid for everyone.
The current company Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform that IBM has acquired, several developers have signed a contract to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications by using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team did not talk to Facebook and Google about whether or not there was a complete change because all of their business models could be fully upgraded after one night.
“We don’t need permission from them.”
In a post on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new website built on the Solid platform."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by founding the World Wide Web Association at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been the influential name in the debate over the neutrality of the internet.
Despite launching the Inrupt project, Berners-Lee will continue to hold the role of Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Association, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m very optimistic about the next era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Celebration of Father Bernard Vann's Day receiving the Victoria Cross Medal in World War I
The celebration of the 100th Anniversary of the Church of England’s only Pastor was awarded the Queen Victoria’s Cross Medal in World War I as a warrior who had been held in his home country.
Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann won the medal on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he died of being shot four days later and he himself never knew he had won the British Army's highest honor.
On Saturday, his two nephews unveiled a commemorative stone during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of these grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was a “glorious symbol” when the stone was displayed exactly 100 years after the war that helped his grandfather win the medal.
According to the London Declaration, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Vann, the commander of his squadron, crossed the Canal de Saint-Quentin "with dense fog, under heavy fire from rifles and machine guns."
He then slammed straight into the bullet and with "great courage", he led the squadron upwards, before slamming into a gunman and dropping three snipers.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - just a month after the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather’s actions were “activities that I myself could never do, but there was humility.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also set a blossom after the Royal Brentwood Youth Music Parade.
Michael Vann said he felt "extremely honoured to participate in the parade" and "the courage of a true hero will be noted by the support of so many."
Fans of martial arts wake up all night to watch Bellator 206, but eventually they only get Peppa Pig
Imagine you’ve been waking up all night to watch the Bellator 206 with a hard-boiled audience, but ultimately refused to watch the main event.
The show's introductory section from San Jose said there were 13 matches, including six on the main card and was broadcast live throughout the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., as soon as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared the match, viewers in the UK were shocked when the screen turned into Peppa Pig.
Some people feel disrespected after they wake up in the morning to watch the game.
One fan expressed on Twitter that turning the show into a children's animated film was like "an ingrateful joke."
“The government stipulates that martial arts content broadcast at 6 a.m. is inappropriate, so they have to turn into a children’s program,” Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of Bellator’s marketing and media department, said when asked about the program’s transfer.
"Peppa the pig," he said.
Bellator CEO Scott Coker said he was considering a broadcast schedule to ensure British audiences could watch the show in the future.
Mr. Coker said, “I think that if we play back, we can solve the problem.”
“But it’s 6am on Sunday and we can’t deal with the issue until Sunday according to our time zone, but it’s Monday according to their time zone.
But we're trying to find a solution.
Trust me, when people switch programs, there are a lot of texts going through and those messages aren’t very friendly.
We tried to fix it, at first we thought it was due to technical flaws.
But in the end, it is not, but by government regulations.
I can promise you this won’t happen next time.
We will reduce the number of matches to five, instead of six as originally expected - five is the number of matches we usually provide and we have tried to provide the level to the fans.
This is really an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels ‘Bad Thua’ About Sexual Tendency
Olympic dancer Tom Daley said that when he grew up, he always felt bad about losing people because of his sexual orientation – but that was his motivation for success.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize he wasn’t like anyone until he was in school.
Speaking on the Number 4 Desert Island Discs program led by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out about the rights of gay men to bring “hope” to others.
He also said that being a parent has made him less interested in winning the Olympic Games more.
Kirsty Young, the host of this year’s rice program, took a few months off to cure the disease.
Among the first Laverne leads, Daley appears as an abandoned person, saying that he feels "thua bad" everyone, because "his progeny is not socially accepted as clearly sons and daughters."
He said: “Until today, feelings about the feeling of being lost and the difference still exist, becoming the motivation and strength for me to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he had “made something” so that people wouldn’t be disappointed to know the truth about his sexual orientation.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become an active athlete for the LGBT community and he uses his image at the Commonwealth Block Sports Congress in Australia this year to call for more countries to protest against x-divorce.
He said that he said himself was because he felt very lucky to be able to live openly without being discriminated against and wanted to bring “hope” to others.
The three-time World Cup troop shared that he loved a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black. The two met in 2013 and "suddenly in love."
Daley was married to the Oscar-winning 20-year-old last year, but he said the age difference was never an obstacle between the two.
“When you have to go through too much suffering when you were a child,” he said at the Olympics for the first time when he was 14 and his father died of cancer three years later, “it will be very difficult to find someone the same age as he had ever experienced an upswing in his life.
The couple became parents to the boy Robert Ray Black-Daley in June and Daley said that his "worldview" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, my goal was 'I have to win a gold medal,'" he said.
“But as you know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
“My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son was named after his father Robert. He died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept the fact that he was about to die and one of the last things he asked was that they had an Olympic ticket in London in 2012 — because he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell you ‘you can’t sit in the front row anymore,’” he said.
"I hold your hand when you hold your last breath and even until you stop breathing and go away forever, I can't finally admit that you have to be invincible."
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympic Games and won a bronze medal.
“I just know that it’s the dream of my life – to dance in front of a crowd of fans at the Olympics, it really doesn’t feel any better than that,” he said.
This was also a source of inspiration for him to choose the first song - Heather Small's Proud - the song that accompanied him during his training toward the Olympic Games and still made him excited every time he heard it.
The Desert Island Discs program aired on BBC Station 4 at 11:15 BST, Sunday.
Mickelson is down on the bench for Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American footballer Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday for his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to step up his pace to avoid the record becoming a sad experience.
Mickelson has played in the two-year event once 12 times but the team leader Jim Furyk again let him sit on the bench in the fourball and foursome series on Saturday.
Instead of being the center of action as in the U.S., the five-time winner has to spend the day activating the player and playing the game in the hopes of getting rid of the discomfort.
The 48-year-old player with the field are flat kicks that have never been the ideal choice for narrow Le Golf National, even when he is at the top of the ladder, because the wrong kicks here will bear heavy consequences.
And if this golf course is still not obsessive enough, then Mickelson will have to compete in Sunday's 9th match against his opponent, the UK Championship Champions League expanded Francesco Molinari. This week, Molinari defeated and defeated the young Tommyr.
If the U.S. team is currently losing 4 points before starting a series of 12 singles games that want to start impressively, then Mickelson’s game is crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his footballer and didn’t say much.
“He understands his role very well today, he leans into my back, arms through my arm and says he’ll be ready for tomorrow,” Furyk said.
"He's very confident.
He is a legend and has contributed a lot to the team, in the past and throughout the week.
I never imagined that he would play two games.
I imagined more, but that’s the way things are going and we think it’s the right way.
He wants to play, just like any other team.”
This Sunday, Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record, becoming the most-scoring player in the Ryder Cup.
It could also be the mark of the end of his career at the Ryder Cup because the highs in his personal record have never appeared in this tournament.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and a conciliation match, although Furyk believes his presence brings invisible value to the team.
"He's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he likes to make people laugh. He's really fun in the group," he explains.
"I think the young players are happy to meet him and this week is pretty fun.
“What he’s given is more than a game.”
European Team Leader Thomas Bjorn knows that the lead edge can quickly disappear in a timely manner.
Thomas Bjorn, European Team Leader, has had experience that even though his team has a lot ahead of them in the Ryder Cup finals, the results can still be easily reversed in an unpleasant way.
The Dane started playing in 1997 at Valderrama, in which their team, led by Seve Ballesteros, led by five points ahead of the American team but ultimately only won by a 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2–131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 star rating.
“You always have to remind yourself that we’ve been leading a lot in Valderrama; we’ve been leading a lot in Brookline and we’ve lost, in Valderrama, we’ve won, but it’s tough,” Bjorn said, looking ahead to the Nationals in the first round of Golf and the 10th-winning game of the Class of 2018.
So history will tell me and everyone on the team that that's not the end.
You still have to focus your mind on tomorrow.
Go to the field and the game is good.
The tournament is not over when the scores are not on the table.
We have a goal to win the cup this year and that’s our focus.
I’ve always said that you focus on your 12 players, but we also understand the strength of your team – they’re the best players in the world.”
Joyful at the performance of his players on the folded golf course, Bjorn added: “I’ll never say anything before.
Tomorrow will be another war.
Tomorrow will be the show of each individual and will definitely be very different.
It would be great to play in pairs and everything goes well. But when you play in person, all the odds of a golfer will be revealed.
That’s the message you have to share with every player, that they have to be ready for the best match tomorrow.
Now a couple of matches have to separate and each one has to be ready for the best match.”
Unlike Bjorn, the rival's boss, Jim Furyk expects his players to show better personal abilities than when playing in pairs, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas have won three out of four points.
Furyk himself had gone through both directions in major turnovers on the last day, having been a winning team member at Brookline before failing while the European team was hailed as the "Colored at Medinah."
"I remember every letter," he said when asked about how Ben Crenshaw, the team's 1999 captain, gathered and encouraged the players before the final match date.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you’re going to want to start as fast as you see in Brookline, or as you see in Medinah.
When the results are following a trend, the matches in the middle will be under a lot of pressure.
“We’re building a team that way and sending players out on the pitch in a strategic way and trying to make a miracle for tomorrow.”
Thomas was assigned to lead the team in the match and faced Rory McIlroy in the top match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other European champions in the first series.
"I chose this team, in that order because I believe it's a way to get past it," Bjorn said of the choice for his singles game.
Germany's new warships continue to be put into service.
Local media reports: The latest destroyer of the German Navy should have been tested in 2014 to replace the Cold War-era warships, but at least by the following year could have been tested due to faulty systems and increased costs.
The Die Zeit newspaper quoted a military spokesman as saying that the "Rheinland-Pfalz" test operation, the lead ship of the all-new Baden-Wuerttemberg destroyer, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship was supposed to have been delivered to the Navy in 2014, but trouble after the delivery hampered the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen destroyer.
This means that these ships will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, a number of imaging technologies, such as radar, infrared, and sound.
Other important features include longer maintenance times – which can deploy the latest destroyers in remote national ports for up to two years.
Continuous delays, however, mean that these modern warships – which are supposed to help Germany control foreign countries – would become lagging behind at the time of start of use, Die Zeit notes.
The F125 wrecker unfortunately became a headline last year when the German Navy officially refused to test the ship and returned to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned the ship to the shipyard after delivery.
There is little information about the reason behind the return of the ship, but the German media mentions a serious "software and hardware deficiencies", leading to a warship completely useless if engaged in combat missions.
Particularly serious software outages as the Baden-Wuerttemberg ship will be operated by a fleet of 120 sailors - with only half the manpower on the old Bremen destroyer.
At the same time, it can be seen that the weight of the ship increased significantly, leading to a decrease in performance and limiting the Navy's ability to upgrade in the future.
The "Rheinland-Pfalz" weighs 7,000 tons and is believed to be twice as heavy as the Germans used in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project – including crew training – is also a serious issue.
The project is thought to have significantly raised the team to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) – while the initial estimated cost is <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The issue of the latest destruction of ships has become particularly important, in the context of recent warnings about the strength of the German navy being increasingly narrow.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German Parliamentary Committee on Defence, acknowledged the Navy was a “lack of warships capable of combat.”
The official said the problem became more and more serious over time, because the old ship had stopped operating but no replacement ships were available.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg ships were eligible to join the Navy.
The National Trust listens to the secret life of bats.
A new study is underway in a landlocked area in the Scottish Highlands to reveal how bats use natural landscapes to hunt for food.
It is hoped that these findings will shed light on the behavior of mammals who know this unique fly and are geared towards future conservation activities.
The study was carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, tracking the journey of common bats, soprano pipistrelles, brown eared bats and Daubenton bats at the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
A special recorder will be placed in important locations around the research site to monitor the activity of these bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
The audio analytic specialist will carry out the analysis of all the recordings and determine the sound frequency of the bat and the sound purpose of each particular bat.
Subsequently, maps and habitat reports of bats will be established to have a detailed picture of their behavior in the natural landscape.
Rob Dewar, an NTS nature conservation consultant, hopes the results will help determine which habitat plays the most important role for bats and how each species lives in that environment.
This information will help identify the benefits of wildlife environmental management activities, such as grassland cultivation and the best way to conserve forests for bats and other related species.
The mosquito population in Scotland and across the UK has declined significantly over the past century.
They are endangered by construction and development activities that affect the plumage of bats and the loss of habitat.
Windmills and lighting systems, flies traps, some chemical processing methods for building materials, as well as attacks by pet cats can also pose a risk to bats.
The skin is not completely blind.
However, due to the habit of prey hunting at night, the ears are more useful than the eyes when roaming and catching prey.
They use an extremely sophisticated wine-like positioning technique to identify obstacles on the runway.
NTS is responsible for over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land nationwide, while paying particular attention to bats.
The organization has ten experts who are regularly trained to carry out surveys, inspections and sometimes participate in animal rescue.
It even established Scotland's first and only bat conservation area at the Threave grounds in Dumfries and Galloway. This is the home of eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The land manager, David Thompson, said the land was their ideal territory.
“Threave is a great habitat for bats,” he said.
“We have a lot of old buildings, a lot of coniferous trees and a good living environment.
But there’s still a lot of mystery about bats, so working here and at other facilities will help us understand more about what bats need to grow further.”
He underlined the importance of having to test the life of bats before conservation in the areas, because the accidental destruction of their fetuses could kill up to 400 children and vomiting, almost completely destroying the population.
Mosquitoes are protected species and the killing, harassment, harassment or destruction of their poultry is illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, an employee of the Scottish Conservation Fund, encouraged the community to join in helping.
She said: “We still need to learn more about bats and with so many species, we can’t know how far apart their populations are.”
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape and his lawyer prepares German magazine lawsuits.
Cristiano Ronaldo said the sex charges against him were "fake" and that someone "wanted to take advantage" of his name.
His lawyer is preparing to sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel for filing the charge.
The Portuguese forward currently playing for the Juventus team has been charged with raping an American woman, named Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
The newspaper Der Spiegel reported on Friday that the man allegedly paid the woman $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident.
In a live video streamed on Instagram before 142 million followers hours after the allegations were made public, 33-year-old Ronaldo said the report was "fake news."
"No, no, no.
What they say today is all fake news,” the five-time Golden Ball player said in front of the camera.
“They want to take advantage of my name for profit.
That's normal, too.
They’re famous for my name, but that’s just part of the job.
I'm a happy person and everything's good," the player added and smiled.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing a lawsuit in the Japanese newspaper Der Spiegel on the charge, calling it “a suspicion of unacceptable privacy.”
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral damages to the amount corresponding to the severity of the infringing conduct, which may be one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The case was alleged to have occurred in June 2009 at a high-end hotel room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga are believed to have returned to the player's room. According to the records at Clark County Court, State Nevada, he was accused of raping her at the hotel.
Mayorga said Ronaldo fell down after the indictment and said he was "99%" a "good guy", with only "1%" not good.
There is evidence that Ronaldo confirmed that the two sides had sex, but based on consensus.
Mayorga also said she went to the police station and was recaptured of the wounds at the hospital, but later agreed to settle out of court because she was "fearful of revenge" and worried about "public humiliation."
The 34-year-old woman said she was currently looking to reverse her previous settlement decision because she continued to be hit by the indictment.
At the time of the indictment, Ronaldo was preparing to transfer from Manchester United to Real Madrid, but eventually this summer, he switched to playing for Italian giant Juve in a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million transfer deal.
Brexit: You will 'forever regret' for losing the position of carmaker
Business Secretary Greg Clark said the UK would "forever regret" if it lost its position as the world's leader in the production of Brexit sedans.
He also added that it was quite "concerning" when Toyota UK told the BBC that if the UK left the European Union without any further agreement, they would stop producing at the plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said delays at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant – where Toyota’s Auris and Avensis line-up was produced – produced nearly 150,000 units last year, of which 90% were exported to other countries in the European Union.
“My point is that if the UK completely leaves the European Union at the end of March, we will have to stop producing at this plant,” Marvin Cooke, Toyota CEO at Burnaston, said in a statement.
Other automakers in the UK are also concerned about Britain leaving the EU without a cross-border trade deal, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford in a month after Brexit.
The main concern of automakers is the supply chain risk in the event of a Brexit without another deal.
Toyota's production line operates on the "just-in-time" principle, with parts delivered in the UK and the European Union after every 37 minutes for orderly production lines of vehicles.
If the UK leaves the EU without another deal on March 29, there is a possibility of a border disruption and this concern could lead to delays and a shortage of spare parts.
Toyota said the company could not keep its inventory value for more than a day at the Derbyshire plant, so they would have to stop production.
Clark said Prime Minister Theresa May’s Chequers plan for future relations with the European Union would be “accurately adjusted to avoid border checks.”
"We want to have the best deal, not only to ensure success in the present, but also to ensure that we take advantage of this opportunity," he said in the BBC's Today program No. 4.
“Evidence from Toyota as well as other car manufacturers shows that we need to ensure that the supply chain continues to be successful.”
Toyota has not announced for sure how long it will stop production, but in the long run, they warned that the extra cost will reduce the factory’s competitiveness and ultimately, workers will lose their jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and assembling Unite at the factory, his members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, once these jobs are lost, there will never be again.
A government spokesperson said: “We have built an accurate and reliable plan for the relationship with the European Union in the future.”
White House Announces Meeting TT. Trump and Mr. Rosenstein May Be Delayed Again
The White House announced on Sunday: Donald Trump’s high-level meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “backed by another week” as the fight over the case of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating the interference in the Russian election, the link between Trump and Russia’s aides and the possibility of the president obstructing the enforcement of justice.
Trump’s dismissal of the deputy secretary-general, pulling that out that Mueller would be difficult to operate independently, has sparked a lot of rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported Rosenstein had discussed wearing headphones to record talks with Trump and the possibility of losing the president through the 25th Circuit.
Rosenstein refused to report.
But on Monday, he came to the White House amid rumours that he was about to resign.
Instead, his meeting with President Trump — who was visiting the United Nations General Assembly in New York at the time — is scheduled for Thursday.
Trump said he "did not want" to fire Rosenstein but the meeting was delayed to avoid conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing between Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct.
On Friday, President Trump asked the FBI to spend a week investigating charges against Kavanaugh, while continuing to delay the full vote of the Senate.
President Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about Rosenstein’s meeting, she said: “The date of the meeting has not been fixed, perhaps this week, it is possible to see the reason for this postponement is because other issues are taking place at the Supreme Court.
But we will soon get the news and the press will be updated.”
Some reporters may disagree with the statement: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
The show’s host, Chris Wallace, asked her why.
Sanders said the absence of press conferences was not due to the dislike of television reporters "too much," although she had once said: "I also agree that actual reporters are a lot of things."
She then suggested that there should be more direct contact between President Trump and the press.
"The president is currently conducting more questions than any previous president," she added, without giving any evidence: "We have considered the number of press meetings."
Sanders said there would still be press conferences, but "if the press had a chance to ask the president directly, it would be much better than talking to me.
“We’ve tried a lot and you see we’ve got a lot of work to do over the last few weeks, which will replace a press conference where you can talk directly to the president.”
President Trump frequently answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends open meetings or in press meetings when officials visit him.
Simple press conferences are usually very rare.
This week, in New York, the president should have made a statement, but he suddenly appeared in a strange form in front of a crowd of reporters.
The Minister of Health wrote a letter to European Union staff working in the healthcare industry in Scotland to talk about the fear of Brexit
The Minister of Health wrote a letter to European Union staff working in the healthcare industry in Scotland to express the country’s gratitude and desire for the staff to remain behind Brexit.
Health Minister Jeane Freeman sent a letter with a message that he would resign within six months of Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union.
The Scottish Government has pledged to support the costs of applications for the certification of residence status of EU citizens working in the public service sector that have been transferred.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: “Throughout this summer, negotiations between the UK and the European Union on Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union continue, with a decision expected to be made this fall.
But the UK government is also pushing for more work to prepare for a scenario that may not reach an agreement.
I know that this is an unfortunate time for all of you.
That’s why I want to reiterate that I am now very appreciative of the contribution of each employee, regardless of their nationality.
What’s more, colleagues from the European Union have brought valuable experience and skills to help strengthen and improve health services, while also bringing benefits to patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is completely your home and we look forward to your stay.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after a head injury.
Christion Abercrombie, the Tennessee Tigers’ long-distance defender, underwent an emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in a 31-27 loss to Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, Tennessee’s Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee's head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before the break of the first strike.
"He's running towards the edge and crashing down," Reed said.
The trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie an oxy-breath at the perpendicular edge before putting him on board and taking him on further examination.
A Tennessee state official told Chris Harris at the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been operated on at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added "no detailed information on the extent/type of injury" and the state of Tennessee is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student of the red team, first competed under the Tennessee state shirt after moving back from Illinois.
He had a total of five games on Saturday before being eliminated from the game and he had a total of 18 games this season.
Foreigners buying real estate in the UK will be taxed higher
Foreigners buying real estate in the UK will be taxed higher, this extra amount will be used to help the homeless according to Tory’s new policies.
This change will disable Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters.
The tax increase will apply to non-taxable persons in the UK.
The Ministry of Finance expects this policy to help raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year – to help the homeless.
Foreigners buying real estate in the UK will be taxed higher - this extra amount will be used to help the homeless, Prime Minister Theresa May announced today.
The change will disable Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters with a commitment to providing cheaper housing and targeting high-income individuals.
The tax hike will apply to non-taxable individuals and businesses in the UK, and this additional increase will boost the government’s efforts to counter the current stalemate.
Fees – in addition to the current tax rate, including higher taxes announced two years ago for the second house and the purchases of houses only for that purpose – can go up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects the change to increase to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
An estimated 13% of new real estate built in London has been sold to non-UK citizens, which pushes home prices upwards and makes it increasingly difficult for first-time home buyers.
Many of the country’s wealthy regions – especially in the capital – have become “the ghost town” because most foreigners buy homes that spend most of their time in other countries.
The new policy came just weeks after Boris Johnson called for tax cuts to help many young people have the opportunity to own their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping the price of real estate high by taking land but not using it, calling on Prime Minister May to give up the restrictions on affordable homes in order to fix the "home crash" in the UK.
Corbyn also announced a series of housing reforms aimed at attracting voters, including controlling renting and ending "no-fault" deportations.
He also wanted to give the councils more power to build a new house.
May said: “Last year I said that I would spend my time restoring my dreams – that life would be better for a new generation.
And that means reregulating the housing market is very chaotic right now.
England will always be open to those who want to live, work and build life here.
However, this does not mean that people who do not live in the UK and companies based abroad can easily buy homes as hard as British residents.
For a lot of people, the dream of owning a house has become too far away and the maintenance is still huge.”
Jack Ross: 'My last hope is to lead the Scotland team'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross said his "last hope" was to become the manager of the Scottish team at some point.
Scot, 42, is facing the Northeastern club’s resurgence challenge, currently holding third place in League One, three points lower than first.
He moved to Light Stadium this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I want to play for my country as a player.
I had the hat with the B logo and that’s what I wanted,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportsound.
“My five-month childhood was linked to the Scottish games that took place in Hampden with my father, and that’s always made me remember.
However, that opportunity will only come if I succeed in managing the club.”
Sunderland's previous managers before Ross included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic coach said he didn’t feel pressured to be the successor to the great names at such a large club, which he had previously rejected from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“Success for me at this point will be judged by ‘can I bring the club back to the Premier League?’
The organisational and physical structure at this club is definitely part of the Premier League," he said.
"It's not a task to achieve easily, but I only see myself as a success if I can bring the club back to the tournament."
Ross was only three years in the managerial position, after a time as an assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months as a coach at Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from falling to third place, and took St Mirren from the risk of falling to the next season's champions.
Ross said he now feels very comfortable throughout his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It's probably a real turning point," he recalled in the lead role of Alloa.
“I truly believe that I’m perfectly fit for a manager role rather than a player.
This sounds strange because I was quite successful, had a good income and achieved some certain achievements when I was a player.
But the game is usually not easy.
There are a lot of things you have to face every week.
I still have to endure the stress and pressure of the job but I am satisfied with the management work.
I’ve always wanted to do managerial work and now that I’m doing it, I feel the most comfortable being myself throughout my adult life.”

The hot summer sunshine has boosted revenues for liquor stores that are struggling in the UK but put additional pressure on restaurant chains.
According to the figures, liquor and bars saw revenues increase by 2.7% in July – but revenues at restaurants fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, from CGA’s business consulting firm, summed up the data, saying: “The sun lasted longer and the British team entered the innings at the World Cup, making July’s sales trend the same as June, when wineries rose 2.8%.
Revenue at restaurants fell 1.8% in June and worsened in July.
Alcoholic bars and bars that specialize in beverages are the fastest-growing compared to the decline in restaurants.
Restaurants that specialize in food are also affected by the hot sun, though not as severe as restaurants.
Looks like everyone just wants to go for a drink.
Revenues from alcoholic beverages and managed bars increased 6.6 percent in the month, while food sales decreased by 3 percent.
Paul Newman, RSM hotel and entertainment analyst, said: “These results reflect the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events are still the biggest factors when it comes to restaurant revenue.
It’s no surprise that restaurants continue to struggle, with revenues dropping 4.8% compared to the same period last year, while cost pressures continue to rise.
The long-running hot summer took place right at the worst time for food suppliers, not knowing in August when the weather was cooler could improve the current situation."
Total revenue growth at liquor stores and restaurants, including new open locations, was 2.7% in July, reflecting a tightening in the brand’s deployment.
Coffer Peach Tracker’s sales monitoring for UK wineries, bars and restaurants has collected and analyzed work efficiency data from 47 active groups, with combined revenues of more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and that’s the industry’s benchmark.
One in Five Children Have Secret Social Media Accounts That Parents Don't Know
One in five children — some at age 11 — have secret social media accounts that parents and teachers don’t know about, a survey found.
The results of the 20,000 second-graders survey show that the number of "Virtual Insta" pages has increased significantly
The news has raised concerns about the rise of pornographic content on the internet.
Twenty percent of students say they have “proper” accounts to show parents
One-fifth of children – some 11-year-olds – are creating social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 second-graders revealed rapid growth in "insta" accounts - a reference to the Instagram photo-sharing page.
The news has further heightened concerns that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students said that children who use a “right” account do not have bad content for parents to view, and that they also have a separate account.
A mother accidentally finds the secret page of her 13-year-old daughter, and finds a teenager calling out to others “rape me.”
According to a study by the United Kingdom Awareness Association and the HMC in constituent schools, 40% of children between the ages of 11 and 18 have two profiles, and half of them admit to having a private account.
Mike Buchanan, director of HMC, said: “It’s worrying when many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces that parents and teachers can’t find.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the "representative of athletes" at the Scottish Football Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Board of Governors as the non-executive director at the annual meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most memorable athlete in Scotland, and President Ian Beattie sees this change as a great opportunity for sports coaches to take advantage of her rich match experience on the international arena over the past decade.
"Eilidh is highly respected in the Scottish, UK and worldwide crowded community, and we are sure that crowded in Scotland will benefit greatly from her election to the council," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I want to be a representative of the athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help lead this sport in Scotland."
An American, who had previously won gold medals for 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, he had all four Olympic gold medals and is now a regular commentator on the BBC, who was unable to go back after a heart attack.
He tweeted: “A month ago I was hit.
I can't go.
Doctors say that there is only time to answer whether or not I am recovering or in what condition.
It was a tiresome journey but to fully recover, to learn how to travel again and now I was able to travel fast!
Thank you for your motivating messages!”
Advertising Milk Suction Machine Compares Mothers to Cow's Dairy Disagreements Online
A company that specializes in milking machines divides comments online with an ad that compares breastfeeding mothers to cows that are milked.
To mark the launch of the product, which is considered to be “the world’s first wearable and non-noise-free milksucker,” consumer technology company Elvie launched a new ad inspired by her music videos for self-expression.
Four mothers jump in a dry-grassed cow cage with a song that reads: "Yes, I've got my own milk, but you don't see any tail, and "In case you don't realize, these aren't breasts, they're my breasts."
The message goes on: “Put the milk out, suck the milk out, I’m feeding the kids, suck the milk out, suck the milk out, I’m sucking the milk out for my girls.”
However, this ad, posted on the company’s Facebook page, has caused a lot of controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received a lot of negative feedback from the audience, with many opinion that the ad considers the "horror" of the dairy industry to be mild.
“It’s a bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, we also have to conceive and give birth to milk, except for cows that are robbed of their mother's cows within a few days of birth," one wrote.
Elvie's Milk Vacuum Cleaner Is Uniquely Enclosed Inside Breastfeeding T-Shirt (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: “This can cause psychological harm to both the mother and the baby.
That’s right, why not use it to advertise a milking machine for breastfeeding mothers?”
Another commented: “This advertisement has nothing to do with it.”
There are those who also defend the advertisement, one woman admits that she sees the song as "very fun".
“I think it’s a unique idea.
I'll buy myself one if I'm still breastfeeding.
The real sucking of milk made me feel like a cow.
This ad is a little crazy, but I understand its message.
This is a unique product," another commented.
Another commented: “This is an interesting advertisement aimed at mothers who need to smoke milk (usually at work or in the toilet) and they feel like “cowboys”.
This is not an advertisement of praise or an appraisal of the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women revealed that they had danced with a milk vacuum cleaner hidden in their underwear.
The idea behind this campaign is based on the fact that many women suck milk to breastfeed says they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie milk vacuum cleaner never makes any noise, no wires or tubes, and it sits tightly inside the breastfeeding shirt, allowing women to move freely, carry babies and even go outside while sucking milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother commented: “The Elvie Milk Suction Machine is truly a revolutionary product, worthy of a bold introduction and encouraging curiosity.
When comparing women to cows, we want people to know about dairy products and the related challenges, while at the same time expressing fun and empathy for the freedom that new dairy products bring to mothers.
This isn’t the first time Elvie’s milksuckers have appeared on the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the catwalk floor of designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children quietly move to a tent on the Texas border
The number of migrant children in detention has increased dramatically despite the fact that the number of people crossing the border on a monthly basis has remained virtually unchanged, partly because of the harsh arguments and policies put forward by the Trump administration that have made the process of bringing children to donors more difficult.
According to tradition, most donors have been immigrants without paperwork, and they are concerned that receiving an immigrant child may affect their ability to stay in their own U.S.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential donors and other adult members of their families would have to take fingerprints, and this data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency, testified before Congress that the agency had detained dozens of applicants for funding for unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had never been convicted before.
“Nearly 80 percent of donors or family members are here illegally, and most of them have had pre-financing.
So we are continuing to prosecute these individuals,” Mr. Albence said.
According to staff working in refugee camps, in order to be able to quickly deal with cases involving these children, officials have issued a new regulation requiring some donors to appear in court within a month of detention, rather than after 60 days, according to the previous standard.
Many people will appear through a video conference call, rather than being directly present, to rectify their legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who have been tried are deemed ineligible for protection will be deported quickly.
The longer children are held, the more they become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent behavior or an attempt to escape, according to staff at refugee camps and reports from the system in recent months.
Supporters say concerns are increasing at a larger facility like Tornillo, where they see a child struggling with difficulty who is more likely to be overlooked because of the size of the camp too large.
They added that bringing children to a refugee camp city without allowing children enough time to mentally prepare or say goodbye to friends could cause psychological injuries that many children are suffering from.
Syria proposes U.S., French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw from the country immediately
Speaking before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called for Syrian refugees to return to the country, despite the civil war moving to its eighth year.
Moualem, the deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil, meaning anti-terrorist forces, so “will be treated.”
“They have to withdraw from Syria unconditionally and immediately,” he told the council.
Moualem stressed that “the war on terrorism in Syria is nearing its end”, with more than 360,000 people dead since 2011, with millions having to leave their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to “fight in this holy war until we clear terrorist groups out of the entire territory of Syria” and “the illegal presence of foreign forces.”
The U.S. currently has about 2,000 troops in Syria, specializing in training and mentoring both Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the country that are being destroyed by war.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said the country's previous conditions were good enough for them to return, and he blamed "some Western countries" for "infuriating fears" that the refugees would not return.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to create conditions for the return of refugees,” he said.
“They’re using the military for humanitarian purposes.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a neutral zone in the last rebel region of Idlib had created an opportunity to push for political negotiations.
The deal between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed the deal had a “clear deadline” and expressed hope that military action would target holy elements including fighters from the Nusra Front affiliated with Al-Qaeda, who were “will be wiped out.”
U.N. Special Representative Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of the new committee including the government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, he said the committee's work was limited to "reviewing the terms of the current constitution" and warning not to interfere in the elections.
Why Trump Will Win in the Second Term <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Logically, President Trump will win the re-election in 2020 unless the criminal proceedings and scandals put an end to his presidency ahead of time, as liberals are hoping.
This is clearly the “most tragic tragedy of a president’s term!”
So far, there have been no signs of heat loss.
Since 2014, the number of viewers of the golden hour has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News now has 2.4 million viewers at the golden hour, compared to 1.7 million viewers from four years ago, and MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” has ranked the top of the cable chart with more than 3.5 million viewers at the top news points.
“Although I don’t understand it, many people are still being drawn to it like they are,” said Neal Baer, who runs ABC’s “Designated Survivor” television show, about an interior secretary becoming president after an attack that destroyed the House of Representatives.
Nell Scovell, a former playwright and author of the book "Just the Funny Parts: and the book " Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club," has another hypothesis.
She recalled a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her that he would vote for Trump.
You asked me why? why?
"He replied, 'Because he made me laugh,'" Mrs. Scovell told me so.
This is an interesting thing in the context of chaos.
Of course, unlike what is happening on TV, any move in Washington can decide the future of Roe v. Wade, or the amalgamation of immigrant families and the global economic situation.
Only a few TV viewers have the privilege of choosing their channel.
No, this is even more appealing than the Washington Post when you win six hours to see a group of experts arguing about the use of Bob Woodward’s “deep” information in the book “Fear,” or the “Daniel’s” coat of arms.
I changed my mind about Super Mario.
"One of the things he does is always bring you something new every night that makes it look like a reality TV show," according to Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the author of the "Pawn Stars" show.

This week I had a conversation with Fleiss, outside the house on the north coast of Kauai under 80 degrees, but he was hiding inside to watch MSNBC while filming for CNN.
He couldn’t leave the TV screen at the very least when Brett Kavanaugh was running in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was on the table.
"I remember the days when we were doing those crazy shows and people were saying, 'This is the beginning for the end of Western civilization,'" Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Money from the outside was poured into the midterm elections that were the most trained for the race into the White House.
It’s no surprise that Pennsylvania’s 17th constituency is witnessing a cash rain, as the reorganization of the congressional area has forced the two candidates to race in the same seat.
The recent territorial reorganization in Pittsburg County struck Democratic Party Representative Conor Lamb – who won a seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is racing with Republican candidate Keith Rothfus, who is now representing the former 12 counties in Pennsylvania, which share multiple boundaries with the new 17 counties.
The main map was rescheduled after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old counties were arranged to be fraudulent in a way that was in the interest of the Republican Party.
The race in the new 17th district has become a financial race between the party's main funding organizations, the Democratic Committee on Congressional Campaigns (DCCC) and the Republican Committee on National Campaigns (NRCC).
Lamb was a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a stellar victory in the popular March special election for Pennsylvania’s 18th congressional district.
The position previously belonged to the Republican Party for more than a decade and President Donald Trump has won 20 points in the district.
Political commentators have rated the Democratic Party a lot higher.
The U.S. has considered sanctioning El Salvador for its support of China, but has since withdrawn.
Diplomats note that the Dominican Republic and Panama have recognized Beijing, and Washington has hardly made any objections.
President Trump had a meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and the president had once owned a hotel in Panama until business partners fired the Trump Organization’s management team.
U.S. foreign ministry officials have decided to recall U.S. diplomatic mission leaders from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to "recent decisions on Taiwan's non-recognition", according to the ministry's spokeswoman Heather Nauert.
But sanctions are only considered for El Salvador, which received US$140 million in aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, including cuts in financial aid and visa restrictions for some subjects, would cause major losses to the Central American country that currently has a high unemployment and crime rate.
As internal meetings were taking place, U.S. and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic issues to re-organize a similar meeting last year that was once seen as a step forward in the effort to prevent U.S. entry.
But by mid-September, senior officials had declared that they wanted to continue the conference, helping to end the consideration of sanctions against the United States.
Diplomats said Vice President Mike Pence is currently scheduled to speak at the conference, which is scheduled to take place in mid-October, when there are signals of implementation of administrative measures.
And the three U.S. special envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any message or harsh punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal discussions on condition of anonymity.
Their information has been certified by an outside analyst who has a close relationship with the government and also spoke anonymously.
History of research.
The next bomb could be a report by special counsel Robert Mueller on President Trump’s obstruction of justice, which now has plenty of evidence in the public record.
It is widely believed that Mueller is shifting his investigation into the issue of cooperation between President Trump and Russia in the presidential election.
If there is a change in the party in parliament, President Trump will face a lot of difficulties in parliament, just before the preparations for the election campaign, and even with those in the same party.
There are a lot of problems, I don’t mean to mention President Trump’s departure is inevitable – just like his counterparts in Europe.
Both sides of the Atlantic coast need to make choices, and this will affect the length of time this struggle will take.
In 1938, German officials were willing to carry out a coup d'état against Hitler, if the West had agreed to oppose and support the Czech Republic in Munich.
We have failed, and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of massacres.
History revolves around such milestones, and the unrelenting struggles of the Democratic Party will increase or delay.
The Americans have to face some of these milestones.
What would happen if President Trump fired Deputy Justice Rod Rosenstein, who controls the fate of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein seems to have been sitting in a pile of fires since there were reports last year that he proposed the president’s slurred recording secrecy and speculation that the president was not fit for office.
Mr. Rosenstein’s Institute attests to the information of the Times is inaccurate.
“How will we react if the new FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair — or if he confirms with the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest statements?
Above all, are we going to vote in the middle of the term for a Congress so that this body will force Mr. Trump to take responsibility?
If we fail in these challenges, democracy will lose power for a long time to come.
But I believe that we will not fail, because I had a lesson in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime that took over our home.
She survived, emigrated to the United States, and, 60 years later, she gave me the opportunity to light candles on the Sabbath.
With my legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

Graham Dorrans' optimism for the Ranger team ahead of the clash with Rapid Vienna
The Rangers played against Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win over the Austrians, after an impressive match in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, would give them the advantage of winning the Europa League G-League.
The knee injury prevented defender Graham Dorrans from appearing for the first time in the season until a 2–2 draw with Villarreal but he believed the Rangers could use that result as a kicker for better things.
"It's a good thing for us because Villarreal is a strong team," the 31-year-old said.
“We were in the game with the belief that we would win a point.
It’s a shame we can win at the end of the game, but the conciliation ratio is also a good result.
They may have played better in the first half but we have countered in the second half and have a better stance.
Next year, it will be an important match in Europe.
“Hopefully we could win three points but it would be a tough game because they had good results in the previous game, but with the opposition of the fans, I’m sure we can get over and get good results.
“Last year was a difficult period, I was injured and the changes at the club but now I feel very good.
The team is good, the players have good stance and good quality of training.
We hope that we can continue to go deeper to reap a successful new season.”
Women Are So Worried About Sleep Deprivation Because of Retirement Problems
Despite the fact that the survey participants are well aware of what they care about, few people communicate with family members.
About half of the nationwide study participants said they had talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
These are the steps to get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t mentally prepare your family to take care of you if you don’t express your desires first.
Talk to your counselor and family to discuss the location and how it is taken care of, as those choices can be an important factor in determining costs.
Carrying with your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you outline the payment method for those costs.
Your financial options for long-term care purposes may include traditional long-term care insurance policies, cash-worth life insurance policies to help cover these costs or self-purchase insurance with your own money – as long as you have it.
Preparing Legal Documents thoroughly: Avoid legal battles that may occur.
There is a health care plan available so that you can appoint a reliable person to oversee the health care process and ensure that the specialists comply with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
In addition, consider the authorization of your financial statements.
You should choose a reliable person to make financial decisions for you and ensure that you pay your bills if you do not have sufficient capacity.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine that your parents are in a medical emergency and are on their way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
List those details so that you’re always ready.
“It’s not just a financial issue, it’s a doctor thing,” Martin asked.
“What kind of medications are there?
Who will take care of the dog?
You've already made a plan."
The man fired several shots at the school in Ilfracombe.
A man was shot with gunshots on his way home last night.
The victim, about 40, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and arms.
Police described the shooting, which took place at around 2:30 BST, as a "self-propelled activity."
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries were not life-threatening and the police called for witnesses.
Earthquakes and Waves in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and wave that struck Indonesia’s city of Palu on Friday, officials said the death toll was expected to rise.
Communications were cut off, aid workers were unable to receive any information from the Donggala administration, a region north of Palu close to the heart of the 7.5-degree earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster occurred.
Here are some key events about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 as of 2017.
The city is celebrating 40 years since the earthquake and the tidal wave took place.
Donggala is a capital of more than 300 km (180 miles) along the northwest coast of the island of Sulawesi.
The capital, an administrative region under the province's management, has an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the two main sectors of the economy in Sulawesi province, especially the Donggala coast.
Nickel mining is also an important industry here, but mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the coast opposite Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by waves several times over the past 100 years, according to Indonesia’s Oriental Relief Agency.
In 1938, a thunderstorm killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A thunderstorm also erupted in western Donggara in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is in the Pacific Belt of Fire and is often hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tidal waves that have occurred in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a wave of attacks on 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of which were recorded.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake in southern Java, Indonesia’s most populous island, caused a massive tremor that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A powerful 7.6-degree earthquake occurs near the city of Padang, the capital of eastern Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people have died.
2010: A powerful 7.5-degree earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai, off the Sumatra Sea, causing a 10-metre-high tremor, destroying dozens of villages and killing about 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake strikes the capital of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing damage and panic when people remember the destruction of the 2004 earthquake and deadly waves.
Earthquakes did not cause waves, but more than 100 people were killed by collapsed buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit Indonesia’s tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly concentrated in the north of the island.
Earthquakes have destroyed thousands of buildings and put thousands of temporary tourists in jail.
Sarah Palin's Son Arrested for Domestic Violence
Track Palin, the son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for the attack.
Palin, 29, in Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a report on domestic violence and anti-arrest warrants, according to a report published Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to a police report, when a woman tried to call the police to report the crime leading up to the hospital, he was on the phone.
Palin is being held in Mat-Su and has to submit a non-guarantee of $500, according to a KTUU report.
He appeared in court on Saturday, claiming he was "definitely innocent" when he was asked to be acquitted, according to the report.
Palin faces three Class A offenses, meaning he could be jailed for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He has also been charged with minor B offences, jailed for a day and fined $2,000.
This is not the first time criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack on the hospital.
The case is currently pending at the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, meddling in reports of domestic violence, and possessing weapons in a state of non-awakening related to the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of punching her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticised by former militant groups in 2016 after linking her son’s violent behavior to PTSD after serving in Iraq.
Earthquake in Indonesia: Hundreds dead
At least 384 people were killed in the earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A powerful 7.5-degree earthquake has caused waves and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been cut off, with the number of deaths expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake took place just outside the center of Sulawesi, northeast of Indonesia’s capital Jakarta.
The video is being posted on the social media sites showing the timing of the disaster.
Hundreds of people were concentrating on a beach festival in the city of Palu when the wave came.
Federal prosecutors are proposing a death sentence for suspected terrorist attacker in NYC.
Federal prosecutors in New York are suing Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack who killed eight people — a rare punishment that has not been carried out in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is believed to have used a truck for rent by Home Depot to carry out the attack on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and cyclists on October 10.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily injury, according to a notice of a proposed death sentence, filed in the South New York County.
Both of these crimes can be sentenced to death, according to court documents.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal prosecution charged Saipov with a count of 22 counts of murder, including eight counts of murder, often used by federal prosecutors in organized criminal cases and indictments.
The attack called for "detailed planning and pre-station planning," prosecutors said, describing Saipov's way of doing it as "horrendous, ruthless and inhumane".
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has injured, damaged and lost the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro the Damian.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York executed the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to death in September 2009.
The last execution in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were executed after they were convicted of spying on the Soviet Union in the Cold War two years ago.
Rosenberg's wife was executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a Uzbek, did not express regret after the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators that he felt good about what he was doing, police said.
Saipov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS video on the phone, according to the report.
He also asked to hang the ISIS flag in the hospital room, police said.
He has not pleaded guilty to 22 counts of indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal attorneys representing Saipov, said they were "completely disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
“We think that the decision to execute the death penalty instead of accepting a conviction with a general prison sentence without the possibility of release will only prolong the damage of this event to those involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s recovery team had previously asked prosecutors not to give the death penalty.
Conservative MPs say Nigel Farage should take responsibility for Brexit negotiations <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Nigel Farage said he would “mobilize the people” in a rally at the Conservative party’s conference.
Former Ukip leader said politicians must "feel the heat" from European skeptics - because one of Prime Minister Theresa May's MPs suggested he should be held accountable for negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative proponent Peter Bone said at a rally in Birmingham that the UK had "get out of the alliance" right now if Farage was Brexit minister.
But the challenge that Prime Minister May faces as he tries to reconcile the deep divide between Conservative MPs, who support staying in the European Union, has taken part in a protest against Brexit.
The prime minister is struggling to maintain a plan of compromise between the attacks on the part of those who support Brexit, those who support staying and the European Union.
The Allies say they will push it forward by trying to reach an agreement with Brussels despite a strong reaction - and forcing European skeptics and the Labour Party to choose between 'short-plan' and 'short-plan'.
Bone said at a Leave Means Leave protest in Solihull that he wanted to “oppose the Chequers plan.”
He suggested Farage should be in the senate and be in charge of the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he's in charge, we're probably out of the league now," he said.
Wellingborough added: "I will support Brexit but we need to oppose the Chequers plan."
He testified to his opposition to the European Union: “We are not fighting in world wars to subjugate others.
“We want to build our own laws.”
Mr. Bone rejected the proposal that the opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain in the alliance is completely false.”
Andrea Jenkyns, a Brexit proponent of the Conservative Party, was also present at the protest, speaking to reporters: “I just want to say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“Not many people are condescending to the Chequers plan, the opposition will not vote for this plan, which often does not happen to our party, our activists, who are willing to call for the support of the people and vote for us from the start.
“Give up the Chequers plan and listen to the people.”
In a message to May, she added: “Prime Ministers hold their seats when they keep their promises to the people.”
Farage said politicians had to participate in the protests to “feel the heat” if they changed the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
“This is a matter of trust between us — the people — and the political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to give up Brexit and we’re here today to say, ‘We’re not going to let you do that.’”
In a message to supporters, he added: “I want the political class, who are intent on changing Brexit, to feel the heat of the current situation.
“We are mobilizing the people who have brought Brexit victory and we will never surrender until we become an independent, autonomous and proud UK,” he said.
Meanwhile, the supporters of the stay marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour demonstration in the city centre.
Some activists raised the Conservative Party’s voice against Brexit after the group’s launch this weekend.
Labour MP Lord Adonis has ridiculed the Conservatives about the security issues they are facing at the opening of the conference.
“These are the people who once told us that they can control the IT system and all the technologies that Canada provides, including the issue of free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“This is totally a game.
“Brexit is not a good thing,” he added.
Warren wants to “elect” the president’s seat.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would decide to "elect the president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that Massachusetts Democratic Party MPs spoke about her future when she gave a speech in the city hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, was re-elected in November, in a race with GOP state representative Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of Trump’s 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
People are guessing that she could take Trump’s place in 2020.
The event took place on Saturday afternoon at Holyoke is her 36th meeting with voters in the main town hall since President Trump took office.
One of the attendees asked her about her intention to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time "women need to take part in politics to reform the government and there needs to be a woman at the head."
Arrested in LSU's Sims Shooting Death
On Saturday, police in Baton Rouge, La., claimed that a suspect had been arrested in the shooting of LSU's Wayde Sims basketball player on Friday.
Baton Rouge police said they arrested 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11 a.m.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help in determining the identity of the man in the film.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday morning.
“The Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and were killed,” Murphy J. Paul, a police officer, told the media on Saturday, on sports channel 247.
Wayde intervened to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being on the scene, possessed of weapons, and confessed to shooting the Wayde Sims.
Simpson was immediately arrested and detained at the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
As a teenager who was 1.98m tall and grew up at Baton Rouge, the Sims played 32 games with 10 games in the official team in the previous season with an average play time of 17.4 minutes, earning 5.6 points and 2.9 points per game.
Grand Prix in Russia: Lewis Hamilton won the world championship after winning against Sebastian Vettel.
Valtteri Bottas clearly had an advantage over Lewis Hamilton on Saturday when Mercedes was still a strong team in the season.
From the starting point, Bottas had a good start and successively surpassed Hamilton to defend his position in the first two races and made Vettel fight his own teammates.
Vettel entered the first pit and left Hamilton on his way back into the race, a decisive action.
The Mercedes into the pit behind Vettel, but Hamilton again outperformed due to the driver on the Ferrari forced to slow down in order to avoid the risk after two laps in order to protect the third place.
Max Verstappen started in the back row of the race and took seventh place when he finished one straight on his 21st birthday.
He then led the whole race as he did not change tires to get to the finish quickly and passed Kimi Raikkonen to win fourth place.
He eventually entered the pit in the 44th round but was unable to speed up in the remaining eight rounds when Raikkonen took fourth place.
It was a gay race because Valtteri played very well over the weekend and it was really a rebound racer.
“Finally the team had an excellent race to win number one and number two,” Hamilton said.
It's a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein in the campaign on Saturday for insisting that she did not leak a letter from Christine Blasey Ford about the Supreme Court’s allegations of sexual assault in the Brett Kavanaugh case.
Speaking during the campaign on the West Virginia coast, the president did not directly target the announcement made by Ford to the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting that what is happening in the Senate shows people "not bad intentions and honesty."
“It’s been happening and what’s been going on in the last few days at the Senate is great, you can feel the anger, you can see the angry, the ugly and the annoying and the dishonest,” he said.
“When they see the papers and read the leaked news and they say, ‘Oh, I’m not the one doing that.
I didn’t do that.”
Do you remember that?
Dianne Feinstein, you leaked the news, didn't you?
Remember her answer... she leaked the document right-- "Oh my God, what's going on?
No, no, no.
I’m not leaking.”
Come on, wait a minute.
We leaked ... No, we didn’t do that,” the president repeated the senator’s words.
Feinstein had been sent a detailed letter to Ford about the allegations against Kavanaugh in July and the information had been leaked earlier in September – but Feinstein denied that her office was leaking the information.
“I don’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I don’t leak her story,” Feinstein told the committee.
"She asked me to keep a secret and I kept a secret as she requested."
But the president seems dissatisfied with her rejection behavior and he commented in the Saturday night campaign: “I’m going to tell you about that, it’s actually a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but it’s the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing to protect the Supreme Court’s candidate, who has been accused of sexual abuse by three women, the president said the Democrats were using the allegations for their own purposes.
“They’re determined to regain power in every way.
You will see meaning and discomfort because they don’t care who will hurt, they want power and control,” the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars win 5-3 against Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants in a game against Dundee.
The Dundee Stars made up for the loss of the Belfast Giants on Friday in the Elite League with a 5-3 win in the back row over Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants scored two goals early thanks to the goals scored by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie cleared the home team before Dwyer scored more points for the Giants.
Francois Bouchard went on to clear Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen scored two goals to help the team win the match.
It was the team's third defeat in the team's Elite League season led by Adam Keefe, who beat Dundee 2-1 in a game held at Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth confrontation between the two sides this season, and the Giants had won in the previous three games.
Dwy's opening goal in the fourth minute at just 3:35 p.m. with the help of Kendall McFaull and David Rutherford also helped Beauvillier double the goal apart just four minutes later.
In the early minutes, Sullivan helped the team to shorten the score in the 13:10 minute before Matt Marquardt became a player who helped Cownie beat the score in the 15:16 minute.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead position in the 1st round when scoring the second goal at the end of the league.
The home team agreed and Bouchard again scored in proportions with a spectacular score in the 27:37 minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen lead Dundee to the end of the second half and he scored the fifth goal for his team in the final minutes of the match.
The Giants have lost four in the last five games, currently resting to wait for the next game against Milton Keynes on Friday.
Air traffic controllers have sacrificed their lives to save hundreds of passengers on planes who escaped the earthquake.
Air traffic controllers in Indonesia are being hailed as a hero after sacrificing to ensure that the plane carries hundreds of passengers can take off safely.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tidal wave.
The strike continues to take place in the region and many people are trapped in debris in the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues ran away to keep him alive, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, 21, refused to leave his position at the control tower, which was shaken by strong winds at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He stayed to ensure that the aircraft carrying Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the ice at the time, could take off safely.
Then he jumped out of the unguarded control tower because he thought it had collapsed.
And then he died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision saved lives, according to Australia's ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he stopped breathing before the plane reached Palu.
“Our hearts broke when we received this news,” he added.
Meanwhile, officials fear that the death toll could rise to thousands, a spokesman for the national disaster relief agency said it was difficult to reach the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"The death toll continues to rise as many bodies are still trapped under the rubble and we have not reached many," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
The six-metre wave has destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aeroplanes provide auxiliary supplies and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute that passes, there is an ambulance carrying the bodies.
Clean water is very rare.
“Small markets are being looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is racing to support survivors but we don’t know how the situation is there.
It’s a tragedy, but the situation can get worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo came to Palu on Sunday and said to the National Army: "I wish all of you would work day and night to complete all evacuation-related tasks.
“Are you ready?” he told CNN. . . .
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok, which killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini says one man is missing after plane crash at seaside
The carrier that crashed in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia said one man was missing, after a previous statement that all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the plane that was sinking.
Air Niugini said in a press release that, until Saturday afternoon, we could not find a male passenger.
The airline said it worked with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to a request to provide additional passenger details, such as age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
On Friday, officials said seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said the six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday, and all of them were still in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events is not yet clear.
Both the U.S. Air Force and the Navy said the plane landed at the wreckage shortly after leaving the ice.
Some witnesses believe that the plane had a lack of track.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was at a very low altitude.
"This is a good thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others could crawl through deep water to the north to reach emergency exit doors on a sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants were panicked and yelling, and he was slightly injured in the head.
The U.S. Navy said the sailors working nearby while repairing the port bridge also helped rescue by using a jetty to pick up people on the shore before the plane sank at a depth of about 30 meters (100 feet).
Air safety data shows that 111 people have died in accidents of airlines registered in the PNG network over the past two decades but no cases related to Air Niugini.
Analysts say the girl was roasted alive at night.
On the basis of Saturday’s record of the retrial of a man accused of roasting a woman in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. State Department analyst Paul Rowlett has been witnessing in court for hours as an intelligence analyst.
He demonstrated to the jury how to use mobile recordings to summarise the movement of defendant Quinton Tellis, 21, and victim Jessica Chambers, 19, on the night she died.
Rowlett said he had received location data from a number of mobile phones showing Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, contrary to his previous statement, the Clarion Ledger newspaper reported.
The data showed that his cell phone was in the same location as Chambers's phone during the time he said he was staying with a friend named Michael Sanford, a police officer who questioned Sanford.
Sanford testified before the court on Saturday and testified that he was not in the town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying because my truck is in Nashville."
Another controversial detail is that Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks before she died.
Mobile phone records show that they only knew each other for about a week.
Rowlett said that occasionally after Chambers’ death, Tellis deleted Chambers’ messages, calls, and communications from his phone.
"He's got you out of his life," Hale said.
The attorney general's office is expected to begin the closed debate on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial of the jury on that day.
High Breed Group: What Is Hip Hop Positive?
The team of three hip hop artists wants to oppose the negative views of this genre by putting positive messages into their music.
The High Breed group, from Bristol, claimed that hip hop no longer conveyed political messages and solved social issues.
The band wanted to bring this genre back to its true origins and re-popularize the positive hip hop lineup.
Recently, artists such as the Fugees and Commons have gained more fame in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Is there another black man?
NY sues couple who fired her after texting "racial discrimination"
A sister in New York Nanny has sued a couple who fired her for discrimination after she missed a wrong message from her mother complaining that she was "a black man."
The couple rejected them as racists, calling the lawsuit a "money laundering" case.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, was depressed when she discovered her new baby sister, Giselle Maurice, who was black on the first day she got a job in 2016.
“Don’t worry, don’t worry about it,” Plasco-Flaxman told her husband.
However, instead of texting her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After realizing the confusion, Plasco-Flaxman "disgusted" dismissed Maurice, she said that her African-born baby sister was about to leave the job and that she hoped to have a Filipino baby, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid the day by day and went home to Uber on her own.
Now, Ms. Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for dismissal with $350 a day for the six-month period of work she was hired to receive money even though they did not sign any contract between them.
“I want to show them, look, you shouldn’t do things like that,” she told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple objected to allegations that they were racially discriminatory, saying Maurice’s termination was logical because of fears that they could not trust her after insulting her.
“My wife sent her a message that she wasn’t going to send.
She's not a racial discriminator.
We are not racists,” husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But can you give your child to someone you’ve offended, even because you’ve been wronged?
What about the newborn baby?
Let's talk about it."
Comparing the case to a "money laundering" case, Plasco said his wife had been giving birth for two months and was in a "very difficult situation."
“How are you going to deal with someone like that?
This is not a thing to do," the investment banker added.
While the legal proceedings were taking place, the stream of commentary quickly paused on the couples on social media, their behavior and the logic of the story.
Paddington's publisher fears readers won't be interested in the story of a bear who knows how to talk, the letter said.
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, was born shortly after the book was widely accepted by readers, the letter reveals: “It’s hard to put yourself in someone else’s place when reading the book for the first time is published.
It’s great to know now about Paddington’s great success.”
When talking about his father, a filmmaker for the BBC before being inspired to write a children's book from a small toy bear, he still felt optimistic when his work was "rejected" a year later, when she shared in the celebration of the 60th anniversary.
When talking about Paddington, she described her as “a very important member of our family,” adding that her father was always silently proud of her success.
"You're a pretty shallow man, and you're not an explosive," she said.
“But because Paddington actually exists with him, it’s almost like having a child and it’s got certain successes: you’re proud of them even if they don’t really exist.
I think you've seen Paddington's march that way.
Although it was a product of his creativity and imagination, he always earned a certain place for Paddington.”
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
As soon as her daughter landed, she was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life but were useless.
“I call Nad often to say that this is bad and she doesn’t like it,” said Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I got a call from Nad saying that she would stop breathing in two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll see you soon.
I will always be with you.
The doctors pumped the heart-assisted medication and slowly pulled the tube out of her body.
She stopped breathing a few times and this was the last time.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that all this was not yet closed.
I can’t cry or scream or cry because I’m with my family and people.
I must be the one who binds them.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now still saddened by her daughter’s departure, boarded the plane along with the other passengers – facing the challenge she would have to overcome.
"No one knows," she said.
“I bow my head and cry all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but when I was on the flight I felt compassion for Nad.
The boy needed my love and understanding.
I know how much she loves you.”
Woman Suffers Posting Postcards to Prevent Suicides on Bridge
The two women have lost their suicidal relatives trying to stop others from stealing their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys posted placards on the Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call to be supported.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, at the age of 13, suffered from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parents to be in the feeling that I have to go through every day,” she said.
The 45-year-old Davis, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with a hearty laugh.
“Everybody knows it because of that laughter.
They often say the boy’s laughter lights up every room.”
However, he quit his job before committing suicide because he found himself "in a really dark place."
In 2014, Tyler’s 11-year-old brother also left as his brother after ending his own life.
Mrs. Davis said: “I’m constantly worried that there will be a chain reaction.”
Davis designed the intervention boards, "to let people know that there are always people so that you can meet, chat or even make friends.
Don’t live in silence – you need to talk.”
Humphreys, a friend of Mrs. Davies's for many years, lost Mark, his life partner 15 years ago, not long after his mother's death.
“He’s not talking about feeling bored or disappointed or anything like that,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed that he had changed his attitude.
He was bored at school on Christmas Day - when the kids opened the presents and he didn't want to look at them or anything around."
She said her husband’s death was a huge loss to them, but they still had to try to get over it: “This has caused a huge loss in our family.
It breaks our hearts.
But we’re all going to continue to live and fight it.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is shattered when the FBI starts investigating
Mr. Flake said on Saturday that "I think, if we can really get something like what he asked for--a limited investigation of time, limited scope, then we can collect a little bit of bribes," he added that he feared "the commissions would."
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is only a matter of time.
The midterm elections lasted five weeks, on November 6 - if as expected, Republicans who are currently in a very bad state will be even weaker in trying to find the representative they want to vote for in the highest position.
George W. Bush called the senators, running the hallway in support of Kavanaugh, who had been an assistant to the White House under President Bush, from where he was able to reach his wife, Ashley, who was President Bush’s personal secretary.
What Happens After The FBI Announces Reports?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there will be 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats from the Democratic Party.
It is not yet clear whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 Senate votes, which allows Mike Pence, now vice president, to remove the tie knob and confirm the candidate’s position in the Supreme Court.
The number of North Koreans excavated 'strongly' under Kim
The number of North Koreans has fallen sharply since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago, a lawmaker in South Korea said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the unification of South Korea, said there were 1,127 excavations last year – compared to 2,706 excavations in 2011.
Park said tightening of border controls between North Korea and China and the large proportion of smugglers detained were key elements of the change.
Pyongyang did not make any public remarks.
Most of the excavators from North Korea were eventually granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most excavators flee through China, the country with the longest common border with North Korea, and they can easily cross the strictly protected non-military zone (DMZ) between the two countries.
China considers the excavators to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often forces them to return.
The relationship between North Korea and South Korea – technically still in a state of war – has improved significantly in recent months, the report said.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to hold talks focused on the issue of de-nuclearization.
The move comes after a historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, both sides agreed to extend the terms to advance to the North Korean peninsula's nuclear arsenal.
But on Saturday, North Korea’s Secretary of State Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions that caused the delay in the process.
"If there is no confidence on the U.S. side, there will be no trust in our national security issues and in such a case, there is no other way that we will unilaterally find our own solution," Ri said in a statement to the U.S. Congress.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh a “extremely provocative part,” and said he was not fit for a position at the Supreme Court.
Minority Phe leader Nancy Pelosi called the nominee for the Supreme Court position, Brett Kavanaugh, a "extremely enthusiastic death" and said he was temporarily unsuitable for serving in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented in an interview held on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t help but I think if a woman did that, they’d call it a ‘extreme death,’” Pelosi said of her response to Kavanaugh’s statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh insisted on rejecting allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when the two were young.
In the opening statement, Kavanaugh revealed a lot of emotions, there were moments when he almost cried out and was particularly concerned about family and the five months of high school.
He also strongly condemned the Democratic Party in front of the committee, calling the allegations against him an "act of the more planned assassination" due to anger over Hillary Clinton's loss in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's statement proved that he did not fit for a position in the Supreme Court, as he clearly expressed his behavior against the Democratic Party.
“I think he’s removed his position by himself when he made his statements and how he treated himself when it came to the Clinton family and the Democratic Party,” she said.
Pelosi refused to be asked if she had tried to accuse Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if the Democratic Party won a majority in the House.
“I’m going to say this — if he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he doesn’t have a seat in the Supreme Court that he has to sue,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the Court of Appeals in D.C.
Pelosi added, as a Democrat, she was interested in Kavanaugh’s ability to make a ruling against the Pocket Health Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he was considered a conservative judge.
In the hearing, Kavanaugh avoided the question of whether he had changed some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"This is not the time for a person who is over-excited, biased, and hopefully we'll say, 'This isn't great,'" Pelosi said.
Women need to know how to take advantage.
This is really a heavy criticism, this month over the next month, this year over the next year another greater anger, and she can’t get over it without crying the beast.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Ms. Steinem told me after 45 years.
“I don’t think that’s unusual, do you?”
She went on, "I've been a very helpful woman, she's a senior executive, she says she's also been crying when she's angry but to form a reaction when she's angry and starts crying, she'll say to the person she just talked to that, "You can think I'm sad because.
I'm angry."
And she continued to cry.
And I think this is great.”
You are allowed to cry so that this behavior is part of the way out of anger because basically they are being misunderstood.
One of my deepest memories of working at the first company was that it was a place just for men, I used to cry when my anger exploded, that is when I was hit by an older woman — that’s the cold manager that always made me feel scared.
She said to me, “Never let them see you cry.”
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and happy because they’re with you.”
Patricia Schroeder, later a Democratic MP in Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in his presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an affair on a boat called Monkey Business and left the race, Mrs. Schroeder was extremely disappointed, saying there was no reason why she could not stand up for the presidential election.
Thirty years later she laughed and said to me, “It wasn’t a smart decision.”
“There were seven other candidates in the race, and they needed another candidate.
Some people have called the race "Snow Leaf and the Seven Lions."
Due to late participation in the campaign, she was lost in the fundraising campaign, so she vowed not to participate in the campaign unless she raised $2 million.
The war has failed.
She found out that some supporters gave her $250 instead of $1,000 to support the male nominee.
You ask yourself, “Do they think I’m discounted?”
When she declared that she would not launch an official campaign, she had overcome emotions — expressing gratitude to those who supported her, disillusioned with the system that made it difficult for the fundraising process and targeted the electorate rather than the delegates, she said.
“You might think I’ve had a nervous breakdown,” Ms. Schroeder recalled how the press reacted to her.
“You thought Kleenex was the sponsor of my company.
I remember thinking about what they would put on my grave?
“Are you crying?”
The U.S.-China trade war could be a good signal for Beijing
Experts said the opening wing to the trade war between the United States and China had been halted, and the war would continue, a rift between countries could be an advantage for Beijing.
Earlier this year, U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning by taxing China’s main exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
Increasing escalation in recent weeks with a $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) tax rate hit half of China’s imports into the U.S.
Beijing has retaliated by raising tariffs from five to ten percent to $60 billion in U.S. goods.
China’s commitment to retaliate in line with U.S. action and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to slow down soon.
Washington’s ceding of the tariffs means Beijing has to make demands, but the public loss to the United States is too shameful for China’s president, Xi Jinping.
However, experts believe that if Beijing could bring up the right flags, the long-term pressure from the trade war with the United States could be a positive signal to China by mitigating the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a political decision in Washington or Beijing can both start an economic relationship in one of the two countries and this is actually far more dangerous than what has been previously recognized,” said Abigail Grace, a new Asia-focused researcher at the Security Center.
Syria 'ready' for refugees to return, says foreign minister <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Syria says it is ready to allow the refugees to return and is calling for help to rebuild the country that has been devastated by the more than seven-year war.
Speaking before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country were improving.
"Today, the national situation is more stable and safer thanks to the advances in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to renovate areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore living conditions.
All the present conditions are ready for the refugees to return voluntarily because they have left the country because of terrorism and the economic conditions that affect their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the war began in 2011.
Six million other people still live in the country in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome aid in rebuilding the country that was destroyed.
But he stressed that the country would not accept conditional aid or assistance from the countries that financed the insurgency.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by beating the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5–10.5 at Le Golf National in the outskirts of Paris, France.
The United States have lost six consecutive times in Europe and have not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the championship when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn scored 14.5 points when defeating the U.S. team.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who took part in most of the tournaments, threw his ball into the water in the third round in hole 16, admitting he lost Francesco Molinari.
Molinari's Italian golf hands shine in all rounds and become one of four players who have won 5-0-0 since the current season began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5–4 by the lowest-ranked player in the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
World top scorer Dustin Johnson, who lost 2-1 to England’s Ian Poulter, may have played the last Ryder Cup game in his career.
A former Ryder Cup player of eight seasons, Spanish Sergio Garcia has become the greatest champion of any tournament with a total of 25.5 points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t stop it.
It’s really been a tough year.
Thank you, Thomas, for choosing and trusting me.
I was so happy to get the cup.
As for my team, I’m glad I was able to help,” Garcia said of the aftermath of Europe’s victory.
He switched the torch to fellow John Ram, a golfer who defeated American legend Tiger Woods with a 2-1 in a singles game on Sunday.
“It’s great to be able to beat Tiger Woods, I grew up and admired him very much,” Rahm, 23, said in a statement.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a 13-21-3 record in the Ryder Cup.
The statistics of one of the greatest players of all time show that he has won 14 major titles and only stood behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team has tried their best to find tickets for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who are first-class golfers of the tournament.
U.S. team leader Jim Furyk said after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of the players, they fought very well.
This morning we were having a hard time because of the high temperatures in Europe.
We've been eliminated.
I'd like to thank Thomas.
He's an excellent team leader.
All 12 players on the team played very well.
“We’re going to refocus the team, I’m going to play the PGA in the US and the Ryder Cup and we’re going to continue to win the top of the table.
“I love all 12 players and I’m proud to be the captain.
I'd like to put on my hat, guys.
We've played very well."
