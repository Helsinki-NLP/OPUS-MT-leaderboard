The goods cost less than 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the value of the goods....
I'm a <0x23>PRS_ORG<0x23> customer and so it's not a problem for me.
All you need is a number or instructions what I should attach to the package so that it can be tracked by you as a return.
I ordered the <0x23>PRS_ORG<0x23> a few days ago... for 249<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>.
Today it costs 179<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>.
Honestly, I find that very annoying.
Do I need to cancel the order and reorder for the better price or is there another way of crediting?
In principle, I also believe that children should not be encouraged to take on a parental role for their younger siblings.
However, I think it is also good for big brothers to take care of the little ones in moderation.
Let's take a look, let's help, let's bring the bottle, etc.
In this way, they learn responsibility, help in the family and are involved.
As long as you are still a child, I don’t see a problem.
If your K1 works alone for a short time and it’s OK for him, that’s good.
It’s best for you to determine if it’s suitable for your children.
It is not that he should wrap K2 and accompany for hours at bedtime.
Legally, it is probably questionable.
Maybe that’s why the psychologist’s statement comes along.
Because if something like a fire, an earthquake, an earthquake, an alien invasion, etc. should actually happen, it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether this is a risk you want to take, of course, is your discretion ;)
Please help me find the title of a book again!
I remember reading a crime/thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the whole story but the title doesn’t want to happen anywhere anymore maybe someone here knows...
The story was about fear and treating it.
At the beginning of the story, an animal caregiver commits suicide by overloading himself with food and going to his predator cats.
The case is taken over by a commissioner who, after a brief investigation to his therapists, runs a clinic where he treats anxiety patients.
The Commissioner has a small niece who is also afraid (of fire) and lands with this therapist.
There is more suicide and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is commissioned anonymously to go to the suicide site and document and put the photos on the internet before each suicide.
In any case, it eventually turns out that this therapist operates a kind of underground therapy group where the patient implants a chip that suppresses a center of fear in the brain and ultimately confronts the patient with their fear in the most extreme way.
(One woman jumps out of the window and another goes to death with intent)
This confrontation of fear is referred to in the book as "the fight".
In the end there is a big showdown in the clinic that had to do with a fire.
That’s so the rough action I’m pretty sure the book was originally written by a French author/author.
If this action is known to anyone or even someone can tell me the title of the book I would be very happy.
Oh, I don't have the password for Wlan available.
I need to get in touch with my husband first.
But it can take a while.
What steps do I need to take after that?
Is it also possible to get back the price difference?
Child, 4 j., splitter under thumbnail
Child, four years old, has wooden splits under the thumbnail (outside) over the entire length.
I tried to pull him with a tweezer.
Very difficult to grasp.
It didn't work and it hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
No more chance.
Tomorrow we go to the doctor.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
Thanks to the combination of digital decoder and sound module on a printed circuit board, we reach dimensions of only 30mm x15.5mm and can therefore be installed in almost any locomotive of the track widths H0 and 0.
LokSound 5 Decoders are offered with all common interfaces and always come with a 11x15mm large "sugar cube" speaker next to the sound capsule kit.
Like all family members, LokSound5 is a true multi-protocol decoder.
It controls the DCC data format as well as Motorola<0xC2><0xAE>, Selectrix<0xC2><0xAE> and M4.
In DCC format, 14 to 128 driving steps are as natural as 2- and 4-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus<0xC2><0xAE>, the decoders automatically log in to a suitable digital center.
It masters all DCC programming modes and thanks to RailCom<0xC2><0xAE>, the CV values on the main rail can be read with appropriate centres.
For centers that can only program the CVs of 1-255 there are help registers.
Motorola<0xC2><0xAE> users benefit from up to 28 driving stages at 255 addresses.
Three more Motorola<0xC2><0xAE> addresses enable the triggering of 16 functions.
A built-in programming mode also enables reprogramming with the honorable Control Unit 6021.
The M4 protocol allows automatic logging in to mfx<0xC2><0xAE>-compatible centers.
The LokSound 5 decoder recognizes the Märklin<0xC2><0xAE> brake lines as well as ZIMO<0xC2><0xAE> HLU brake commands or the Lenz<0xC2><0xAE> ABC system.
Braking with DCC brake blocks or with DC voltage is also possible.
In addition, it also stops with a Selectrix<0xC2><0xAE> brake diode.
An automatic ABC commuter train allows automatic commuting between two stations.
The LokSound 5 decoder can be used on analogue DC and AC circuits.

Because of Omicron: Johnson wants to push for refresher
Increasingly new cases of Omicron provide policy and science in the UK.
Therefore, all eligible adults in England are expected to receive a vaccination offer by New Year.
LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to move even faster than previously expected in the face of rapidly rising micron numbers.
Every adult in England should have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year if at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said in a pre-recorded video message to his countrymen on Sunday night.
So far, the target date has been at the end of January.
The UK government will also provide additional support to speed up vaccination campaigns in parts of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
One is facing an emergency in the face of the Omicron variant, which is why vaccination protection urgently needs to be stepped up, Johnson said.
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased again with a third dose of the vaccine.
"Let's boost it now!" said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1,239 additional cases of omikron were recorded in the UK, bringing the total number to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of 65%. dpa
Will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price at pick-up?
I'm in favour of everyone presenting themselves with pronouns
I sent out an application.
Today the invitation came for a conversation by email.
I want to reply to the e-mail.
But unfortunately, the name is not a "Peter", but a slightly more complicated name.
I googled him and depending on where he/she has a cultural background here it is either a man or a woman.
**I have no idea how to write the email now.
Can someone help me, please?
** I'm a foreigner and I don't want an official to step over my feet.
Conclusion: Everyone should present themselves with pronouns.
I have a total of 5 books on it.
4 of them go.
Only the one I bought today won't go away
Obviously, the chair had an inconspicuous shortage in sales.
How else can such a pad damage occur after 9 months ?
First try on the <0x23>PRS_ORG<0x23>.
This has been working since approx.
14 days no more.
So I always bought the latest books through the website and then read on the <0x23>PRS_ORG<0x23>.
I bought 6 <0x23>PRS_ORG<0x23> and wanted to buy 8.
But there was no more.
Now they are available again and I would like you to add 2 chairs to the order and invoice this to me.
[CW] The feeling when I can't help.
Content Warning: I’m going to write a little bit about domestic violence here.
I just need to write something about my soul.
I (21) come into contact more often with victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence for professional reasons.
One topic that really bothers me and unfortunately is too common is that many victims can’t help themselves or think we can’t help them.
It is clear to me that we cannot do everything and it is not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than if I can do nothing in such situations.
I see the blue spots, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in a conversation under four eyes, with the perpetrator far out of sight and hearing, I can't reach all of them.
I don’t know what the reason is, maybe it’s fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the usual social environment, fear of dragging the children out of it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone is that sometimes even very close to tears, all of them are worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don’t just have to accept violence.
I often wish I could help in any case... I know I can't.
This will never make it easier.
Please always remember that you are worth living without violence, which is so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What makes the series "League of Legends"?
Lots of fantasy, lots of complicated names, a breathtaking creation: "Arcane", the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, has recently launched on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the already announced two seasons?
Basketball Bundesliga: Derby debacle of the MHP giant Ludwigsburg at the Merlins Crailsheim
At least on the youngest Johannes Patrick was abandoned.
Again nothing: for the second time in not even three months the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick had said with a look back at the Cup defeat in early October at the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim: "We still have some anger in our stomachs".
After the game, however, it did not lie down - but rose again in the face of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga.
More than the naked result, however, the manner of the appearance was disappointing.
A statistic that expresses the whole dilemma is mentioned as a substitute: the Three-Quote was just once 13 percent, 4 hits (all by the young John Patrick) in saying and writing 31 attempts - still questions?
John Patrick said: “We just weren’t focused enough after the win at Tenerife, and we didn’t implement what we trained.”
In other words, move the ball.
His reaction against Sebastian Gleim was quite different: "To win a cool game for the second time against Ludwigsburg," the lucky coach said.
"It felt like it was like 10,000 people."
On Saturday, only 750 visitors were allowed in the Hohenlohe-Arena, but they came at their expense.
Not least because of BBL topscorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and guided his team's game.
"The best player I've ever trained," Gleim said.
While in Patrick's team themselves, the performers such as Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed on the whole line.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) the giants prevented a total debacle and reached up to eight points after they had already laid 39:59.
In addition to John Patrick, Justin Simon came on twelve points.
Luckily, there is not much time left.
Already on Wednesday (at 7 p.m.) the giants received the Skyliners Frankfurt, before then also in Ludwigsburg a maximum of 750 spectators.
We used to have a different email address, but I changed it.
Yes, I have already registered a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims have been rejected.
We have legally informed ourselves again and have therefore registered them again.
We originally signed up six months ago.
Always peeled from the egg: Max Raabe becomes 59
He is able to inspire his audience with new interpretations of drummers from the 20s and 30s.
He is currently on the road with the program "Good day, dear happiness" - if he is allowed to perform.
In fact, Max Raabe wanted to celebrate his birthday this Sunday on the stage in Leipzig.
But it will be nothing.
The planned concert has been moved to May 2022 - "on official orders" to curb the coronavirus.
Other of his performances planned during the Advent period also have to appear first, as it is called on the website of the singer, who is now 59, and his musician (www.palast-orchester.de).
Starting in January, the artists want to meet their dates already in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962 in Lünen in North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe has already sung a lot and enjoyed singing as a teenager.
In Berlin he studied opera singing, and in 1986 he founded the Palais Orchestra together with fellow composers.
Since then, the baritone has established itself with its repertoire of hits and songs in the style of Comedian Harmonists.
He has been awarded awards many times.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) - just like his hit album "For Women It's No Problem" (2013) - reached second place on the charts.
He managed to get it out of the niche into the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, the blonde hair strictly combed back and thought of label, Max Raabe is no longer to be thought of from the current German-speaking music landscape.
With the program "Good day, dear luck" he has been on tour since 2020. dpa

It still does not work I can only crave the cover sheet but not blade.
Federal Minister of Construction Klara Geywitz: Expropriation does not create a new apartment
The new Federal Minister of Construction Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the seizure of large housing corporations, as demanded in a popular decision in Berlin.
"With a deprivation, not a single new apartment is created, it only changes the ownership structure," Geywitz said in an interview with the "day mirror" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants assurance that their rent will remain affordable in the coming years.
A colorful mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives or housing companies is, by the way, the best protection against monopoly formation.
In Berlin, the coalition of SPD, Greens and the Left Party wants to set up an expert commission on how to deal with the outcome of the popular decision.
However, if the situation did not relax, Geywitz did not conclude talks with the FDP in the Ampel coalition about further tightening of the lease law.
The coalition agreement provides for a braking of rent prices by 2029, a limitation of rent increases in tense housing markets and an expansion of rent levels.
I will speak with the Minister of Justice to implement this as soon as possible.
If the rental market still does not relax, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," the SPD politician stressed.

At least 100 killed by tornadoes in Kentucky
In a devastating storm system, numerous tornadoes have been pulled through the United States.
In Kentucky alone, there could be more than 100 deaths to be reported.
The pictures from there are reminiscent of a war zone.
On the night of Saturday, several tornadoes in the United States caused severe devastation and may have claimed as many as a hundred deaths.
The storms leave an approximately 320-kilometre-long snowfall of devastation, especially in the state of Kentucky.
Its governor, Andy Beshear, said after a visit to the disaster area, wherever the tornado was broken, everything was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just away.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this is possible at all.
In the state of Kentucky alone, there are up to 100 deaths, with official figures rising every hour.
Hello, I just saw that she sold out Vitrine <0x23>NAME<0x23>.
That's too bad.
Will it still be produced?
Or is it completely out of the assortment?
Is it possible to order these showcases in another country?
How long will you sign up?
If delivery cannot be made in my apartment, I have to cancel the order!
I understand that, only I can order the ceiling now and have it delivered to Germany, which is in the shopping cart?
I had returned an item or a return via the contact form and wanted to ask if it arrived or processed because I have not yet received confirmation.
Companies pay vaccine premiums and change promotional rights
While the federal government further rejected the proposals for a vaccine premium, companies in Austria themselves have taken the initiative and offer their employees cash rewards for the vaccination.
Thus, they are in line with the social partners <0xC3><0x96>GB and the Chamber of Commerce, which today demanded financial incentives for vaccination.
The conversion of advertising slogans to call-ups – according to the German model – is also intended to increase the readiness for coronavirus vaccinations.
He's moved into a company he's been bullied about.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It's been a year.
He obviously didn’t get stuck in his old place, and he was looking for something else.
You can do that, too.
And that he didn't like you at the time: well, it doesn't matter.
He didn’t like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please take up the cancellation.
This will be legally relevant.
I'm doing a screenshot.

Help with your own first campaign
Boron to the groove!
For a group of 4 friends, I’m currently leading the Adventure Over the Grip Pass and want to lead my heroes seamlessly into a campaign written specifically for the players.
We play DSA 5.
The big bow is made, the evil weights and their motivations written, the individual acts devised and now I am in the process of writing the entry adventure and crashing already on the first encounter over my own feet.
The premise is that the heroes are to bring a wagon with cereals from Gratenfels to a small village near Lake Thuran.
This is where the further action will take place.
A few miles from the village, the hero is supposed to unravel a group of goblins and lure them into a dungeon.
I want to give the player characters the opportunity to solve the confrontation in different ways: convince, act, threaten, recognize the danger early, whatever happens to the players.
Group strength: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 armed with spears, 6 armed with bows and saws
If not noted, the goblins line up the heroes in a hollow path and flank each three to the left and right of me arches armed the vehicle, while two with spears stop the vehicle.
If it comes to the battle and the heroes are subject, I have two solutions
The heroes are all unconsciously and subsequently found and healed by the son of the village school, a half.
The cart is gone, of course.
If a defeat is inevitable, this hemisphere attacks with two of his servants and comes to the aid of the hero in the battle.
The cart is still there, everything is great.
How do you feel about Deus ex Machina solution 2?
Is the encounter too much as an entry into the adventure?
The group of goblins will play a crucial role later, so it is not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: wow, I didn’t expect so many answers, especially not so many great suggestions and tips.
I’m sure I’ll focus on many of your ideas and now I have more confidence in my narrative.
I have rebuilt the lamp.
And back together again.
Unfortunately, it still does not work.
That's why I'd still like to send her back
If you can let the returns come, then I can pack the lamp and bring it to <0x23>PRS_ORG<0x23>.

Here the lower part was damaged, so almost the part with storage space.
Will everything be picked up again or just part of the storage space?
I'm nervous about Sky Sport F1
Hello dear F1 fans, throughout the season the quality on the German Sky has decreased more and more, so I want to get some air with this post.
For the first time today, in the middle of the F2 race, the transmission was interrupted in order to start the F1 pre-reporting on time.
Although the delayed start and the start of the schedule was far behind the planning, one could still have shown the last ten minutes (planned) as well as the championship decision (!).
It seems, however, that for legal reasons, F1 takes precedence and therefore has to restrict everything else, so Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Still stupid, especially since Sky UK has passed the race.
Yet a little praise: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes has accompanied the difficult situation around the serious accident well.
Then there was regular knowledge in F1 with commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both did not know that you can change the tires under a red flag.
Although this situation already existed in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both came to the conclusion that Verstappen may change the tyres when there were corresponding radio rumors on this subject to Hamilton.
At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators immediately knew that there was a possibility for stabbing.
I think that such elementary rules should be known simply when commenting on the F1 on a pay-TV channel.
It is also not the first puzzle rate that is now possible or prescribed according to rules, both simply have constant uncertainties on the subject of rules.
In general, I don’t like the fictional commentary style of Roos, but admit that it’s a matter of taste.
But I really like even Heiko Wasser from RTL better.
In addition, there are constant dizzinesses that both seem simply unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from (as well as unsuspecting) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" by Ralf Schumacher.
Especially the latter brings a lot of unrest in the comment that he apparently does not take it seriously.
Last but not least, the advertising simply takes over at Sky, in the outlet front, Sky is the only transmitter that goes into the advertising, as you can listen to F1TV, because only the German soundtrack has to get out without comment immediately after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do this.
Also, these two channels do less advertising in the trainings than Sky, and that as a free-TV channel.
Although you have to praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, that alone does not let me overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of the Sky Sport F1 program is also very poor and full of repetitions.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-language transmitter that transmits the F1.
Unironically, RTL makes even the advertising a better job in the four races that they are still allowed to transmit.
So anyway, the grandiose F1 season makes much less fun than it would be possible with a reasonable transmitter.
I'd be interested in your opinion.
On this page: <0x23>PRS_ORG<0x23> pendant lamp, brass and multicoloured glass x 1
Hello, I have an item that should be delivered last week and which is still not delivered.
I contacted the chat twice and so far nothing.
The First Lady told me that it will be shipped on Monday, the second Lady told me yesterday that she will check and send an email and she never responded.
Hello, I ordered two <0x23>PRS_ORG<0x23> on 12.12.19.
One of them has already detected a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric has a hole in the front of the stool).
I'm asking for support.
Fan pumps are excellent for supplying an aquarium with oxygen as well.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via air lifter.
This series is offered in 3 variants by us.
Look at the table at the end of the offer.
There you can see the performance in comparison.
If the pumps are strong enough, you can operate whole systems with them.
If you have a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outlets are suitable so that you can connect several outlets.
The MK series has one, two or four outputs, depending on the model, but also offer to put an accent in the aquarium, for example with an air curtain (you can find with us in the shop) or with a decor that converts the air bubbles into a function.
Here would be a treasure trove to call a shell or something like that.
The MK-series has a special, soundproof construction and thus ensures low operating noise.
The installation is very simple.
The fan pump is connected to an ejector by means of an air hose 4/6 mm... and it can start.
The fan pump should be equal to, or higher than, the water level and be installed outside.
If the fan pump is deeper than the water level, you should put a check valve in between.
Simply cut through the air hose and place the valve in between.
This would prevent once water running backwards, the water running out of the pool through the pump...
Should the fan pump be installed outdoors, it should be covered and protected from moisture, like other air pumps.
The pumps of the MK series are pure power packs that consume little energy
Even if we specify the processing time of 3 days here on ebay, the parcels will be packed daily and the parcels will also be picked up daily here.
Everything goes well on the way, it goes very fast.
We just want to prevent a little bit so that no one is right, just because it once took a little longer.
It would be so, not everyone has an understanding for all the employees who also work in the forwarding business... of course here does not make a Corona stop.
Please do not rate as poorly, just because the delivery is delayed, which is solely due to the parcel services.
Of course, you like to skimp on these services, even if we say at the moment...they have damn hard
This is also very different regionally.
Don’t be angry with anyone, stay healthy and we all hope that there will be better times again.
How long does it take to order the yellow with and without armrests?
Is it possible to order the legs in light here too?
Amazon founder Bezo sends astronaut daughter and moderator to space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV moderator and four other passengers took a short trip to space.
They were transported on Saturday by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin's "New Shepard" missile system.
Starting and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the U.S. state of Texas.
Under a radiant blue sky, Bezos personally received the newly-cured astronauts upon their return.
"Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue space suit as he opened the Luke to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers gradually climbed out and hugged the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were on the road for 10 minutes and 13 seconds, reaching an altitude of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of 1961 NASA astronaut Alan Shepard (1923-1998), named after the Blue Origin rocket system, and the 50-year-old TV host, Divestorer, were the company's honorary guests.
How much they each paid for their ticket, Blue Origin did not tell.
Laura Shepard Churchley recalled her father’s mission after the short flight.
He worked hard on his efforts and had to do everything himself.
She just flew along, the 74-year-old said with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also expressed his enthusiasm.
He would prefer to return to space again, said the moderator.
"New Shepard" flies to 100 kilometers of altitude
The "New Shepard" missile system is largely automated.
The capsule, separated from the rocket during the flight, reached an altitude of about 100 kilometers above the earth, temporarily with weightlessness, before the reusable object slowed down from large parachute landings again.
The International Aeronautical Association and many other experts view 100 kilometers above the Earth as a boundary to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was Blue Origin’s third manned all-around trip: Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board on the first of July, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former U.S. pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
The second in October was the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became world-famous for his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", as well as former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries and the deputy chief of the company.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of propelling space tourism business largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard for the climate.
At the touch of a button, you can easily choose whether your "Smart Stone" should be permanently lit in one color or play through its entire color repertoire.
When set to color change, the luminaire retains a light color for about a minute before gently transitioning to the next decorative shade.
The solid design of the »Smart Stone« lamp proves itself outdoors all year round.
In a snowy environment, its light is even particularly good – only a shorter luminosity can be expected as soon as the days are shorter.
In the winter, just make sure that no snow damages the solar module in its function.

Someone who works in biochemistry or has studied biochemistry
I am currently studying biochemistry in the first semester and find the subject in itself quite exciting and also in the laboratory does not bother me (I already have the inorganic chemistry internship behind me).
Of course, I also informed myself before studying about career prospects thought at the time, but also that I would like to study until the doctorate.
At the moment, however, I have doubts, especially concerning my professional prospects.
On the one hand (Studycheck etc) you hear great job opportunities and the profession is totally sought after, on the other hand you hear from unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid jobs.
That is why I would be really interested:
1) What are you working at the moment?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/salary?
3) What did you study/what training did you do?
4) Would you do it all over again?
Thank you so much for your feedback!
I am currently really insecure and may be considering discontinuing my studies in 2022 and becoming a professional computer scientist.
If you have experience, you will also like to write :)
Extra Stress Before Holidays & Holiday Weekends
This topic came up with me last week.
But now I had to use my long weekend to relax from it.
That is why I have a post on it now.
Not only before big holidays, like the Christmas holidays, there is a lot of stress in our company.
As it seems, there are also before holidays plus bridge days.
Last week was Maria’s Ascension, which is called “Ascension” in Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and businesses make a bridge day, which is why it is semi-official.
Last week there was a long 4-day weekend in the house.
So what happened last week?
Stress is everywhere.
Loud e-mails, which absolutely had to go out before departure, order here order there, all *unconditionally* before the long weekend.
'Cause... 'cause?
Because "next week then" sounds after so much time and it shouldn't be?
Or because people want to do as much in a shorter week as in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but I was also very nervous.
What is this self-sacrifice about for holidays?
Why do we still have holidays when we can’t afford them properly?
The stress probably didn’t come from above, the colleagues were all on their own.
My question is simple: are we the Swiss just like that?
Is this our Reformed-Evangelical way of life?
Or do you know that in the North?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian homeland - but she has no presents yet.
"The beauty, even if there should be no snow in Erfurt, then you just drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian forest," said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will agree to the party by baking and basteling with her son.
“I love that,” Catterfeld said.
However, she still has a lot to do until the meditative days: "For the first time I don't have any presents yet, I have to start now".
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth process of the mice and the spring regeneration.
NEKTON-Bio contains all vital vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 <0xCE><0xBC>g biotin/kg.
NEKTON bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny feather.
The majority of the feather damage that occurs in poultry farming is solely due to nutritional deficiencies.
Since the feather is made of protein-containing substance, a particularly rich and balanced protein diet of the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of an impeccable spring dress.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily diet must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
Most of the animal losses that occur during mice are due to a lack of or unbalanced protein intake and/or insufficient supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavourable ratio of amino acids in most plant feed products is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
No additional vitamin preparation should be administered during the administration of NEKTON-Bio.
NEKTON-Bio is cold water soluble and can easily be administered via drinking water or soft food.
Thank you, I found it

DDR-Handarbeitsmodell ZDR-Handarbeitsmodell ZDR-Handarbeitsmodell ZDR-Handarbeitsmodell Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the Lok was in use in Silesia and Central Germany, the very rare Lok probably came from the conversion proposal of the model railroader M.E.H.E.E.F.E., used with game tracks and fun parts, see
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and we have worked up
In 1924, the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft commissioned the AEG to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that could carry 2,200-ton coal trains and 530-ton passenger trains with a travel speed of 45 km/h.
The maximum speed required was 65 km/h.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG decided on the delivery as a 1'Co<0x2B>Co1' locomotive with actuator drive AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part, the Siemens-Schuckerwerke with the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which received the operating numbers E 95 01–06.
All survived the Second World War and then found themselves in the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives arrived in the Soviet Union as repair goods.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
In the Reichsbahnwerk Dessau, the workworthiness of all six locomotives was determined.
[4] With the progressive re-electrification of the Central German network, an increasing demand for locomotives for heavy goods haulage services emerged, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were developed in 1959, with the other machines serving as spare parts dispensers.
In this case, the E 04, E 44 and E 94 present in larger numbers were first preferably constructed.
It was not until the E 94 that the number of workloads could not be increased further, that the E 95 fell into the focus of the workload.
[4] Initially, the locomotives were stationed at the Leipzig-Waren railway station.
They came to the railway operating plant Halle P in 1960.
They were used in a separate circulation plan mostly before coal trains from the Geisel Valley to Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
With increasing age, the complicated control of the locomotives proved problematic.
So it often happened that shooters remained glued to switching operations.
Then the man who was constantly driving on this locomotive with a hammer and a wooden wedge had to loosen the shots during the ride.
Damage to the driving motors occurred more often and led to months of failure in the locomotive.
[5] Since there were sufficient new locomotives in the late 1960s and a significant expansion of the electric operation was not planned at the time, the Reichsbahn was able to dispense with old locomotives and most of the splitter types, so the E 95 was discontinued.
They added that the German Reichsbahn wanted to occupy electric locomotives only in a single way, which would have caused a problem in train operation due to the difficulties mentioned with the machines and the conditions of view from the driver's stand.
[5] After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were discontinued in mid-1969, the E 95 01 was the last to be discontinued on 5 October 1970.
The new designation 255 001 was thus never used.
Up to the E 95 02 all locomotives were dismantled.
The E 95 02 was installed as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a wick heating system on the main railway station Halle.
It took some time for the Reichsbahn officials to be convinced that the E 95 was worth keeping as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the locomotive was first refurbished externally with the aim of being able to present it to a vehicle show in the RAW Dessau.
[5] It has since belonged to the Verkehrsmuseum Dresden as an inoperable museum locomotive.
In 1986, the locomotive was completed.
The locomotive museum is maintained at the DB Museum Halle (Saale).
Since 1995, employees of the tradition group Bw Halle P have been working on the operationable upgrading of the locomotives.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time at an exhibition at the Museums-Bw Arnstadt with new internal and external varnishing, with the transformers being checked and five motors operating.
-The locomotives were in use on the Silesian mountain railway and off-road tracks until 1945, where they proved themselves due to their reliable drive and low maintenance.
In February 1945, the machines were relocated to Leipzig to the Central German network.
The main area of use was initially Silesia
Handicraft model H0 in OVP, function well, there are optical reworks at the locomotive in self-work necessary, dusted, with game tracks, basement smell !!!, very rare handicraft model, very small edition- possibly the construction kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUSCHKE and BACHMANNKE

Residential fire with two minor injuries and high damage
Two people were lightly injured in a fire in a residence in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated damage has been done in the six-digit euro area, police said on Sunday.
The fire had probably spread from a carport to the adjacent residence in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech district).
Two residents were reportedly taken to the hospital on Sunday with light smoke poisoning.
The exact cause of the fire was not known at first, but the police did not assume an intentional fire.
The Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigations.
But then she arrives much later.

To debunk fake news - Biontech CEO publishes vaccine photo
U<0xC4><0x9F>ur <0xC5><0x9E>ahin published on the social network "LinkedIn" a photo of his first vaccination in early 2021
Biontech chief U<0xC4><0x9F>ur <0xC5><0x9E>ahin had not publicly expressed his vaccination status so far.
Now, the entrepreneur published a photo showing his coronavirus vaccine.
The illness of a friend moved him to do so, <0xC5><0x9E>ahin said.
U<0xC4><0x9F>ur <0xC5><0x9E>ahin, CEO and co-founder of the Mainz company Biontech, has released a photo showing how he is getting a vaccine against the coronavirus.
There was misinformation on social media that I was allegedly not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I have received 3 doses of the biontech Pfizer vaccine," <0xC5><0x9E>ahin wrote in a post on the network "LinkedIn".
"For a few months, friends have urged me to post a photo of me on which I am vaccinated to counter these false rumors."
So far, he has refused because the communication should not revolve around him.
But a call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply saddened to hear that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He fights a serious Covid-19 disease and has been hanging on a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, <0xC5><0x9E>ahin continued.
He did not ask for the reasons.
"However, the most common cause seems to be fear, which is often fueled by misinformation and mistrust."
Fear can only be difficult to fight with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
On the Internet, an interview with the Deutsche Welle circulates, in which U<0xC4><0x9F>ur <0xC5><0x9E>ahin says he has not been vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as Deutsche Welle itself explained.
"I am not legally allowed to get the vaccine myself at the moment," <0xC5><0x9E>ahin said at the time.
There is a priority in Germany in the vaccination of the vaccine.
In the meantime, the priority has been lifted for a long time – and the head of biontech has been vaccinated three times, according to appropriate information.
<0xE2><0x86><0x90> Tens of thousands of people without electricity
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia the light went out on Friday evening: no electricity anymore and in many cases, no heating.
A fire had damaged a substation.
After a fire with heavy damage in a substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg-Kreis in North Rhine-Westphalia had to cope with electricity for about 24 hours.
As a result of the fire on Friday evening, 41,000 affected residents and residents in several municipalities turned out the lights.
The supplier Westnetz reported that on Saturday, numerous emergency power units had been in operation until the large-scale disruption could finally be completely repaired late at night.
Firefighters and assistants of the THW provided support in the municipalities.
The authorities offered shelters in schools and called for help in the neighbourhood.
The provider thanked the affected people for their patience and the helpers for their use.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought considerable constraints.
We also thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire department and the THW for their tireless use," said the head of primary technology, Florian Witt, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage will take a few more days, as some lines were initially only provisionally able to resume operation by the West-Netz installers, he explained.
A technical defect led to the fire, according to company data.
Electricity is flowing again
According to Westnetz, the fire that broke out on Friday at 7.15 p.m. has severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear at the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation.
There, complex cleaning and repair work is required.
At the same time, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level was created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is restored.
Since Saturday at 6:00 p.m., more than 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity again.
Another 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually switched on as of 9.30 p.m.
Since 11:15 p.m., the last one still had electricity affected by the outage.
More than 80 installers from Westnetz and partner companies were employed.
After the construction of an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon, the authorities had also called for neighbourhood assistance.
"It is important now that the citizens in their neighborhood take care of older or single people and notify the local fire departments when help is needed," Landrat Sebastian Schuster (CDU) said after a crisis meeting.
When setting up and operating emergency power units, the focus was on the residents of Altenheimen.
In addition, according to authorities, temporary nursing homes have been set up in schools for those people who have not been able to care for themselves or who need the power-dependent medical devices or who are dependent on medical care.

To keep the paint order even and clean, you should clean the components with some soap water from dust, grease and fingerprints, rinse and dry with clear water.
Before applying the brush to the model for the first time with a new color, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the later non-visible inside of the components or on a yogurt cup.
The first line on the component
Pull the brush evenly stroke next to stroke.
Light overlapping of the color layers later ensures an even surface.
Avoid wiping back and forth with the brush.
As a result, unrealistic surfaces are created.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the bright colors.
Otherwise, the dark ones might pass through later.
Metal tones and metallic colours end up with a separate brush.
Otherwise, there can be nasty metal shavings when they mix with normal colors.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before installing them.
The models achieve a true original look through the decals or decals, respectively.
From flags on airplanes, to ship names, to ornaments and badges on car models: the decals give the model the final edge.
Apply the decals in the correct order as long as the components are still within easy reach.
An aircraft cockpit can be glued or more easily before it is installed in the hull.
Even more important than the right tool such as scissors, tweezers and toothbrushes are when sticking time, patience and a calm hand.
Cut out each required decal individually and place it right on you.
Decals are also called water slides because you moisten their back briefly with water until the carrier paper gets dark through the wets.
Then you just push the picture a small piece of paper and place the piece in the appropriate place on the model (which you have moistened before).
While you hold the decal on the model with a tool, you pull the carrier paper aside.
Attention: Always check that the picture is sitting properly before you push it completely off the paper, so that it does not stick to the finger, crack or even tear.
Suction excess water with a household cloth.
Attention not suitable for children under 3 years
I can only open a book briefly, as soon as I look for something else then I do not read the book and I have to log out and sign up and reload the book and look for the place until I have read.
I’ve already communicated with you on Saturday.
Do I receive this by email?
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp came in 3 individual packages with me
Thank you so much!
Then I'll buy somewhere else as soon as the money's back.
Can I get it back without any problems?
Childcare at PKV / What is an "insurance case"?
Hello together,
we have been in child care for some time, now when it comes to billing with the PKV, it suddenly turns out.
The series by:
We had previously applied for the children’s wishes at the PKV and got the promise over 3 attempts.
Attempts were not restricted in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt directly led to a successful pregnancy and childbirth and was billed with PKV.
Some time later we tried to have a second child, and carried out 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but these did not yet count against the PKV.
We applied again for the cost at the PKV and again got 3 further attempts allowed.
After some further attempts (we have made more attempts than promised, logically counting the most expensive with the PKV) we filed the invoices with the PKV and got the bad surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2<0x2B>3), the PKV wants to refund only 3 attempts.
The reason: With the pregnancy/birth, the remaining 2 attempts of the first pledge expire.
The second child's wish is a new insurance case.
According to the AGB, however, "the insurance case begins with the medical treatment, it ends when the need for treatment no longer exists."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
* Who is entitled here to the PKV (only 3 attempts will be refunded) or we (there are 5 attempts to refund)?
* Should the PKV have pointed out to us in the promises that with a birth the further attempts fail?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
Infertility (due to closed ureters) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here would give your opinion.
Thank you so much for your help!
Please send me the three variants by email and tell me how I can get back to them
It's all right.
We will not order anything from them anymore.
If they add the sales from me and my friend <0x23>NAME<0x23> (same address), they obviously have lost a good customer.
You are welcome to forward this to your manager.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday the colleague told me that the refund was triggered and now tell me that I have to return the thing.
I can’t believe that the dresser is completely messed up.
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague wrote.
It is clear that the refund has been triggered and I have still not received a refund via <0x23>PRS_ORG<0x23>
You can tell your manager that you have now lost two regular customers.
My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment via his account.
We're not going to do that anymore.
No, the defect did not occur until a few months later.
An office chair must withstand normal use.
Otherwise, they may not sell it as an office chair.
Regardless, the warranty of 24 months is valid.
No, it is not possible for me to purchase another type of packaging.
I will remove the cabinet and make it available to the transport company.
Hello, I have a question about your series of <0x23>PRS_ORG<0x23>
These products are advertised with additional stools to buy, but we can't find them with you.
Can you help me?
Topic of the Week: The Best Low Budget Movies
What a low-budget film is, for that there is no general definition with exact budget limits.
Wikipedia has the following to say:
A low-budget film or low-budget film is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
On the web you can find plenty of lists of low-budget movies, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interested representatives in this category?
What's bothering you?
And what do you not like at all?
I am a very good customer of you, I have already furnished 2 apartments completely with your furniture.
Wanted to ask for the best price for the grey leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended again, is it now also reliable?
Thank you very much
With friendly congratulations
If there is no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30min is not a chat!
Unfortunately nothing changes at the waiting position...I will soon give up again because it just doesn’t work here.
Hello!
"Half victory" against Belarus linked to high costs for the EU
The EU can declare a "half victory" in conflict with the Belarusian regime, according to political expert Raphael Bossong.
But the costs were very high and meant massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees in Belarus' border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (EPD).
The EU has not resolved the confrontation sustainably, said the researcher of the Berlin Foundation for Science and Politics (SWP).
This state of liquidity - Belarus does not contribute very little, but the EU feels like a winner - probably goes on for a while.
Dealing with people at the border is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong said.
Apparently, there is an “increasing normalization of pushbacks” by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole is not resolutely opposed, it is at the expense of fundamental rights.
At the same time, this development weakens cohesion in the Union.
"It obviously cannot enforce itself if a Member State tries to do its thing," as currently Poland, which does not even allow the EU Border Protection Agency Frontex access to the border.
In addition, the EU is paying another price for its policy on the border with Belarus, Bossong says: A consensus on the principles of asylum policy will be made more difficult because the line "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Trying to cross the border again
According to Poland’s border guard, migrants have again tried to reach Polish territory via Belarus.
55 migrants were arrested on Sunday night and brought back to the border, a spokeswoman said on Sunday.
Polish officials had been stoned by migrants in the incident near the town of Czeremsza.
According to reports, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be provided medically by a military doctor.
In total, border guard 52 attempted border crossings were registered within 24 hours.
A group of 28 migrants had already crossed the border barriers on Friday night.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed or tried to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko of being in power in Minsk with the prospect of entering the EU.
According to press reports, Poland and Lithuania ruled out border sections.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU Commissioners traveled to the countries of origin of the people to prohibit departures there.
The most effective element of the EU response is the pressure on the airlines, Bossong said.
"There, the EU has thrown its market power into the balance and demonstrated its determination to operate with tough bandages and extraterritorial sanctions."
Minsk must also take into account domestic policy costs.
The Belarusian society is probably not set up to have the security apparatus regularly smuggle thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 final
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen has committed two violations of the rules during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 final of Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has filed an objection.
The silver arrow suspects two breaks in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to an alleged violation by Max Verstappen in Red Bull in the last safety car phase, when he is said to have outlawed it.
A second objection was raised against the valuation at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes, the protocol was not complied with.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in Mercedes in the last round and had reached his first Formula 1 title.
The manoeuvre took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase in which the Dutch had overtaken cars driving in front of him.
I'll check it out.
I'll talk to the bank and report back to you.
Thank you for your support
Free entry for members: Europa-Park organises SC-Freiburg-Fantag
The Europa-Park, the name of the Europa-Park stadium of the Sport-Club Freiburg, has invited to SC Freiburg Fantag.
Members and permanent cardholders of the Breisgau sports club as well as members of the fan community were allowed to visit the Europa Park for free on this day.
In addition, there were also vouchers for drinks and sausages.
On that day, the eight-track trains lit through the jerseys red and white.
Fuchsle, Ed Euromaus and many red and white balloons provided the perfect backdrop,” the park said.
Since the beginning of the 1990s, the cooperation between the Bundesligist and the leisure park in Rust, located 40 kilometres north of Freiburg, has been ongoing.
At the first SC Freiburg Fantag in the Europa-Park, it was again shown how well the partnership fits.
Seeing radiant fans who have fun together on the roller coaster confirms this," says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.

Judith Hermann read from her novel "Home"
As part of the series "LiteraTour Nord", author Judith Hermann read on Friday in the sold-out Blue Note from her current novel "Home" and also acted as a moderator.
She is divorced, lives in a house on the coast and listens sensitively to the nocturnal noise at her doorstep.
I gave up the contact form yesterday to return an item, but didn't receive an email confirmation or anything like that.
My question is whether my request has been received.
Not everyone has the time for your chat and incorrectly delivered cheap goods from China.
Your mistake, which you fix and not all of our budget.
Contact Mrs. <0x23>NAME<0x23>.
I can't chat with them every day
We had chatted yesterday and agreed that I or Mrs. <0x23>NAME<0x23> will receive an email with a 60 Euro voucher, a re-order of the <0x23>PRS_ORG<0x23> nightstand and a return label.
This email has not yet arrived.

Sorry, but just because he says he's not an anti-Semite doesn't mean anything.
It's like when a dealer says he has nothing against foreigners.
Both of them will not admit to your i.
But Kollegah is constantly reproducing some anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself, you just have to let it go completely.
Yeah, wow, you're not as serious as your colleague.
Those who seriously question evolution in principle are simply completely lost.
Because of me, a God has made it all happen.
But once you’re a creationist, you have to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and that science is just nonsense.
And so you are an enemy of science and not to take any more seriously like Kollegah
To obtain an optimal field of vision, the lupe should be approached as close to the eye as possible.
The specially aplanatically-achromatically designed lens system allows you to practically use the lupe to the edge zone without glare and colour errors.
Often lupus is marked with magnification details.
However, this information applies only to precisely defined conditions that rarely correspond to the conditions of use.
In order to make the best use of your lupe, we ask you to observe the instructions in the table "Technical data" (see instructions for use in the package).
Light reflections are generated on the lens surfaces of all optical devices - even in case of impact loops.
An anti-reflective coating significantly reduces these reflections.
In compliance with the optimal conditions of use - lupe close to the eye - mirroring on the lens surfaces is less noticeable.
Further information can be found in the accompanying instructions for use (available in German and English).

Tanned sale in Schönwolde: in the municipality of Krembz, women are looking for Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has already experienced so many curious situations when selling tannins.
Once a man is supposed to be driving home without his partner, because the two could not agree.
Each year he plants about 2,000 pieces for it.
The 56-year-old has already experienced so many curious situations.
That always makes the pre-Christmas season something fun, he says.
What about the voucher?
Am I going to leave as a customer?
After all, I received a defective delivery and now paid the full price for it.
I will also evaluate this accordingly!
We do not need to discuss the better court here, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both are made of meat that is grilled on a rotating spoon.
And they both have their names.
In German, an equivalent might be something like the "Dreher", which by far does not sound so delicious.
Problems with Fiberglass <0x2B> Devolo DLan/Magic
We have had a new fiberglass connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I now have trouble building a stable Wi-Fi network.
Previously, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which received and broadcast 50 Mbit flawlessly up to a few failures.
The new fiberglass connector sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and to the DLan module connected to the FritzBox.
However, the other DLan module, which sends the wifi, no longer arrive the full 500, but the more I remove myself in the house with the module, the less arrives (so use a socket, which is located 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This means that the internet with the new fiberglass connection is now even slower than before (<0x7E>45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but there were similarly large losses here as well.
Could someone explain to me why with fiberglass so much internet speed is "lost" over the power line?
Is LAN really the solution?
It would be extremely difficult to put LAN cables in the house.
I’m really desperate, which is why I created an extra account here.
That is why I would be even more pleased with an answer.
When it's time to change the Giro account
Who would have thought that now would be the first time to rest at the giro accounts, he is mistaken.
While many banks have used autumn to get their customers to confirm the price increases of the past with all sorts of tricks, the free amounts for negative interest rates continue to decline.
Deutsche Bank, for example, was considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros long.
Now she has just halved the free amount and even quartered it for the daily allowance.
In a first step, the limit was lowered only for customers of the Postbank Group – to 50,000 euros for Giro and Investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for daily cash accounts.
Meanwhile, however, these lower free amounts apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesperson confirmed on request.
Not only for new contracts, but also for "newly made individual agreements with existing customers".
The Commerzbank had already fallen to a limit of 50,000 euros, which still applies, just as with ING Germany.
The direct bank DKB, which is popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the free money in two stages, first to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
After all, more than 100 banks now have a free balance of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>25,000 or less, according to figures from the Internet portal Verivox.
Sparda-Bank Berlin has also arrived at 25,000 euros: however, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centres, which in the first instance even got right against this regulation before the Landgericht Berlin.
Banks are already discussing whether the institutions should possibly form reserves - in the event that the higher authorities, too, declare the negative interest in principle inadmissible and many millions of bank customers have to be repaid.

Jennifer Aniston employs an entire beauty army
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But their life is like a mountain and valley ride.
Jennifer Aniston, 52, has been voted the most influential woman of the year by The Hollywood Reporter.
For her, who in 2021 made the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show", this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and work.
An entire army of assistants, stylists and coaches take care of her look.
After all, according to Aniston, she enjoys one chip a day (yes, read correctly: a SINGLE chip from the bag).
The fact that the hearts of the female and male fans are still at the same level is actually a miracle.
Maybe it's because she's just lucky - and she's still looking for the big love.
And the baby's wish was removed from the list.
She was always asked when she would become a mother.
That hurt her.
The people who asked this have no idea what’s going on with me personally, medically, why I can’t.
It was really hurtful.
Let’s hope that success and fame will also make you happy.
Unworthy End of a Career: Raikkonen Must Give Up
Kimi Räikkönen’s farewell to Formula 1 was even quieter than he thought.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn pulled out his gloves and wiped the sweat off his forehead.
That's it.
After a tyre failure and a slight tyre touch, Räikkönen had to drop his Alfa Romeo after not even half the race distance at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ending his career in the Royal Motorsport class.
His wife Minttu and the two children had also travelled to the United Arab Emirates.
Räikkönen's greatest success was winning the 2007 World Championship in Ferrari.
He scored 21 Grand Prix victories, started 18 times from the pole and came on the podium 103 times. dpa
Friedrich wins 60th World Cup - Nolte wins in two-bob - Sport
The brand of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the bob pilot.
"I figured this out once, I had to win nine and a half victories per season, then I could make it to Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic champion from the BSC Oberbärenburg, who booked at the Winterberg races two successes in two days.
First, he resisted Johannes Lochner's attack on Saturday by five hundredths, in which he drove from rank three to one.
Then he slightly changed the material setting and took a bigger lead on Sunday with 0.30 seconds.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he stood in front of the British Brad Hall.
The third was the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
"We took a greater risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also brought his 22nd win in the series.
The Berchtesgadener Johannes Lochner, who drove for Stuttgart, came to place two earlier this time in fifth place.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach finished in fourth place in the first race.
“If I knew what he was doing differently, I would do it that way,” Lochner said.
Nolte with home victory - Podium for Jamanka
With the women, Laura Nolte won the third season in the two-bob on her home run.
After only reaching fourth place in the monobob the day before, she rested on Sunday in the German triple success with forward Deborah Levi to the World Cup victory.
Two-bob Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thuringia came in second with Germany’s fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
In addition to her Olympic qualification, she booked the first podium this winter.
Wiesbadener Kim Kalicki finished third with Leonie Fiebig.
For me it was supercool, first podium place in the World Cup, I am super happy that Mariama is taking me with her.
I am super happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay," Burghardt said, emphasizing: "It's not just a postponement, but there's also a lot to do around."
Jamanka was a little upset about the not completely faultless rides, but said: "It's going in the right direction."
I already had the blanket in the shopping cart and could buy it now!!!
What should I do?
I just didn’t get it and therefore I can’t redeem it, which is why I finally asked for it.
Because of Corona, I had completely different problems last year and never had time for it.
And now he said it was over, which really pissed me off.
Look in the chat it was about the Asare seat bench.
I would like to return it and then order again as it is just reduced :)
Why is the shipment only started on 16.3.?
There was nothing from such a long delivery time on your website
No, only when I tap on it comes an extra field with the message
Was taken away from your colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today
I also sent you pictures of the wrongly delivered goods.
But we still want the shelf module, just a new undamaged one
And not cancel the entire order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello dear great girls and girls and women,
I have a few things I just want to write and maybe it's one of them - or some of them...
I am 24, have kPTBS, full-time student and dog mom - sometimes apart from my dog does not scream or goes to kindergarten he is actually 1 to 1 my child.
My friend (since 6J together) is sick, has recovered from a second degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we kissed a lot and it was nice.
I helped him with the shower (because hand is in the association wg burn).
It is also cold and we are currently seeing less (1-2x week) which makes me create a lot with my needs for affection and love.
My puppy just has abdominal pain, I cooked for him and now he is lying in his pillowcase and has relaxed a bit after I was there with the heat lamp and squirting for him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she's just gone for a month.
Now there is also homework on us, which we of course divide.
Cooking is a lot of work for me.
My PTBS disease is just fine, I’m half well treated and I’m fine.
Not good, but I'm getting along and I'm almost symptom-free.
My university is demanding a lot (for me), tomorrow at 3pm I have a written test for which I have not done anything yet and over tomorrow anatomy class for which I should prepare at least a little something.
And next week I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes next is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no place there.
So my week goes like this: Only until over tomorrow, then it’s weekend.
But after that, does it all go on?
Only until his birthday.
Only until the beginning of the holiday.
Only until the weekend.
Just until...
And so it goes on forever.
I think I’m just so stressed that I need these mental hints because otherwise I’m packing it up.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic", but otherwise I can't...
Is that the way it is with you?
Honestly, I'm infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
Truly infinitely grateful, I can't put it into words.
I don't know if I'd have survived my KPTBS.
I think this has something to do with women’s mental load, and that’s why I thought I’d probably find fellow sufferers here...
I definitely wish you a restful evening, the week is almost over!
I got my order today unfortunately the whole other color plus surface is scratched and table leg has imprint.
On the first delivery, the color was exactly the same as on the website.
We are very disappointed!!
What can you offer me?
If we change the table now do I get another color or how?
The cancellation email was sent on 26.12.<0x23>NUMBER<0x23>.
The rest twice.
But it was not confirmed.
At school, I noticed that many religious teachers don’t believe in God and that for them it’s just another subject like mathematics or geoscience.
For me, it was always a bit strange, maybe because I was raised as a Christian and I always believed in something like that.
How do you feel about that?
Perhaps you can also tell about work and study colleagues with different attitudes.
Basically, I understand the difference between private and professional and it makes sense to separate.
There is also a curriculum, etc.
But it just felt strange to have a physics teacher who does not believe in the theory of relativity.
What makes you want to teach religion if you don’t believe it?
True culture or something?
I hope your question is not too private.
Can't it be changed or not?Please write in English I understand that too
It's been a long time, so I'd take it off.
That's good, thank you.
I expect to receive a feedback by the end of next week at the latest.
Thank you for your support <0x23>NAME<0x23>.
Film Search Please Help
Hello, dear people,
I am looking for a movie from my childhood (bin 24).
I think it was a movie for young people.
There are two time axes (or parallel worlds) in the film.
The Modern (Real) World.
In other words, the past (or the realm of the dead) (not quite sure).
Since I can’t describe it in more detail in the real world, there is a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead a young soldier (uniform similar to those of the soldiers from the curse of the Caribbean).
For some reason, the paths intersect and an action arises.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this realm to be able to live for himself, I mean.
The transition, I think, is also the soldier's grave.
In the end, the two soldiers are fighting against each other.
If that tells you something, I am grateful for every answer.
Our little girl slept only on her stomach from week 1.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Take it easy.
Such a child endures much more than you think.
Make sure everything around is correct, no cuddly animals, often going in and looking, but no minutes of monitoring.
That makes you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Achso and ours did not have a sleeping bag, but always a blanket.
Watch your child when they are asleep.
Does it turn its head to the side?
Is it possible to get something out of your stomach?
Or is it directly in the mattress with the face in front?
You can tell if everything is all right.
We’ve all grown up too, and when my husband was born, it was a walk and there would be that you put the kids on the stomach to sleep.
In addition, we are already "customer" with you and have already bought a lot of items
But why are you offering me only 20<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>?
Hello, I already wrote yesterday with a colleague of yours and so far no feedback.
It is about my wardrobe that arrived yesterday (order number: <0x23>ALPHANUMERIC-ID<0x23>).
The right drawer does not fit into the cabinet.
I ask you to contact me as soon as possible.
The cabinet is not currently in use.
To be quite clear.
RBTV has made a lot of promises.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be held.
I had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It is simply that the policy of this transmitter is now under all strains.
Almost every format is sponsored (okay), but then go on a big bed tour at the same time.
It has been said that you are an "independent" Internet transmitter.
Arno: “You don’t want to be a running liposuction column.”
What are you now?
An 0815 advertiser trying to bring his BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then we have Marahs Do's & Don'ts.
This applies to everyone except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, they can continue to offend people.
A crook who is completely lacking in empathy and at the cost of the action with the exploded rented rooms tries to make ashes.
How to find all this well?
If you like it, I think it's terrible.
I ask for a call back, as my supplied wooden table was delivered defectively.

Cherry kernel pillows are a traditional home remedy for beneficial heat applications, since cherry kernels can absorb heat very well and re-dosed.
The removable interior cushion can be heated very easily in the microwave or in the oven.
The soft cover makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel protected, even if they don’t even feel so well.
The cherry kernel cushion with reference is suitable exclusively for the following areas of application:
Before heating the pillow, check for atypical odors, sticks or burns and remove them immediately if present.
Please remove the inner pillow for heating from the cover in advance!
Heat in the microwave at up to 300 watts for up to 2 minutes (please note the microwave manufacturer's specifications!)
Directly after heating distribute the heat evenly in the pillow by shaking!
Then put the inner cushion back in the cover.
At the first warm-ups, a slight moisture formation can occur on the surface, but this disappears with repeated applications.
Be sure to follow the given heating instructions as longer periods or higher energy outputs can lead to damage (risk of ignition and combustion!).
Before heating the pillow in the microwave, check that heating of grain products is allowed in the manufacturer's instructions for use.
After the heated inner pillow has been put back in the cover, please check the temperature of the pillow for suitability for babies (max 43 <0xC2><0xB0>C) at your armrests!
Do not use the pillow in acute and chronic, inflammatory or feverous diseases, circulatory disorders, fresh hematomas, bleeding gums and open wounds, as well as in people with reduced pain.
In case of existing skin, heart, veins, diabetes or tumour diseases, as well as pregnancy, please consult a doctor before use.
Should seams have opened and loose cores come out, dispose of the product and loose cores immediately and inaccessible to children.
If the product is used in babies under 1 year of age, the temperature of the child should be checked regularly during use to rule out overheating!
Any serious incidents related to the product shall be reported to the manufacturer and the competent authority of the country where the user is established.
The cover is removable and washable in the machine at 30<0xC2><0xB0>C.
Please note the care symbols on the product!

Is the battery broken?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer charged by my power supply.
I bought this again about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought the power supply alone was enough for the operation.
Incorrect display, the battery is empty and the laptop will no longer start despite plugged in power supply.
After that, I expanded the battery, but nothing happens here either.
Do you have any ideas?
A new battery has been ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in power mode?
Is there anything else broken?
Thank you very much for your help!
I want the delivery of the <0x23>PRS_ORG<0x23> to the room.
How can I book this?
I am interested in the <0x23>PRS_ORG<0x23> chair.

No problem with the Everyday V2 backpack from Peak Design!
20 liters of capacity also swallows larger photo equipment without any problems, which can be safely stored using the padded FlexFold dividers.
And what else you need on everyday items, thanks to practical accesses in the individually configurable interior, remains well organized and detachable from the photo equipment.
With the "update" of the Everyday Line to the version 2 (V2), the series presents itself in a new look.
With the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still giving you instant access to photo equipment.
This works with two options: Once conventionally via the lid flap, which can be closed with the MagLatch locking system, an excellently designed solution for effective protection that has already proven itself with the Messenger Bags.
In this case, the closure flap contains a closure hook made of metal with a matching anchor bar on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has designed different "filling stands": there are 4 anchor bars, which are permanently destroyed, in which the closure hook can be hooked.
If the backpack is fully loaded, you just take the top bar, it is more empty, a deeper one.
The flap closure and hooks are also magnetic.
Thus, the backpack can also be reliably closed without locking the hook.
The second option also distinguishes the Everyday backpack fundamentally from other, photo backpacks: In addition to the cover flap, there is also a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest drawback of traditional backpacks with access from above - you no longer have to crawl through the content!
At the same time, this clever detail increases the everyday worthiness of the backpack enormously: if you take not only your photo equipment, but also everyday items or travel luggage with you.
In the Everyday Backpack you can configure the interior individually (more on this below) and thus store the two separately - and access it independently through the two side openings.
In addition, you can pull the backpack from the right side in front of the body, for example, to access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while the everyday things stay safe in the left half of the backpack and do not come in between.
Comfortable, uncomplicated adjustable belts help in this.
And since the outer shell of the backpack is also completely made of 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the content remains dry even if it is to go to Scotland in the autumn.
Unfortunately, I am in vain waiting for the email from your support.

Hello, my order number is <0x23>NUMBER<0x23>. when will the item be delivered?
Order and payment was on 12.1.21.
I was delivered a completely different lamp than I ordered
Please give me a call
If you extend my voucher, I will immediately place a larger order, but anyway I kept the damaged piece of furniture and did not return it.
And that last year went differently than I thought I could not have guessed and I just couldn’t solve it in time and clarify.
But I have the damage as a customer and I do not accept that.
Rotinger brake discs are designed for the demands of the dynamic driver, the reliability and safety of braking can be appreciated even in difficult conditions.
Rotinger brake discs are made of cast iron and then machined (drilled and cut).
All tuned discs are produced in short series according to individual technical characteristics, which are specific to specific discs and patterns.
On the basis of the individual technical drawing, a special manufacturing program is created, which focuses on the balancing of the disc according to the characteristics of the original assembly.
The tuned discs produced in this way ensure high comfort and braking efficiency.
In addition, created openings increase the efficiency of cooling the disc, with the cuts improving the cleaning of the brake discs and brake pads.
The aesthetic characteristics of our tinted discs underline the character of every car with an attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man on the southern fork of the American River discovered glowing chunks in the water.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, the news spread quickly and triggered the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49.
Thousands came from near and far, making Coloma one of the fastest growing and thriving cities in the country.
Areas were cut off, tents were set up, and saloons and hotels were built almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country’s wealth.
For many it was called "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or Bankruptcy)!
In this game you are a pioneer who seeks wealth in the West and wants to make a name for himself.
You will look for gold, recruit workers, assemble horses, and build businesses.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding river basins and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You need to outsmart your pioneer colleagues in order not to get along with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast-paced strategy game with many ways to win.
You choose your actions at the same time, you have to stay at home with your resources and build a tableau that “works” more and more for you (so-called “engine building”).
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, receive additional actions, or apply rules in your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge plates, you can develop your individual style of play with the help of fine adjustments.
Coloma plays over a three-year period from 1848 (the year that gold was discovered in Coloma), over 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year in which California gained official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will secretly and at the same time select a location on the game plan where they can perform actions.
After that, their selection is revealed and they place their pioneers in the appropriate locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, it gets a lock!
This disables half of the location - thereby reducing the possible actions there.
Players then perform alternating actions, such as gaining resources, moving cars, setting up tents, searching for rivers, building bridges, opening stores, and positioning revolver heroes.
When all the actions are completed, the pioneers return.
The trigger turns to a new location at the beginning of each round and thus changes the available actions.
This goes on until the price has moved five times, so each location has once hidden and the year ends.
There is a shootout in which the players must defend Coloma from an assault of angry bandits.
If the players have contributed enough revolver heroes and are numerically superior to the bandits, they will receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they will receive smaller rewards or end up in the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shootout, then the final score is made.
The player with the most win points wins!
For free shipping I take up to the dimensions 35 x 25 x 4,5 cm the shipping method, the shipment of goods (games in foiled).
For everything else, mostly DPD insured and with shipment tracking (foliated games, wrapped with fly and packing paper).
If you are a collector then I can also send cartons in the carton for an extra charge of 2 euros, which is 100% non-printing stations.
"Why children are not tyrants" Doku, ARD Mediathek
CW mental violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentation appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I looked at it right away.
<0x3E>Children’s psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a popular guest on talk shows and gives lectures across Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyrants" (2008), he sparked a heated educational debate.
Former patients: those entitled to education are now making serious accusations against him.
Please be careful, the film is hard to bear.
And I’m very grateful that so many people think and act differently now.
Our parents and other responsible persons must never, never, ever go to power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child free space for his development and to make the framework for the child as large as it makes sense and possible in the situation.
Brrr, I'm still shaking.
Holetschek: Countries advise on the elimination of the test obligation for three-fold vaccinated
The health ministers of the countries want to decide at their next meeting on a nationwide elimination of the test obligation for triple vaccines.
"We countries need clarity quickly as to whether and from when three times vaccinated can be exempted from the test obligation," Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Health Ministerial Conference, told the "Image on Sunday".
The elimination of 2G plus for triple vaccines is "not only medically meaningful, but also provides an additional vaccine stimulus," Holetschek said.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised "that he will make a proposal to the Health Ministerial Conference as early as next Tuesday". <0xE2><0x88><0x92> afp
So I want to send the lamp back
What is the best way to do that?
Hello, I find the <0x23>PRS_ORG<0x23> chair very nice, but I can’t see how high the seating area is.
Can you continue to help me?
I can no longer make a purchase via my <0x23>PRS_ORG<0x23>.
Display: Ups, an error has occurred.
Shopping through the <0x23>PRS_ORG<0x23> page goes to the computer.
I have updated my account data.
What can this be about?
What you are describing is called *Awareness*, meaning sensory perceptions under full anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of about 1 to 1000.
The most common is hearing noises/voices, rarely seeing images, and most rarely feeling pain.
Relevant to this topic: C-sections are operations that are accompanied by an increased rate of awareness, as a very deep anaesthesia is avoided to protect the child until the abort.
Previous episodes of Awareness should be mentioned during the anesthesia interview.
Certain anesthesia procedures, such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Love everyone, this comment from me describes Awareness correctly, but had** u/Nitemarex **per definition none.
I read your comment wrong.
The chair is defective.
The $20 doesn’t help either.
These are legal guarantee claims.
The absolute minimum would be for them to take back the defective chair.
In addition to the legal obligation, this is also the standard in the field of e-commerce.
Please check again if you are at least taking back the defective chair.
We then sell the second chair privately.
We also lose a lot of money.
I already sent you an email that you did not reply to.
Again, the question.
In the order and on the invoice it is stated that the goods will be delivered up to a room of my choice.
The carrier is company <0x23>NAME<0x23>.
I just called there.
They told me they were only delivering at the front door - because of <0x23>PRS_ORG<0x23>.
Is that so?
If so, I have to cancel the order, as I do not know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture on the first floor.
Will I not be called?
I had formulated a question
Theatrical historian Günther Rühle died at the age of 97
He has profiled himself as a theatre critic and as an intendant.
He later wrote a monumental history of theatre.
On Friday, Günther Rühle died at the age of 97.
There’s the new book on the table, freshly printed: “An old man gets older”.
The shocking diary of a slow farewell from the world led by the theatre historian and journalist Günther Rühle until April 2021.
And in the middle of the reading comes the news that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book is: "I have already witnessed my life here."
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common are European pallets, standardized wooden pallets, which are used mainly in the European area as load carriers.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL
According to data from Statistics Austria, over ten million pallets were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value was about 79 million euros.
How many pallets are imported to Austria each year is not collected

Loading Tips & Tricks
I had a lot of great tips for the perfect gulasch here a week ago.
It was there at Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery!
So thank you again for that :)
Now I have come to the taste and want to cook rouladen for the first time on New Year’s Eve.
Tomorrow I'm going to set up a cattle fund for this.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I do not have an oven, but only a large pot.
How's it going now?
What about the books or how do I get them back on my <0x23>PRS_ORG<0x23>?
My English isn’t that good anymore, but I’ll get it.
It is about a refund of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC><0x23>NUMBER<0x23>
I was already informed by email on 18.01. that the refund was made.
So far, the money has not been received by me.

Where there are still Christmas chips in the Lübeck area
For many people, gans or duck belongs to the Christmas days such as the pine tree and the gifts.
You haven't taken care of any birds yet?
Now the time is running out.
We will tell you where you can still get a Christmas steak in the Lübeck area.
The "drive" of a pipe end stage contributes significantly to the heat and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the valve reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME controllers, you can adjust the desired level and the volume of your sounds.
In addition, the VT<0x2B> Series amplifiers offer a unique POWER LEVEL controller that allows you to reduce the sound level without changing the "gain" and distortion.
On top of that, it was already heard that with the POWER LEVEL controller you can even float a power reserve when it comes out of shame.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL controller, the full potential of the VT<0x2B> series can be exploited in any situation.
The headphone socket can also be used as a line output.
The signal here is processed by a box simulation, so that even when using a headphone or when recording directly, you get an eminently "acoustic" sound impression.
The AUX socket can be connected to a CD or MP3 player, so you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate tuner.
If you donate an additional VFS5 foot button, you can also conveniently call up the sounds by foot, turn on/off the effects blocks and "tap" the pace of the corresponding compatible effects.
In fact, this is essential for live use.
With its new power packs, VOX is taking another step into the future!
I had seen it that way with others.
Is it possible to return the lamp?
Because it's too low for over a dining table?
So I'd like to send her back.
Can you help me with this?
What about the dresser?
Will we receive an update to the exact delivery date in the coming weeks?
Hello, have you ever sat on the <0x23>PRS_ORG<0x23> chairs?
If it doesn’t work, I’d be happy with a discount or voucher.
I may find a buyer for the furniture.
Only over 1,000 euros for goods I don’t need is a lot.
I have just received my delivery and would like to know if screws were planned as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the <0x23>PRS_ORG<0x23> mirror (door) on the provided hooks.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting time is not worth it

Iran Sees Progress in Negotiations on Nuclear Accords
There is progress in the negotiations for a revival of the international nuclear agreement, according to Iran.
"Both sides are about to agree on the issues that should be on the agenda," Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri told the Irna news agency on Sunday.
This is a "positive and important development" because at first there was not even a consensus on the issues to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks on revitalizing the agreement had been resumed after a break of just under a week.
Traders from Iran, Germany, the UK, China, France and Russia will take part in the negotiations.
A U.S. delegation is also present in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Free State now the state with the highest incidence of Corona
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence in the whole of the country.
As the only federal state, the value is above the mark of 1000.
As the only federal state, Thuringia was above the mark of 1000 at the Corona incident on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute reported the seven-day value with 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had always had the highest incidence in the whole of the country, this value on Sunday was 990.5.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had decreased slightly, but had also been above the value of 1000.
In Thuringia, 2,242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 other deaths related to an infection were reported within a day.
200 serious Covid-19 patients were treated intensively in hospitals on Sunday.
There may be delays in reporting on weekends.
In addition, health officials have been overburdened for weeks and are hardly coming back with the detection of new cases.
I understand that.
Since the delivery is only in early March, it may be possible until then.
I have to print it out and paste it on the package and drop it off at the post office, that was it, wasn't it?
I don't need to click/insert/fill in here?
That’s exactly what I want to avoid, that’s why I’m writing to you.
I would like to accept the return at my own expense.
8 euro return fee is a freak in my eyes.
It's time for change
<0x23><0x23><0x23>MBundesday you are welcome to me, I am u/StratorDE in the Plenary Hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
Why the post here?
If you look at the activity in the past months of the MBU, you can see one thing: it is not extensive.
We have come to a winter star and have expanded the summer hole to a few months.
<0x23>Where is the problem?
Yeah, what was it like?
For the most part, this should simply be related to the dissatisfaction, how some things have gone on here and how we are in general.
In recent days it has become increasingly apparent that many here really still have bock on the Bundestag.
<0x23>What we need to change
At this point, the community is asked around the Mbundestag, who wants to keep it alive.
The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who has become aware of this project in the last few days and has found a, simply put, shear pile.
After some writing back and forth, several people from the community have found themselves wanting to rebuild the project.
However, I would also like to call on everyone to participate once again, only in this way this project can also have an existence in the future.
For this purpose, we have created a discussion platform in the form of a discord server on which we can exchange with each other, as well as work out specific things.
You can access the server via this link.
Objectives:
<0xE2><0x80><0xA2> How will the M.B. Day work in the future?
* Which existing orders need to be changed/adapted/removed?
<0xE2><0x80><0xA2> How will we move abroad in the future?
* How will new members be recruited?
How do we create a fair electoral system?
I’m pretty sure I’ve forgotten a lot, but what’s not bad, we’ve got the discord in the end.
If you have the desire and the time, come to the Discord, work with and let us decide democratically about the future.
I have ordered a lampshade from you that is still being delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big/cloudy for that and not suitable for my taste.
I have already ordered a different suspension for this.
I put it together and noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about that.
I hope this will be returned and I have a full refund.
This is also quite sad because the <0x23>NAME<0x23> is much darker than expected.
I have another question: the daily blanket <0x23>PRS_ORG<0x23>, is there also an oversize blanket, so in 240/240 for example?
<0x23>PRS_ORG<0x23> must be able to guarantee that the faulty cabinet will be picked up on time.
And I ask you to make that happen now.
I don't have a suitable packaging, but I will disassemble the cabinet as far as possible for the pick-up - they need to clarify with <0x23>PRS_ORG<0x23> how this can then work.
<0x23>PRS_ORG<0x23> can contact me by phone at any time to arrange a pick-up date.
Is there a manual for the assembly?
How much time do I have to take care of them or decide to return them?
How do you answer the question of why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague that I like.
She herself has lived vegetarian for a while now, probably also very rarely eat meat.
I was also a vegetarian for a few years.
Asked whether I have always wanted to be vegan, and whether vegetarianism was a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thought.
And while I thought for a long time that as a vegetarian I would support animal welfare, at some point I reflected and understood that I ultimately support animal cruelty.
So I decided to become vegan.
At that moment, I had the impression that her side was disgusted, then she defended vegetarianism and meant that she knew where her meat came from and that as a vegetarian you would reduce animal suffering.
Now I wonder if my answer to “plump” was?
How do you answer the question?
I have the feeling that you as a vegan are quickly stuck in a corner and conflict arises without it being put on.
It greets a harmonious vegan (;
This is clearly not an exception under <0xC2><0xA7> 312d BGB.
Your <0x23>PRS_ORG<0x23> does not disconnect from the legal requirements for remote access.
I am not on the assigned date when <0x23>PRS_ORG<0x23> picks up my return.
Since I can’t be there for a funeral, that can’t be changed either.
Can I be assigned an alternative pick-up date?
From 01.02.<0x23>NUMBER<0x23> I am constantly coming back.
Lahnsteiner Wehr equipped for water rescue: 45,000 Euro grant from the country
Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Interior Minister Roger Lewentz handed over a 45,000-euro grant to Mayor Peter Labonte at the Lahnstein Town Hall for the new water rescue equipment wagon of the Lahnstein Volunteer Fire Brigade.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, amounted to 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in security.
I am pleased that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate supports us in this,” says Lahnstein’s mayor Peter Labonte.
The equipment wagon is used by Lahnstein, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Over and under water they perform tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein there is a growing number of operations: the boom of the hotel boating on the Rhine and the Moselle as well as the increasing use of the lahn as a leisure flow contribute to this.
I bought myself a book that I could only read to 10% and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
I have followed their recommendations, however, have synchronized, removed and reloaded the app NOTHING worked.
I’m a bit frustrated because the whole action has already cost me a lot of time and now I’m hoping for help.
Okay, that's it.

Thank you for putting yourself here for the first time, I have also spent almost a decade in the civil service in a similar activity, so to speak, we were also arms carriers in the executive, I do not want to go on about it!
The question of right and left is always very simplistic.
In principle, however, one should say that, of course, the civil servant comes from the liberal to the conservative spectrum, and not from the revolutionary left, this should be clear to everyone.
That, of course, even in the particular uniforms and coats of arms, it is necessary to make it clear to everyone that these people, of course, can hard to deal with the living reality, but of course, it is also clear, because of course you have to a mediocre whites and women, but I don't want to use it to the Germans with the migration background, women and also gays.
But even if for the first time it sounds strange to my experience to have a conservative attitude, they are proud of Germany and feel less picked up by exaggerated left-wing politics, even if this policy is supposed to be used for them or intends to make it right.
Back to the right, since of course police and armed forces are also a cross-section of society, you will also find extreme rights there, but that these may openly say their opinion there or even openly forge any state-threatening plans is medially totally exaggerated and irritates me as well.
Of course, it happens that even police officers and soldiers who were often deployed abroad often start to flatten out because of negative experiences and also sometimes say things that are controversial until politically incorrect.
It also happens that sometimes right-wing colleagues meet who are engaged in a rainy exchange of thoughts.
Nevertheless, in my opinion, this is well fought and also countered by political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so international and that is also good in my opinion that we could not afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
What I don’t understand, I ordered the other basket on the German side.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered it was not sold out.
I already ordered it in November.
it was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order
It is still about my order, which is no longer available.
I've been chatting with <0x23>NAME<0x23> before.
Alternatively, you could deliver the other <0x23>PRS_ORG<0x23> basket for <0x23>NUMBER<0x23> Euro in black to Germany or this basket is also available somewhere in Germany.
I always find you as a partner company.

Ordinary for a child?
Hello, I (w32) have been busy with something for a long time.
I am very disciplined and organized at work (I am self-employed, very little free time), but my whole life I get more bad than right to run my budget permanently clean and tidy.
There are always phases in which everything stays, and then and when it packs me and I clean up and clean up.
But it’s never really so “someone could come to visit spontaneously”.
My husband is (unfortunately) also not better, it bothers me somewhere but mostly loses budget just against work and dislike.
The kitchen is cleaned regularly as we like to cook.
Now to my question, have you managed to become more orderly with a child?
But we haven't worked on it yet, and I've been busy with this question for a long time.
Because for me I have no incentive, it just doesn’t bother me as doll as long as no visit comes and e.g. always fresh clothes are there and the kitchen is usable.
Do you have a bigger stimulus with your child or do you stay slutty?
I look forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new and high-quality, as well as anatomically preformed cut, offers maximum comfort, a perfect fit and thus allows almost unlimited freedom of movement.
Preform with special, further embossing on the joints for improved freedom of movement (on arm and knee)
For the Focea Comfort 4, the Flex System 2 has more than doubled the area covered by the Flex System to further increase comfort.
Seamless stretch panels at the joints reduce friction (axis, arm and knee bending)
High-quality preforms in the lower back area and in the step ensure a tight, perfect seat.
Elaskin 8.8 Stretch panel in the lumbar spine area increases the flexibility around the back zipper and thereby improves comfort, especially when bending and when mounting and laying the equipment on the surface.
The Free Flex Zone around the shoulders and back guarantees increased flexibility in arm and back movements.
Fireskin is a warm, water-repellent material with a special surface structure that offers a high degree of cold protection.
Positioned on the chest, it brings heat to a sensitive area of the body.
Seamless, thin (-2 mm) seal on the face on the hood increases comfort, sealing and durability (separate head hood)
Soft zone in the collar improves the sealing with a finely adjustable width adjustment by a flexible, gentle velcro closure, which does not adhere to the casing or the seams
Double cuffs with zip on arm and foot joints connect a foldable inner cuff with a soft, cassetteted neoprene outer cuff
45<0xC2><0xB0> lacing at the closure of the inner cuff for increased elasticity and wearability.
Long zip at the neck with an elastane reinforcement, for an anatomical cut with increased comfort at the waist without hood
Long G-Lock P back zipper (overall without hood) with metal slider and built-in Water Dam system for improved sealing (Beuchat patent)
Zippers on arms and legs
Neoprene reinforcements at all ends of the zippers to prevent tearing if excessive force is applied.
Neoprene panels smoothly glued with outer and inner overlap
Edges of the outer cuffs sewn for greater loadability
Edges of the inner cuffs embossed for increased flexibility
The original Beuchat system was designed to fix the computer in its place, especially for deeper dives (the system is compatible with all common bracelet computers)
Career in social work - as someone with a self-confident personality disorder?
I have been training in software development and I have been studying for about a year now.
Unfortunately, I find more and more that this profession is not the right one for me, which is why I have been thinking about starting again and studying social work for a long time.
The problem: I have a self-confident (or anxiety-avoiding) personality disorder (EVPS).
That means, roughly speaking, I don’t have a sense of self-esteem and I’m shy accordingly.
I don’t have a problem talking to people on a factual level, but I find it very difficult to have loose conversations and I’ve been told more often that I’m acting imminent (though I think that’s already gotten better).
Can I become a social worker?
I do not want to work as a street worker or in an open youth meeting, but rather in, for example, addiction counseling or family help.
But I don’t know if the concrete workday is really the way I imagine it, and it’s hard to find something about it on the Internet.
The EVPS is already leading to problems in my job (for me, emotionally) because it pulls me down every time there is something to complain about in my code ("even the simplest things messed up again") and it's hard for me to think of more experienced colleagues, etc. I have to ask them to help me.
The problems I will probably have in every profession but I wanted to mention it in place.
Have you received the sofa yet?
Because there was no confirmation of that either.
I'm waiting for an appointment for pickup
What do you mean by return?
When I have downloaded a book to the <0x23>PRS_ORG<0x23>, the message your <0x23>PRS_ORG<0x23> does not authorize this book
Is there a problem?
I was chatting with <0x23>PRS_ORG<0x23>, who asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my closet.
The protein (protein) absorbed with the feed decomposes the bird in its gastrointestinal tract into the individual protein building materials (amino acids) and in turn builds up its own body proteins, which it also needs for the formation of feathers.
The feather formation in the nesting and the new feather formation in the mouse bird are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high stress for the animal’s overall organism.
Please note that NEKTON bio must not be administered during breeding, as otherwise there may be disturbances in the breeding process.
Following this curative administration of NEKTON-Bio, the daily supply of vitamins with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral preparation) should be resumed.

1 g NEKTON bio on 250 ml of water or 100 g of soft food.
It is recommended to prepare only as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes on a daily basis and to change water/feeds on a daily basis.
One streaked measuring spoon (inside) corresponds to 1 g of NEKTON bio.
In the case of severe feather damage, the double or triple dose of NEKTON bio can be given at the beginning until the approach to feather re-formation is visible.
After this, the normal dose is administered until the spring reconstitution is complete.
Storage: NEKTON bio should be stored dry without sunlight, between 15<0xC2><0xB0> and 25<0xC2><0xB0>C.
Please excuse me, but the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break after 9 months?
The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
This is really very bad service.
Hello, I sent an e-mail on Monday to inform you that my order has arrived damaged and pictures have been attached.

Statement by a community worker in opposition to the Statute
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
On our property is to like a walnut tree.
So a case application has been submitted to the community.
An employee writes to me that the fall of fruit trees and thus also the walnut is not part of the statute.
In the statute, however, the walnut is explicitly stated as a tree to be protected.
Can I now rely on the employee’s statement or not?
On the one hand, I have to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statute is clear.
Thank you for your feedback.
We understand that.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I haven't received a message
Well, then I still have a sofo unused.
Would you be able to offer me a discount or a voucher?
What was more expensive?
yes, I think that, only the question is yes, if I can pay in euros and have the ceiling delivered to Germany
Can you check that out?

Advice and ideas for further professional life
Merry Christmas to you for the first time!
Unfortunately, my Christmas is moderately good, because my dear head is just thinking of everything you can think of.
Before I get here right now .. in short: I need advice and best of all from people who somehow know my situation - so from you.
I'm just doing the ref as a cross-sectioner.
Originally I studied something else and also worked there in an area (to remain at least a little anonymous, I do not mention anything more specifically).
The whole thing was too boring for me and I looked for alternatives that could make me more fun.
At some point I landed at the faculty and I was sure it was - even though the framework conditions are significantly more inflexible than in my previous profession, but that didn't matter to me.
I'm now at the third "I google other job offers".
And it's only been six months.
With the paintings before, I have always decided to continue and at least finish the ref, after that I can still turn around.
But right now I'm absolutely done.
I had so little free time last month that I was completely exhausted.
It’s a holiday, but there’s still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the ref I always thought I was stress-resistant, but my weekend was also my weekend and my holiday night was my holiday night.
I was free.
And the stress at work didn't matter in those moments.
The family holiday is too stressful for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that additionally irritate me.
Basically, it’s fun and from the outside, the ref is also running well in terms of feedback and so on.
But I’m completely exhausted and wondering how much stress my body can withstand before it closes completely – if it doesn’t already.
I wonder if I would like to have this for the rest of my working life - just when I read some of your contributions here - or if I should not go back to the old area now, because where I was valued, I could take some free time to work as if I needed it, and the work was kind of boring.
But then I wonder if in a year I have not come back to the same place as I am now and am dissatisfied.
You see, it’s all sort of weird, but maybe as outside advice or ideas, you’ve come out of this situation, which I’m completely done with, and almost at the slightest thought of it, I’m starting to cry.
I’m not going to make decisions emotionally right now, which probably leads to nothing good.
But maybe your views will help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel – or to enjoy Christmas, that’s enough for me first.
Thank you for reading and apologise for my bitter undertones.
I hope my situation has become at least a little clearer.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has evolved steadily, which has led to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly imitates the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps, we are introducing a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely up-to-date in terms of sound.
Thanks to the VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of the components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers are waiting for an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Of course, these amps also include the multi-stage valvetronix tube preamp.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because these simply get the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuit, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system from which the natural resonances only swirl.
With VOX's "Tone Room" software, you can even correct and bend historical facts at the virtual level until the amp and effects sound as you've always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Of course, it has since been refined several times to meet new sound requirements, which in 2010 again led to a boost in the performance of the VOX Valvetronix series – with more dynamics as well as numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20<0x2B> to the VT120<0x2B> with two speakers, the new VT<0x2B> Valvetronix series has also been designed so that all guitarists looking for maximum sound diversity can be found here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a bold sound, a nuanced playback of dynamics and strings as well as a prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that the end stage determined the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
Equipped with a 12AX7 tube, the valve reactor circuit of each VT<0x2B> amplifier perfectly shapes the behavior, subtle nuances and sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner: Magic lose to Clippers
The Orlando Magic series of defeats in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine – but it’s not enough to win the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven counters from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost on Saturday 104:106 to the Los Angeles Clippers.
The large main compartment is also adaptable: with three individually positionable and foldable velcro dividers, it is completely tailored to the needs of your photo equipment and is therefore suitable for any type of camera - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-format mirrors.
What ultimately fits in the backpack depends, of course, on the size of the camera and the lens.
A possible fixture would be a DSLR camera with a fixed lens, two to three interchangeable lenses and a flash.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the various models of the Sony-a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 still leave room for more lenses.
In addition, you can still store a lot of accessories.
And anyone who has a small DSLM camera (Olympus MFT cameras, Fujifilm X-A or E-Series) can use the backpack for his equipment and for photographic things.
With the Everyday Backpack 20L, drone pilots also make an optimal choice, as the backpack provides enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcano eruption on La Palma: probably the longest in history
In the nearly three months since the outbreak began, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused major damage.
Is an end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days, the volcano eruption on La Palma has been the longest in the Spanish Canary Island history since Sunday.
To date, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585 with 84 days was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
There are no reliable data on previous outbreaks.
Although the activity of the still nameless volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has declined somewhat in recent days, volcanologists still did not dare to predict when it could end.
The indicators indicate a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said the president of the island council, Mariano Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez Zapata, the state television station RTVE.
Damage in millions
In the nearly three months since the outbreak began, the more than 1000-degree-hot lava has destroyed nearly 2,900 residential homes and other buildings, RTVE reported.
Nearly 1,200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick lava layer.
This is equivalent to nearly 1,700 football fields.
More than 7,000 residents had to be evacuated, the damage is estimated to be more than 900 million euros.
Before the coast, two new lands with a total size of about 50 hectares were created by cooled lava.
Banana cultivation, of which about half of the 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly and which was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption, was particularly hard to deal with.
225 hectares of banana plantations have been destroyed, other areas severely damaged, the newspaper "El Pa<0xC3><0xAD>s" wrote.
Christmas and the Gifts
Christmas is at the door and especially the children will be looking forward to the heavenly feast.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have connected with the spiritual atmosphere and the blinking tension something seductive in itself.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still hold our increasingly divided society together.
It is all the more important to become aware of the Christmas tradition of donation, so that the gesture of donation, which, according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss, was a peace-founding "social contract of natural peoples" can be re-entered with this strict routine of life.
How Nicholas became the Christ Child
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants through whom the Christmas days were closely linked to the gift.
Previously, gifts were presented in one way or another on St. Nicholas Day.
The background of this still popular sitter today is that St. Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, secretly threw three women gold into their windows one night to spare them another life in sin.
From this unconventional kind of gifting, the popular custom in Germany emerged to fill the boots with presents especially for children.
Protestants faced this custom because they rejected intermediaries between God and people as "holy worship."
For these reasons, they defend themselves against the institution.
Martin Luther made from the Nicholas the Christkind and thus founded a new line of tradition.
The focus of the gift shifted to the Christmas Eve.
Since most Protestants do not see such detailed questions as closely, only the few still irritate the fact that the custom of St. Nicholas is still a fixed part of the pre-Christmas season, much like the use of Martinssingen and Martinssingen.
Today you will find in boots in front of the door and under the Christmas tree from socks to coveted luxury watches everything the heart desires.
Diversity of Traditions in Christian Countries
Sources prove a tradition of giving since the 13th century on the day of St. Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the day of the gift shifted to Christmas Eve.
In all Christian-style countries, however, there is a happily-formed cuddle on the question of who will now bring the gifts to the children.
In Germany it depends on the respective region whether the Christ Child appears on the Holy Evening or the Santa Claus, who is in principle a type of Nicholas, to which some species have been assigned over time.
This includes, for example, his white noise bar, which has little in common with the rather strict assyrier bar of the historical figure, his sled, which is drawn by pensioners, and the preference of the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, St. Nicholas remains the central figure on Christmas Day.
In Spain, the Holy Three Kings give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is supposed to show them the way to the child Jesus.
In Scandinavia, sometimes fairytales bring the gifts, while in Russia it brought Frost to some glory.
Here it is not reindeer, but three horses that pull his sleds as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the motherland of the Reformation during the Hussite wars, the Christkind is responsible for handing over the gifts.

Police shoot suspected bank robber near Royal Palace <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Near Kensington Palace in London, an armed man was shot dead by police on Saturday.
Police said callers had reported a man who was supposed to have gone to a bank with a gun and a bookmaker's shop.
The man fled, according to authorities, in a vehicle that could be stopped a little later by officials.
Shots were fired and the man was shot.
He was still pronounced dead at the scene.
The police did not come from a terrorist background.
Several embassies are located in the area around Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and the three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.

The decorative lamp harmoniously fits into any bed, garden area or stone garden.
The lamp is easy to set up and can be anchored with 2 earth splashes in the ground.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Luminous duration max. 10 hrs.
- The sturdy plastic version can be used outdoors all year round.
In the Hollywood spectacle, it is usually threatening objects from distant galaxies that glow brightly in color.
On the other hand, “Smart Stone” is harmless: The sun alone makes this solar light radiate fascinatingly – optionally in white or colored light (in the same six different shades).
The edgeless, amorphous design is chosen consciously: like a natural shaped large silhouette, this modern light object presents itself by day.
Its organic roundings fit in any natural environment – whether on the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the stone bed.
He also does well in the neighborhood of larger pebbles and findlings, where he knows how to claim thanks to his size.
Large pre-workouts can be saved: »Smart Stone« does not require no power supply or batteries as a solar lamp.
Place the “lightstone” in any place that is sunny.
Two earth splices provided ensures a firm hold when needed.
The matt white plastic case itself is robust and weatherproof.
Its solar module hides "Smart Stone" discreetly inside it, along with its battery and two LEDs – one for white, the other for colored light.
The battery already charges when sunlight falls on the housing.
When it gets dark, "Smart Stone" starts to illuminate automatically; in which color you decide for yourself: Just six attractive light colors are available to you – alongside daylight white – to choose from.
Finally, the switch off is also done automatically as soon as the battery charge level has dropped to a predetermined minimum or it becomes bright again.
As soon as the sun shines again, the charging cycle starts the next day from the front.
I’ve done this several times and it doesn’t work.
Sorry, I would like to continue ordering from you, but if the voucher is not charged to me, I will no longer order in principle.
If you think otherwise, let me know.
Otherwise, that was the last contact today.
Then please send me the number for the sideboard.
In the lockdown, however, no construction market was opened....
The engine control of the LokSound 5 has again been fundamentally improved.

Pills problem
"Hello, dear women.
I hope I do everything right here, after a year reddit is actually my first post.
To my problem: I had to start taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had so incredibly bad pain during the period and fuck PMS before the period.
Now I would like to let this stay again because I already have to take enough medications due to chronic diseases that I can’t choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
At my last about two-year break I had gotten from 0 to 100 explosion-like spikes and these everywhere.
So far so superficial, but it made me feel pretty good and I didn't feel comfortable.
Over the past two years, this has never really normalized.
Maybe someone has some tips to avoid that this time around.
Perfume-free and without tinnitus, my cosmetics are already, but maybe there is something someone can recommend to me.
Unfortunately, the female doctor didn't take me so seriously and the dermatologist's appointment is still coming.
Many thanks to everyone who has read the novel!
Lovely skin is such a thing.
Had precursor bad neurodermitis, then a time of rest, then large-scale node patches and acne topic.
I also tried everything possible in the course of chronic disease and I was hung on sugar, milk and low-fat mixed food because otherwise nothing worked so well.
It may also be good that hormonel is just the worm inside, but if you like me everywhere you want to stop also prefer not to go looking for what else is still wrong.
I already had everything from her colleague's seminar.
I have written and now I have lost the conversation and do not know what has been answered to my concern.
I always have to work through and on the phone and suddenly everything was gone...
What is there to check if the money was there, I would have seen it

The approval for the laying of the new high-voltage cable at Tann is valid.
The plan-setting decision of the government of Lower Bavaria frees the way for construction, which is due to begin in 2022.
This was announced by the network operator Bayernwerk.
The seven-kilometre-long earth cable will connect the Tann substation in the north of the municipality and the existing 110 kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable is connected to a free-wire mast near the village of Edermanning near Reut.

Ref: School planning (EK)
Hello, ladies and gentlemen,
I have been in the Ref since summer, teaching is fun for me, but I still have big problems planning my teaching in the field of geosciences.
Unfortunately, my school is technically not well equipped, so in principle I can only use the board, the school book and an OHP as a medium.
In school I can only copy s/w for free (which is annoying for geography).
I just need a lot of time to plan my classes.
For example, we are currently doing the topic of geofactors and in my case, every hour stands for itself.
In principle, the methods are always repeated, but on the other hand, I do not want to invest too much time for simple lessons (which I also need for UBs, etc.).
When planning, I always start from the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build that (usually I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school does not have).
We have the book Terra and with most tasks in the book I am rather dissatisfied.
So also the worksheets.
Maybe a geoscientist can tell me how to work with the book in a timely manner.
I'd really like it.
I would like to return the <0x23>PRS_ORG<0x23> from the order <0x23>NUMBER<0x23>.
I have actually already decided on a new one at <0x23>PRS_ORG<0x23> but I would like to finish the return as soon as possible for the first time.
The trade is afraid of the 2G regulation around the Christmas trade.
In most shops, only who is vaccinated or cured is allowed.
The trade considers this unnecessary and complains of revenue breaches.
He is also prepared for a possible solution.
From the point of view of the German Trade Association (HDE), the 2G regulations are ruining the important Christmas business for retailers.
In dealings with items of non-daily need, sales failures were to be complained, HDE chief executive Stefan Genth criticised.
According to a recent HDE survey of 1,100 retailers, more than 70 percent of companies looked negatively at the rest of the year.
A lot of people have already written off the Christmas business.
"What should actually be the positive highlight of the year is now often a hole without soil," Genth said.
Traders with 2G access restrictions lost almost a third of their pre-crisis sales in the past week.
It works well only in the food retail as well as in the online area.
The association demanded consequences from the dramatic development.
Purchasing with a mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the CEO.
“2G shopping does not take us further in the fight against the pandemic,” he said.
The current regulations deterred customers and required a high level of staffing.
The tyre scheme must be approved nationwide, he demanded.
After that, each customer only had to be checked on 2G once (vaccinated or cured) and had access to all the stores with the received tape on that day.
In addition, sampling checks should be sufficient in the retail sector, as is already the case with the 3G rule (vaccinated, cured or tested) in public transport.
The real estate group Deutsche Euroshop, which specializes in shopping malls, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were last without 2G at well 75 percent of the pre-Corona levels, the sales at about 90 percent.
These numbers will now surely fall in the middle of such an important Christmas business," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner of the "Economic Week".
Due to the high personnel and administrative effort, the center is trying to find solutions and get approved.
This includes the so-called ribbon solution, in which "visitors, for example, at a central location in the center once provide their 2G detection and then - equipped with a bracelet similar to a club hotel - can enter all shops without interruption". dpa
I recently ordered the <0x23>PRS_ORG<0x23> and got delivered.
The mirror has a scratch and on the frame is also an error that has been tried to be cassetted with a yellow filler.
That looks awkward.
I would like to return the mirror and have already packed it back into the package and glued it.
How do I proceed with the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual-balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high performance and high color reproduction.
The adjustment of the color temperature and brightness of the lamp is ensured by a modern microprocessor with exceptional possibilities.
In addition to the brightness adjustment, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually adjust and store the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controller, it is simple and intuitive to use.
The lamp generates a very flow of light with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free.
The 120-degree radiation angle that allows you to illuminate large areas at relatively small distances is excellent.
By the way, also in reporting situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness virtually without changing the color temperature.
It’s a great tool to work on either the movie set or in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows remote control of the light in TV studios or when the light is mounted in hard-to-reach areas.
At the back of the lamp is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a bright display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Furthermore, there is the slot for the NP-F batteries (not included)
The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To perform the settings of the individual settings on the memory slots, simply press one of the memory buttons for a longer period of time.
The memory controller stores the current state of the lamp when switching off, so that when switching on again the known situation is restored - very convenient when working in the studio, for example, when the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
Working with battery one of the biggest strengths of the DL3120 functionality results from the possibility of operating with cheap NP-F batteries.
These are often already owned by photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can rely on existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set whether the batteries have sufficient power - it is a battery test equal to built-in - for each of the two battery compartments a value in the two displays (the left battery top display, the right on the bottom display).
In addition, it is of course possible to continuously supply the headlamp with electricity via the supplied power supply.
The construction of the headlamp is very simple.
They have a 16mm sleeve as a connection for fastening, so you can directly to your photo stand.
The inclination can be adjusted reliably on both sides by means of fasteners.
It was taken into account that the mechanical components are also extremely high quality and are therefore also designed for longevity and hard use.
In addition, a tilt joint is included in the delivery.
Largely, this is included in the delivery as well as a bag.
So you can safely transport or store the lamp with all the accessories you may still want to buy, without any problems.
It's a shame I gave it away and it's too small. :(
"Party we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates after comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last two in the series, defeatless Hesse was supposedly on their way to the next Bundesliga draw.
But then the SGE turned up, within a good hour, got frustrated with a mature start of the season from the soul and won furiously with 5:2. "It's madness what the boys did today," cheered coach Oliver Glasner at DAZN.
At first, it looked like a new damper for the Frankfurters who are still behind their expectations now in rank nine.
Patrik Schick led the Leverkuseners with 2-0.
What happened then impressed the SGE-Trainer as well.
"How the players then came back and showed a fantastic performance," Glasner continued.
I am extremely happy with the performance we have shown and of course with the result.
Also defender Christopher Lenz, who for the first time since the fourth day of the game and his overcome muscle injury was able to stand on the pitch, emphasized the morale of his teammates.
"I think our mentality is incredibly great," the 27-year-old said, looking forward to seeing the result, especially for viewers.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
However, Glasner now wants to keep the focus on the upcoming tasks, but is also well positioned in terms of the personnel situation.
It is extraordinary that we have all players fit in December that all players are physically in a top constitution.
It is top work in our medical department, but also the players live highly professionally.
Now we want to "step by step and stay humble" and move the tasks "to this level" until the turn of the year.
Next up is an away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach (18.30, Sky) on Wednesday during the English week.
Grade I get the mail that my package comes back to you due to an error on my part.
I tried to call <0x23>PRS_ORG<0x23> and let it redirect, no chance.
Can it be shipped directly to me again or do I have to wait until the money is returned and place the order again?
For me, it would mean that I will not order again because it has already taken a long time.
Have you ever sat on the <0x23>PRS_ORG<0x23> chairs?
Handball women's dampers ahead of quarterfinals against Spain
Germany’s handball women slammed against Denmark after humiliation with their heads hanging and empty glances from the parquet.
At the end of the World Cup final, the DHB selection at 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers scored a heavy defeat and must now run against host Spain in the quarterfinals.
“We were too scared and had too much respect for the opponent,” said Bundestrainer Henk Groener.
We have to act differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished the main round group III with 8:2 points as second behind the Danes (10:0).
It's a shame we couldn't take the flow with us.
It was a bad game for everyone that we have to delete," said captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight to enter the semi-finals, a significant increase must be made against the 2019 World Cup Seconds on Tuesday to keep the delicate dream of the first medal alive since 2007.
The best German thrower in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was backroom player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We just weren't there - neither in the attack, nor in the defense," backroom player Xenia Smits admitted and demanded: "We have to look forward quickly now."
From the front to the back not at the height
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team with the Anpfiff was not at the top.
Failures and technical failures in the attack and gaps in the defense were responsible for a quick 0:4 rebound after seven minutes.
Only Torwife Dinah Eckerle was immediately at operating temperature and prevented worse with some parades.
The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully completed a quick match.
However, the expected initial inflammation was not.
Against the aggressive coverage of the Danes, the German women could hardly stand in the scene - and if so, they mostly failed at the strong Althea Reinhardt in the Scandinavians' gate.
Thus, the match had run early at 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially since back room player Mia Zschocke soon after saw red due to a hard foul on her opponent.
In the quarter-finals, they are allowed to play again.
Only in the final phase of the first half did the DHB selection get a little better into the game and until the break reached at least five goals.
However, the only quiet hope for a catch-up after the change was already there after seven minutes at 9:19.
Again, the Greener defenders sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-placed opponent, who is one of the medal candidates in the final round.
As a result, the German team was no longer able to climb to an increase in performance and went as a clear loser from the parquet.

Cheesecakes?
Tree ornaments?
Is it musical?
Is the Santa Claus coming, the Christ Child, or is it the gift of Grandma and Grandpa?
No matter how you do it, everyone gives up and around Christmas effort to have it as nice as possible as a family.
Whether these are solid traditions, or even something different every year: tell us how it went or went in your family!

Is this going on with them?
The title is there, I work as an improviser in mobile vaccination teams, where (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is vaccinated v.a. in nursing homes.
Since these are soon to be completed in large part, it will continue to be partly in vaccination centres for me.
I like to answer questions without a time limit on the organisational and human aspects and also medical questions, as long as these are not related to a person (e.g., "I take medication X, this tolerates vaccination...").
My task includes clarification for the vaccination, the position of indication (person is entitled to a vaccination according to the coronavirus vaccine regulations and no reasons to speak against it), medical documentation and, if necessary, emergency care in case of allergic reactions (we have never happened).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, e.g. medical specialists.
In vaccine teams, however, we often don’t have any, but “only” (for God’s sake, no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for the preparation of vaccines, but they can’t (can’t) carry out vaccinations, so I’m doing most vaccinations myself.
Serious "huidlerer" question: Amberger knows the solution
What is a "huidler"?
With this dialectic word, sent by an Amberger, the BR TV show "Wir in Bavaria" has been provided for intense reflection.
However, unlike many previous days, the term in the series "Host me?" this time remained unsure by the callers.
No, it wasn't a "man who's nervous."
And no one said, “Everything has to go fast.”
That, people heard from the TV moderator, was completely wrong.
Then the man from Amberg announced the solution, and thus probably surprised many of the upper palzers.
"The skinler," the spectators learned, "is a patch with which someone wipes the oven".
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, interviewed by Bavarian TV for years as an expert, confirmed this.
With the note that this is a typical Upper Paleolithic term, somehow derived from the more well-known oral word "holding".
With this, an educational gap was closed - probably even for some who have been living in the Amberg area for a long time.
I have not been able to buy books for two weeks.
There is always the following error message after confirmation: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I restarted the <0x23>PRS_ORG<0x23> gel<0x23>PRS_ORG<0x23>n, connected to the PC, synced and repaired.
Nothing's helped.
Tire selection on a race bike – really that panic-proof?
This morning I woke up with a lot of effort, because I wanted to train at least a little bit in preparation for my bike tour in the coming week.
That said, I did and I drove with my racing bike, which I bought on eBay yesterday.
The first 40km were also really nice - but then what happened in every downtown town (this time: thank you Krefeld!).
Glass splitter on the track.
Zack, loud rush and my rear tyre didn’t want to join the rest of the track at all.
Since I had no real way to get a replacement coat and tube because of the day of the week, I had to turn around again with half a bad mood and take the first-best train home.
It wasn’t too bad when it came to running, maybe it’s even better if I practice it with the tire change before the bike ride.
But now I have a question and I hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long distance over several days ahead of me, I would get extremely unhappy with this problem more often.
Now was really not bad, because even the old tires from the previous owner (very nice old man, on the day I got to pick up the bike I ripped off until 2 pm 120km!) and who had already called it suboptimal because he has been riding with them for several years.
But if I think that I have to make a tire change when driving after 80-90kms, then I think I'm really bad luck :D
Now I got into a conversation with an older man at the train staircase, who asked me wondering why I wouldn’t have the Marathon Plus tires; these should be inextricable.
Now, of course, the whole thing sounds very tempting.
But are they really so incapacitated?
I don’t want to spend 40<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>/tyre now, just to be disappointed.
I also wonder: I have at the moment on the race bike I believe 25x622.
There are also (apparently?) tyres in the Marathon Plus, but most are already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you advise me on other tyres in a race bike in general?
The Schwalbe side seems to be my absolute! Is it better to recommend the Durano DD?
Thanks in advance for the help and dear congratulations!
Car scrambles against tree: driver fatally injured
The 53-year-old had crashed on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten with his car for an undisclosed cause against a central island and then hit the interstate, police said.
There was a frontal collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The 53-year-old's car was then slid against a tree and the man clamped in the car.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old passenger were seriously injured in the accident and taken to surrounding hospitals.

After the release of our new high-end broadband B 100-6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series would also have a baby again.
SOLO 15 is the new launcher and is visually reminiscent of the large models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, in this construction proposal, an appropriately designed foot is included directly in order to raise the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no influence on the acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length according to the conditions at home.
In principle, the SOLO 15 is very well suited for people where the maximum volume plays a more subordinate role, but is intended to achieve an exceptionally high level of sound.
A 10 cm speaker is simply unable to generate such high sound pressure levels almost unfiltered.
However, this does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, it appears considerably adult and for its size extremely impressive and accurate.
Tonal was tuned to the SOLO 15 with a slight high pitch.
This is common in broadband in order to optimise the highly increasing bandwidth at too high frequencies.
Exactly aligned to the listening pitch, the SOLO 15 convinces with a very clear and fine sound.
Slightly turned outwards, the high-tone range can be reduced and the sound image can thus be made warmer.
Thanks to the point sound source, the location of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereo triangle is sharp and surprisingly precise.
The extremely low mechanical losses of the reference B 100 - 6 OHM ensure an enemy dynamics that seeks the same.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but also extends it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all of our construction kits, it is recommended to first think about the final look of the speaker, in order to plan appropriate changes during construction.
For example, if you want to veneer the housing, the lowering of the speaker must be adjusted accordingly, since the veneer again carries material.
After all the plates have been cut (e.g. in the construction market), you should first drill an 8 mm hole into the bottom plate at the appropriate place, so that you can later easily carry out the cable there.
With the help of a top milling machine, the speaker opening in the front is now followed, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be used later in a smooth manner.
On the back side, this opening should be provided with a 45<0xC2><0xB0> phase in order to make the opening surface of the speaker chassis inside as large as possible.
The four screwing points of the B 100 - 6 OHM are interrupted in the phase, as shown in the picture "Detail Phase".
After that, you start with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of you.
The back wall, the lid, the front and the floor are now peeled onto them.
In this case, the three stiffeners should also be used and glued.
The stiffenings themselves can vary in material thickness if needed, for example, if you want to use finished products from the construction market instead of making them yourself from 16 mm MDF.
In the next work step, the second side is attached.
After that, all the plates of the foot, that is, the two sides, as well as the front.
By means of a suitable hole-circle saw or a forstner drill, the apertures of the bass reflex tube, as well as the connection clamp on the back wall, are facilitated.
Then use a round milling machine to round off all the edges of the actual box.
The top of the foot plate can also be rounded off.
Subsequently, the foot plate is firmly glued to the foot of the housing and additionally screwed with long wooden screws.
It follows the marking and pre-drilling (2.5 mm drills) of the screwing points of the speaker chassis and the connection clamp.
After the housing has been cleaned of wood dust (suck / blow out), you start laying the cable.
The simplest way to do this is through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the back wall.
The entire and uncut cable is pushed piece by piece through the 8 mm hole into the foot to the terminal opening and let it stand out there about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the housing, one leads the cable to the speaker opening and lets it also loosely hang out there.
Subsequently, the frequency ranges are prepared and used.
The building plan of the frequency branches, as well as the corresponding connection plan can be taken from the following document: Installation instructions Soft Solo 15.
If the frequency switch is installed and the connection terminal is screwed, the sealing of the 8 mm cable opening inside the box is followed, which is not yet completely closed.
Thanks to the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening and with some skill, you can drop hot glue onto the opening and close it.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and using a small lamp, the seal can be checked accordingly.
Now the damping is followed by the description.
Subsequently, the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and screwed with the corresponding screws.
The polarity plays an important role in this, so that the plus line (marked cable) has to be soldered at the plus pole of the speaker (greater contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is shortened to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and inserted.
For damping, a mat of the damping material is cut into two parts and distributed loosely in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept open.
Can I place an order now and deliver it at the beginning of June?
"Hello everyone,
<0x3E> Finally we can announce that we will be hosting OSCAST again this year!
<0x3E> Unfortunately, for known reasons, it is not possible to get more than four people into the studio, which means a higher planning effort and explains the short term of the announcement.
ABER: There will be at least three people per switch, so we’ll track the 2021 Oscars with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
<0x3E> We do our best to avoid delay or other problems.
But hey, it’s still a pandemic – yet we’ll do everything we can to accompany the Oscars as entertainingly as possible.
<0x3E> It will start at about 0:30.
If you’re already having a cold drink, plan good food and get ready for a long, but very interesting night.
