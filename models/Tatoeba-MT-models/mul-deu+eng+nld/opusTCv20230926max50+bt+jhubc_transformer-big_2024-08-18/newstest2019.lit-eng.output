MG Baltic case: new Gustaini lawyer says not yet expected to get acquainted with the case material
The 11th trial of the MG Baltic case was attended by all the defendants: <0xC5><0xA0>ar<0xC5><0xAB>nas Gustainis, Gintaras Steponavi<0xC4><0x8D>ius, Vytautas Gab<0xC5><0xA1>ys, Eligiius Masiulis and Raimondas Kurlianskis.
The trial began with the testimony of the accused.
At the previous court hearing, Aleksandar Doro<0xC5><0xA1>ev, a new lawyer appointed by the state, told the jury that he had not yet received the case material.
At the time, MG Baltic lawyer Linas Belevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius stated that in order to ensure the full defence of the person, the panel of judges must allow the new lawyer to access the case material and requested to postpone the trial.
"In order to ensure the defence of a person, he must be familiar with the material of the criminal case.
This is not just a formal settlement,” said L. Belevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius.
The new lawyer A. Doro<0xC5><0xA1>ev noted that he did not expect to get acquainted with either the indictment or the entire case.
Earlier in the previous court hearing, the suspect <0xC5><0xA0>. Gustainis reported his lawyer’s refusal because he would no longer be able to pay him.
Audio recordings were also heard at the meeting.
The lawyers of the accused are angry that the audio recordings submitted to the court are of poor quality.
The law raises suspicions that politicians, taking bribes from MG Baltic, supported or initiated decisions favourable to the group in the Seimas and other state institutions, as well as influenced the decision on the winners of public procurement, ELTA recalls.
More than 150 people, more than 50 of whom were members of the Seimas, several former ministers, and members of the European Parliament, were interviewed during the constitutional investigation.
More than 200 surveys and more than 30 krats were conducted.
Gustaini is suspected of receiving more than 8,000 euros, Steponavi<0xC4><0x8D>ius - 15 thousand euros, V. Gap<0xC5><0xA1>ys - more than 27 thousand E. Masiulis is suspected of taking more than 106 thousand euros.
The Labour Party is suspected of bribery and trade with influence, the Liberal Union is suspected of bribery, trade with influence and abuse, and MG Baltic is suspected of buying and trading with these parties.
Politicians are suspected of having met with MG Baltic’s vice president, R. Kurlianski, on the issue of bribes, and later offered or supported favourable initiatives in the Seimas or other institutions.
The Guardians of Ethics: The Council of the Liberal Union on the Right to Action of the Vilnius Chapter
"The decisions taken by the management are in accordance with the statutes", - after the meeting of the Commission BNS its head Vytautas Tamo<0xC5><0xA1>i<0xC5><0xAB>nas reported.
“This decision was not a new one for us.
We had already made a clarification as a commission in July, when the question of Powers and Utena was raised.
Then we said that according to the statutes, this is a matter of competence of the Board.
And if the board decides that some section can act as it pleases - go with the committee and the board agrees with it, then the chapter can go, but if the board decides that there will be party lists everywhere, what the board has adopted, then it is the decision that all the parties will join the board.
And if you disagree with the board, then there is an opportunity to suspend membership and go with the committee," he added.
According to V. Tamo<0xC5><0xA1>i<0xC5><0xAB>n, the party’s board will now decide on further action.
On October 17, the Board of the Liberal Union of the party annulled the decision of the Vilnius City Department to participate in municipal elections not with the party, but with a new list of electoral committees.
In the opinion of the party board, the decision of the capital liberals to participate in the elections in the form of a public election committee violated the party's statutes, decisions of the board.
By October 31, the Vilnius chapter had to cancel its intentions to participate in municipal elections with the list of committees.
But the department didn’t do that.
The former head of the department, Parliamentarian Au<0xC5><0xA1>rin<0xC4><0x97> Armonait<0xC4><0x97>, has already resigned from the Liberal Union.
The mayor of Vilnius, former chairman of the Liberal Union Remigius <0xC5><0xA0>ima<0xC5><0xA1>ius, promising to pursue the term of another head of the capital, has already presented the team and ideas of the public election committee "For Vilnius we are proud of!".
He also left the party.
The municipal council and mayoral elections will be held in March next year.
Villagers in northern India drove a tiger into a tractor that had previously killed a man, officials said on Monday.
Mahavir Kaujlagi, a forestry official, said the tiger had killed a man working in the fields late on Sunday, the villagers surrounded the animal and, trying to escape, drove it on a tractor.
Residents say the tiger also attacked and stabbed a young man about 10 days ago.
The village is located in the Dudhwa tiger sanctuary in Lakhympur Kheri district, about 250 km southeast of the state capital of Uttar Pradesh, Laknau.
It is forbidden to bite tigers in protected areas.
Ban director Ramesh Pandey said the incident will be reported to the police in accordance with the Wildlife Conservation Act.
In April, villagers in Uttar Pradesh’s Nighasano district struck another tiger; he suffered serious injuries.
The tiger is the national animal of India; according to the Wildlife Conservation Act, tiger is considered an extinct species.
Last year, government data showed that during the previous three years, at least one person was killed every day in clashes with wild tigers or elephants.
Human conflicts with the tiger have been on the rise since the 1980s, when India launched a tiger protection program, which established bans in national parks and began to treat the killing of large cats as a crime.
While tiger computation methods have changed, censuses show that the population of approximately 1,800 tigers at the time increased to 2,226 individuals in 2014.
Cats and dogs are recommended to be labelled with chips
The Chairman of the Seimas Environmental Protection Committee, K<0xC4><0x99>stutis Ma<0xC5><0xBE>eika, together with other members of the Seimas, registered amendments to the Animal Welfare and Protection Act, which propose mandatory labelling of cats and dogs with subcutaneous microschemas.
"We propose that cats and dogs should be labelled as subcutaneous microchips, and that local municipalities, the Ministry of Agriculture and the State Food and Veterinary Service organise their registration and labelling.
In 2019, all dogs will be labelled free of charge with state funds, and in 2020, even cats, so that the population will not have any worries and the cost will be covered by specially provided state funding," said K<0xC4><0x99>stutis Ma<0xC5><0xBE>eika, Chairman of the Seimas Committee for Environmental Protection.
The amendments to the law aim to address the systematic need for labelling of pets.
This is expected to help avoid the problems caused by irresponsible animal breeders, illegal breeders or vendors.
It is provisionally estimated that, according to the expected average price of the microchip and the service, which will reach around 5 euros, during the transitional period will be compensated by all owners of animals.
The total cost of labelling all pets can reach up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6 million.
It is planned that the need for these funds will be distributed over three years and will reach <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2 million annually.
The funds for labelling programmes are expected to be allocated through the Municipal Environment Support Special Programme, which will significantly increase revenues this year due to the increased taxation and redistribution of natural resources.
The municipality will be able to use these funds not only to mark cats and dogs, but also to castration and other programs.
According to Mr Ma<0xC5><0xBE>eikas, mandatory labelling practices have been common in almost all countries of the European Union, which allows for the protection of the animals themselves (since they can easily be returned to the owners when they are wrong), and has saved the time of the breeders themselves when the breeding and the breeding of the stray and the grooming of the stray.
In addition, EU legislation provides that travel is only possible with labelled pets.
At the same time, labelling obliges to take care of the animal responsibly throughout his life.
The previous proposals for mandatory labelling were subject to opposition, as the relevant programmes were proposed to be financed by the population.
"Now the model provided should avoid this criticism, because animal protection is proposed to be financed by increased incomes in the environmental protection support program and the right to label by granting not only veterinary doctors, but also drafts in the academia - to academics, i.e., authors of personal animal care.
The draft law was registered by a group of Seimas members representing the different Seimas groups - K<0xC4><0x99>stutis Ma<0xC5><0xBE>eika, Algimantas Dumbrava, Eugenijus Gentvilas, Edmundas Pupinis, Rimas Andrikis, Antanas Vinkus and others.
Thirteen members of government forces killed in Taliban attack in eastern Afghanistan
A spokesman for the governor of the province, Arifas Noori, said seven soldiers and six police officers had been killed.
He added that four more soldiers were injured during the attack on the joint army and police control station in the Chogyan district.
According to Noori, in the three-hour battle with the Afghan forces, six fighters were killed and ten more Taliban were wounded.
A Taliban spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahideen, issued a statement to the media in which the movement claimed responsibility for Monday's attack in Gaza province.
Noori said that this post was set up two days ago in a strategically important area to cut off the Taliban supply route.
During the attack, the post was completely destroyed.
"Rytas" straightened his hand to help Ukrainian club
On Wednesday, the fourth round of the FIBA European Cup will be held in the "Ryto" arena of Vilnius, where the clubs of Kosovo and Ukraine will meet.
Dvikova will be held in the capital for political reasons.
Having maintained warm relations with Ukrainian basketball, Vilnius "Rytas" will receive the teams of Cherkasy "Cherkaski Mavpy" and Pristina "KB Prishtina" on November 7 under its roof in the "Ryta" arena.
"For political reasons between Kosovo and Ukraine, we were not able to host this match at home, so we are very happy that our friends from Vilnius agreed to accept us," said Maxim Michelson, the head coach of the Ukrainian team.
“We have a lot of friends in Vilnius, and our countries always agree well with each other.
Lithuania is one of the best countries with basketball traditions in the world, so it will be a real honour for us to play here.
We hope to receive support from the volunteers.
The Kosovo team was unable to come to Ukraine, as these countries do not have any diplomatic relations.
Currently, the Ukrainian team after the first round takes third place with one victory in three meetings, while the Kosovo team is in second position and has the most victory.
This will be very important for Group E coaching, as only two teams will reach the next stage.
In the past, Vilnius also hosted the selection of Ukrainian and Kosovo national football matches for the 2017 European Basketball Championship.
At 100:61, the Ukrainian team celebrated the victory.
Basketball fans will be able to enter the matches for free on Wednesday, and the start of the duel - 7 pm.
“Women Lie Better” Star Actress B. Arsobaitha Persecuted by Lies
It’s probably just a coincidence, but the charming brown actress Brigita Arsobait<0xC4><0x97> has been given roles related to lies a number of times.
First the series "Women Lie Better", then the show "Melag<0xC4><0x97>s" and finally the comedy "Melagai".
In this film, Brigita plays the wife of Danius Kazlausko's hero.
“I really enjoyed filming in Melage, because I’m more of a theatre actress and I’ve rarely appeared in cinema.
The amazing team of colleagues gathered from the beginning promised an excellent result.
This experience is very important and valuable to me.
But the most interesting thing that happened on the square was the puppy Sunny!
All my life I thought that if I had a dog, it would be big and serious.
I've never admired those small, decorative "fif" four-pieces.
But during the filming, Sunny was so attached to me that the sympathy became mutual and in the end I even forgot to buy it from the hostess, but unsuccessfully,” the actress smiled.
A new Lithuanian comedy "Melagiai" was produced by the Lithuanian film hits "Unexperienced" and "Between Us, Boys..." by the producer Paulius Virbickas and the producers Stass Baltakis.
Your loved one just told you she's waiting.
That would be great news, just... your lover is your brother's wife!
But that's not all.
Without predicting to publish the "good news" to everyone, parents unexpectedly declare - they are different!
After 50 years together...
And all this happens before even the most beautiful holiday of the year - Christmas!
But the end will be even more surprising, because no one expected such atoms.
Not all of the characters are what they look like at first sight.
In addition to the comedy of B. Arsobait<0xC4><0x97>, "Melagiai" presents good mood to the viewers four times film stars: Giedrius Savickas, Dainius Kazlauskas, Edita U<0xC5><0xBE>ait<0xC4><0x97>, Giedr<0xC4><0x97> Giedraityt<0xC4><0x97>, Liubomiras Laucevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius, Larissa Gipokait<0xC4><0x97> and Gepokait<0xC4><0x97>.
Comedy "Melagai" - in China from November 9
Decide whether to write off <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million of unpaid taxes on immigrants
The Seimas on Tuesday agreed to consider the amendment to the law on the declaration of place of residence prepared by the "country" leader Ram<0xC5><0xAB>no Karbauski.
Sixty-six Seimas voted for, nine against and twenty-five abstentions.
The Seimas will proceed to the review on or after 6 December following the Government's conclusions.
According to Karbauski, these contributions are calculated for people who have not declared their departure from Lithuania.
According to the parliamentarian, in three years, one person does not receive about 1 thousand euros, and now there are about 100 thousand of such people.
Social Democrat Algirdas Sysas regretted that in this way the Seimas would "call some of the people not to comply" - to declare departure and then no taxes would be charged.
Antanas Matulas, a member of the Health Committee, noted that Lithuanians living abroad use the fact that when paying a small health insurance tax, they come to Lithuania to receive treatment - they are provided with the same services as those paid.
The amendments provide that those persons who will pay social insurance contributions in the European Union, European Economic Area or the Swiss Confederation are considered to have left Lithuania and that Sodra will exempt them from the payment of health insurance contributions in Lithuania.
Mindaugas Sinkevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius, head of Sodros, has previously said that such a step will facilitate both the lives of emigrants and the activities of Sodros.
Online video of a sliding bear reveals a serious problem <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
As the mother locust slumps in a vertical snowflake, the baby slumps, slipping down and again a persistent copy.
The video has received a lot of reviews and comments.
People were fascinated by the resilience of a small bow - repeatedly sliding down, he looked after his mother again.
He succeeds not for the first time, but the little boy does not try to surrender and finally achieves his goal.
The video really depends on the attention, but it also reveals the threat posed by humans to animals.
Scientists argue that it is also necessary to talk about the fact that people’s desire to know wildlife can sometimes be harmful.
"It is clear to me that the bear drone was very frightened.
From their movements, you can see that they panic.
If they didn’t radiate to the environment, they would probably have chosen a safer route or overcome it more slowly or more cautiously.
This is a great example of how drones should not be used," ecologist Mark Ditmer told The Verge.
Some time ago, Mr. Ditmer and his colleagues explored how drones operate bears.
The animals had their heart rate monitors adjusted.
When the drone approached, some of the bows were allowed to run, while others were not able to run, but all of them began to tremble more often with fear.
Scientists recommend using drones to film animals responsibly, not to crawl too close, not to make noise, and not to radiate where it is prohibited.
The fledgling president was contacted by the newspaper.
On Tuesday, the court in Kiev invited the resigned president Viktor Yanukovych to attend a trial on his alleged treason in an unusual way, the call was announced in the state's official publication.
The court's appeal, published in the government's news paper "Uriadovoj kurjer", invites the former leader to attend the hearing of the criminal trial on November 19, during which his final arguments could be heard.
The document states that Mr Yanukovych has the right to participate in the meeting by video communication.
On October 30, the court in Kiev announced the conclusion of the debate in the case of V. Yanukovych.
V. Yanukovych’s lawyer in Russia, Aleksandr Goro<0xC5><0xA1>inski, was given the opportunity to register in the register of foreign lawyers before November 19, so that he could attend the hearing, where V. Yanukovych is expected to be in video contact with his father.
The Kremlin-backed Yanukovych was overthrown and fled to Russia during the Mayan uprising in February 2014, triggered by the president’s refusal to sign an association agreement with the European Union.
Russian President Vladimir Putin later revealed that the former leader of Ukraine was taken to Russia through a special operation organized by Moscow.
In March, Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula, and a few years later a war broke out between Kiev-backed separatists in the east of the country.
Since then, the fighting has claimed the lives of some 10,000 people, despite the efforts of the international community to secure a long-term ceasefire.

Restrictions on Cogeneration Power Plants Applicable to the Constitutional Court
The Seimas’ opposition, as promised, appealed to the Constitutional Court (CT) the rulings’ decision to pass a law on the possibility of stopping the construction of waste incineration plants.
On Tuesday, the Seimas opposition Group of the Patriotic Union of Lithuanian Christian Democrats (TS-LKD) reported that a group of Seimas members appealed to the KT, asking the authorities to investigate the compliance of the amendments to the Waste Management Act adopted with the Constitution.
"Parliaments underline that the provisions of the law are intended to interrogate projects of waste incineration plants that are currently underway, in order to order the government to impose new restrictions (20 km away from the territory of residence) in the notification - to the construction of the building in Raleigh and the entry into force of the law in Vilnius.
"Parliaments note that, in the context of the construction of a building in a residential area, in relation to the construction of objects of state importance (i.e., distance is determined and the definition of the concept of "residential territory", in relation to the construction of a building in a residential area, in relation to the construction of a building in a residential area, in relation to the construction of a building in a residential area, in relation to the construction of a building in a building in a residential area, in a residential area, in a residential area, in a residential area), in a residential area, in a residential area or in a residential area, in a residential area, in a residential area, in a residential area, in a residential area, in a residential area, in a residential area, in a residential area, in a residential or in a residential area, in a residential area, in a residential area, in a residential, in a residential area, in a residential area, in a building, in a residential, a building, a residential, a residential, a residential area, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building, a building,
The appeal states that the law adopted is contrary to the constitutional principle of the rule of law.
"The CT has repeatedly stated that the legislation does not apply to those legal facts and consequences that occurred prior to the entry into force of the newly adopted legislation.
In this case, the Government is empowered to apply the law back on the basis of an undetermined criterion.
By imposing such a legal regulation, the constitutional principles of legal certainty, legal certainty, protection of legitimate expectations, and thus the constitutional principle of the rule of law, are violated," the appeal read.
It also notes that large financial investments have already been made in the projects of the Vilnius and Kaunas cogeneration plants.
If the current projects were to be stopped, the state would not only suffer hundreds of millions of financial losses, huge losses and the Lithuanian population - it would increase heating prices, due to the increasing amount of waste disposal in landfills would increase environmental pollution.
Members from Seimas TS-LKD, the Liberal Union, the Social Democratic Groups and Algirdas Butkevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius, the senior member of the ruling Social Democratic Working Group, signed their appeals to the KT.
A couple of weeks ago, the Seimas managed to collect 71 votes to reject President Dalia Grybauskait<0xC4><0x97>'s veto of amendments to the Waste Management Act, which provided for the government's right to stop the construction of the 20-mile-long coal-fired power plant.
The Seymour’s re-adopted amendments to the law will enter into force on January 1, 2019. It is true that the authorities are already proposing to waive the 20 km restriction.
This proposal is scheduled to be considered during the autumn session of the Seimas.
However, the government’s right to stop projects that have already begun is not planned to refuse.
KT will consider this case in a row - no earlier than a year later.
LeBron James's stats for the Lakers Club
The start of LeBron James’ career at the Los Angeles Lakers is not what he, the organization and basketball fans expected.
The Lakers began the season with four wins and six losses, and such a weak start helped spark thoughts about the possible dismissal of coach Luke Walton.
However, the president of basketball operations, Magic Johnson, said that he would not forgive the coach, but that he needed to play better.
The biggest star of the team, L. James, should turn to himself.
While the statistics of the semi-finalist are usually impressive - 26.8 points, 7.6 rebounds and 7.7 rebounds.
But she doesn’t tell the whole truth.
In the first ten games of the season, other numbers have emerged, indicating that the Lakers play better when there is no L. James on the pitch.
A <0x2B>/- statistic that shows how many points a team gets or misses when there are certain players on the field.
When James was on the pitch, the Lakers missed 30 points more this season than the rivals.
While he was sitting on the ground, the crocodiles earned 19 points more than the rivals.
At present, the Lakers are only in 13th place in the Western Conference, but several victories can turn everything upside down.
Spain will continue to contribute to the protection of Lithuanian airspace
The meeting noted that Spain will contribute to the protection of the airspace of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia in 2019 and 2020.
"Lithuania greatly appreciates Spain's cooperation with NATO and its significant contribution to ensuring the security of our country and the region," Minister Linkevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius said.
The Spanish Air Force has carried out five NATO air policing and air policing missions in the Baltic States, three of them in Lithuania.
The last time the Spanish Eurofighter fighters were deployed in the north of the country was in May-August of this year.
In addition, Spain will contribute to the protection of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia’s airspace in 2019 and 2020.
The Minister also noted that regular consultations are taking place between Lithuania and Spain on security, political, economic and strategic communication issues in the fight against propaganda.
Mr Linkevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius expressed the hope that Lithuania and Spain would continue to work closely together on the European, transatlantic agenda and other multilateral issues.
Since 2004, when Spain opened its embassy in Vilnius, Ambassador Jose Maria Roblesas Fraga is the fifth Spanish representative in Lithuania.
On 29 October, José Maria Roblesas Fraga handed over the consignment letters to President Dalia Grybauskaite.
V. A<0xC4><0x8D>ien<0xC4><0x97> on the arrest of R. A<0xC4><0x8D>o: I believe in the innocence of the man and the security of the law
“It was the most incredible thing I could ever think of.
On the other hand, perhaps, the services are doing the work that must be done.
We all do our own work.
I believe in law enforcement, I believe in my husband that everything is right and fair, that no dishonest actions should be taken," said V. A<0xC4><0x8D>ien<0xC4><0x97>.
A<0xC4><0x8D>a was arrested by the Special Investigation Service (SST) on Monday - law enforcement suspects that while he was still the director of the Raseiniai municipality administration, he took a high-value bribe and, in exchange, was able to create exclusive conditions for private companies under the ownership of buses.
Representatives of private companies are suspected of having acquired R. A<0xC4><0x8D>a directly or having participated in the masking of bribes in various financial transactions.
In April of this year, the Council of Raseiniai District Municipality R. A<0xC4><0x8D>a was relieved of the duties of the head of the administration in the third attempt after the alleged mistrust.
The former "arrangement" in March of this year became a member of the newly established Gediminas Kirkilos-led Lithuanian Social Democrats Labour Party, he suspended membership in this party on Monday.
Several years ago, he was unsuccessful in the mayoral elections as a representative of the electoral committee "Tavo Raseiniai".
V. A<0xC4><0x8D>ien<0xC4><0x97> says that the man did not intend to run for mayor next year, but had not yet decided whether to participate in municipal council elections.
V. A<0xC4><0x8D>ien<0xC4><0x97> was elected to the Seimas with the list of Lithuanian statesmen and Greens, she is a member of the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission.
The politician says the release of further law enforcement action - and it will depend on whether it will be removed from the commission of work.
"I certainly don't make stable decisions today, this week I think I'll make a decision.
I will see, if there is a need, what accusations are made, of course, I will make a decision in one way or another.
I probably need to stay away from all the things that are being investigated in the Anti-Corruption Commission, but once again, everything will take its place,” she said.
The representative of the opposition Conservatives in Seime Radvil<0xC4><0x97> Mork<0xC5><0xAB>nait<0xC4><0x97>-Mikul<0xC4><0x97>nien<0xC4><0x97> called on the Chairman of the Seimas, Viktor Franckieti, and the head of the "country" Ram<0xC5><0xAB>nas Karbauski, to detach from the committee of the group’s colleague, Vida A<0xC4><0x8D>ien<0xC4><0x97>, and to rescinate it from the committee.
She argues that the further work of V. A<0xC4><0x8D>ien<0xC4><0x97> in the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission "would lead to public distrust and discredit the work of an important parliamentary oversight commission".
Sensitive "Coldplay" music dominated and popular Lithuanian couples
On the autumn evening, a lot of music and film lovers are heading for the pre-production of the film Coldplay: A Head Full of Dreams.
The event was attended by a group of famous people: Jonas and Simona Nainiai, Ignas Lelys, Martyns Tyla and many others.
The film tells the story of Coldplay, one of Britain’s most popular pop bands, which intertwines with moments from concerts.
Documentary director Matas Whitecross met the group's men while they were still playing at bars and gathering just a few dozen spectators.
You can see images from concert backgrounds, rehearsals or free time that have not yet been shown in the film.
Singer and pianist Chris Martin and guitarist Jonny Buckland met in 1996 in college and founded the band "Pectoralz".
Soon they were joined by the boss Guy Berryman, and a little later - and the drummer Will Champion.
The group changed its name to Coldplay and just twenty years ago released its first album, Safety, which featured three tracks.
The majority of the 500 recordings were distributed to radio stations, producers and friends, and only 50 copies of Safety were sold.
Coldplay is a well-known, respected and beloved band worldwide, having released seven albums, which have sold more than 100 million copies.
Over the past two decades, the group has won 107 different awards, including nine Brit Awards and seven Grammy Awards.

Utena's Juventus high-ranking Vaidas <0xC4><0x8C>epukaitis won the title of the most useful player of the week after playing in a solid match for Betsafe-LKL.

Palestinians shot dead in West Bank by Israelis stabbed
The army "blocked the way for this attack because it identified a terrorist attempting to hit civilians and an IDF (Israel Defense Forces) soldier," the Israeli army said in a report circulated on the incident near Kiryat Arba's new headquarters near Hebron.
“He fired the terrorist and neutralized him.
He was taken to the hospital.
Israeli civilians and IDF soldiers were not harmed," the statement said.
A military spokeswoman told the AFP news agency that the attack was attempted by the Palestinians.
After the incident, the footage shows that he was not seriously injured.
A similar wave of Palestinian attacks began in 2015.
Such attacks have declined in recent years, but it is rumored that a new wave of them could arise.
On October 22, a Palestinian man was shot and killed by a knife by a group of Jewish soldiers near Hebron.
Grybauskait<0xC4><0x97> urges China to create a more favourable investment environment for EU business
President Dalia Grybauskait<0xC4><0x97> calls on China to create a more favourable investment environment for investment in European Union (EU) countries, to facilitate conditions for foreign imports.
During the opening of the trade and investment forum in Shanghai, Grybauskait<0xC4><0x97> stressed that in view of the signs of economic slowdown, the common goal of Europe and China should be to "unify efforts in the context of a competitive, non-competitive, non-competitive, and anti-war approach to protectionism in the world."
"The European Union is very important to China's commitment to creating a more attractive, open environment for investment - this is important in negotiating a trade agreement with China.
It is important to conclude this trade agreement as soon as possible, ensuring that foreign businesses feel welcome and safe here, as well as strengthening the protection of intellectual property," Grybauskait<0xC4><0x97> said.
China’s opening up is important not only for Europe, but also for this country, as well as for global economic growth.
The Lithuanian head stressed that the transparency of investments must be "higher than the interests of any business group".
"Transparency, the rule of law, strict adherence to international treaties - this must be an essential thing for the environment of new investment relations," Grybauskait<0xC4><0x97> stressed.
“Corrupted capital flows should not be expected in any country in the world – not just here or in our countries,” she added.
China's import show is trying to alleviate criticism that it avoids opening up its market and only protects its companies.
The exhibition is attended by heads of several countries, more than 2800 companies from 130 countries and regions of the world, including Lithuania.
According to the Lithuanian Department of Statistics, China currently ranks 25th among export partners.
Last year, Lithuania’s exports to China increased by 50% - this amounted to 180 million euros.
At the same time, the volume of imports from China exceeded 820 million euros.
Some officials are concerned that China’s investment in Lithuania could have undesirable political influence, while Beijing’s exceptional focus on Eastern Europe is disrupting the EU’s unity.

The mobile signature provider Estonian IT company SK ID Solutions reports that the failure of the mobile signature system has been removed and the service works as usual.
The mobile signature started again at 2:28 p.m.
The mobile signature system crashed on Monday at 9:52 a.m.
These failures were experienced by customers of telecommunications companies Bit<0xC4><0x97>s, Tele2 and Telia.
The cause of the SK ID Solutions malfunction has been identified but is not disclosed for security reasons.
The company apologises to consumers for the inconvenience experienced.

Cause of the Lion Air plane crash revealed: relatives of the dead infuriated
The black box of the crashed Indonesian airline Lion Air has shown that there has been a disruption in speedometer operation during at least the last four of its flights, investigators said on Monday.
Soerjanto Tjahjono, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Committee (NTSK), said a similar rift had occurred during the last four flights of the plane, including a fatal one, when the plane crashed into the Java Sea on October 29 shortly after takeoff from Jakarta.
All 189 people on board were killed in the crash.
A number of media outlets have reported unrest during the previous Boeing 737 MAX 8 flight from Denpasar to the Indonesian capital.
"When we opened the black box - yes, the technical problem was the air speed, in other words, the speed of the plane," Tyahjon told a news conference.
"The black box data showed that there was the same problem during the two flights before the Denpasar-Jakarta flight," he added.
“There are a lot of rumors on social media.
We now want to clarify that in the black box (the data was released) about four flights, during which there were problems with the air speed meter," - said the head of the NTSK.
During a meeting with members of the deceased families, Mr. Tjahjono said the information on the flight data recorder was consistent with reports that the speed and altitude of the last flight had changed incorrectly.
The search team has not yet found a second black box recording the conversations in the cockpit.
Lion Air said that after detecting a technical failure during a flight from Bali to Jakarta, it was corrected according to the manufacturer's recommendations.
One of the company’s founders, Rusdi Kirana, was not invited to speak to communications minister Budi Karyos Sumadi, who moderated a meeting of family members with officials overseeing the search for the remains of the plane and victims and an investigation into the disaster.
However, he stood up and bowed his head when angry and abusive family members demanded that Kirana, along with his brother Kusnano, be present when Lion Air was founded in 1999.
"Lion Air was misbehaving," said a man presenting himself as the father of Shandy's passenger, Johan Ramadhan, who worked as a prosecutor on the island to which the plane was flying.
"I want Mr. Rusdi Kirana and his team to pay attention," he said.
“Since the start of the crisis, Lion Air has never contacted me.
We lost our child, but Lion Air didn't show us any sense."
After this meeting, Kirana left quickly, avoiding questions from journalists.
Many families are waiting for the results of the long process of identification of the deceased.
Nearly 140 body bags loaded with parts of human support were handed over to police medical experts.
So far, only 14 victims have been identified.
Relatives asked why the inlander, which was launched two months ago, was allowed to fly, although a failure occurred during the October 28 flight from Bali to Jakarta, among other things, causing passengers to fear a sudden crash of the plane immediately after takeoff.
Lion Air said the bug had been rectified.
Is it true that the problem has been solved? asked the son of one of the dead.
- If not, the relevant technicians must be held accountable.
The law is very clear, they did not claim that the plane was allowed to take off again.
These bad technicians must respond by law so that the plane crash in Indonesia does not happen again.
Mr. Tjahjon said the large amount of small cracks and the fact that the cracks were leaking in a fairly small area indicate that the rope probably fell into the water by flying at a very high speed.
"The plane was intact when it crashed into the sea.
He did not speak in the air, and the aircraft's engines, when it touched the water, acted in large turns - this indicates all the turbine turbochargers broken," the official explained.
The Lion Air plane crash is the biggest aviation disaster in Indonesia since 1997, when 234 people were killed when a Garuda plane crashed near Medano.
After the accident, the rescuers from the wreckage: injured and a minor
On Monday evening, on the way to Cancer - Plunge, the vehicles BMW and Mercedes-Benz collided with Tilviks.
Cars have been hit by a cactus and three people have been reported injured.
It is reported that the BMW driver, born in 1999, went to the opposite side of the road, and the cactus smashed into the Mercedes-Benz car, which was used by his father, born in 1967, and his daughter, born in 2005.
The BMW driver was rescued from the wreckage by firefighters - rescuers.
A girl from Mercedes-Benz was in an accident to brush her teeth.
All the victims were taken to the hospital.
The Presidency: No artificial facilitation needed for the referendum
After the Seimas approved a proposal by the ruling party to reduce the referendum cartel to the first section of the Constitution, which currently has greater protection, the president will amend the veto, says its adviser Mindaugas Linge.
"More than half of the population voted for the Constitution - that's a requirement.
This and its amendment, in particular of the articles in its first section, should certainly be at least a majority .
It's not hard to predict whether the president would really get married," Dalia Grybauskait<0xC4><0x97>'s adviser to domestic politics told news radio on Tuesday.
He emphasized that the first section of the Constitution defines the basic matters of the state - language, flag, territory, capital, state sovereignty, and, therefore, by reducing the necessary number of votes to replace those articles, according to Linge, would create a "negative" precedent.
"In the opinion of the President, there is no need for any artificial facilitation, we need more preparation for the referendum itself, we need more dialogue with the people," he said.
The Assembly plans to vote on the amendment to the Referendum Law on Tuesday.
It provides that a decision on amendments to sections 1 and 14 of the Constitution with a higher protection shall be adopted, provided that at least two-fifths of the eligible citizens vote in a referendum.
At present, more than half of all citizens who have the right to vote can replace the articles of Sections 1 and 14 of the Constitution by a referendum.
About 2.5 million citizens have the right to vote in Lithuania: half would be 1.25 million voters, two-fifths - one million voters.
This proposal was born after the Seimas approved in September a veto by the President on amendments previously adopted in Parliament, which softened the requirements for a number of votes by amending Article 12 of the first section of the Constitution defining citizenship.
The referendum is proposed to reduce the cartel in preparation for a referendum on dual citizenship, it should take place on 12 May next year and on 26 May, when the first and second rounds of the presidential elections are planned.
Emigrants who emigrated after the restoration of independence on March 11, 1990, cannot now hold dual citizenship, except for some exceptions.
Dual citizenship is sought by the Lithuanian community in the world, but fears that under the present conditions the referendum will not take place - voting would not bring enough people.
R. Masiulis: Lithuanian airports "bra<0xC5><0xA1>ka", so they need to be updated
Lithuanian airports and road infrastructure are starting to crumble, so it needs to be updated, says Transport Minister Rokas Masiulis.
According to him, the renewal of Vilnius Airport is the minimum task that the state must perform.
"The gold transport infrastructure has already been depleted because it was designed for smaller passenger traffic.
We have to renovate Vilnius Airport - it does not even fall into the far-reaching planning, it is the minimum we have to do," Masiulis said at a communication conference held by the Democratic Development Fund and the State magazine on Tuesday.
According to the minister, the next decade will be extremely important, because important projects will have to be implemented - the completion of the construction of Via Baltica, Rail Baltica, the construction of Klaipeda’s external port, the renovation of Vilnius and Kaunas airports, and possibly the construction of a new airport.
"The next decade will be very important - we need to complete the integration of roads, railways, the construction of an external port in Klaipeda, arrange the airports, maybe decide on the construction of a new airport.
We must not sleep, already start projects that will take advantage of our potential in 10, 20 or 30 years," the Minister of Communications said.
Mr Masiulis reiterated that too little money has been spent on car road maintenance in recent years.
"The situation is not improving so far, because the funds are not being allocated enough.
We are planning to build new roads, but there is a lack of funds for even the most necessary maintenance, for example on the highways.
We need to determine how much should be allocated to road maintenance if we want their condition to improve," Masiulis said.
He stressed that Lithuania’s exports of transport services grew by 18.6% this year, and the largest export market became Germany, surpassing Russia.
Mr Masiulis once again criticised the European Commission's proposal to require EU carriers to periodically return tractors to the country of registration.
“We need to make sure that our exporters in Western Europe feel at home.
In my opinion, the proposal for tractors to return home on a regular basis is absurd, because in Europe, empty trucks, fuel, would increase emissions.
Mostly, this will benefit the railways, because the costs will increase so much that some of the transport will be transferred to the railways.
We are looking for ways to defend our positions," Mr Masiulis said.
According to the Ministry of Communications, 12.2% is generated in the transport sector.
Lithuania's gross domestic product (GDP).
It employs more than 118,000 people and operates more than 7,500 companies.
Ginza with hereditary growers
Last week, Masiulis Seimo Economics Committee announced the start of negotiations on the change of the cultural purpose of the Vilnius Airport building - this would allow the old terminal to be demolished and a new one to be built.
However, the interim head of the Cultural Heritage Department (KPD), Algimantas Degutis, called the deliberations of Masiulis political pressure.
According to him, the building built in the sixties of the last century is a value, registered in 1993, and not by politicians, but by specialists to decide on its abolition.
Mr. Masiulis then commented that the modern arrival terminal would contribute to improving the image of Lithuania.
"Extracting the old terminal from the heritage would be a politically important step, so that it could be demolished and a new modern arrival terminal built, so that you will feel in a modern country in Vilnius, rather than in such an interesting, unpretentious place - a place that does not represent our country as in.
Mr Masiulis also said that Kaunas plans to build a completely new passenger terminal and connect the airport to Rail Baltica by building an underground station.
This transport hub is expected to be operational in 2026, when Rail Baltica is completed.
Last year Vilnius Airport served about 3.7 million people, this year 4.8 million passengers are expected, and next year - 5 million.
Kaunas Airport served a total of 1.2 million passengers last year.

Minister of Finance on the possible crisis: it is important not to talk about the disease
“We always have to be prepared for the worst.
What I want to be happy about is that for the third year in a row, for the first time in Lithuanian history, we are accumulating reserves.
But also a very important thing is not to speak up for the disease," Shapok said on Monday.
ELTA recalls that on Monday and Tuesday, Finance Minister and Deputy Minister Migl<0xC4><0x97> Tuskien<0xC4><0x97> attended meetings of the Eurogroup and the EU Economic and Financial Council (ECOFIN) in Brussels.
The ECOFIN meeting will discuss issues related to the taxation of digital services.
This new tax aims to avoid fragmentation of the EU single market, as a number of Member States have already introduced or intend to introduce a certain tax at national level.
In the short term, it is proposed to agree on how income received for the provision of certain digital services in the EU Member States should be taxed until the agreement is reached at global level.
The Eurogroup will review the draft budgets of the euro area countries submitted to the European Commission (EC).
On 23 October, the EC rejected the Italian draft budget as not meeting the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact.
This is the first time that the EC has taken advantage of this opportunity.
For more information please refer to Belgium, France, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain.
The Euro Group will also discuss the issues of deepening economic and monetary union: the implementation of the European Deposit Insurance System and the reform of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM).
Lithuania supports a stronger role of the ESM in financial support programmes, but it is believed that the functions of the ESM must be clearly defined in order to avoid duplication of the functions of the ESM and other EU institutions.
Balys Bura<0xC4><0x8D>as.
Lithuanian Work Traditions and Habits
It has been 120 years since the birth of the famous Lithuanian photographer and cultural writer, ethnographer and landscape designer Bali Bura<0xC4><0x8D>o (1897-1972) in Sidari, <0xC5><0xA0>iaul<0xC4><0x97>ni valsi, in the then <0xC5><0xA0>iauliai Governorate.
In commemorating the 100th anniversary of the Lithuanian state, we have an excellent opportunity to remember how the life-saving national revival has invited many Lithuanian people, including their brothers Buracus - Bali, Jona, Broni<0xC5><0xB3> - to the celebration of the traditions of the Lithuanian state.
Balis Bura<0xC4><0x8D>as, who has travelled around the homeland with a camera in his hands for more than 50 years, has presented a wide and realistic picture of our country’s customs, traditions, folk art and material culture.
He sought to preserve the rapidly disappearing claws of national culture and had a rare ability to perceive the lasting value of his work.
In the photographs of Bali Bura<0xC4><0x8D>, Lithuania’s landscapes, castle mountains, everyday life and festivals adorned the pages of Lithuanian newspapers and magazines with national costumes.
This publication presents a large part of Bali Bura<0xC4><0x8D>’s legacy, dedicated to the description of national working habits and related traditions and, most importantly, their attractive iconography.
The material published shows not only the peculiarity and beauty of these traditions, but also the progress of our civilization over the past century, despite two world wars and heavy occupation.
The book’s manuscript contains an extremely rich description of the works of the inhabitants of <0xC5><0xBD>emaitia, especially of Kupu<0xC5><0xA1>k<0xC4><0x97>s, <0xC5><0xA0>iaul<0xC4><0x97>n<0xC4><0x97>s, Tel<0xC5><0xA1>i<0xC5><0xA1>kis, as well as of the people of Auk<0xC5><0xA1>taitia and D<0xC5><0xAB>kia, their celebrations and other traditions and customs of Bali Bura<0xC4><0x8D>.
Of the approximately 10,000 negatives left in museums and archives, 400 rare, mostly unpublished photographs have been selected, grouped according to the selected texts.
They reflect the unique aspects of ethnic culture that are characteristic of squirrels, squirrels, other regions of Highland and Lowland.

The tragic fate of the couple: died just after a few hours of marriage
A couple of newlyweds died in a helicopter crash just hours before they were married in southwestern Texas.
The 24-year-old William Troy's Byler and his wife, Bailee Raye Ackerman Byler, were killed on Sunday shortly after midnight when a helicopter crashed into a hill 16 km north-west of Juvaldi and 129 km west of San Antonio, Justice Steven Ken.
The strange thing is that the accident occurred after about 24 kilometers, just as many as the teenagers were years old.
Helicopter pilot Geraldo Douglas Lawrence, 76, has also died.
The young men studied at Sam Houston State University in Huntsville, Texas.
They were married on Saturday evening at the Byleri family’s ranch near Juvaldi, and after the wedding, a family-owned helicopter crashed.
The accident occurred after a helicopter crashed about 24 kilometers away.
The newlyweds flew to St. Anthony's International Airport, where they were going to board a plane and fly on honeymoon, Kennedy said, without specifying the final destination of the couple's trip.
"It's a very shallow, uneven relief area, and that hill is about 120-150 meters high," Kennedy said.
Mr. D. Lawrence piloted the family's aircraft for many years.
According to S. Kennedy, he piloted helicopters and served in Vietnam.
After the autopsy, it should be clear what the physical condition of the pilot was and whether it could not have been the cause of the disaster.
The helicopter crashed about 5-10 minutes after takeoff.
His debris was seen with a broad beam on the hillside, and the hull remained "dangerously smashed," flight safety researcher Craig Hatch of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said during a press conference on Monday.
The researchers intend to clear the wreckage and then examine it in depth, but it will not be easy for the truck and truck to reach that place, he said.
The cause of the disaster has not yet been identified, and the preliminary NTSB report should be published within two weeks.
Israel's Prime Minister Calls the Imposition of New Sanctions on Iran a 'Historic Day'
"Today is a historic day," Netanyahu told members of his party's Likud parliament, his office said.
"Today is the day when, under the leadership of President Donald Trump, the United States imposes particularly stringent sanctions on Iran, the most stringent sanctions on Iran during the entire time that efforts to curb its aggression have begun," he said.
Earlier on Monday, Israel's Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman (Avigdor Lieberman) said the new sanctions would give a "decisive" blow to Israel's actions in the region.
The measures, which Washington calls “the toughest sanctions of all time,” came into effect after Trump’s decision in May to withdraw from the world powers agreement with Tehran on his nuclear program.
The sanctions are aimed at significantly reducing Iran's oil exports, which have already fallen by about a million barrels a day since May, and separating Tehran from international financing.
Israel has long opposed the agreement with Iran and says its scope and deadlines are too limited.
The Jewish state also says that the lifting of the sanctions has enabled Iran to finance militant groups and its own military activities.
Israel is particularly concerned about Iran's actions in neighbouring Syria and has vowed not to allow it to settle there militarily.
Other parties to the agreement with Iran - Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia - disagree with the U.S. decision and say the agreement, as envisaged, has so far prevented Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.
The court again aggravated the circumstances of the death of a young motorcyclist
With the death of a young motorcyclist in Vilnius, in the northern city, the court will hear the testimony of the witness.
The Vilnius County Court ruled on Tuesday that in order to find out all the relevant circumstances of the case, one of the witnesses will be questioned at the next hearing on November 26.
An acquittal has already been issued in this case, but the prosecutor’s office does not agree with it.
On August 22, the Vilnius City District Court convicted the 79-year-old Eduard Osipov of driving a motorcycle in a car accident that resulted in the death of a motorcyclist and declared that the motorcyclist was driving at high speed in the city and committed a serious injury.
The Vilnius County Prosecutor’s Office requests that the district court’s judgment be annulled and argues that Osipov is to blame for the accident and that the findings of the district court are unfounded.
The acquittal is requested by the family lawyer of the deceased motorcyclist.
The accident occurred on August 11, 2015, around 3 p.m., when E. Osipovo's driven car "<0xC5><0xA0>koda Fabia" from Lak<0xC5><0xAB>nas Street entered <0xC5><0xBD>irm<0xC5><0xAB>nas Street and collided with a motorbike driving on the main road.
The prosecutor's office accused the man of violating road traffic rules and causing a traffic incident - a man who was driving a Piaggo on the main road died.
Initial police reports indicate that the driver of the scooter was killed, but later, after investigations, it was found that the vehicle was comparable to a motorcycle in terms of power.
The judge of Vilnius City District Court, Roland Bu<0xC5><0xBE>inskas BNS, has said that experts have determined that the motorcyclist was driving at 89.2 kilometers per hour, although the permissible speed at the site is 50 kilometers per hour.
“The driver of the car could not have predicted that the motorcycle would drive at such a high speed,” the judge said.
At the time, the driver of the honorable age car claimed to have driven at only 5-6 kilometers per hour.
The driver, who saw the clutch, tried to brake and fell off the vehicle before colliding with the <0xC5><0xA0>koda Fabia.
The prosecutor’s office believes that Osipov, who was driving from the side to the main road, had to give way to a motorcycle driver.
Novaya Gazeta: Six Wagner Workers Killed in Syria
Among the dead were five soldiers of the Syrian army and six persons belonging to the military company "Vagner".
This is reported by a source in the Novaya Gazeta in Syria.
According to the source, one of the members of the 5th Syrian Army Corps, including a number of Syrian volunteers and "military mercenaries", has been deployed in the area.
The Novaya Gazeta sent a request to the Russian Foreign Ministry with a request to provide information about the fate of the Russians.
Former Belgian King Will Have to Take a Parenthood Test
This decision is part of the victory of the artist Delphine Boel.
Since 2013, she has sought to be recognized as a child of the former monarch.
A 50-year-old woman claims her mother, Baroness Sybille de Selys Longchamps and Albert II, had a short love affair decades ago.
The 84-year-old king denies his fatherhood.
According to the RTBF, he can appeal to the Supreme Court if he objects to the DNA investigation.
According to the Court of Appeal, Jacques Boelis, the ex-husband of Delphine’s mother, is neither biologically nor legally the father of the artist.
For the investigation in question, Delphine appealed for the recognition of the "true" daughter of her father, Albert.
The PRC will allocate money to the parties, but it will not bring anything to the social workers
The Supreme Electoral Commission (PRC) plans to allocate a budget grant of almost 3 million euros to the largest political parties this week.
The ruling Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party (LSDDP), which was established this spring, under the leadership of Parliament Vice-President Gediminas Kirkilo, is not yet planned to allocate funds from the budget.
However, they may be allocated in the near future by a separate decision of the JRC if the legal environment governing the distribution of grants to parties changes.
Laura Matjo<0xC5><0xA1>aityte, the President of the SEC, informed the SEC that "this Thursday there is a meeting of the commission, which is scheduled to take a decision on the allocation of the half-yearly subsidy to the parties".
According to her, a decision on this issue must be taken by the PRC by 15 November.
Seven parties, six of which are parliamentary, are expected to be allocated <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2,751 million.
The opposition party in the non-parliamentary Union of the Fatherland, non-parliamentary, non-parliamentary, non-parliamentary, non-parliamentary, non-parliamentary, non-parliamentary, non-parliamentary, non-parliamentary, non-parliamentary, non-parliamentary, non-parliamentary, non-parliamentary, non-parliamentary, non-parliamentary.
Under the current law, which is also governed by the PRC, when allocating the budget money, grants are awarded to parties that meet the requirements of the law and have received at least 3% of the votes during the last sessions of the Seimas, the municipal councils and the European Parliament.
Therefore, the current legal regulation does not allow the LSDDP, which was established only this spring, to expect to receive money from the budget.
The party has not participated in any election so far.
True, the ruling coalition is trying to change the law so that social workers receive at least a few hundred thousand euros in the upcoming three elections next year - the municipal, the president and the European Parliament.
The relevant amendments to the Political Parties and this year’s budget laws were adopted by Seimas President Dalia Grybauskait<0xC4><0x97>.
The Sejm has not yet decided on the veto, but representatives of the ruling party, Mr Kirkilas, and the country-green leader Ram<0xC5><0xAB>nas Karbauskis are confident that parliamentarians will seek to reject the president’s objections.
However, this will not be expected to be done by Thursday's meeting of the CRC, so according to Ms Matjo<0xC5><0xA1>ait<0xC4><0x97>, "the grants will be distributed according to the legal procedure that has existed so far".
True, the head of the PRC did not deny that if the Seimas this week or next week rejected the president’s veto and a new amendment on the allocation of budget funds to the parties came into force, the Commission could consider a decision on the allocation of an additional subsidy to the separate political forces of the PDP, including LDP.
“When making a decision, we will take into account the full legal environment, because we are the executive body that has to implement the laws adopted,” she said.
If the Seimas were able to reject the veto and the new laws came into force, the Government would allocate additional money to the parties under them, additionally borrowing the corresponding amounts.
Grants already allocated to the seven parties would not be affected by such a decision.

Poroshenko: activists Handziuk murder warrants must be punished
“I want to say that no version – and today there are more than 20 – will be rejected.
Each will be very carefully checked in accordance with the examination procedures.
I, as president, do not have the opportunity and do not have to get information that could harm the course of the investigation.
However, the government must ensure transparency and the law enforcement authorities must work effectively.
Only in this way will it be possible to know the truth and punish evil," Poroshenko said at a meeting with the youth in Kiev on Tuesday.
He stressed that he is most interested in making sure that Handziuk’s murder is cleared, and that the killers, the crime organizers and the ordering parties “take the necessary responsibility”.
"After this case has been reclassified to murder [the case], they are completely rightly and reasonably threatened with life imprisonment," the Ukrainian president said.
He rightly called the demand of the public to investigate the case openly and impartially.
Poroshenko stressed that the statements made by law enforcement officials in parliament should show that "the government is determined to hold criminals and murderers accountable, whatever they may be."
He also said that political speculation on this issue will not help to clarify the situation, and even more confusing.
"I urge all, both the government and the opposition forces, not to waste unwarranted arguments and, God forbid, not to use this murder in public relations," he said.
"On the contrary, now we need to unite and ensure that the investigation is effective, fair and transparent, fast - in such a way as to raise public confidence.
We just don’t have another way.”
"No one will be allowed to take advantage of this situation to destabilize the country," he said.
In July, K. Handziuk, who fought against corruption, was attacked and smeared with acid in the city of Cherson.
She was an adviser to the mayor of this southern Ukrainian city.
The woman was hospitalized after the attack, but died in the hospital on Sunday.
Unexplained to the police and prosecutors of the attack, Ukrainian Attorney General Yury Lucenka made a resignation statement on Tuesday.
After her death, officials received accusations from public activists that she was unable to carry out an investigation properly.
The activists also called for the resignation of the Attorney General and the Minister of the Interior.
"I am making my resignation statement today," Lucenka told MEPs, reading his report.
Parliament still has to approve the resignation of the prosecutor.
Lucenka accused the activists of putting pressure on the investigation and leaking important information, making it difficult to identify the perpetrators of the murder of K. Handziuk.
Bill Gates has introduced a toilet without water.
Introducing a futuristic toilet, Bill Gates’ transition from traditional such devices to a water-free one was likened to the computer revolution of the last decade of the 1980s.
Microsoft founder Bill Gates presented a high-tech toilet in Beijing that doesn’t need water in the water pipes, Reuters reported.
The toilet without water works according to the principle of separation of solid and liquid waste.
Both types of sewage are processed into chemical fertilizers.
“The technologies you see here are the biggest advances in sanitation in the last 200 years,” Gates said in a statement.
The technological toilet was created with the funds of a charity founded by Bill Gates and his wife Melinda.
Within seven years of working on a plant that could turn human waste into fertilizer or water, the fund spent $200 million on it.
In total, according to Bill Gates, about 20 toilet models were created.
Now the device is finished and can be sold.
However, in order for such toilets to be mass-produced, the Gates Foundation is ready to spend an additional $200 million.
According to the Gates Foundation, 500,000 children under the age of five die each year due to poor sanitary conditions in the world.
To combat poor sanitary problems, such as cholera and others, health spending is increasing, which already amounts to 233 billion.
To better illustrate the sanitary situation that needs to be improved, Bill Gates went to the toilet presentation of a glass with feces.
According to him, this is a good reminder that in a small sample "there can be 200 trillion rotavirus cells, 200,000 bacteria causing infectious diseases, 100,000 eggs of worm parasites."
S. Slyva elected president of the Mass Football Association
On November 5, an extraordinary meeting of the Lithuanian mass football association took place in Kaunas, where Sergej Slyva was elected the new president of the organization.
An extraordinary general meeting of the members of the association was convened as a result of the request received by Anatoly Stecenko to resign as president of the association.
It was attended by 13 out of 15 members.
The main issue on the agenda was the election of a new president.
Two candidates participated in the elections - Sergey Slyva and Vaidotas Rastenis.
11 members of the association voted in favour of Slyv, two members voted in favour of Rasten.
Slyva will complete the term of office started by Stecenko, which will continue until January 2021.
Anxiety in France: People's deaths are worrying
French health officials on Monday announced a permanent ban on a widely used pesticide in the wake of concerns over dozens of people who have recently been poisoned in the west of the country.
The health agency ANSES announced that the decision to ban all products with pesticide methamphetamines was taken after a new safety check started earlier this year, even before at least three waves of poisoning began in the departments of Meno and Luara.
As a result of these cases, the government has already suspended the use of pesticides.
This soil disinfection chemical should not contact plants or farm workers.
In order to be effective, the product must be used in large quantities.
In France, it was used about 700 tonnes a year.
At least 70 people, including many farm workers, in the Ange region, where a lot of salad dressings are grown, complained of eye and throat puncture, breathing problems.
“These episodes confirm the fairness of our decision, but they did not rush it,” Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Weber, deputy director of ANSES, told Ouest France on Monday.
Methamphetamine, one of the most commonly used pesticides in the U.S. and Europe, is considered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) to be a “probable human carcinogen.”
This pesticide, marketed under names such as Vapam and Sectagon, is allowed in Europe until 2022, when a new safety check is to be carried out.
"There was no other choice but to remove him from the market, regardless of whether he had alternatives," Weber told the newspaper.
"We understand the difficulties that will arise for salad dressing growers, farmers in general, but public health is more important," she said.
Farmers have already expressed dissatisfaction with the government's decision last month to stop using methamphetamine in a region whose economy is heavily dependent on intensive agriculture.
In this region near Nantes, more than half of the 35,000 tonnes of salad juices consumed in Europe each year are grown.
Next season there will be "much less salad dressings, pickles and porridges", last month, when the government stopped using methamphetamine, the head of the Nantes farmer's federation Philippe Retiere (Philippe Retier) told AFP news agency.
Taline invested 70 million euros in a shopping centre with an overview round
A new shopping center "T1" will be opened in the capital of Estonia next weekend, in which the local capital real estate (NT) development company Pro Kapital Grup has invested 70 million euros.
The total area of 130,000 m2, or 55,000 m2 for rent, will be operated in the shopping center of 150 shops or entertainment venues, more than 30 cafes and restaurants, according to the developer’s report.
In comparison, the total area of Vilnius "Akropolio" (counting together with the area of the offices) amounts to about 110,000 sq. m. And for rent - 91,000 sq. m.
"T1" - the first shopping center with a review wheel mounted on the roof, says the developer.
It will start operating at the beginning of next year.
In addition to it, international transport gates will also be integrated into the territory: next to it there are trams, intercity buses will soon take place.
Rail Baltica’s main terminal is also operating nearby and is projected to serve about 1 million passengers per year by 2026.
Paul Michelozzi, CEO of Pro Kapital Grup, says that the global shopping mall business is undergoing significant changes, and with the development of T1 managed to get ahead of them.
“We’ve created a new generation of shopping malls that provide emotions and experiences that aren’t accessible online.
It is a place of attraction for people in the very center of the city, a traveler's gate, an impressive and worth visiting object and at the same time a quality time spent with friends or family," Michelozzi said in a statement.
Great Attention to Amusement
According to the manager of the shopping center, T1 also has the largest entertainment and discovery center in the Baltic States.
A total of 12.000 sq.m., or one-fifth of the total rented area, is devoted to entertainment.
An exceptional accent - a review wheel is installed on the roof.
It will lift guests to 120 m above sea level - Taline taller only TV tower.
After the review round, on the fourth floor, Super Skypark will operate, opening the largest batting centre in Europe and Estonia’s first basketball and mesh field on batting, the company says.
In the interactive "SkyLAB" research and discovery center, children are promised to take at least 5-6 hours.
The entertainment complex also features a 360-degree panoramic 4D cinema.
In addition to the conventional cinema shown in the six halls, visitors will also be able to experience virtual reality cinema with interactive 7D cinema.
In addition to the visual effects and moving chairs according to the rhythm of the film, the feeling of reality will be reinforced here by the combined effects of wind, rain or snow, as well as selected fragrances, smoke or fog in the cinema.
According to the developer, the opening of "T1" is expected to increase Estonia's tourism revenue of 13 million euros per year, attracting over 300,000 visitors.
Pro Kapital Grup is listed on the Nasdaq Baltic Stock Exchange, as well as on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.
Last year, the group received <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.8 million in sales revenue and suffered <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>350,000 in losses, according to the financial report of Pro Kapital Grup.
In 2016, almost EUR 9 million of sales revenues were generated on the Lithuanian market and a net profit of EUR 2.4 million was generated.
The shopping center "T1" was built by the Estonian company "Marko Ehitus".
In Cameroon, President Paul Biya is sworn in for the seventh term in a controversial election.
During an 85-year ceremony supervised by Parliament President Cavaye Yeguie Djibril, Biya promised to preserve the "unity and unity of the West African state".
Africa’s oldest president, who has ruled his country for 35 years, was declared the winner in the October 7 election, which won 71% of the vote.
However, the election was overshadowed by low voter activity, violence and suspected fraud.
On the eve of the inauguration of Mr. Biyos, 79 students and three school staff, including directors, were kidnapped at a presbyterial school in the Northwest region, where English-speaking separatists are campaigning for independence.
The majority of Cameroon's 22 million people are French-speaking and one-fifth are English-speaking.
In 2016, in the North-West and neighbouring South-West Province, in the wake of dissatisfaction with alleged discrimination in the fields of education, justice and economics, autonomy began to be demanded.
In 2017, when Biya refused to resign, the radicals declared an independent state, the "Ambassoon Republic", and raised their arms.
According to NGOs, at least 400 civilians and more than 175 security forces have been killed in separatist attacks and government retaliatory operations this year.
More than 300,000 people have fled the violence: some are across the border to Nigeria, but many are forced to live in semi-desert forests.
In October, only 5% of voters voted in the Northwestern region and 15% in the Southwestern province.
In both parts of the country, Biya won two-thirds of the vote.
Conservative Primary Elections: Mistakes Caused by Inexperience
"When there is a shortage of places, understand that the party has organized everything with its own resources.
Some municipalities were allowed to use their premises, but there were no polling booths everywhere because we cannot buy them ourselves.
“Thanks to those who borrowed,” he said.
According to him, complaints are pending, but their content does not materially change, and the infringements themselves are not of a malicious nature.
“There were complaints.
Not all the people who participated in the elections were experienced - it was also news for them.
Thus, not all of our actions were consistent with our procedures.
Therefore, the CRK had to be alerted in order to comply with the principles described by us.
These complaints do not constitute a reason to doubt the results," Anu<0xC5><0xA1>auskas said.
According to the President of the CRK, there have been cases when the ballot papers were not printed - upon learning about this, the ballot papers found in the ballot boxes without the stamp were cancelled.
Some towns lacked space, but, according to Anu<0xC5><0xA1>ausko, complaints and violations related to several dozen bulletins.
"Well, since the difference is several thousand, it certainly does not make a substantial difference to the results of the elections," Anu<0xC5><0xA1>auskas explained.
It is said that the activity of party members in the elections was 55%, while the activity of nonpartisan voters was 69%.
Both candidates had 400 observers and 600 people worked on the commissions.
The results announced on Sunday also do not change - Ingrid <0xC5><0xA0>imonyta voted for 79% of voters (16,418 votes), while Vygauda U<0xC5><0xA1>acka voted for 21% (4441 votes).
On 17 November, the TS-LKD Council will formally support the candidacy of I. <0xC5><0xA0>imonyt<0xC4><0x97> in the presidential elections in May next year.
Trump says he probably won’t meet Putin in Paris
White House national security adviser John Bolton earlier said Trump would meet with Putin in Paris, where the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I will be held this week.
However, in the final rallies before the U.S. Congressional midterm elections, Trump told reporters he was not sure if it would be a good opportunity to meet with the Russian president.
"I'm not sure we'll meet in Paris.
Probably not," said the President of the United States.
However, the White House chief added, they will meet during the G20 summit and "probably meet many times" after that.
Trump continues to try to "overload" relations with Moscow, despite suspicions that Russia is interfering in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
K<0xC4><0x99>stutis Strupas calls for repeal of VTEK decision
K<0xC4><0x99>stutis Strupas, the former director general of Santaras Clinics at Vilnius University, is asking for the decision of the Chief Official Ethics Commission (VTEK) to be repealed, which has been recognized as a timely failure to declare transactions and thus violated the law.
K. Strup's complaint was examined by the administrative court of Vilnius County on Tuesday.
The decision will be announced on November 26th.
The applicant requests the annulment of VTEK’s decision of 23 May, BNS’s representative Sigita Jacinevi<0xC4><0x8D>ien<0xC4><0x97> Baltaduon<0xC4><0x97> said.
Mr Strup believes that gifts donated to loved ones should not be declared, he argues that he understands the exception to the law.
In May, VTEK announced that Silvija Strupien<0xC4><0x97>, head of the Department of Ambulatory Rehabilitation of the University Hospital of the Republic of Vilnius and the then removed Director General of Santara Clinics, violated the provisions of the law regulating the declaration of private interests.
The investigation found that four transactions were declared without the deadlines: a loan taken from the bank in 2010 with the spouse, the purchase of securities from the bank in 2017, a gift given to the daughter in 2017 - an apartment and in 1996 together with the spouse's matrimonial property and a non-marital agreement.
Mr Strupien<0xC4><0x97> also declared these transactions by expiring the deadlines.
Persons who have violated the law on the harmonization of public and private interests in the public service may not be promoted for a year.
The law obliges you to declare not only your own, but also your spouse’s data.
The study was carried out by VTEK on the basis of information provided by Info TV.
It was explained whether K. Strupas and his wife, S. Strupien<0xC4><0x97>, head of the Department of Ambulatory Rehabilitation of the University Hospital of the Republic of Vilnius, had properly and in a timely manner declared their transactions.
Last year, according to Info TV, Strup gave his daughter a real estate worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>125,000.
However, the former head of Santara clinics and his wife had not indicated in their declarations of interest.
Strupu, along with at least a dozen others, have expressed suspicions in an investigation into corruption - according to law enforcement, for winning public computer, software purchases in clinics from companies demanded illegal financial compensation, it was disguised as support.
In this way, Mr. Strup is suspected to have stabbed at least five times in Santara clinics during public procurement in the field of information technology.
K. Strup himself denies his guilt.
Corruption suspect Professor K. Strup was fired from the position of head of Santara clinics in September.
With the decision of the Ministry of Health and the University of Vilnius, the participants of the Santara clinics have terminated their working relationship with K. Strup<0xC5><0xB3> at his own request.
He has been in charge of the hospital since November 10, 2013.
Professor Juozas Raistenskis will continue to temporarily lead the Santara clinics until the competition to elect a new general manager takes place, promising to announce it again this year.

You already want to teach in a different way in schools: promises less tests, more practice
Such changes in educational content are planned by the Ministry of Education and Science, which presented them on Monday at the Forum "Change of Educational Content: Foreign Experience for Decisions in Lithuania".
Minister of Education and Science Jurgita Petrauskien<0xC4><0x97>, speaking in the debate, said that over 30 million euros have been invested in the updating of educational content over the last ten years, but no results have been seen.
"According to the results of the international student achievements survey PISA, the achievements of pupils are below the OECD average," said Minister of Education and Science Jurgita Petrauskien<0xC4><0x97>.
The OECD expert Philas Lambertas, quoted in the report by the Ministry of Education and Science, said that Lithuania is too much focused on the provision of knowledge rather than on the practical application of knowledge.
According to him, in general education programs in Lithuania, a great deal of attention is paid to students’ literacy, critical thinking, respect and responsibility, but it is also needed to educate children’s creativity, entrepreneurship, financial literacy, empathy.
Deputy Minister of Education and Science Gra<0xC5><0xBE>vydas Kazakevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius, presenting the changes in the general educational content, said that the volume of programs starting to update this academic year will be smaller, they will be more specific, the disciplines will be more closely interconnected.
According to the Deputy Minister, the education of pupils will be more individualized, the schools will become more independent - they will be allowed to prepare between 10 and 30 percent of their unique educational content, the current pupil evaluation system will change to a cumulative score, gain more weight and informally.
A small number of standardized tests.
It is promised that general education programmes will be digital, convenient to use, linked to e-resources, the bank of tasks.
The aim of updating the educational content is to improve the achievements of pupils in the international PISA study by at least 10%, reducing the gap between the achievements of pupils in the modern competences of the school by a third, and in writing in various fields.
As of May 2018, Lithuania plans to allocate 7.8 million euros from the European Union and the state budget to update its educational content.
It is expected that the project of general education programmes to be updated in the 2019-2020 academic year will be tested in some schools, and from September 2021 they will be implemented in all schools.
At the beginning of October, the Ministry received criticism for a project of almost 8 million euros worth of the Education Development Centre to update the initial, basic and secondary education general programmes.
With a four-year budget of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.8 million, the first purchase of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.3 million was announced at the beginning of October, which sought out the developers of educational programmes.
After criticizing the experts for this purchase, he was suspended, and Minister of Education and Science J. Petrauskien<0xC4><0x97> dismissed Giedri Vaideli, director of the Education Development Center.
In Lithuania - exercises how to respond to extreme flooding
In Lithuania, on Monday, a 10-day exercise to improve the response of the institutions to the extreme floods begins.
As reported by the Department of Fire Protection and Rescue (PAGD), during the exercises will be examined how state authorities are prepared to work in the country after declaring a state-level emergency, for example, to take a flood in the vicinity of the vans: to eliminate its consequences, to coordinate the search and rescue of people.
The exercises will be attended by more than 100 representatives from all ministries of the country, other institutions, as well as members of emergency operations centres in 12 municipalities.
On November 5-13, the preparatory stage of the exercises will take place, during which the municipality, receiving information from the Hydrometeorological Service of the PAGD on the non-stop falls and the onset of the flood, will make decisions on the management of the emergency situation.
The active phase of the exercise is scheduled for 14-15 November.
During this time, the department will be operated by the State Emergency Operations Centre, and the State and municipal institutions - the institutions' Emergency Operations Centres.
After declaring to the Government a state-level emergency due to the effects of the flood, the Prime Minister appointed the Head of Operations will lead the resolution of the emergency, the elimination of its consequences, the protection of the population and property and rescue actions.
The Deputy Director of PAGD, Mindaugas Kanapickas, says that the most important thing in the exercises is to check the readiness of the institutions to carry out the functions provided for in the legislation, to assess the possibilities for exchange of information, to check how the institutions are prepared to warn and inform the populations of the institutions in the event of an imminent disaster.
The exercises will also demonstrate the joint capacity of Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian firefighters to pump large amounts of water from the covered areas.
For this purpose, the BaltFloodCombat module was established in 2009.
Ukraine's Attorney General Yury Lucenka resigns
Ukraine's Attorney General Yury Lucenka on Tuesday announced his resignation from the resonance caused by the death of a sour-blown anti-corruption fighter, Ukrainian news agency Unian.net reported.
Under Ukrainian law, the request for resignation must be submitted by the Prosecutor General to the President of the country, and this is to give the Supreme Council a majority to approve.
On Tuesday, Attorney General Lucenko presented a law enforcement investigation into the order of Mr Gandziuk's murder and the results at the Supreme Council.
In his speech to parliamentarians, he described the investigation as effective, but expressed outrage at the fact that Gandziuk's death was being exploited for politicians' public relations.
Gandziuk was a Ukrainian anti-corruption activist who spoke publicly about police corruption in her hometown of Cherson, in southern Ukraine.
On July 31st, an unknown attacker, K. Gandziuk, appeared in the face of a mule acid.
On November 4, she died of injuries in the hospital.
Protesters at Ukraine’s Interior Ministry are demanding a response to the murder of K. Gandziuk, AFP/Scanpix.
According to Lucenko, a law enforcement investigation has identified 12 people who may have been involved in a murder warrant for Mr Gandziuk.
However, one of the most likely versions of the study has been leaked to the media, which poses a threat to the success of the study.
According to the Attorney General, the suspects were given substantial knowledge about the leakage of information.
Lucenko added that he was personally acquainted with Gandziuk and was angry that some politicians were using her blood for public relations.
"In order for no one to have reason to say that someone who is in a position of authority, I want to state that I am making a statement to resign.
Today I will present it to the President of Ukraine and you will have to consider this issue in Parliament," Lucenko's statement in Rada was quoted as saying by Obozrevatel.
Lucenko added that “you can’t allow a dual government in the country when the law-enforcement system collapses without any evidence, even for exposed crimes.”
Lucenko is considered a close associate of the country's President Petro Poroshenko.
He was appointed Attorney General on May 12, 2016, following prolonged attempts to remove his predecessor, Viktor Shokin, suspected of being covered in corruption by top officials and politicians.
Minister of Energy <0xC5><0xBD>. Vai<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC5><0xAB>nas meets with representatives of Orlen Lietuva
As Energy Minister Aurelia Vernickait<0xC4><0x97> informed Elta, the meeting will discuss the achievement of renewable energy targets in the transport sector by 2020 and beyond 2020.
According to the European Commission (EC), transport is the only sector that does not currently reach the EU-level trajectory set out in the national renewable energy action plans, accounting for 6% of renewable energy in 2015.
The EC estimates that progress towards a mandatory target of 10 % in the transport sector is rather slow due to a variety of difficulties, including relatively large costs of reducing greenhouse gases and regulatory uncertainty.
Renewable energy in this sector is mainly derived from biofuels (88%), and electricity plays a lesser role at this stage.
The Seimas took a proposal to supplement the issues of the corruption investigation by the Conservatives to the KT
The Seimas on Tuesday approved the proposal, which was registered by Agn<0xC4><0x97> <0xC5><0xA0>irinskien<0xC4><0x97>, the "state" leading the investigation into the illegal influence of political processes.
There were 58 Seimas, 27 against, with nine abstentions.
The draft will then be considered by the Seimas Committees, which will be headed by A. <0xC5><0xA0>irinskien<0xC4><0x97>s’s Legal and Legal Affairs Committee.
Following its conclusion, a vote will take place on the adoption of the amendment to the decision.
The Seimas Temporary Commission of Inquiry, which is currently conducting a new political corruption investigation, has been instructed to explain the possible illegal influence in 2008-2016.
<0xC5><0xA0>irinskien<0xC4><0x97> proposed to extend the term, stating that "important information has emerged in the public space about possible illegal influence and impact on political processes and state institutions".
A. <0xC5><0xA0>irinskien<0xC4><0x97> describes in the project "the possibility of representing the interests of pension funds in the legislative process or by appealing to the Constitutional Court or attempts to influence the decision-making processes of such significant independent institutions as the Chief Official Ethics Commission".
The appeal to the Constitutional Court for pensions was initiated by opposition conservatives.
The ruling "states" found that the conservatives relied largely on the arguments of private pension fund lawyers in their appeals.
Influenced by the Supreme Commission of Official Ethics (SEC), the leaders of the "countrymen" accuse former comrade Povila Urb<0xC5><0xA1>i<0xC4><0x87>.
According to them, the former chairman of the Seimas State Management and Municipalities Committee could have appointed the members of the VTEK to fire the former head of the Commission’s Prevention Division Mindaugas Siauri.
At the end of September, the Seimas formed a committee to explain the possible illegal influence of interested persons or their groups, the impact on the election process, the formation of coalitions, the participation of parliamentary factions, the work of individual politicians, parties and public movements, the activities and the financing of the law.
It is also proposed to examine the information provided by law enforcement and intelligence authorities to the competent authorities as to how they have reacted.
Researchers should present their findings by 1 May next year.
There will be an election campaign for the President of the European Parliament.
Seven of the 12 members of the commission are "countrymen" representatives.
Its members were also appointed by two social workers, one "regular", a liberal and a representative of the Union of Christian Families in the Lithuanian Polish Elections.
The Conservatives and Social Democrats refused to participate in the commission’s work.
The new study was initiated by Ram<0xC5><0xAB>nas Karbauskis, president of the ruling Lithuanian peasants and green union.
According to him, an investigation by the National Security and Defence Committee (NSGK) carried out last session on essentially the same issues has shown that the investigation needs to be continued.
Germany's Homeland Security chief has lost his job.
55-year-old Maassen has further aroused controversy, saying he was blamed for his troubles by "radical left-wing forces" in the Merkel coalition.
As a result, he was not transferred to another post, as promised earlier, but forced to go to the reserve.
Among other things, it turned out last weekend that a few weeks ago at a meeting of representatives of European internal intelligence organisations in Warsaw, Mr Maassen criticized Merkel’s “enemy” immigration policy.
German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, who defended the head of intelligence for a long time, said at a press conference on Monday that Maassen's recent comments were unacceptable and "personally disappointed."
Seehofer himself, having been pressured both by this dispute and by the poor appearance of his party in the local government of Bavaria, asked President Frank-Walter Steinmeier to release Maassen to the reserve.
Hurricane Shark Attacks Affect the Whole Island - Third Man Weared
The Queensland Emergency Service said in a statement that the victim of the attack near the Rocky Island Sid Harbor, located off the coast of Queensland, suffered "smooth leg and wrist wounds".
The man was taken by helicopter to the hospital.
The sequential island is the largest of the same-named archipelago objects, attracting many scuba diving and boating enthusiasts from all over the world.
Attacks of sharks in this region have been relatively rare so far.
On September 19, Sid Harbor was attacked by a woman and the next day a 12-year-old tourist was attacked in the same bay.
The last attack on this island was in 2010, before the last swarm of sharks.
VRC has two new members - Viscount and Puksa
A. Puksa was offered to the members of the PRC by the Lithuanian Bar Association.
He will replace Svejona <0xC5><0xA0>altauskiena, a delegate from the Lawyers’ Association who has withdrawn from the PRC.
Lawyer E. Viskonta was proposed to the members of the SRC, taking into account the presentation of the party "Order and Justice".
This party does not have a representative of the People's Republic of China when Donat Laurinavi<0xC4><0x8D>ius withdrew from it.
In a secret ballot, Puxus's candidacy was supported by 74 Seimas, 5 against and 6 abstained.

Bodies of girls ruin stereotypes about wedding dresses <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Body girl with white puffy wedding dress - mission (not) possible?
Can the white pavilion floating towards the altar be larger than the size of S or M and still look attractive?
The participants of the larger reality show "The Evolution of the Big (r)" will prove today that the beauty and elegance of the bride really does not depend on a woman's kilograms.
But that's not all - one of the girls of the project will have tears of happiness tonight - her boyfriend will appear on the filming site.
“There are still those who think that bigger girls don’t get the attention or look of guys.
It's just a myth - my boyfriend is an athlete himself, but for him I like what I am, he doesn't require a figure that meets any standards from me," - before the show with a wedding dress will speak to the show participant Aurika.
Wedding dress is not easy, in every sense, clothing - it is a complex construction, with a lot of material, a dress difficult, uncomfortable for movement.
Also, some women believe that a taller girl in a white dress will look even taller and therefore have less self-confidence.
I can reassure you that the properly selected model of the dress really solves this "problem", - explained one of the members of the show commission, fashion designer Robert Kalinkin.
The girls’ fates in the project are decided by R. Kalinkin, together with the whole commission - Erika Vitulskiene, photographer and social networking star Nagliu Bierancu and TV producer Laura Paukste, who has opened a large fashion house.
"When deciding which girl to say goodbye to the show, there is a lot of confusion between the members of the committee - we all represent different spheres and imagine the winner of the show differently.
The task of demonstrating wedding dresses has been further complicated, and it is - I can now reveal - that two newbies have appeared, which have certainly not been worse than the old one.
It was a special evening in every sense,” says R. Kalinkin.
Naujok<0xC4><0x97>s - 23 years old with a scandalous behavior in one of the summer reality shows famous Eve and 31-year-old mother of exceptional beauty Dovil<0xC4><0x97> - like other girls participated in the selection of "Dyd<0xC5><0xBE>i (r) evolution" and got into the top twenty.
Unfortunately, after the first extremely open photo session of girls in the streets of Vilnius city, they had to say goodbye to the project.
The girls returned to the show by LNK viewers, for their favorite voice on the television portal.
The world-renowned reality show of apocalypse beauties in Lithuania is taking place for the second week - here the plus-sized girls will compete for the first plus-sized star name in the country.
So far only eight of them remain - and they all understand perfectly well that the winner can only be one.
The intriguing and unpredictable reality show "Dyd<0xC5><0xBE>i (r) evolution" week begins already this Monday evening at 20.30 pm via LNK.
Actor I. Elba named the sexiest man in the world
U.S. magazine People has announced the sexiest man in the world this year.
He is the 46-year-old British actor Idris Elba.
While the man claims that this message was unexpected, telling about the new title, he did not stop joking.
I thought, "Can't be!
Seriously?".
Then I looked at myself in the mirror and thought - yes, today I look sexual, - laughing at the actor.
Speaking frankly, Idris said that this title was an extremely pleasurable feeling that deteriorated his ego.
The British star believes that he has often been caught in words and tricks that made his childhood difficult because, as he himself calls it, he was "very tall and ungrateful".
The young actor did not believe his peers and became an object of affection both for his rare and unusual name and for his African origin.
"You've just grown your muscles and I've become the toughest guy in my neighborhood," Idris smiled.
When a man loses his ability to be big on screens, I. Elba works as a discotheque at parties held in Spain, and especially in the bustling Ibiza.
In his spare time, the man enjoys Thai boxing and has a backdrop for fashion, which he realizes by creating his own clothing line.
The British actor believes that the most important thing in the world is the family, so he plans a wedding with his fiancée Sabrina Dhowre.
I. Elba became the 33rd most sexiest man in the world for People magazine.
In 2017, Blake Shelton won the title.
Man killed in <0xC5><0xA0>irvint<0xC5><0xB3> district during drinks
On Monday evening, a man was fatally murdered in the <0xC5><0xA0>alki<0xC5><0xA1>kis village of <0xC5><0xA0>alki<0xC5><0xA1>kis in the <0xC5><0xA0>irvinto district.
According to the Vilnius County Police, at 9:16 a.m., a report was received that a man beat up a neighbor during the drinks.
Doctors arrived and found the death of a man born in 1943.
A suspect, born in 1994, has been arrested for intoxication at 2.53 per cent.
The police explain the circumstances of the incident.
Authorities no longer require a 20 km distance from the construction of waste incineration plants
Vilnius cogeneration plant is being built, near Gari<0xC5><0xAB>nas Market.
Authorities no longer ensure that the construction of waste incineration plants maintains a distance of 20 kilometres from the settlements.
K<0xC4><0x99>stutis Ma<0xC5><0xBE>eika, the head of the Environmental Protection Committee, registered an amendment to the Waste Management Act in the Seimas on Monday, which denies such a requirement.
According to Mr Ma<0xC5><0xBE>eikos, the countrymen's group, which had previously supported the 20 km distance rule, promised to support the amendment on its refusal.
The amendment by Mr Ma<0xC5><0xBE>eikas provides that from January 2019 onwards, waste incineration plants could be built to meet the requirements of environmental protection and public health requirements laid down by law.
He acknowledges that the amendment has raised the President’s doubts about such a ban.
"Given the definition of a residential area, it is obvious that it would be almost impossible to find such places where the above-mentioned objects could be built," said the chairman of the committee.
In October, the ruling majority opposed the President’s veto to tightening the construction of waste incineration plants.
In addition to the ban on the construction of waste incineration plants closer to 20 km from the settlements, the amendments provided for permission for the government to make decisions on the future of the two power plants already built, taking into account the public health interests.
The latter provisions of Mr. Ma<0xC5><0xBE>eika do not propose adjustments.
The energy group "Lietuvos Energia" built in Vilnius with waste and biofuels, and in Kaunas - together with the Finnish energy group "Fortum" company "Fortum Heat Lietuva".
The latter is already burning waste in Klaipeda.
Talk about a possible compromise in Brexit negotiations <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Britain and Ireland’s leaders discussed a possible compromise on Monday to address a complex issue in Northern Ireland that would strangle Brexit negotiations, Dublin said.
Speaking on the phone, British Prime Minister Theresa May proposed an opportunity to review the so-called safeguards agreement mechanism that would allow the UK to leave an open border between the province of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland belonging to the European Union.
Ireland's Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has vowed to consider the proposal, but has rejected any option for Britain to unilaterally withdraw from the agreement, the government said in a statement.
In the interview, Mr May "has the opportunity to review the mechanism of safeguards," it states.
"Varadkar has made it clear that he is open to reviewing new proposals, provided that the outcome of such a review will not be related to a unilateral decision to discontinue the protective measures," the government said in a statement.
Brexit negotiators do not find an acceptable solution to avoid checks on the UK-Ireland land border as Britain exits the single market and customs union next year.
The two sides agree on "precautionary measures" to keep the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland open until a larger-scale trade agreement is signed to ensure that additional customs checks at the border are not carried out.
The EU wants Northern Ireland to continue to comply with EU customs rules, but London wants them to be applied temporarily to the UK as a whole.
The Daily Telegraph reported on Monday that Brexit secretary Dominic Raab is seeking Britain to be able to withdraw from the containment deal unilaterally after three months.
However, Varadkar told reporters in Dublin that his government "cannot support it".
"Third-month or limited-term safeguards are not the securities on which they will be written," he said.
Earlier, London and Brussels did not confirm information about the breakthrough in the Brexit negotiations after Britain announced last weekend that the deal was hand-in-hand.
"I would say that we are continuing to make progress in the negotiations, but there is still work to be done," May said in a statement.
European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schin also told reporters: "We're not there yet."
Nobel Laureates Call for Access to Reliable Information
A group of prominent thinkers, including Nobel laureates, on Monday issued a statement calling for the right to access reliable information in the internet era.
Among the 25 signatories to the International Declaration on Information and Democracy are the economists Amartya Sena (Amartja Sena) and Joseph Stiglitz (Joseph Stiglic), the Nobel Peace Prize-winning Iranian lawyer and human rights activist Mariysa L<0xC3><0xA1>boda L<0xC3><0xA1>szl<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1>a (L<0xC3><0xA1>o<0xC5><0xA1>a L<0xC3><0xA1>vada<0xC5><0xA1>), Mariy L<0xC3><0xA1>tara<0xC5><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xA1><0xC3><0xA1><0xC3><0xA1><0xC3><0xA1><0xC3><0xA1><0xC3><0xA1><0xC3><0xA1><0xC3><0xA1><0xC3><0xA1><0xC3><0xA1><0xC3><0xA1><0xC3><0xA1><0xC3><0xA1><0xC3><0xA1><0xC3><0xA1><0xC3><0xA1>n Eba (L<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xAD>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3>
"We call on the leaders of goodwill on all continents to take action to strengthen democratic models and open public debates through which citizens can make decisions based on facts," the group said in a statement.
They argue that the “global space of information and communication” is a common good that “must be safeguarded in order to strengthen freedom of expression and view”.
“People have a fundamental right to access information that is freely collected, processed and disseminated, based on the truth of commitment, principles of pluralism of attitudes and rational methods of fact-finding,” the statement said.
The document calls for help from world leaders, including U.S. President Donald Trump, who often criticizes "fake news" but regularly accused of distorting the facts.
World leaders should voice their stance on the issue when they meet at the Paris Peace Forum on November 11-13, the signatories said.
The statement was prepared within two months, under the leadership of St. Ebadi and Christophe Deloire, head of the Paris-based Press Freedom and Journalists’ Rights Organization Reporters Without Borders (RSF).
Other signatories include former Senegalese President Abdou Dioufas, Chinese lawyer and human rights activist Teng Biao, and political scientist Francis Fukuyama.
The Seimas approved higher fines for harmful products
The Seimas approved amendments to the Product Safety Act, which stipulate that penalties for product safety violations should be increased.
The amendments were adopted unanimously in the Chamber.
As Antanas Vinkus, member of the Seimas Committee on Health, said, with regard to the new project, he welcomes the fact that the objectives set are related to better consumer protection of products.
Its provisions shall also be adapted to the requirements of the Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council.
"My head, in the proposed bill, is to be better and more concretely distributed to all actors involved in the supply and distribution process: manufacturers, service providers, importers, distributors and others.
As practice shows, the current system of penalties does not always prevent further infringements, because the entities who have paid the fines continue to commit repeated infringements," Vinkus said.
The project was prepared by the Ministry of Economy, after the approval of the Government, the Seimas Economic Committee supplemented it with its proposals.
Amendments to the law aim to increase penalties for infringements, strengthen the protection of consumer rights, empower market surveillance authorities and create a clear system of product safety requirements and compliance with them.
According to the Ministry of Economy, there is currently no obligation for producers to properly label the product and thus ensure its traceability.
In addition, according to the Ministry, market surveillance authorities are not granted the right to enter the territory of manufacturers and suppliers, buildings, premises, carry out inspections, which hinders the work of the authorities.
According to the Ministry, the deadline of six months for the imposition of fines and warnings is too short to identify the infringement, to carry out an investigation and to impose a fine.
Also, according to the ministry, the penalties imposed are not effective enough.
Companies often repeatedly violate the requirements of the law - in 2017 alone, 14 companies did so.
The Ministry of Economy has proposed to impose an obligation on manufacturers to properly label the product and thus ensure its traceability, in order to make it easier for market surveillance authorities to clarify suppliers of non-compliant products.
It is also proposed to give market surveillance authorities the right to access, in the course of national product safety checks, operators who produce, supply products on the market, territory, buildings, premises, carry out inspections.
It is planned to increase the amount of fines for violations of the law.
A fine of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> 150 to 2 500 (now 144 to 1 448) would be imposed on the manufacturer, importer or authorised representative who has placed dangerous products on the market and on the distributor on the market who has supplied them.
A fine of between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1 000 and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5 000 (now between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>868 and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4,344) would be imposed on the State Consumer Protection Service (VVATAT) or another market surveillance authority if it decided to prohibit the placing on the market and supply of dangerous products or the provision of dangerous services.
Failure to comply with the requirement to remove dangerous products from the market, recover them from consumers and destroy them would result in a fine of between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2500 and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6,500 (now between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,448 and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5,792).
If dangerous products have caused harm to consumer health, a fine of between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2,500 and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15,000 (now <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,448 to 11584) would be imposed.
If dangerous products resulted in the death of a consumer, a fine of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6,500 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>25,000 (now <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5,792 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>23,169) would be imposed.
According to the Ministry, a fine of up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>25 thousand is imposed in Poland and Austria for violating the legislation governing product safety (minimum fine not set), in Belgium - from <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>26 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>600,000 - from <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>75,000 - in Bulgaria - from <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>500 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6, in Romania - from <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>155 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6
10-Year-Old Child Abducted: Raped by Family Member
The incident in Colombia has intrigued millions of people.
A 10-year-old girl gave birth to a healthy boy in the rape of her older brother.
The baby sees the world thanks to the cesarean section, but both the girl and her baby feel good.
They have been supervised by doctors for some time.
It still has to take some time before the young mother with the baby will be released home.
"Based on the information I received from police officers, the little girl became pregnant after she was sexually exploited by a family member - her brother," the director of the hospital where the delivery was received told a foreign television station.
Police are investigating the incident of rape and violence against a child.
Norway’s Armed Battalion Participates in NATO Exercises in the Farthest and Extreme Areas
Troops from the Norwegian Armed Forces took part in a series of complex exercises in the mountains north of the country’s capital Oslo.
It is part of NATO’s “Triangle 2018” exercise, the biggest NATO exercise since the end of the Cold War.
Most of the soldiers from the second Norwegian military battalion after the September 11 terrorist attacks spent a lot of time away from home, in places like Afghanistan - that is, in the warmer outskirts.
But most of all they are skilled at fighting in the Arctic, and these skills are of great use now that NATO is shifting its focus.
In recent days, in the mountains east of Tinset, often in the most remote and remote areas, soldiers have been engaged in staged battles against real British soldiers.
Warriors have the skills to survive in this cold wilderness, but in a harsh climate they are on their shoulders to speed up a much higher weight - one backpack weighs about 50 kg.
The soldiers at the headquarters say that their skills, how to survive and fight under such conditions, they share with other NATO soldiers.
According to the soldiers, these exercises, which, like no other, are particularly reminiscent of real warfare, will teach them to be prepared if there is a serious threat.
Premier League's Ausssiders Win First Season's Victory
On Monday night, the 11th round of the Premier League of England ended.
Huddersfield Town won a crucial 12-seat win in all tournaments, which was the first successful night of the season for which Huddersfield Town won the doubles.
Huddersfield Town and London's Fulham double ended in a home win with a minimum score of 1:0 (1:0).
The defending double smashed the spectator’s attention as both teams fought for three crucial points, and the winner of the match was not clear until the last minute.
However, the hosts kept the balance and did not allow the Fulham team to rob the equals.
Fossu-Mensahas scored his only winning goal in the 29th minute.
It’s worth noting that this was the first Huddersfield Town home run of the season.
After the 11th round, Huddersfield Town ranks 18th in the league, Fulham remains last, 20th.
Kaunas vice-president doesn't plan to return to politics
Former Kaunas deputy Povilas Ma<0xC4><0x8D>iulis, who has left his job in the municipal elections and the United Kaunas organization, does not plan to return to politics due to his support for Vygaud U<0xC5><0xA1>acki, and promises to focus on business.
“I’m going to focus on business.
I am a shareholder of several companies, and I also have ideas for new projects.
And most importantly - I will be able to enjoy the opportunity to spend more time with the family", - said P. Ma<0xC4><0x8D>iulis.
He also said he did not plan to participate in the upcoming municipal elections.
Ma<0xC4><0x8D>iulis had not yet had the opportunity to speak with V. U<0xC5><0xA1>acka after this Sunday lost the initial elections of the Union of Patriotic Union-Lithuanian Christian Democrats to Ingrid <0xC5><0xA0>imonyte.
"To be honest, we haven't been able to discuss the results in detail with him and the team and talk about the plans for the future.
It is clear that after Vygauda leaves the fight for further elections, this stage of my life is over,” Ma<0xC4><0x8D>iulis said.
He said he did not regret the decision to leave Kaunas for support for U<0xC5><0xA1>ack, only regretted that "Lithuania has lost a unique opportunity to have a true leader in the context of international relations".
Ma<0xC4><0x8D>iulis served as deputy mayor of Kaunas for a short time in 2011, and later returned to these positions after successful elections to the United Kaunas in 2015.
He is a shareholder in the private school "Erudito licejus" and several other companies.
Workers at Kaunas Castle: What are they doing here?
The Kaunasers, when they noticed the workers in the Kaunas castle, are amazed that the rest of the tower is finally being rebuilt.
Gabrielius Su<0xC5><0xBE>ied<0xC4><0x97>lis, director of the Kaunas City Museum, told the portal kaunas.diena.lt that the work on the replacement of the protective roofing of the south-west tower with a fragment of the defensive wall is taking place here.
According to the postman, the roofs will be cans.
"The worn-out canvas posed a threat to the environment - people could fall in and get injured - so it had to be replaced.
The roofs were no longer resistant to moisture, so it was also damaged to the heritage," the museum director explained.
Will these roofs be similar to those that were a few centuries ago?
"All works are combined with heritage and other institutions", - G. Wo<0xC5><0xBE>eid<0xC4><0x97>lis added, aiming for the result to be as authentic as possible, but at the same time the important and practical side - roofing values must be protected from moisture.
A universal solution has been chosen when working with heritage.
Before that, the elements of the Kaunas castle were covered in the soviet year, so they no longer had historical value," the director of the Kaunas City Museum said.
The contract was signed on October 2nd.

U.S. and South Korea Renewed Navy Exercises
In the southern city of Pohang, military exercises with about 500 soldiers will now take place in two weeks, the Defense Ministry said in Seoul.
The U.S. has 28,500 troops deployed in South Korea.
The two countries have been preparing joint military maneuvers for many years, which Pyongyang calls a "provocation" and a "preparation for the invasion".
North Korea said on Friday it would renew its nuclear program if Washington did not lift economic sanctions on Pyongyang.
Such a course change could be “very rarely discussed,” the North’s foreign ministry said.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a televised interview that the sanctions would remain until Pyongyang gave up its nuclear weapons.
He also announced that he will meet with North Korean envoy Kim Yong Cholu in New York this week.

The Center for Eastern European Studies will work with two major U.S. "memory centers"
According to Lino Kojala, the head of the RESC, who has been in Vilnius for thirteen years, the meeting in the USA will allow the implementation of the projects and will make the voice of Lithuania more heard on the other side of the Atlantic.
“We have been working hard on this for several months.
I am pleased that the two major institutions see us as partners and are looking for opportunities for joint action.
I have no doubt that the activities of the niches will arise, because the issues of NATO, security, disinformation and development of the Eastern Partnership countries are also a priority for them," Kojala said.
The agreements note that the RESC and the U.S. institutions will work together to prepare applications for international projects, exchange expertise and knowledge, and prepare expert visits.
This should be especially useful for Lithuanian analysts, as both partners have an excellent international reputation.
The FPRI has been in operation since 1955 and unites almost a hundred top-level analysts.
FPRI ranked seventh in its category in the University of Pennsylvania’s latest global ranking of analytical centers.
At the time, the CEPA, whose analysts have been repeatedly invited to consult and work for the highest U.S. political institutions, ranks top ten in the same ranking in its category.
"This will give more opportunities for Lithuanian analysts working in various institutions to enter the US information space and will encourage us to raise the quality cartel," Kojala added.
One of the first practical steps should be the help of partners in distributing the forthcoming RESC analytical publication "Lithuanian Foreign Policy Review" among U.S. decision-makers and in the public space.
The Centre for Eastern European Studies operates on the basis of projects implemented and does not receive targeted grants.
Among the RESC partners with which joint initiatives are implemented are the European Commission, NATO, USAID, various international funds, etc.

Mexican restaurant to help deported migrants from the United States
The further the more Mexicans are deported back, and the more difficult it is to adapt to them when they return.
“When I was deported, they took everything: houses, cars, clothes.
They took everything except one thing - my knowledge," said Victor Hugo Hernandez, director of the restaurant.
The Board of Directors expects the merging of Mexican and U.S. cultures to promote a better understanding of each other.
