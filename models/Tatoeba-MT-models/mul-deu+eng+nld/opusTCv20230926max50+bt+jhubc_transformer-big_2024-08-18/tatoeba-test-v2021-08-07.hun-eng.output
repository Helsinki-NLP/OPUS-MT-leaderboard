That's not the right solution.
It's no exaggeration to say he's a genius.
It's no secret.
I'm not the one who's got a problem with Tom.
It's not that expensive.
This is not the 19th century.
This is not the 19th century.

There's a razor change.
Looks like you're not feeling well here.
Looks like you've been thinking about everything.
It makes me sad.
That's what counts.

Seems to be.

It seems to me that you're being honest.
I think you're wrong.
Looks like we're gonna have an extraordinary guest.
It's cool to be late for a date.
That's exactly what they want.
Oh, dear.
It's fair if you get the same pay for the same job.
It's almost perfect.
It is far from ideal.
It's yours.
You know, it's funny.
It's starting to burrow.
It's getting serious.
We're gonna have a hard time.
It won't be easy.
You're lucky to see a falling star.
It's good to be warm.
It's good for learning.

You can't breathe in here.
Impossibility to meet your expectations.
It is impossible to meet your requirements.
I don't know what tomorrow will bring.

It's inevitable.
That's inspiring.
It's just a feeling.
It's just further away.
It's just a matter of time before Tom gets in trouble again.
It's just a phone.
I just don't want to die today.
It's pretty heavy.
That's pretty important.
It's really nice of you to take me home.
That's nice of you to say.
It's late.
There's a wash today.
It's like an underwater field, and the turtles, rays, and sharks over it are like flying creatures.
It's closed.
It's me again.
It's me again, Tom.
It's me!
That's me.
It's sad the way he lives.
It's too cold to swim.
This is my horse.
This is my life!
This is my life!
That's my problem.
This is my suitcase.
Now it's my turn.
It's never too late to be what you could have been.
You have nothing to do with it.
That's not a bad idea.
This is not a bank.
It's not as pretentious as it sounds.
It's not complicated at all.
That's not enough.
That's not gonna happen.
It's not Mennad's job to change Egypt.
It's not mine.
It's not my fault.
Not negotiable.
It's not that far.
It's not that simple.
This is not the 19th century.
This is not the 19th century.
It's not what it looks like.
It’s not about what you do, it’s about how you do it.
It's not worth complaining about.
I didn't talk to you.
I wasn't talking to you.
I didn't tell you.

It's obviously very painful.
It's okay if some people think they're farmers.

"Three months have passed, and Tomi says he speaks French fluently." "Well, he's at the top of the dumb assistant." "What's the top?" "Dunning-Kruger effect."
Just three days.
It's on the other side of the park.
Sounds good.
It's over, isn't it?
It's over.
It's personal.
It's as if I'm throwing it out of a ditch.
He smashed his wings.
That's amazing.
That's pretty convincing.
It's pretty simple.
It is quite obvious that the aim of these misanthropic theories is manifested in the contempt of the working class, in the removal of imperialism from the responsibility of the bloody wars it provokes, and in the belief in the very essence of the thought of the infinity of human war.
Yes, it's urgent.
It's raining in my heart.
There are few large gardens in Japan.
It's real, isn't it?
That's a really big number.
He's downstairs.
It's a bad thing to ask someone how much they're looking for.
They say the Czech girls are beautiful.
They say they're leaving Tokyo soon.
Shit! Shit!
It's just disgusting.
It's snowing here.
It's snowing in Boston.
It's so good to stay home!
He's still moving.
It's suicide.
This is technically possible.
This is the best book I have ever read.
That's the least I can do.
Theoretically possible.
It's the same for everyone.
The same old problem.
That has yet to be answered.
It's time to take our tent.
It's time to get out of here.
It's time to go.
Time! Time!
Time to fix the problem.
I should have my hair cut off by now.
Time to rest.
It's time to tell the whole truth.
It's time to do something about it.
Today is Tom's birthday.
It's Tom's decision.
Tomi's word is against Mari's.
It's too dark for us to play.
It's expensive to me.
It's too hot for this now.
It's late.
It's too late to worry about this.
It is a typical autumn time.
It's a bad thing to have a cold.
It's ugly, shiny yellow and doesn't harmonize with anything. But at least they don't go out in the dark!
It's under the table.
Maybe he's not as stupid as you think.
It's not likely that anything serious will happen.
It's up to them now.
It's up to you whether we're going there or not.
It's very attractive.
It's very boring.
It's really cold in this room, isn't it?
It's very disturbing.
It's so fun.
It costs a lot to live here.
That's very kind of you.
It's very white.
It's hot.
That's what we agreed on.
This is your only chance.
To learn a language thoroughly, it takes about 10,000 hours of learning.
You have to have the courage to succeed.
It took me almost three years to build my house.

He understood everyone unexpectedly.
It took just an hour.
It took me a long time to write this book.
It took me more than a month to recover from the cold.
It took Tom a long time to choose a pair of shoes.
It took a long time, but in the end it was found.
I turned to a small alley.
I'm sorry.
I turn left.
It was a beautiful summer day.
It was a difficult time.
It was a friendly competition.
It was a mistake to do that.
It was a good party.
It was dark at night.
It was a real challenge.
That was a stupid question.
That was a stupid idea.
It was a tragic accident.
It was really good food.
It was just a waste of time for all of us.
It was terribly strange.
It was a wonderful day.
It was a wonderful night.
It was chaotic.
Clearly, it was very enjoyable.
We had a good time yesterday.
It was hard at first.
It was hopeless.
It was hot and wet.
It was hot, and the weather was humid.
It was just a kick-off.
It was just too easy.
I told you.
That's what I wanted.
It was almost eclipsed.
This was not long before John’s idea came up, and John always knew a way out of seemingly hopeless situations.
It wasn’t a very interesting novel.
It wasn't easy for me.
It was not easy to keep my promise.
It was a blow under the belt.
It wasn't interesting.
I wasn't the one who cut the door.
It wasn't my fault.
It wasn't intentional.
It wasn't our fault, trust me.
It wasn't so bad.
It wasn’t the first time they had done this.
It wasn't Tom.
It was just a joke.
It was only when I knew his true intention that I met him.
It doesn't hurt.
It rained last night.
It was kind of weird.
That was really interesting.
It was really quick.
It was really sad.
It was a success.
That was great.
That's all I could think of.
It was the worst pain I've ever experienced.
Tom followed.
They were kept completely secret.
He was unsure if he would marry her.
It was an emergency.
In a few days, it'll be over.
In a few days, it will all fall apart.
It'll be over in a few days.
It takes five or ten years for the technology to be completed.
It'll grow back.
That's what's gonna happen.
It'll rain for a week if it doesn't stop tomorrow.
This will threaten the well-being of the city.
We don't have to come back tomorrow.
You don't have to do that anymore.
It won't take long.
It worked beautifully.
It works perfectly with your iPhone.
That would be dangerous.
That would be different.
It's hard to get out of here.
That would be unreasonable.
It would have been better if it had been arranged.
It's not courage, it's stupidity.
It would have been better if we hadn't done it.
I underestimated Tom.
I got it.
I understand it's uncomfortable for you, but don't worry.
I know what you're talking about, but I don't know what you're talking about.
I understand what you're saying, but it doesn't work.
I understand your problem.

I've been coughing since morning.
I've been bad all week.
I helped Tom out.
I hid behind the fence.

He's finally done.
I forgot his last name.
I have a wife and children.
I have mosquito bites, and they're very itchy.
My guitar's in the trunk of the car.
I've got savings.
I’m used to this climate.
I really wanted him.
I need to get up.
I've got to go.
I'm satisfied with Tom and Mary.
I'm satisfied with Tomi.
We had enough to eat.
I've heard everything.
I just cooked it, baked it and cleaned the kitchen.
I learned so much about Tom.
I've lost all my friends.
My appetite's gone.
I've lost my umbrella.
I've been through it all.
I never went fishing with you, did I?
I haven't been to Arizona yet, but I don't really know where he is.
I've never been to Paris.
I never demanded anything.

There's no reason not to believe him.
I have no reason not to believe him.
I don't have to.
I put the kids on the bus, and Mom's waiting for them in the village, at the bus stop.
I've been thinking again.
I saw it with my own eyes and heard it with my own ears.
I visited my father's grave.
I've wasted my money.
I've won admission to college, and now I have to learn like a winner.
I volunteered.

I warned Tom.
Be careful with him again and again.
I was just starting to work when the phone rang.
I was a butterfly in my dreams.
I was stunned in my dreams.
I was so proud to trust Tom.
I was afraid I'd never see him again.
I was afraid I'd never see her again.
I was alone.
I've missed you.
I've missed you.
I was already tired.
I worked as a miner for two years.
I was rich... and then I got married.
I was fine... and I got married.
I slept.
Tom's arrest surprised me just as much as you did.

I was at her yesterday.
I was at my mom's.
I've been to daddy's.
I was at my parents' house.
I was with one of my classmates.

I was born in 1977.
I was born on a farm.
I was born on a boat.
I was disappointed.
I'm confused.
I'm embarrassed by what he said.
He was fired after 20 years.
I had such a terrible rush that I pushed the bed for a week.
They forced me to sign the statement. I'm sorry.
I'm a little tired of myself.
I went to talk.
That's what I was about to do.
I was happy yesterday.
I had a lot of nightmares, so a friend of mine gave me a dream trap.
I was here, but you're not.
I was here at ten o'clock, but you didn't.
Wash my hands.
I was homeless last year.
I was hoping you might know.

I went to YouTube and didn’t do anything.
I was in Boston when this happened.
I was in Rome.
I was in the hospital for three weeks.
I was just in the mail.
I was just beginning to write a letter when I got home.
They're kidnapped.
I was late for the meeting because of the plug.
I just made a cake.
I was married at the time.
It started the story.
I was naive.
Almost got hit by a car.
I was fucking nervous.
I was nervous at first, but then gradually calmed down.
I was no longer needed.
I couldn't answer a single question on the test.
I wasn't born here, but I grew up here.
I wasn't kidding.
I wasn't ready for it then.
I didn't sleep.

I was worried you might be leaving.
I was sick, I stayed home all day.
I sang.
I was sitting in a chair at the patent office in Bern when I had a sudden idea: if a man falls free, he does not feel his own weight. That shocked me. It led me to this theory of gravitation.
I sat next to Tommy.
I couldn't speak.
I stood by her.
I was home then.
I stood in the plumber for thirty minutes in the afternoon.
I was surprised by what I found out.
I was surprised to find the door locked.
I was surprised to learn that Tom used to be a Frenchman.
They taught me to hit first and only then to ask.
I was the happiest person in the world.
I was the last person I saw him.
I was the only one who didn't laugh.
I was the only one who survived.
I've been there before to get a good place.
I was there last year.
I was thinking about you.
They were treated like a child.
I was trying to fall asleep.
I was very polite.
I've been through all my fears.
I went to the streets of London.
They warned me not to believe what Tom was saying.
I was at Tomival last night.

That's what I've been through.
I went to bed late that night.
I went to Boston by car.
I went to Canada.
I went to the square the night before.
I went without him.

I'll do anything for her.
I'll do my best.
I'll retaliate for this insult, you can be sure.

I wish I could fly.
Unless I can fly.
If I could fly!
I wish I could do it alone.
I wish I had a car.
I wish I had bought a ticket to the concert.
I wish I hadn't seen such a terrible movie.
I wish I could, too!
I wish I had studied harder when I was young.

I wish you weren't right, but I know you're right.
I wish you had done it early in the morning.
I wish you'd let Tom finish his story.
I wish you wouldn't.
I wish you wouldn't do that now.
I'm awake.
I'm tired of waking up.
I thought about what Tom wanted.
I was wondering if anyone else was as curious as I was.
I'm thinking about how I could do it even better.
I wonder how much it could cost.
I'm curious how this works.
Is the weather clear tomorrow?
Are you married?
Is there an easier way to do this?
Is there a man named Thomas here?
I wonder if Tom will be here tomorrow.
I wonder what happened to Paul.
What did the painter want to say?
I'm wondering if the sun or the moon is bigger.
I'm wondering if Tom can come or not.
Who's gonna put this in here?
Who could be responsible?
Why did you ask?
Why is that so expensive?
I want to know why Tomi didn't come to Mari's party.
I won!
I won't be home today at all.

I suggest you get to the airport on time.
If I were you, I'd ask him.
I'd be mad if I didn't say yes to him.
I'd be stupid to say no to him.
I’d be a lot more productive if I didn’t waste my time online.
They'd like.
I'd do it if I had more time.
I'd love to, but I don't have time.
