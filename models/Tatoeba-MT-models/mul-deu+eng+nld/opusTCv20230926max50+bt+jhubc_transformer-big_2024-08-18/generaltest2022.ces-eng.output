The great return of the Czech smelter is approaching.
Pavel Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois has been called to the NHL.
Czech hockey goalkeeper Pavel Francouz, who has been going through a difficult period of his career in recent months, is returning to the NHL.
The thirty-one-year-old Pilsen native will be on the alternator and could soon get to the gate.
The former goalkeeper of Lithuanians, Pilsen and Russian Chelyabinsk was injured in preparation for the NHL in October of this year.
It was exactly in the middle of the match with Vegas that he switched, and since then he has not performed in the NHL.
The incident occurred at the moment when an experienced goalkeeper moved from one bar to another.
“Paul Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois will be out for about three to four weeks with injuries to the lower part of the body,” Denver said in a statement.
His return to the NHL goal was eventually extended by more than two months.
On Sunday morning, he was called from a farm where he picked up four duels and showed his old form.
The AHL accounted for 94.5% of the interventions.
The Pilsen hockey keeper wants to finally make a move and confirm that he belongs in the best league in the world.
In his last year, he had problems with his hips and did not catch a single match in the shortened pandemic year.
In the NHL "Franc<0xC3><0xAD>k" picked up 36 matches, his success of operations is at the number of 92.3%.
Charles puts on Camille costume at Christmas wish, William and Kate pose in Jordan
Britain's Prince William and his wife Kate have chosen a family photo taken during their trip to Jordan as this year's Christmas wish.
His wishes were also made public by Prince Charles, who used a photograph on which his cottage Camille helped to put a costume on.
This was reported on the BBC's website by the BBC.
They send their wishes to friends, collaborators, and the foundations they work with.
The photo was taken somewhere in the desert landscape.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in long summer dresses in khaki color and Princess Charlotte is wearing the dress.
Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, and Prince George and Louis wear shorts and a collared shirt.
Who took the photo, William and Kate did not take it, it is not even clear when exactly it was created.
Last year, the royal family posed for a photo intended as a Christmas wish on a straw package in front of a pile of wood at its rural headquarters in Norfolk County.
The picture, which serves as a Christmas wish, also published the successor to the throne of Prince Charles with his wife Camilla.
Photographer Sam Hussein was captured in June at the Ascot sightings.
Charles, who has a cylinder on his head and a dress on his face, helps Camille put her dress in a color-matched dress.
According to efotbal.cz, Slavia promised Berbro a million for the title, Tvrd<0xC3><0xAD>k denied it.
Prague – The criminals in the current corruption case allegedly worked with the fact that the accused former vice president of the Football Association of the Czech Republic Roman Berbr should have had a million crowns promised from Prague Slavia for the league title in the 2018/19 season.
He informed the efotbal.cz server that he had reached part of the police files.
Jaroslav Tvrd<0xC3><0xAD>k, Chairman of the Board of Management of the Vr<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xAD>k Club, said that the June Whites did not allow any corruption negotiations.
The server has published a transcript of police interrogations, in which Slavia is mainly portrayed by its former sports director Jan Nezmar, who ended up in a championship club last summer.
The former influential official of the red and white was, according to the file, in frequent contact with both Berbre and the former sports director of the second-class Vy<0xC5><0xA1>ehrad Roman Rogoz, who is also among the defendants in the case.
The criminals allegedly worked with information that Slavia Berbro had promised a financial reward for winning the title.
In 2019, SK Slavia Praha won the first league title.
The police authority was informed that Roman (Berbr) is to have a million-dollar salary promised by SK Slavia Praha officials for winning the league, the server quoted from the file.
A day later, according to criminalists, Berbr met not only with Nezmar, but also with the chairman of the board of directors Slavie Tvrd<0xC3><0xAD>k.
According to the server, the file no longer reveals whether the police are still dealing with this information.
The plaintiff rejected any kind of corruption.
Between 2015 and 2017, we actively tried to change the conditions in Czech football and offered an opposing alternative to its development.
“We have never allowed illegal conduct, we have not tried to influence judges in violation of fair play rules, and we have not provided anyone with any financial fulfillment in this regard,” Tvrd<0xC3><0xAD>k said in a statement.
Among other things, Nezmar unintentionally insults some former players of Slavie’s dark skin and also mocks his former boss Tvrd<0xC3><0xAD>k.
The cause of the alleged influence of matches through referees was triggered in mid-October by police intervention at several locations, including the Prague headquarters of the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R.
The highest-ranked in the affair is the Berbr, which no longer fits in any of the football functions.
In mid-January, the former sports director of Vy<0xC5><0xA1>ehrad Rogoz was released from prison.
Helicopters, tanks and bvp are the larping of the Cold War.
The artillery will be new, but in principle of a worse type (the artillerymen must from the armored cab and carry the ammunition manually without cover).
Cars - Toyota hi-lux - are new and good
Trucks and various armored vehicles - at a decent level, in addition, already managed to get rid of Prague V3S even in specialized units.
Aircraft: combat- decent, but at the end of the rental, transport - very small with a short flight, but modern.
Drones - few and only small types without combat potential
Missiles - we do not have at all (but we manufacture and balance abroad)
PVO: medium - cold war, outdated; short-range - good, modern, relatively good number.
I have a story like that.
I've got a sledgehammer right next to town.
They got nutrients from the river and they did crops damage, so I was sitting there.
When I came, I saw that there was a fisherman on the bank of the river.
I didn't want to make a brothel, so I sat down and the guy probably didn't notice me.
I was hoping he would leave before something came out, but of course the fox was gone in a moment.
I let her come 40 yards before I decided to shoot.
The poor fisherman almost fucked himself, waved his head to all sides, so I called to him that it was on the fox.
Before I got out of my seat, it was a snitch.
I mean, a lazy man is a prusser.
On the other hand, it's not a war, it'd have to be a combination of a lot of coincidences to happen something, you'd probably be seen in the thermovisions that almost everyone has today.
So in a visible place, expensive things put your feet to the bedside table and you should be fine.

Internally, respirators are significantly cheaper than the Ministry of Health
The state, responsible for the purchase and distribution of clothing, masks and respirators for the profession closest to the coronavirus, has spent billions of dollars on their acquisition in recent weeks.
The iRozhlas server compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that within a single day, the amounts on the respirator varied by as much as hundreds of crowns.
Why did the prices go so dramatically?
What authorities have been doing economically?
And why did others buy groceries?
Lenka Kabrhelova talks to iRozhlas server editor Dominik Kubi<0xC5><0xA1>tova.
I appreciate the soldiers and armies (as if I am not affected by the memories of the <0xC4><0x8C>SLA, which passed through older generations), but the Czech Republic can not benefit from the compulsory military.
We don’t even have large warehouses of techniques that could be taken by training, we don’t actually have modern techniques even for existing professionals, plus modern techniques are increasingly complex, so the skills of backers will quickly be lost in time.
To do this, modern conventional conflicts, where anyone can put them, will play out very quickly, there will be no time to re-exercise someone.
Finally, the defenders/territorial defense are of great importance to countries such as Ukraine, where mass guerrillas are leading, and this is also a pronounced necessity to deter the enemy.
On the territory of the Czech Republic, the fight will only take place in a conflict of such magnitude and intensity, where the guerilla will no longer be irrelevant, and we do not have a suitable geography for this.
We don’t have individual skills.
That's not even the worst.
The worst part is that half of them play as if they had it.
Then there's a situation where you look at a guy who didn't hit an empty gate two minutes ago, walks into an attack alone between two or even three Swiss, and you're like, "Hey, what do you think is going to happen now?"
Of course, he is being treated like an average tax payer.
“The situation with this ability to lead a defender is so terrible that I’m caught up that I’m honestly surprised when I see that our attacker managed to defeat one player of the opponents.
The First Whales
The Covid pandemic is slowing down, but experts are not expecting a major turnaround in the coming weeks.
The strain in hospitals according to statistical models will last for some time, and a new unknown has been added to the pandemic equation: a variant of microns, which is very likely to spread faster than the current dominant Delta.
At the same time, it is not possible to say with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more serious course of action, to what extent vaccination or post-infectious immunity gained by previous passing of the disease helps against it.
But this week, an unexpected phenomenon on the side of the pluses has also entered the covid equation: the possibility of treatment.
A new drug, the antiviral drug molnupiravir, has arrived in the Czech Republic, which reduces the risk of a severe course of the disease and associated hospitalization by a third and can be treated at home.
And soon it should also be supplemented by the drug paxlovid from Pfizer, which from the results so far reports success even 85%.
The first deliveries of molnupiravirus to the Czech Republic, however, in addition to the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, also highlighted the question of how the local administration is ready for incoming medicines.
As mentioned, the first to be given to domestic patients is molnupiravir by Merck.
The company ended up on the strip first and because the drug began to develop long before the current pandemic erupted in order to find the right treatment for viral horse disease on the South American continent.
This research often ignores the fact that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
In general, they are less open and do not openly share their views.
That is why Eastern Europeans, and especially we Czechs, are used to talking "how our tooth grew".
See, you'll do research where you ask people if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, most people will tell you no.
In the West, they will tell you how they like migration, how everyone should help them, and how we Czechs are racist shit.
And then they go and vote for parties like the AfD.
He's afraid of cancelling culture, saying this in public means losing his job and media lynching.
Then it looks nice in the surveys, the west good, the east bad.
But they'll really find out what people think.
It is only in France, Le Pen and Zemmour, both have more than 20% according to the survey.
We even know that the objects are three and completely identical in Czech.
Identical due to the rotation of the units, so that the soldiers do not have to relearn where what is, then all objects on the hair are the same.
One is the Atom Museum of Brda and the other two are abandoned.
The funny thing is that SSSR did not want to have a nuclear warhead on its own territory either because of the safety or the speed of deployment of warheads due to the western position.
In these underground shells (there are two in each apple) only the heads were kept, not the entire rocket as they say.
If it was necessary to deploy this weapon, a special unit arrived, which picked up this head and mounted it on some carrying device.
In addition to the museum maple, the remaining ones are in a desolate state.
In the second grade of elementary school we had a fellow Gypsy, 4 years we were with him.
He was pretty good, he was making good jokes, he often showed up too much, but it was our mascot.
Everyone was having fun with him, he used to go out often and he wanted to explain something, he was missing a little, he went out regularly, he was engaged in sports with us, he didn’t steal snacks, he didn’t steal phones, he walked cleanly dressed.
He also went to school in the wild, made various ape stores, but he was fine, maybe never a breakthrough.
In the eighth or ninth grade, siblings, gypsies entered the same school year, other classes.
Shortly thereafter, they beat up a teacher, often dealt with something by the police, threatened and threatened other students..
Personally, I sometimes sell something for advertising (old stuff, something I don’t need, etc.) and I have sold often to Gypsies, money always had, did not try any attempts to pull me on the price, communication in peace.
I even sold a car like that, the guy called a month ago that he had already rewritten it on himself..
I say of myself that I am not a racist, I don’t care if someone is white, black, yellow, blue or other, as long as they behave as they belong in decent society (work, work, women don’t run, just ordinary behavior).
But when someone comes in, stretches out his hand, moves out apartments and houses, has a mess around him, makes trouble... so no matter what color he has, I'm gonna mind.
I have no problem with African migrants, if they get involved with us, start doing business, work, learn a language (not necessarily, at least English), respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, I don’t care as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I’ll be there for them.
A young woman died in a car accident in Prachatick
“The young woman suffered many serious injuries and, despite resuscitation care, unfortunately, she suffered injuries on the spot,” Zuzana Fajtlov<0xC3><0xA1>, a spokeswoman for South Bohemian health rescuers, told Prava.
The accident was probably caused by the driver who took the girl.
The eighteen-year-old Peugeot driver probably drove in the direction from <0xC5><0xBD>i<0xC4><0x8D>ovec to Bavorov and, for reasons not yet known, drove in a curve to the opposite direction.
After the collision with <0xC5><0xA0>koda Octavia, the Peugeot vehicle ended on the roof off the road, South Bohemia police spokeswoman <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>p<0xC3><0xA1>nka Schwarzov<0xC3><0xA1> described the accident.
The young Peugeot driver suffered a very serious injury in the accident.
It was a lot of injuries and he was stuck in the car.
After his release, he had to be provided with emergency pre-hospital care and was transported by air to <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xA1> Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jov<0xC3><0xA1> hospital in a stable state, Fajtlov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
She added that the man from the second car suffered a minor chest injury and was taken to the hospital.
New rules apply to parcels from countries outside the EU, customers often do not provide data about them
Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
It's mostly collecting cards.
“Usually it can be tens of dollars, let’s say from ten dollars above, where it’s still worth importing, especially from Japan, where mail is often free,” the collector said.
Since October, his order for small consignments has been slightly delayed, he has to add VAT and hand over the data to the customs procedure.
He will receive an e-mail with the message that the customs officers are expecting the arrival of the package.
Then just fill in the data of the shipment, and if VAT has not already been included by the trader at the time of sale, the customs office will calculate it from the total amount for the shipment and for transport.
If the addressee is not insured by the customs procedure himself, the total amount must also be added to the remuneration of the carrier.
According to Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Neuheisl, however, the whole process is not complicated.
I'll click one or two checkboxes, insert two attachments, and I'm done.
For me, it’s usually a five-minute question, Neuheisl says.
Not all shipments can be delivered smoothly.
Due to the new customs rules, the daily number of shipments received from abroad has fallen from 60,000 to 15,000 at the international post office in Prague.
According to the Czech Post, the problem is also that people do not respond to the requests to provide the data needed to complete the customs procedure.
There are currently 30,000 parcels in the international mail that we need to process.
If people had filled in all the data they needed, and they would have filled them in time, we would have been here about halfway there, says Maty<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Vit<0xC3><0xAD>k, a spokesman for the Czech Post.
Solutions for Inflation
See the title, how would you propose a solution to current inflation?
We are currently at 9.9% inflation and are expecting its further growth.
What do you think the state should do to slow down or compensate for this growth?
We see, for example, a reduction in the VAT on food and PHM in Poland, is this the way for you?
What do you think will happen that is inevitable with where it rushes?
Prices are rising faster than wages, and I think it’s inevitable that people won’t be able to afford ordinary things, especially energy.
How much do you need to add (who is an employee)?
They added 2% to me this year in gross, which is ridiculous, but fortunately I have a similar income from the business that I run when I work.
Would anyone be able to explain to me why evidence of rape is being sent over the grid for six months, perhaps?
This just doesn't take my head how the court can only send a 6-month-old animal behind bars just to do it again as soon as it gets out.
6 months is nothing compared to the fact that his/her victim will have trauma for several years, it will negatively affect her sexual relations and relationships overall.
Not to mention the fact that the victim of rape never has to recover from it.
Doesn't this also mitigate potential future reports of rape of victims?
Man from the Tomb "burned" his girlfriend from Kostomlat
A man from the Tomb inadvertently helped the guards secure his nationally sought girlfriend from Kostomlat, on whom an arrest warrant was issued.
He called them to him himself.
He went to the roundabout.
At first, he approached the passerby and invented a story that he had been robbed.
After calling the emergency line, the guards arrived at the scene and were not surprised when the alleged "stealer" told them that he had invented everything to get the guards to the scene.
In fact, he just wanted to advise the guards how to report to the Police of the Czech Republic.
When checking the identity of the man and his girlfriend, the guards then found that the woman was on the list of wanted persons, in the national search, and she was issued with an arrest warrant.
The case is therefore resolved by the PRC.
An honest question for the people here, do you consider our country to be Slavic?
I personally believe that we are no longer ethnically or culturally veiled, but I would be interested in your opinion.
Otherwise I agree with the meme, of course, it is a shame that Churchill was not able to secure the liberation of the United States of America :')
Of course, I do not deny that we have a Slavic language.
Well, I don’t know, the question is whether a rational person can really believe something completely without evidence just because it could potentially benefit.
I would not consider such a case to be a true faith.
I can't agree with Pascal here, there's an estimate in the world, if I'm not mistaken, about ten thousand different religions.
Which god or god should a person choose?
I would say that it is quite probable that in one of those thousands of religions there is at least one god who will awkwardly punish you if you believe in another god.
But even in the desert it says that there is no god but Yahweh.
Wouldn’t it be more rational, then, to refrain from believing in any god than to risk choosing out of the thousands of gods wrongly, and the one true god that I have not just encountered will send me to hell or some place like that?
Other: Voluntary training with subsequent inclusion in reserves.
The Swiss model is similar, I guess.
X months of training (in different specializations, X months for one) and under the command of professionals with practical experience.
If you do well, you can get a professional offer.
All the components of the ACR would benefit from something like this.
This could be done in cooperation with the University of Defense.
We can talk like this: The cooperation between the education sector and industry is constantly diminishing, companies hunt in schools, and there is some sort of divergence when the workforce migrates from educational institutions to working conditions.
Not only during adolescence, but this process is ongoing, each of us is constantly learning something new, going from one field to another, etc.
A similar intersection should also work between the civil and military sectors.
I also see this as a way of building a relationship between the citizen and the army, that is, an institution that guarantees that Russia, Germany, or perhaps the Mongol invader will never come here again.
I find it funny how you consider NATO to be something carved in stone, we have allies, and so they will defend us if it comes across.
Well, please, sir.
All it takes is one election in the United States that will smash their budget and the whole of NATO goes to hell.
The British will exchange us for Russian money, the Germans will exchange us for Russian gas, and the Poles have already shown themselves to show them their backs and take what they want.
The only thing that has long functioned as a guarantor of independence is the armed army and the population who can control the military technique of their time.
And today he can pilot remotely controlled means for every teenager, no matter what.
We don't need border fortification, it's bullshit today, but the teen's cunt behind a remote-controlled device can handle it.
How not to drown in a box tsunami
Are you packing gifts under a Christmas tree and suddenly you are at home packed with boxes and fillings?
This “waste” is again used by e-shops that lack packaging materials.
Therefore, a map of the stores that will welcome your used boxes has been created.
And it's not just about Christmas.
All of the packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated manipulation.
Therefore, it is a pity to treat them as disposable waste.
Anyone can, by agreement, bring in a cardboard box, plastic or paper filler (the map of the project KAMsNIM.cz contains almost 150).
This will support small businesses, reduce the amount of waste generated, and also avoid crowded blue containers.
The shops themselves welcome packaging, which is currently lacking in the market and also saved money, as the packaging carton has increased by 50% over the last period.
In the eyes of environmentally conscious customers, I am also reinforcing my brand.
One such store is also TIERRA VERDE, manufacturer of eco drugstores and eco cosmetics.
Boxes and fillers are transported to Pop<0xC5><0xAF>vek near Brno by individuals who collect at home, but we also hear from companies with whom we have arranged regular shipments of deposited cartons.
We will use everything when packing shipments from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies, we create a more considerate world together.
Our desire is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature for future generations, says Petra Lopu<0xC5><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xAD>kov<0xC3><0xA1> from Tierra.
However, the application www.KAMsNIM.cz does not only show pick-up points on the packaging material.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (where to take sorted waste from home, where to hand over past medicines, tires, power supplies, batteries, light sources, large-volume waste, etc.).
All the waste can end up in the right place, and reusable items will find their second home.
The total map of the project already contains more than 100,000 such places.
“There are gradually increasing collection yards, re-use centres, textile containers, food banks, charities, SWAPs and other places that help to find use for things that would otherwise become unnecessary waste,” adds <0xC4><0x8C>eku<0xC5><0xAF>cek <0xC4><0x8C>ekulika.
Rather, it seems to me that nowadays the technique is so simple and foolproof that children who use a computer or phone play games on it, but do not learn basic computer skills.
Recently, there was a problem (mainly in English articles) that college students do not understand the principle of folders on the computer.
Because, for example, Google Photos or Apple photo apps or actually mobile phones generally simply hide that underlying filesystem with folders, and it all sticks to one screen in the app.
Let them use the technique from childhood, but above all let them learn something.
I'll rewrite history, seriously.
Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of the French Presidency of the European Union before the weekend – starting in January – and it was spectacular.
Macron spoke for over an hour during which he unveiled the Presidency logo, called for the protection of Europeans – at work, on the street – and mentioned so many events that they could not be reached in six months.
French politicians like it, and voters like it, too.
Macron’s supporters of the right-to-left intersection agree on a few points, but in Europe they do.
And in France, there will be new elections of the head of state in April.
The election calendar has also affected the priorities themselves.
The French leader mentioned, among other things, that historians should write “one history of Europe” and France is ready to create conditions for such work of historians.
A number of commentators immediately acceded with criticism that Macron was talking about pro-European propaganda and rewriting history.
In fact, this is more of a rewrite of history.
The far-right candidate for French President, <0xC3><0x89>ric Zemmour, is now circumventing France with the thesis that the Vichy regime, which collaborated with Hitler during World War II, was not so bad, and is quite successful with the French.
Let's try to take Macron's idea of a history textbook seriously, and let's not look at what's going on in France.
Wouldn't it be necessary?
Students in European countries learn history as a story we versus them and never as a story as a whole.
The Spaniards, the French, the Czechs find out who defeated who in which battle.
But if they don’t have an enlightened cantor, they won’t know what the wider context of the event was.
The movie of the year is Quo Vadis, Aida?
The Czech "Mouse" did not win.
The story, which returns to the Srebrenica massacre of 1995, has also received an award for director and best actress Jasna Duri<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x8D>ova.
At this year’s Karlovy Vary festival, he held on to the first crosses of the spectator rank.
The best actor in Berlin was Anthony Hopkins for the film Father.
I'm not too young, I'm not too healthy/fit and I'm not vaccinated.
It was kind of like "having the flu/ being suffocated" A couple of days I had diarrhea and didn't feel like smoking...
Compared to the common flu, it was worse.
I don't have diarrhea with the flu.
(Only personal experience. I do not claim that everyone has that)

Another portion of observing the world and describing everyday things with unusual poetic perceptiveness, depth and atmosphere.
In his second prose, photographer <0xC5><0xA0>est<0xC3><0xA1>k tried to capture the essence of the small town and Czech society.
A tale of a return to the roots, which turns out to be just a long-awaited illusion.
A bohemist and comparator tells the tale of the Red Cartilage behind the scenes of the present village.
Her portrayal of brutality transcends popular versions and graduates into a horror of emotional emptiness.
And the fact that the way back to instincts is shorter than one is willing to admit.
The author tells a much less sentimental story about the return from emigration than we’re used to listening to.
Those who remain, and those who have left, know too little about themselves to spend it on a common life.
Trains are starting to ride according to new timetable, somewhere the carriers will change
From Sunday, trains will start to ride on the railway according to the new schedule.
The biggest change is the exchange of carriers on some routes, for example between <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem and Cologne, where RegioJet begins to ride instead of Czech roads.
For most lines, only the time of departure, or slightly their route, will be adjusted.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the trains.
With the sale of tickets, the carriers started already in the autumn.
In the new schedule, the Czech Railways plan to report an average of 6783 passenger transport connections per day, of which an average of 478 long-distance trains will be per day.
Trains will travel approximately 118 million kilometres during the new timetable.
In addition to the national connections within the new timetable, the trains will also travel to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
Together with the new schedule, the company will deploy dozens of new trains.
The main news will be InterJet trains, which will run on the lines from Prague to Cheb.
Further new trains will be carried out by the carrier in northern Moravia or in western Bohemia.
The carrier will also traditionally increase the price of the ride from next year, on average by 3.2 percent.
The dredgers take inflation into account in their tariffs each year.
The biggest change in the schedule of RegioJet is the entrance to the line R23 <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem – M<0xC4><0x9B>ln<0xC3><0xAD>k – Nymburk – Cologne.
The carrier here will replace the Czech Railways after the success in the competition of the Ministry of Transport.
A total of 16 connections, eight in each direction, will be performed by RegioJet on a daily basis.
Further changes relate to long-distance connections between Prague and Brno, which will also stop from Sunday at Havl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v Brod, <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>r nad S<0xC3><0xA1>zavou and Cologne stations.
Leo Express has maintained its 16 connections, two return connections to Slovakia and also weekend connections to Krak<0xC3><0xB3>w.
According to the spokesman Emil Sedla<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k, the carrier tried to maintain as much as possible the travel times of its long-distance trains, despite the planned excavation work.
Without major changes, the Arriva trains and other carriers should continue to operate.
The carrier will also be switched on some regional routes.
Changes await passengers, for example, in <0xC4><0x8C>eskolipsk, where on the route from Mlad<0xC3><0xA1> Boleslav via Czech Lipa to Rumburk, instead of Czech roads, Trilex trains of the German company Die Länderbahn will ride.
For the second year, passengers will also be able to use a single rail ticket.
As with Czech roads, their price will increase by inflation by 3.2 percent.
I must disagree.
Shouldn’t we learn from the other side?
Everywhere we hear how much they had to fight for their rights, how much they had to fight for their rights, how they had to fight and die.
I've never heard a lesson in my life from the point of view of the slave party or from that time, no one's defending this, just condemning it.
No one will tell you in schools that blacks often sold blacks themselves into slavery and that they were often the worst slaves.
No one in school teaches you that colonizers often bought land from the Indians, everywhere they tell you just how brutally we Europeans murdered them, killing each other a long time ago.
I also spent some time in the U.S., directly in schools, both in the northern and southern schools.
I didn’t meet with someone intentionally silence the facts, but I’ve heard before that it’s happening and I don’t deny it (in Japan, WW2 atrocities are quite taboo).
My point was rather that history is not black and white and that we tend to look at it from today’s point of view, without understanding.
History doesn’t care about someone’s feelings, it’s just what it is, and I think it’s a fatal mistake to condemn without looking at the thing of that time.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never repeat this.
By the way, now that we're in those southern states, yes, the Confederate flag and the famous slaves there are quite popular, on the other hand, they should have had some of their good successes, and it seemed absurd to me to reject them.
In addition, the North has not been much better, as many people today idealize it.
And a lot of people also forget that not everyone in the South was a slave, and a lot of things were against them.
I wouldn’t compare this with the Russians, they deliberately omit some facts, they lie and manipulate, plus maybe our view of them doesn’t exist (on YT there was also a video from the TV, where they kicked someone who started talking about our legionnaires and 1968).
What I found ridiculous in US schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something their country has never experienced.
All in all, I thought it was shocking in some universities, these students were pretty radicalized, and the schools were backing them on how many times.
And if I imagine that these people will be a lot older once, I feel a little sick that this could be the voice of the majority, because there are young people and even in the ruling elite.
It seems to me that feminism has achieved what it had long ago and it is no longer the same, it has become radicalized.
Today, feminists are referred to as those who have nothing to do with it and ignore the basic biological fact, as well as other groups like LGBT, and this leads to radicalization even on the opposite side, where it often leads to resistance even in quite reasonable things.
Moreover, the more radical someone is, the more they hear him.
In any case, I also did not come across the fact that someone would condemn me for colonialism or slavery.
I've seen a lot of bad geography, but it's both sides. :D
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's completely pointless.
Am I supposed to be proud of something I couldn't do on my own?
In addition, the concept of nationality as a whole, I consider it unnecessary in terms of some personal identity.
If something with people connects me with interests, worldviews and shared experiences, not the place where we were born.
I am not a believer, but from what I know, I can tell you this: We have two Greek Catholic parishes here, one is Ukrainian and the other is Slovak.
The Slovak parish priest is a very nice guy, he has a sermon about theology rather than politics, but then he always fucks some shit about the coronavirus that everyone is ashamed of.
Then, of course, the Czechoslovak Hussite Church is here.
Officially, they are Protestants, but in fact they were born of Catholic modernity and are in fact Catholic without a pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholics, but they go to services to the Hussites, because it is theologically very similar, but the members are mostly more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist temple on Botanic Street.
Otherwise, the church of St. Michael in Dominican Square belongs to the Dominicans and even there every Sunday at 15:00 they do Mass in Latin, as was done before Vatican II.
Platinum from Bethlehem is in the Czech Republic, scouts took it from Austria
B<0xC5><0x99>eclav – The flame burned in Bethlehem, where, according to Christian tradition, Jesus Christ was born, is in the Czech Republic.
Unfortunately for him because of the coronavirus pandemic, even this time they did not go to Vienna, in the morning they took him from their Austrian colleagues at the border crossing Reintal – B<0xC5><0x99>eclav.
It was taken over at the border last year.
The light of Bethlehem is a beautiful Christmas tradition, which we participate every year with the department, I look forward to it.
It is an honor for me to have been selected, said Scout Am<0xC3><0xA1>lia Bud<0xC3><0xAD>kov<0xC3><0xA1> to the journalists present.
While last year the transfer took place at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, right at the border bridge, now at the Reintal-B<0xC5><0x99>eclav border crossing at the parking lot.
For him, scouts usually travel by train to Vienna.
There is no change in the distribution of flame throughout the Czech Republic.
With the light of Bethlehem, scouts traditionally took the train to Brno first, where they handed it over to the diocesan bishop Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch Cikrlem.
On Saturday, December 18, Scout couriers will take care of the subsequent delivery of light, which will travel by selected speedboats and personal trains.
From them, local scouts or volunteers will take over the light at the stations, who will then continue to spread the flames in the Czech Republic and where the trains do not lead.
This year, scouts must comply with the current measures against the spread of the coronavirus.
It's the same as last year.
We give recommendations to both the courier teams and the organizers of the local events, so that of course they wear costumes, try to observe the intervals, it was as little as possible, not singing to colleagues, just behaving in a way that was as safe as possible, described the spokesperson of the event of the Bethlehem light Hzana Zuzana.
The tradition of the Bethlehem Light, which travels through Europe, was born in 1986 in Austria.
The goal is to spread at the same time the idea of peace, friendship and peace.
The light of Bethlehem is for the believer a symbol of hope, a light that transcends darkness.
In the Czech Republic, scouts and scouts have been taking care of its spread for more than 30 years.
The event is attended by hundreds of volunteers, and the flame is also a symbol of impartiality and human reciprocity.
All the latest news, including a list of places where people can come for flames, can be found on the website www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I don't have economic education, so I don't know the basics of the economy that confirm that the grants are the cancer of the economy, but I don't think the grant as a whole would be a problem.
The development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water retention), health and education are making good use of the money, but I do not understand why the money is being given to agriculture, industry and companies as a whole.
As mentioned - a superfluous product is produced and it breaks the free market and the "natural life of the company".
I myself work in a factory where in the hallways a million hangers "xy funded / co-financed by project xy" and such a company is simply artificially kept alive.
This is not the support of a company that gives x work to people, this is the slowing down of development when this company is both holding on and recruiting contracts/employees to companies that could grow and be more productive after its demise
Totally agree, it's terrible.
Sometimes even a person who was born in the internet age gets caught up in some trick or trap - especially advertising.
I myself think that internet ads don’t work with me, but then I still insist that they have influenced me too – it’s just so far-fetched that people don’t always get rid of it.
That is why I support the radical votes in the European Parliament, which are currently seeking to give a complete ban on programmatic (<0x3D> targeted) advertisements...
It's all bullshit, in the words of the classic - I'd ban those internets.
I feel this virus has its roots in (but mostly in point 1):
“I won’t believe something that most people believe and make sense, I’m not a sheep, but I’d rather believe something that’s less likely, doesn’t make much sense, but it’s important that I have my own original opinion that I’m going to argue is a critical thought.”
“I won’t believe everything the media says.”
“I don’t believe in politicians.”
Televisions have failed the trend of Christmas movies, the premiere of them is two hundred this year
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - China, television stations and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have plunged the trend of Christmas movies and this year it will premiere more than two hundred of them.
This was calculated by the IMDb movie database operator.
In recent years, the genre of family and romantic Christmas movies has been scoring and significantly increasing the audience’s visibility, which is why these images are becoming more and more popular.
This year, there were four times more Christmas movies than in 2011 and twice as many as five years ago.
The IMDb database included only those images that have the word Christmas in their name, so there will be a lot more holiday movies in the real world.
Films that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic there are especially fairy tales associated with this period, worldwide there are also pictures of S<0xC3><0xA1>m doma, Love Heaven or the classic Christmas story Life is beautiful from 1946.
The real boom in the Christmas scenes, however, only started in 2009, when the US cable television station Hallmark launched a special film series, the BBC reported.
Her advent project, Countdown to Christmas, included four films at the time, and was very successful.
This year, the station started to chill its viewers on Christmas already on October 22 and presents a total of 42 Christmas pictures.
This year, Lifetime has 35 new Christmas-themed movies on the program, and the total number of popular streaming platforms such as Netflix is also contributing.
“In this magical period, the story doesn’t matter as much, the important thing is that there are a lot of Christmas trees in the background and it’s snowing,” said Brandon Gray, the author of a book about Christmas movies called I’ll Be Home for Christmas Movies.
“For viewers, it’s a form of escape and a way to feel a little quiet for at least two hours amid all the festive insanity and insanity of the world we’ve been living in for the last couple of years,” Gray said.
According to him, for example, Hallmark TV still uses the same recipe for his films, which is uniform but successful.
You have two people who fall in love with each other, but then there will be some misunderstanding about half an hour before the end, which, of course, seems to resolve and the two will kiss.
This is the way it is all around, and as long as all the movies look the same and have a similar atmosphere, people are watching one after the other, Gray adds.

Only nineteen riders will enter the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in Formula One.
Nikita Mazepin had a positive test for COVID-19 and will not be in the final race of the season.
The state of Haas will only send one formula to the track.
In the last race of the season, he was to attack on a better place from the 20th cross, which he made in qualifying.
However, the Russian Nikita Mazepin from the Haas stable will not eventually reach the Grand Prix Abu Dhabi.
He was tested positive for Covid-19.
At the start of the race, only nineteen cars will appear, from the last pass, Mazepin's teammate Mick Schumacher, from the first Max Verstappen, who will fight Lewis Hamilton in the direct battle for the title.
Mazepin, as stated by the Haas stable, is fairly well and shows no symptoms.
Nikita is physically fine because he was asymptomatic.
She is now in isolation and will follow the guidelines of the competent public health authorities, and safety will be a final priority for all stakeholders," her representatives told formula1.com.
He won't send a replacement rider to the Haas race, and he can't.
Any substitute would have to complete a qualification or drive in another part of the weekend.
Covid-19 does not affect the first racer.
Kimi Räikkönen had COVID-19 at the start of the season, last year Sergio Pérez was tested positive by Lewis Hamilton.

Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: The price tag of the most expensive sweater will impress!
It's kind of like portable jewelry, and the creator put half a year of work and all his savings into it.
“I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but with little experience at home, sweaters were never worn very much,” says Lebanon, who spent over 3,000 hours in half a year.
Silk bought in Italy, 24 carat gold thread in France and 2,000 ornamental crystals supplied by Swarowski.
The silver stars were decorated with 150 diamonds.
“The foundation is wool and cotton, but silk adds softness to the sweater,” praises the creator of his work, which, of course, does not recommend washing.
And he's got another hook.
“I’m on the verge of losing weight, I have to sell my sweater as quickly as possible,” Lebanon admits.
If he succeeds, he will set a world record.
The most expensive sweater to date, sold five years ago, cost “only” 720,000 kroner.

The government approved the deployment of up to 150 troops to help Poland.
Scouts, explorers and drone pilots could leave before Christmas, the mission is approved for six months.
They are to help Polish colleagues with the protection of the border with Belarus and with the construction of the planned fence.
Poland has officially requested assistance from NATO states in connection with the several-month-long actions of the Belarusian regime, which calls on citizens of the Middle East countries to its territory with a false promise of easy crossing of the EU border.
British and Estonian troops are already operating on Polish territory.
Is the mutation Omicron spreading in southern Moravia?
Hygiene is investigating another case of a child from Adam.
“We are currently reporting further suspicions of this variant in another child from Adamov, from the preparatory class.
Direct contact with previous cases from Z<0xC5><0xA0> Adamov University has not been proven," Ciupek said.
Six cases were reported in the province in a week.
“We are still waiting for the official confirmation of the variant in our six cases – it is carried out by the National Reference Laboratory for Influenza and Non-Influenza Viruses of the State Institute of Health in Prague,” said the director.
She added that they are two nurses from one place of work of the Faculty Hospital Brno and two children one of them, two eleven-year-old students of the University of Brno Adamov.
There is no connection between the cases of Brno and Adam.
Three of them have mild symptoms, according to the director, four have no sign of progression.
No one with suspicion of Omicron has traveled abroad
None of the above have traveled abroad, nor have any of their families, nor have they come into contact with anyone who has been abroad.
The connection with the championship in the water polo is none of the above, Ciupek said.
The head hygienist Pavla Svr<0xC4><0x8D>inov<0xC3><0xA1> said earlier that an international tournament in the water pole, which was in Brno a few weeks ago, is being examined.

California is limiting the sale of weapons.
He wants to act like Texas in banning abortions.
California Governor Gavin Newsom on Saturday announced a plan to ban the sale and manufacture of certain weapons in the most populous U.S. state using a legal mechanism that Texas used in its controversial anti-abortion law following the detection of an embryo’s heartbeat.
People should then be entitled to compensation in the case of anyone who manufactures or sells assault rifles and home-made firearms in California.
Newsom’s announcement responded to Friday’s U.S. Supreme Court ruling that the Texas abortion ban remained in effect, despite a nearly 50-year-old precedent ruling that set the right to abortion in the U.S. by about the 24th month of pregnancy.
However, the court did not now rule on the constitutionality of the entire law, but rather on the technical issue arising from the innovative design of the measure.
In this case, the enforcement of the ban was transferred to the public, thus making it impossible for the Texas Republicans to challenge it by the usual court.
“I am outraged by yesterday’s decision by the U.S. Supreme Court, which allowed the Texas ban on most abortion services to be maintained and largely supported the Texas maneuver to protect its law,” the California governor said in a statement.
“If states can now block the review of their laws by federal courts, then California will use that power to protect human lives,” Newsom continued.
He said his subordinates were tasked with working in cooperation with the State Parliament and the Minister of Justice on measures that would empower the public to enforce the ban on assault rifles and so-called ghost weapons.
This is how household-made weapons are labeled, which do not have serial numbers and can be used to circumvent regulations.
Newsom wants “poor citizens” to have the right to demand compensation of at least $10,000 (more than CZK 220,000) and court fees from anyone who manufactures, distributes or sells assault rifles, components for “weapons of their spirits” in California.
“If the most effective way to keep these horrific weapons off our streets is to create a threat of private lawsuits, then that’s exactly what we should do,” the California governor said.
The AP notes that California has banned the production and sale of some military-style weapons for decades, but in June the federal judge blocked the ban as unconstitutional.
While the state would now actually renew the ban using the Texas template, the words of the Liberal Supreme Court member Sonia Sotomayor, who warned in a dissenting opinion on Friday’s majority verdict against the extension of the state’s legal mechanism to other legal mechanisms, would be confirmed.
However, the Texas Supreme Court did not grant full immunity from the court review and allowed abortion clinics to pursue lawsuits against selected agents in the southern U.S. state.
Each emergency vaccination has its own public testing phase, where it gradually comes to what the vaccination scheme will look like and there is also an improvement of the vaccines themselves, based on the results.
Israel, for example, is already in a major wave of studies on the effects of 4 doses.
And according to these studies, most patients have up to a five-fold increase in antibodies, which already has the long-term effect you mentioned.
Just like any other vaccination will have its own vaccination schedule over time, only it’s too soon for that.
Another fact is that soon a new vaccine, based on an inactivated virus, should come on the market, which according to the manufacturer's specifications promises up to 10x greater effectiveness.

Poland Threatens to Stop Payments to EU Budget
According to Ziobra, the European Commission would act against the law if it took advantage of new powers and stopped paying money to Poland because of the rule of law dispute.
The Commission has already postponed the approval of the Polish plan to draw <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>36 billion from the EU fund for the recovery of economies affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
And it is under pressure from the European Parliament to move forward and use a mechanism to withdraw EU subsidies to countries that violate the rule of law.
"Poland should respond to this EU blackmail on all issues that require unanimity," said Ziobro, the head of the small Solidarity Poland party, without which the current government would lose a narrow majority in the Sejm.
"Poland should also consider its commitments in the EU's energy and climate policy, which lead to a drastic increase in energy prices," Ziobro added.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland stop its contributions to the EU.
This would be justifiable given the fact that the EU is illegally denying us the funds from the common budget, to which we are also contributing, the Polish minister added.
His party is more radical in its approach to the EU than the ruling party Law and Justice.
According to the European Commission, the changes that Polish justice has undergone during Ziobro's actions threaten its independence and subject it to politicians.
According to Ziobra, Brussels is creating “impossible conditions, because its goal is not the rule of law, but the change of government in Poland.”
Warsaw is facing a “political dictatorship carried out by blackmail and an effort to undermine the democratic decision of several million Poles,” Ziobro said.
He said Poland should be a member of an EU that is based on a partnership of sovereign states, and not on the government of the strongest and Brussels bureaucracy that is not under democratic control.
He said that his party would never agree to such concessions to Brussels, which would limit Poland’s sovereignty.
“We will never agree that Poland has the status of a colony,” he said.
But to be honest, at Lidl, we have one type of cheese in four different places.
I didn’t look at the other things, I also met one yogurt several times, I just needed cheese, parmesan, after ten minutes at the dairy shelves I gave up and asked.
They had it, it's true, in that narrow sector they were all selected, less common and special cheeses, but it was between the vegetable and the lactose-free zone...
If there is avoidance, no more scent to any market, no action, no gold yard in the square, there may not have such a choice, but usually they have everything I need and it has some sort of order, so I'm done in ten minutes.
I'm going to Lidl to take a vacation.

When I was a child, I was punished with a whip.
It was never because of signs, it was usually just that I repeatedly refused to listen and got angry (read instead of going to sleep, washed with my brother, etc.).
At the same time, I was never punished without warning, my mother always first threatened that if I did it again, I would get an injury (sometimes even after the next "attachment" she only brought and laid it so that I could see it).
It was only after I repeatedly refused to listen that I got a few blows to my butt (through clothes).
Personally, I think that physical punishments (in a reasonable way and to a reasonable extent) are beneficial because the child reacts to them much more than words.
I think the part with the warning is important, because it gives the child in its own way the choice of not to obey and get, or get better and there will be no punishment.
At the end of the day, all I needed was a warning to start listening.
Defending the system
When a prominent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch Cepl in 1999 answered a journalistic question, what does the Czech Constitution mean to him – whether the sacred charter on which he swears and on which he relinquishes his first lessons at school, or, conversely, an agreement that can be changed in the case
We once agreed in the Constitution on the democratic rules of our lives, which at the same time define who we are as a state and its citizens, and with changes it is better to save.
And imagine: some nations even like to have their own rules.
Just as the Czechs love pork chops and cabbage, Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch Cepl voted at the time.
Recently, however, the opinion among lawyers is increasingly emerging that the Constitution of the Czech Republic needs to change.
The years are tested by situations that its creators (to which Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch Cepl belonged) could not foresee, such as the behavior of a directly elected president.
But in one thing, Cepl was right.
Everything we know about such documents shows that political interventions in their texts must be thoughtful.
The Constitution needs to be understood and actively defended, only then can it be the key to coping with most of the crises that societies face throughout history.
The Constitution is, among other things, a kind of governance order consisting of individual rules that determine the politicians mantinely of the game.
We are afraid that power will be abused against minorities or individuals, so we are tying up policies to bans.
At the same time, the constitutional texts also allow politicians to have their power.
Covid does not choose, in FN Brno fight for the life of a several-month-old baby
Although it is known that the coronavirus is milder in children, there are also severe cases that hospitals have been facing, especially in recent times.
“We know that children are at risk and affected less than adults, it’s 2 to 5 percent compared to adults,” the head of the Pediatric Anesthesiology and Resuscitation Clinic of the Brno Faculty Hospital and the Masaryk University Medical Faculty Petr Dominik told News.
The course is much simpler, lighter, often without symptoms.
But there are child patients who are seriously ill with the coronavirus, which we have seen especially in the recent period," added Dominik.
According to the doctor, there are dozens of children in need of moderate supportive care.
It takes place in the clinic of pediatric infectious diseases.
Very seriously ill children with coronavirus have only recently been on ARU.
Children with post-covidal syndromes were on a doctor's appointment continuously throughout the year.
"Now there is an increase in children with acute covid pneumonia, that is, pneumonia, which requires a stay on a resuscitation bed," he said, adding that this disease affects both adolescents and several-month-old infants.
In hospitals, children are also in a difficult condition due to the coronavirus.
“At present, we have a child of several months and adolescence,” the prime minister said.
However, he is happy that no child deaths have been recorded at the FN Brno Children's Hospital so far.
According to the available data, six children aged 0 to 14 died in the Czech Republic on December 6.
According to Dominik, children’s hospitals – not just the coronavirus department – are an integral part of the psychologist’s collaboration.
At the same time, it also points to the fact that, as in adults, as in children, vaccination alleviates the course of the disease and at the same time reduces the incidence of postcovid syndrome.
“That is why we recommend the administration of the vaccine dose in children as well,” the doctor added.
In the quiet zone, you can walk only on marked paths.
But those tranquillity zones aren't that big.
They can be seen on the tourist map on maps.cz.
Generally, in national parks outside the quiet zone, you can walk anywhere (but don't go across the fence to the field).
Skiing/biking in the woods outside the marked trails is not allowed anywhere unless you have an exception (but of course it is not very well looked after outside the national parks).

China is building the impression of controlled infection and that the authoritarian regime is facing the crisis better
Sinologist Jiroush: China is building the impression of controlled infection and that the authoritarian regime is facing a crisis better.
China has embarked on a health and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing rebuffed criticism for failing to stop the epidemic, which has turned into a global pandemic.
The country now reports a zero increase in the number of infected.
States, including the Czech Republic, are competing for Chinese protective equipment, and Chinese doctors often help in the fight against the coronavirus, for example, in the worst-affected Italy.
How do you feel about Beijing?
Is it friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
A friend meets a friend and says to him, "Don't you want an elephant?"
I got it and it's great.
The wife likes it because she saves the grass, washes the car with a cradle, and the children play with it.
Well, it's just great.
If you want 5000, I'll sell you an elephant.
My friend, I'm going to cry, it's going to be great.
After a while they meet and the one who bought complains: you guys, who sold it for an elephant???
The lawn is smashed, there's huge shit everywhere, the car's gone, the kids are afraid of it, and the wife wants to get a divorce.
The guy who sold says, "You talk bad about an elephant, you don't sell an elephant like that."
The world's affairs are controlled by great powers.
Although the equality of sovereign states applies, it is the great powers that determine the course of international affairs.
Europe can become such a great power only if it works on its integration.
It is still functioning at the economic and political level (on selected issues), but there is still a lack of military integration.
I personally think that Europe is heading towards federalization.
It won't be in 10, 15 or 20 years.
But maybe in the middle of the century, the mood will be different and it will work out.
I thought about it too, and it's quite possible.
I'm not an expert in Czech, so maybe I'm a vocabulary writer.
I'm just assuming that the ellipse usually includes 2 different units at the same level.
I will borrow an example from another commentary on "Spanish oranges and mandarins" when it is clear that they are both from Spain, whereas for "Spanish fruit and mandarins" it is no longer clear that they are from Spain.
In addition, I base this on the fact that the phrase is "all American forces," including their weapons, and that I know that American complexes are operated only by Americans.
In other words, I expect it to be already included in that broad concept and there is no need to specify it further with the American forces.
But again, maybe I'm just saying it :D
Either way, it's a ridiculous requirement.
An earthquake with a magnitude of five has been recorded in Tokyo.
Japan’s Tokyo metropolis and surrounding areas were hit by a 5.0-degree earthquake on Sunday.
Witnesses said the buildings were shaking in the capital, but no damages have been reported so far.
No tsunami warnings were issued, according to Reuters.
Vicki Holland of Britain tortured the monkey of cosmonaut Milly
Horrible footage shows the moment when the frightened monkey crumbled into the toilet bowl before her senseless owner smeared her and laughed at her.
The Dutch monkey also fed pairs, kebabs and hamburgers, regardless of her real nutritional needs.
The Magistrate's Court in Gwent has now banned her from animal husbandry for life, The Sun reported.
Experts in the rehabilitation of monkeys, who care about Milly after her torture, said they had never seen such a frightened cosmonaut.
Milly has spent nearly two years rehabilitating Monkey World workers in Dorset and is now playing with another rescued monkey named Moon again.
The four-time mother has confessed to two charges of causing unnecessary suffering to the protected animal.
The Magistrate's Court in Gwent sentenced her to 12 weeks in prison with a one-year suspended sentence.
Holland was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, had a lifetime ban on animal breeding and had to pay a total of CZK 12,000 in court costs.
The leader of the Small Monkeys team that rehabilitated the tormented animal, Steph Sawyer, said: “Milly is fine, but the rehabilitation will continue even further.”
It took Milly to get used to people again.
She shuddered and hid from everyone she met, and any loud sound or sudden movement made her scream.
The monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Even now that she has settled down and is satisfied with the male, the sight of new people in her can still cause panic.
The psychic scars of torture will accompany her forever, Sawyer adds.
Milly's allegations came to light after police in Gwent discovered horrific footage of her wife's phone after raiding her apartment on drug charges.
On the footage, you can hear Milly sing vulgarly.
In the next video, the Dutch monkey offers cocaine and says, “Do you want cocaine?”
Then lick my fingers.
In May, along with her partner Russell Cox, 43, she admitted to holding cocaine with the intention of selling it.
In her house, cocaine was found for <0xC2><0xA3>1,600 (a total of less than <0xC2><0xA3>50,000) hidden in Kinder eggs.
Cox was subsequently jailed for 30 months and Holland was given a 20-month suspended sentence.
And what amazing concepts will you learn from that prehistoric period three times in a row when you bravely skip the entire 20th century?
Like you're taking the same stuff with you in first grade as you did in sixth grade?
And the whole thing kills the idea of steaking, when no one, by the way, doesn't care if you can or understand.
First of all, write a test at 1 and then nobody cares anymore.
Walk and randomly ask people on the street if they can determine the character of the roots of the square equation and coefficients.
Everyone's been through it, and the absolute majority won't even cut themselves off and tell you they're totally fucked.
So what the fuck is that learning?
I’m a big fan of the general overview and the fact is that people don’t want and don’t need it.
And at that moment, it's useless, and you'll never get it into them anyway.
It's partly taught to the many people who will need the thing.
But, like, the note that you don't really need all this to stand by the machine, I mean really... because you just don't need it.
In addition, we are slowly getting to a time when not knowing is a sign of punk.
(To which our communist past and anger against educators and elites are probably also involved in us) Of course, the price of being barbarous at these machines is simply high.
If, for example, journalists could count, the covid here probably never reached these dimensions.
Wedding at First Sight: The War of Kadri and Andrey Continues!
Which is the main reason why she can’t leave Switzerland right away,” Andrea said in an Instagram post on Stories to curious fans, which disappointed her so much at Kadrim that she decided to stop all contact and even block it on social media.
This has been going on between Kadri and Andrea since the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was the fact that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea was moving behind her, at least until he returned to the Czech Republic permanently.
But she resolutely rejected it.
And as you can see, their relationship not only did not end with love, but rather grew into mutual disrespect and hatred.
It was a planned attack from you! angered by Kadri's turn in response to Andre's accusations of lying, gambling and debt.
Kadri's supposed honesty no longer pleased his ex-wife, even his younger sister Linda.
She decided to stop her brother in public.
Normally, I don't talk about things like that at all, and we've never said such things to each other in our family.
I certainly don't want to make any regrets.
But when I see someone trying to publicly hurt and spoil the name of someone I love so much, I just can't!
I’m sorry to have to do it this way, but I would like to publicly thank my brother Kadrima for making himself a character and helping our family when we needed it most, despite how young he was.
I’m even more sorry to have to read such incorrect information, which is probably quite taken out of context.
I would love for everyone to know Kadri as well as me, our loved ones and family, stands in confession in response to Andrey’s words.
I'm really grateful to him for everything!
Of course, people will believe what is written, but most importantly, we, his family, love him above all and we know the reality and we know how it really was, added indefinitely.
A drunk thief climbed the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade to the fifth floor.
You won't believe why.
Chao began his robbery journey in a parking lot in the residential area, where he tried to break into several cars.
According to available information, he finally pulled out of one vehicle in the count of less than 330 kroner.
Then he thought of nothing better than climbing to the 5th floor and entering the apartment with an open window.
He stole two bananas there.
The video from one security camera then captures him walking down the street away from the scene and eating a banana.
When the owner of the apartment woke up in the morning, he found that the bananas were not where they were, and called the police.
She then arrested Cchaa.
The man admitted to drinking alcohol on the day of the indictment.
And since he needed the money, he decided to rob in the drunkenness.
The whole thing is still under investigation.
The drunk climbed the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade to the fifth floor, where he stole two bananas.

The average age of newly elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest of them is 69 years old, the youngest 33 years old.
The processing of the results of Saturday’s elections for us symbolically concludes a rather challenging but successful year.
A total of four new or repeated elections to the municipal councils and, above all, highly monitored elections to the Chamber of Deputies took place, said <0xC4><0x8C>S<0xC3><0x9A> Vice-President Eva Krump.
She recalled that due to the Covid-19 epidemic, the choices were more demanding on equipment and personnel security.
In Komni na Uherskohradi<0xC5><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1>tsk, the Independent Candidates’ Association won the elections on Saturday, which won 27.76 percent of the votes and two mandates in a seven-member representation.

They will then be published in the Collection of Laws.
What do you think would be a bigger problem?
A dead civilian or a foreign politician?
I think you know all this stuff that people are writing here.
You're just playing dumb to have someone to fight with.
If not, it's sad.
I am not saying that Christians are degenerate or anything like that.
I even like a lot of church buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which, after all, was the goal to make them look good).
And I don't care who believes what.
On the other hand, I don’t care how much power the church had in the Middle Ages, how much money it raised, suppressing science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars it has caused, such as the 30-year-old
Tl;dr: Believe in a spaghetti monster, but the state and the church have nothing to do
The man fell his head down from 12 meters.
The impact on the concrete survived.
An incredible fall survived on Sunday night a man in Ostrava, who was hit by the rescuers of the Regional Health Rescue Service.
The workers of the regional operating center took an hour after midnight on Saturday an emergency call with initial information about the fall of a man from the height.
Two ZZS crews – medical and medical – immediately came to the scene.
Upon arrival at the site, the doctors found that a twenty-seven-year-old man was supposed to fall from a window from a height of about twelve meters and hit his head on the concrete!
There was coal in V<0xC3><0xAD>tkovic.
But not as it should, and the firefighters went into action.
At the time of the arrival of the rescue teams, the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and in direct danger of life.
The intervening doctor intubated his respiratory tract, provided artificial pulmonary ventilation and after other measures as part of pre-hospital emergency care, the ambulance transported him to another care center of Ostrava traumatological center, the spokesman of the ZZS MS region, Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Humpl reported.
I am more concerned than the coronavirus because of inadequate responses from the public and the authorities
The spread of the coronavirus in the Czech Republic is a challenge for politicians and officials, but in the first line of the fight against the infection is mainly doctors and health personnel.
How serious is the situation from their point of view?
We're asking military doctor David Schneider.

Legendary Nunes after seven years of falling, Oliveira defended the belt
MMA had a great gala night full of interesting results.
At UFC 269, things have happened.
Outsider Julianna Pe<0xC5><0x88>ov<0xC3><0xA1> managed to defeat legendary wrestler Amanda Nunes, who for seven years did not find a winner.
Charles Oliveira did not hesitate in light weight, performed a great slash against Dustin Poirier and defended the belt.
The victory was also recorded by Kai Kara-France, who quickly smashed Cody Garbrandt's technical KO in the first round.
Sean O'Malley also defeated his rival.
Surprise that no one expected.
This brought the women's bantam weighing game between the famous Amanda Nunes and Julian Penn.
The American entered the battle as an imaginary "dwarf", Nunes did not lose for seven years and brushed her teeth for another triumph.
In addition, the beginning of the duel was carried in the spirit of paper assumptions.
Nunes started the road to victory very actively, and the rival even spawned a push kick that sent her to the ground.
However, Peneva did not allow herself to make any other mistake and herself unsuccessfully tried to attack with a lever on her hand.
The second round was thrilling and very exciting for MMA fans.
Both rivals were honoured with a lot of excellent blows and hard hooks.
Plus, Penny got Nunes on the ground, where she started cutting her.
She had to give up the effort and unlock the attack.
This is how the American woman prepared a huge shock for everyone when she became the new champion.
The highlight of the gala evening was the battle between Charles Oliveiro and Dustin Poirier for the lightweight title.
Poirier did better at first, but the card gradually began to turn.
In the second he tried to be more active Oliveira, who tried to beat the opponent with a lever on his hand.
He didn’t succeed, but then he put a lot of pressure on himself, got a competitor on his back, and stabbed him with a number of wounds.
That's why he won the second round.
In the third round, Oliveira showed a rear naked choke, which Poirier resisted for a while, but then had to knock off the shortcut.
The Brazilian defended the title, but Poirier lost after two years.
In the next match, Sean O'Malley claimed the sovereign triumph, who already in the first round bet on Raulian Paiva with a hard right back.
Subsequently, he scored a series of precisely measured strikes and recorded a fifteenth triumph.
Kara-France then managed to consult with Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes celebrated another triumph with her little daughter, now losing after seven years.
Did he have a hip or did he have a hip?
At first glance, it’s nothing complicated.
Most significant names in Czech express only one grammatical genus, and therefore there is no problem with them to determine whether it is a male, female or middle genus.
But then there is also a fairly numerous group of essential names, for which the genus is not stable.
Such significant names fluctuate between two races.
When tilting, they then acquire two ends and in some cases remain in non-tilting form.
For example, the words "swim" or "swim" are a male and female genus, in the former they are tilted according to the pattern of "machine", in the latter according to the pattern of "song".
For other groups of essential names, there are different forms already in the first drop of a single number, such as: "row/row", "kedluben/kedlubna" or "potato/potato" (in the sense of food).
Both forms are written, have the same meaning, and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some terms may differ regionally, for example, "okurka" in Czechs and "poor" in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian variant is unwritten, similarly there are other Czech-Moravian pairs of words: "p<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>kop" and "p<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>kopa", "kobliha" and "koblih" etc.
Some of the words that came into Czech from other languages were originally non-negotiable, but gradually they are taken over by the Czech endings.
A typical example is the expression "image", which is a male and female genus, or the word "buffet", which remained intact in the middle genus, but has endpoints in the pattern of "garden".
Turkey has opened the way for migrants to Europe.
What is the situation on the Greek border?
The Greek-Turkish border is under strain due to the growing number of migrants trying to get to Europe.
Thousands of people began to march to the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped defending them.
European politicians are promising support for Greece, and the Czech government is also planning to provide humanitarian aid.
What motivates refugees to take an uncertain path?
What does the situation look like on the spot?
“We haven’t seen the blue sky in three months and we’re suffocating,” a reporter from Sydney said.
The devastating fires that Australia has been facing for the fourth month have killed nearly three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals and destroyed millions of hectares of land.
How do the local authorities and the residents themselves cope with the disaster?
Could the government of Prime Minister Morrison have done more to prevent drastic impacts, critics say?
And what will the country have to prepare for in the future in the context of climate change?
Lenka Kabrhel is talking to a reporter from Sydney, Ika Detroit.
False accusations have always been and are quite rare.
That’s why it’s always written about everyone everywhere.
For people, it is unpleasant to deal with what sexual violence looks like in our society and how widespread it is, so they try to prevent it.
I don't know anyone who was falsely accused.
But I know a lot of people who have been raped, and I've experienced how people often behave around them or even the police.
Victims should always be trusted.
The trend has become that victims are finally opening up about their traumas.
Still, too many people keep it to themselves.
Yes, there will be those who falsely accuse someone.
It’s ugly and smeared in the face of all victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the idea that “a large part of the accusation is fabricated” and that it’s a “trend” you’re only helping sexual offenders.
The Czech Republic floods dismantled houses, families do not have the money to complete
Prices of construction materials have risen by more than 30 percent in recent weeks and months.
A lot of people got into a slumbering situation because of this.
It does not have the funds to complete the dismantled family homes and the banks refuse to increase its mortgage loans.
In addition to material prices, the price of construction works is also increasing.
Therefore, people do not have enough money to complete the already dismantled family homes.
In many cases, banks refuse to raise their mortgages, which creates extremely unpleasant situations for them.
At best, people move into dismantled and uncooled homes.
In the worst case scenario, dismantled houses are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay mortgages and to pay rents," says BHS economist <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>p<0xC3><0xA1>n K<0xC5><0x99>e<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
We will build two to three family houses in a year, and at fifty percent it happened to us.
For us as a construction company, it is difficult for us to comply with certain things contractually, even if the material has been expensive.
So we do without earnings," said the owner of the construction company Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Slivon.
A lot of people will still have financial problems.
If they expected that the construction of the house will cost five million, now it will cost seven.
I think some will wait," Slivon added.
Of the material, copper, iron, as well as installation and heating equipment was the most stimulated.
Construction companies are also struggling with a shortage of workers.
In the Czech Republic, there are no graduates in the field of construction and the influx of foreign workers is slowing down the pandemic.
At the moment, only the situation regarding the issue of a building permit is more favourable.
“In October, construction authorities issued 7,675 building permits, which is almost 10 percent more than a year ago,” K<0xC5><0x99>e<0xC4><0x8D>ek said.
We're fine, and we're gonna be even better.
The real vision is missing, says the commentator of the <0xC4><0x8C>RO – mujRozhlas
The introduction of the new year, in addition to the classical celebrations, has traditionally been accompanied by the manifestations of politicians.
This year, besides Prime Minister and President of the United Nations Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1> and the Christmas message of President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman, the presidents of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies spoke to the people.
What did we learn about the essentials?
As it seems to me the diploma is super right now, I have my own topic that I chose, I continue on to the bachelor's degree, I always do it all year round and then in a week or two I write a written part.
The statesmen are quite calm with us, if a man is not a total macaque and something remains in his head, then the commission will not suffocate him on the theory.
I may have been studying stationery for a week, and when I was at the end of the day, the committee was always trying to get me into some logical derivation that immediately hit me and I had it right.
Other than those projects, I know people who will pay someone to do the semester project for them (we did it a lot, really beneficial, learn a lot) and then they just learn the project and they're outdated.
In my opinion, it is great when at the end of the course there is an exam, in which the knowledge acquired within the project is reflected, not just defense.
All right, but don't count emails and phones and don't send any parcels to the embassy.
You're gonna be the same as them.
Those people at the embassy don't have anything to do with it.
And if they were against Russia, they would risk a lot, so maybe they have to play with them, because otherwise something could happen to them.
But you can easily build a similar statue of Putin next to the statue of the bear Pu.
You might want to put it on the ass of Xi Jinping or something.
I agree, even though Insta throws the artists under their feet.
Once you don’t give stories every day and at least every other day a new picture, your reach will be reduced to a minimum.
In addition, the stealt changes what is more important for the function, whether a tile, comment, or save.
It's been really scary lately, so maybe I'll have to go down to a tiktok where a lot of artists in my industry are successful and can't afford it.
In the end, I would probably like to see something more user-friendly that doesn’t teach artists all their creativity and energy.
Statement of the Donbase Workers Party
The union – yes, the break-up – no, the opponents of the break-up of the USSR express their opinion in the picture.
Thirty years since the illegal collapse of the USSR.
On December 8, 1991, the largest geopolitical disaster in human history occurred.
Boris Jelcin, Leonid Krav<0xC4><0x8D>uk and Stanislav <0xC5><0xA0>u<0xC5><0xA1>kevi<0xC4><0x8D>, without any legal powers and violating the results of the referendum of March 17, 1991, exist in the B<0xC4><0x9B>lov<0xC4><0x97> Forest 8th December 1991.
With a single stroke of a pen, they “destroyed” a huge country with almost three hundred million inhabitants.
With the collapse of the USSR, tens of millions of ethnic Russian citizens were abroad.
Since the early 1990s, Russia’s population has declined by ten to eleven million.
Despite the loss of the non-Russian population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in the two world wars combined!
In the past, the same people who destroyed what had been built in the previous seventy years in one sitting in the Belovo Forest betrayed the socialist camp (created at a cost of millions of lives in the Second World War and the Great Patriotic War).
They consciously de-industrialized, slowed agriculture, detached fourteen republics from the world’s largest power, which had previously been economically united into a single mechanism.
If we want to look even more deeply at the problems of the social crisis, then we see the depletion of the population, the breakdown of the economy, the sciences, the army, the growth of crime, the interethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all the conflicts in the post-Soviet space, the jad of the orange revolutions, the expansion of NATO to the east, the war.
There is such a concept in political science as the “vacuum of power.”
Everything that was in a hurry betrayed and abandoned quickly filled up and won the NATO countries that accepted our geopolitical capitulation.
And the whole world is still shaken by the events of the late eighties and early nineties of the last century.
The price of a product sold in a supermarket with high turnover may not directly correspond to its quality and quality.
It is Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket, which costs 189 CZK / kg.
I'll buy it by putting it in the fridge and making it out for dinner on Thursday.
In the alternative reality, in which I will not buy this meat on Monday, the chain will drop it on Tuesday to 99 CZK / kg - will you describe the mechanism by which this meat will become a burden on my digestive system by changing its price?
Or I will wait until Thursday and this meat will be discounted 1 day before the date of consumption to 69 CZK / kg - what would this meat be different from what I bought on Monday by 120 CZK and left it in my refrigerator for 3 days?
I'll answer myself - nothing.
These bullshit that when something is cheap, it must be guaranteed to be bad, spoiled or poor quality are terribly retarded to tell you the truth ;-)
Now I recently went to Brno to Hlavas, and in the basement of the lady, they were giving me some brochure, similar things I always take to help the brigadiers, they can't throw it out...
Well, the brochure was full of rural reason and conservative views on the functioning of the world, but nothing about God, I was confused, but I thought it would be some kind of agitator.
After reading it, I found out who published it, and in the end, Scientology came out.
Well, like it was a good mattress, full of totally useless lessons, like I'm supposed to wash myself and not be a pussy.
Too bad the paper, because of this, the forests would not have to fall.
I had a similar experience with an ex-girlfriend.
Mental manipulation and emotional extortion will force you to respond to that person because you love him or her without realizing how much the situation is.
Several times she threatened to hurt me because I went out with a friend she didn't like to talk to.
Or even when I wanted to leave her apartment earlier, she started crying and asked me not to go anywhere.
Then she started to physically lock the door.
It was a great relationship for about a year, but then another six months passed and it started to kick her in the ass.
Then I ended the relationship because I told her I was going to break up and shove her up, but we can still talk about it next week to calm her down and not catch any more amok.
Such a person sucks feelings, emotions and overall joy out of you.
I'd rather keep the distance
When insurance companies are furiously robbing themselves here by buying a cloud of tests and honing for positives, they wouldn't even know about the terrible disease being a test.
The only thing we do is complication for companies, carriers, and others, because their employees in the random number generator have been given five days of domestic prison time.
In the West, they stopped with the chessboard, admitting that it was not worth dealing with the disease weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, Valek is new and has to steal something else and drive his ego by inventing buzzing.
I'm watching the good old bastard come back to us.
After several years of repression and repression of this sleazy business, MLM Recruitment is back on track.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20 years old, a champion at the University of Applied Sciences), the initial promises of product training and business skills quickly turned into "it doesn't matter to you, especially get people".
Honestly, I was interested in the products that I offer because I wanted to help people, but the training was more about how to scare and sneeze a person.
When the first money earned came, one quickly realized that if he wanted to make money, he had to eat a few certain products a month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only earnings, that is, the person then felt like a home salesman of pots.
But what I can say, the experience it was valuable, the man learned that he should not jump right on every spike and thoroughly check the information.
At the same time, I wouldn't put them all in one bag.
People in this business are successful and even beneficial to people, but they certainly won’t boast of expensive consumer goods or a “fat” account.
I've never seen much of this in the corporation where I do it.
HR is calm, managers look at their management and don’t put a lot of pressure on us.
Regular evaluation is happening somehow, in the form in which it takes place with us it goes quite well (set some goals for next year, in a year we will see what came out and what didn’t) - it’s more of a self-assessment than someone would evaluate you by some numbers, and the like.
Corporate events are also optional.
But we are also a bit unique within our company - there are departments that are more "corporate".
Sometimes one has the feeling that we are such a near-startup that squats in the offices of a large corporation no.
But it works so they don't bother us much as long as the results are.
The Czech Republic lost in the UK is dead.
Her body was found in London.
For almost ten days, British police searched unsuccessfully for the missing 32-year-old Czech, who was lost at the end of November.
On Sunday 12 December, Foreign Minister Jakub Kulh<0xC3><0xA1>nek announced on social media that a woman from Uherskohradi<0xC5><0xA1>tsk was found dead.
British police have confirmed to our representative office in London this afternoon that they have found the body of a missing Czech citizen.
The cause of death is being investigated.
With regard to the family, we will not provide further information on the case.
My sincere condolences, Kulh<0xC3><0xA1>nek said on Twitter.
The young woman was last seen on November 28 on a bus on the way from work, she had to pick up money from the ATM before joining.
Her disappearance was reported by her colleagues from work five days later.
She was subsequently searched by the London police, and Interpol placed her among the missing around the world.
It also appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
Police have arrested a man in this regard a few days ago.
What role he played in the case and what she suspects him of, but did not disclose.
At the end of the year, four new councils were established.
On Saturday, December 11, new representatives were elected in the municipalities of Kom<0xC5><0x88>a na Uherskohradi<0xC5><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B>, Lu<0xC5><0xBE>ice na Mosteck, Nov<0xC3><0xA1> Ves na Liberecka and Rovn<0xC3><0xA1> na Pelh<0xC5><0x99>imovska.
The number of representatives in these municipalities fell below the number stipulated by law or the elected representative offices collapsed.
In the new elections, there were 99 valid candidates for 28 seats.
Electoral participation reached 62.41%.
The highest interest was recorded in the village of Evn<0xC3><0xA1>, where 93.62% of eligible voters voted.
A total of 8 women and 20 men were elected.
The average age of elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest is 33 years old.
A total of 13 candidate papers were registered for the new elections to the representative offices of the four municipalities.
There were 36 women and 63 men in 28 representative positions.
The average age of the candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, the oldest 72 years old.
The processing of the results of Saturday’s elections for us symbolically concludes a rather challenging but successful year.
There were four new or repeated elections to the municipal councils and, above all, the highly monitored elections to the Chamber of Deputies.
At the same time, we had to work mostly in more demanding epidemic conditions, which placed greater demands on equipment and personnel security, Eva Krump, 1st Vice-President of the Czech Statistical Office, assessed.
The last constituency was processed on Sunday, December 12 at 03:49.
On Monday, the results of the vote will be discussed by the State Electoral Commission and, after approval, will be published in the Collection of Laws.
This is the biggest problem I have with the pandemic.
It took me a while to deal with the fact that we have a rather dangerous infectious disease at the very beginning, but it went without any major backlashes.
Dealing with how idiotically a large part of the population is doing it on all its layers, I have a problem with it so far.
I look forward to the vaccination (tomorrow!) because thanks to it I will finally be less dependent on the fact that other people are not shit.
He would be deprived of the office of president and the ability to retake it.
The chances of this happening are very small, as others have mentioned here.
Besides, I'm not sure if the retracted file could even be considered a treason.
The Supreme Court is an act by which the President of the Republic threatens the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or the democratic character of the state.
It must have been something more serious.
How the Pandemic Affected Intimate Life: Growing Number of People Under 35 Who Are Sexless All Year
More and more young adults in the United States live their lives without sex.
These are mainly religiously-based people, according to the website DailyMail.
The survey found that from 2008 to 2021, the proportion of people under 35 who give up sex life rose from eight to 21 percent.
Women between the ages of 18 and 35 who said they hadn’t had sex in the last year are more than ever.
Other factors are also contributing to the decline in the number of sexually active individuals, according to a study by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS).
One of them could be the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic and a higher rate of unemployment.
But the presence of media, social networks or video games could also contribute to making sex a lesser and lesser priority for young people.
“Since 2010, the proportion of men and women between the ages of 18 and 35 who report having had no sex in the previous year has been increasing rapidly,” said Lyman Stone, an IFS researcher.
In married people, sexual activity is more common, with only 5% of them reporting that they have been without sex in the past year.
For freelancers, it was 29%. Stone added that marriages under the age of 35 are only a small percentage.
The loss of sexual activity is then also contributed by the fear of premarital intercourse and religious foundation.
Although husbands are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of married and married couples under 35 is still falling.
Young people share an opinion about premarital sex, about 30% think it’s a bad thing, while about 70% think it’s okay.
“It’s true that free individuals in this age group are a minority, but their behavior is shifting that trend,” Stone says of the 30 percent.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarital intercourse, it is the reason for religious foundation.
Since 2008, freelancers under the age of 35 who attend religious meetings more than once a month have increased their abstinence rate from 20 to almost 60%.
The trend among “less believers” has risen from 10 to 20 percent, Stone said.
Other factors also contribute to the decline in sexual activity, such as less social interaction and, above all, social alcohol consumption during the pandemic.
The study also showed that the likelihood of sex is lower in people without work, or with lower incomes.
Another reason may be the expansion of digital media, which apparently reduces the need for sex.
People spend more time online, thus “replace” this need.
This trend was mainly driven by a lockdown during the coronavirus pandemic.
The whole rule of covid vaccination is about whether society should force a part of the population to behave that they don’t want, but that can save their lives.
This is a rather difficult question that I personally am most interested in the question of the social conscience.
For example, the question is, if we don't order them and they die, it's our fault.
My argument is that we could certainly have died of an eighty-year-old man who didn't really know much, we didn't explain it to him well, he heard some misinformation, and as a result he didn't get vaccinated and eventually caught it and died.
On the other hand, I do not think that we can for the death of a hardline opponent of vaccination, who, along with the SPD and the KSC, is sniffing something about the bullying and totalitarian state.
From the statistics I have mentioned, it can be quite clearly imported that most of the unvaccinated pensioners probably belong to the second group, so they will really be able to do it themselves.
The Czech Republic without snow.
How does a mild winter signify the fight against drought?
This winter has brought one of the smallest snowfalls in the Czech Republic so far.
The operators of the ski resorts do not go without technical snow, the weather complicates the preparation of the Jizerské fifties.
Is it a trend or an exception?
And what will little snow mean for the fight against drought in the Czech Republic?
I'd have a story, but it's not about a pancake.
Once in high school, a teacher led us through the whole town on the shipyard so we could sail on boats along the river.
On the way there we went once such a wide street and whom we probably do not see in the middle - the follower of the Hare K<0xE1><0xB9><0x9B><0xE1><0xB9><0xA3><0xE1><0xB9><0x87>a sect.
Of course they've come down on us.
Luckily, I ran away, but they talked to a friend.
When she left them, we asked her and her teacher what she told them.
"They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them I had no soul," she replied.
All of us, including the teacher, laughed all the way to the shipyard.
We're terribly shattered.
Not much is happening, but the system is already collapsing, says Orozovic
New German Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw on Sunday after previous visits to Paris and Brussels, where Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki welcomed him with military honors.
"We are opening a new chapter of mutual relations," Morawiecki said at a joint press conference after the meeting.
Scholz stressed that Europe must show together that it will not accept violations of the territorial integrity of Ukraine.
According to the Chancellor, the crisis, triggered by the worrying movements of Russian troops at the Ukrainian borders, is worth tackling with the use of diplomatic negotiations, even within the “Norman group”, bringing France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki said that he informed the chancellor of the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukashenko artificially triggered the migration crisis and used people as live targets and weapons, because every night we record hundreds of attempts to (illegal) cross the borders.
With the Chancellor, he negotiated further sanctions to make Lukashenko’s regime and its patrons in the Kremlin finally understand that we are determined to defend the EU’s eastern border.
Scholz, according to the DPA, assured that Warsaw enjoyed German support in its dispute with Belarus, and condemned the inhuman treatment of the Lukashenko regime with refugees.
Drunk Polish clergyman Caused an Accident, Trying to Hide It
The car returned to the scene of the accident after a while, but the car was driven by another nun who tried to take the blame.
When the police told her that she could lose her driver’s license even if she didn’t have a driving lead and was caught at the scene of the accident, she came out with the truth, TVN24 said.
She admitted that another nun ran into the vehicle and asked for help.
Then the cops came for Sister Celestina.
She was given a breath test, and when they found out she had more than two promilles in her blood, they immediately removed her driver's license.
At the same time, she was informed that she was going to appear in court for her actions.
Dog Hugo does what he can.
Juraj <0xC5><0xA0>ajmovi<0xC4><0x8D> did not make his film.
The Czech creators of family comedies have seen each other in American stories about dog mistresses.
But at the same time, they forgot the essential thing: the legality of the film trade.
After the hilarious film F. Brabce Gump - a dog that taught people to live, now there is another film about the spectator emotion in the cinemas.
The co-writer of the script and the director in one person Juraj <0xC5><0xA0>ajmovi<0xC4><0x8D> ml. freely follows on to his previous film Here I Watch From 2012.
Back on the scene comes the talking jetty Hugo and some famous characters around him.
Julie and Ivan, the owners of the <0xC5><0xA0>umava boarding house that is dying, and so they begin to invite the dogman, Julie's father with his partner and especially her daughter Veronica.
She is no longer a little girl, but a teenage girl who experiences first love.
The director and his partner Beatriz <0xC5><0xA0>ajmovi<0xC4><0x8D>ova (who is also the producer of the film) dealt with the storytelling procedures already in the previous dog film, but at least there were children and dogs.
This time the creative couple wrote an even weaker script, which evokes a mixture of astonishment and feelings of embarrassment.
Let's sum it up.
Julie, although the scientist may, in a ploy from the ploy of the forest, succumb to the ploy of the child to the ploy of the twilight and if the right "constellation" comes, copulates with his forest engineer Ivan, wherever the coordinates are determined by the ploy – the ploy is on the hood of the car or the church tower, the ploy (of course during the ploy).
Nothing against the pure treatment of nature and the power of animal pets.
Their owners know why they have them.
But the spectator wonders what a content pellmel full of unbelievable situations and figures was needed for this message.
A pair of staff thieves, a dogfighting competition, a shumava charlatan, cops coming to the scene to look for “drugs” and discussing the fertilizing power of bone flour – and which the roasted family in the pension of course drinks.
When a hero wakes up after a heavy coma and then sits waved and cigar-shaped at a family table and demands her father’s whiskey and flakes as a cured vegetarian, one can’t laugh.
At the top, the creators will explain to the viewer that “this happens sometimes after a coma.”
The <0xC5><0xA0>ajmovi<0xC4><0x8D> team lacks basic dramaturgical knowledge of working with the text, the ability to construct bearable situations, a sense of character and point and direction.
The acting performances are uneven, the cut is helpless and the overall impression is dazzled.
No matter how Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Vacul<0xC3><0xAD>k, Jitka Je<0xC5><0xBE>kov<0xC3><0xA1> or Nela Boudov<0xC3><0xA1> try to set up their parties, they don’t have much to play.
The only feature of the film is the poetic footage of the nature of the cameraman Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Holomk and a couple of ponds.
It is not enough to draw a few characters, a chattering plot and dog reports, let alone the more popular vulgar expressions that the characters perform.
The argument is not even an annual membership in the Breeders' Club - as in the case of a female producer.
For good intentions to promote the nature and friendship of man with a dog must also be knowledge of the craft in order to tell a credible story.
That didn't work out in this case.
For a good family picture, there's a little bit of eroticism and a minimum of feeling for the genre.
Not even an advertisement for canis therapy would pass this amateur-spoken piece.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to the constant overdose of idiots like you.
There's a difference between offering and coercion, here's how you understand shit, but it's just because you've never tried it.
The decision is always on the customer, if he does not want, the answer will always be no.
If you'd listened to a thief like that, maybe you'd change your mind.
It's a job like any other, in this case a earnings brigade.
The Middle East suffers from unusually dry months.
Winter is the only time of year when it rains.
“Even the complete absence of rainfall during November, as we have noted at some stations, is unusual,” the Israel Meteorological Service said.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reports only six percent of the long-term precipitation average for November.
The two-day rain this week was therefore an exception.
It's good for us.
It's been a while.
It is also the right Christmas backdrop, the resident of Nazareth Was<0xC3><0xAD>m Ashkar rejoiced.
Rainfall in Israel comes almost exclusively in the winter months, is shocking and irregular.
There are dependent forests in the winter rains.
Without them, they dry and are prone to fires.
It is not only about forests, but also about the supply of drinking water and land for farmers.
Israel’s largest freshwater source, Lake Galilee, has been flooded this spring, thanks to the last three rainy winters.
Since then, the level has been falling.
Water managers have been warning against drought for a long time.
“It is expected that depending on global warming and climate change, the rainfall here can be reduced,” Uri Schor, a spokeswoman for Israel’s Water Administration, predicted in 2018.
Israel is able to help itself with technologies such as desalination or wastewater recycling.
Economically weak countries such as Lebanon, Syria and Jordan are worse off.
In the streets of the capital of Jordan, Amman, tankers are increasing.
The plumbing and private wells are drying up.
“This year, my orders have increased by 70 to 80 percent compared to the previous two years,” said tanker driver Im<0xC3><0xA1>d Sulejman in September.
In Iran’s Isfahan, clashes broke out between farmers and security forces.
The reason for the protests was dry.
The coryto of the local river was completely without water.
The region has the driest November in many years.
Israel prepares for military intervention against Iran
The Israeli defense minister said the Vienna talks had brought “no progress” and that he had informed Washington of preparations for an attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities.
Minister Benny Gantz said on Saturday that he had ordered the Israeli army to prepare for a possible military strike against Iran, reports Jonathan Lis.
Gantz, who resides in the United States, is trying to convince the Americans to escalate their pressure on Iran, but he has also informed Washington of military preparations.
During a press conference in Florida, Gantz said that the nuclear talks in Vienna brought “no progress” and the world powers “understand that the Iranians are playing with them.”
This happened to me about three years ago, too.
I turned Miss a little bit and grilled her during the interview to find out what she really wanted me to do.
Finally, I found out that my suspicion of the pyramid was justified.
Because I really don't like these scams, I've been bothering Miss for a while with doubts and questions and finally thanking her and leaving.
Please tell me I'm a fool, but the pyramid is a pyramid and financial advisers are financial advisers.
Skiers went to the mountains on weekends, there was plenty of snow and nice weather
Mountain resorts in the Czech Republic experienced the first major push for skiing this weekend.
After heavy snowfall at the end of the working week, there is no snow emergency and some ski resorts have started operation.
The riders did not even waive the obligation to prove themselves with a Covid certificate in the lifts.
While haulers are not complaining about customer disinterest, some ski equipment rental companies report a weaker demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people in the Liberec region went to the runways and the slopes over the weekend.
The skiers were pleased with the weather, which offered the sun and excellent snow conditions today.
“We are pleased, the opening weekend really came out from that Friday evening skiing, when we had our first skier on the hill,” Je<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B>d Sports Area Director Jakub Hanu<0xC5><0xA1> praised the interest.
Hundreds of people also went to Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k during the first weekend of skiing in the new season.
For example, they had open Ski Arena Karlov or a resort in Brann<0xC3><0xA1> on <0xC5><0xA0>umpersk.
The weekend visit was very decent, an estimated 400 people arrived on Saturday and today.
The conditions are accompanied.
Today the sun was shining, it was around minus three degrees, so perfect, did not save the laudable representative of the ski resort in Branné Rostislav Proch<0xC3><0xA1>zka.
Ski resort operators can only sell ski passes to people who are vaccinated or are within the time limit after the COVID-19 outbreak.
Except for the exceptions, people are prepared for it and prove with the necessary documents, said <0xC4><0x8C>TK René Hrone<0xC5><0xA1> from the ski center <0xC5><0xA0>pindler<0xC5><0xAF>v Ml<0xC3><0xBD>n.
“We only recorded units of incidents,” he added.
Less interest than before the pandemic is reported by some rental companies and sales of ski equipment.
Luckily, there is interest in ski rental.
It is not like in previous years, but there are still enough customers, said Alexandra Boki<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1> from the opaque shop Skiopava.
More effort is expected in the period of the ski courses.
David <0xC5><0xA0>int<0xC3><0xA1>k, director of the Royal Snowbear Company, also feels that due to covid there is no interest in renting ski equipment as before.
At this time before the pandemic, we were almost on loan.
Compared to the period before the pandemic, we are about 50 percent, said <0xC4><0x8C>TK <0xC5><0xA0>int<0xC3><0xA1>k.
According to him, people were depressed with the pandemic and learned to sit at home.
On the contrary, large demand is recorded by the rental company in the Novako area on Bo<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD> Dara.
With the renting of skis there began a week ago and those interested now have to order them in advance.
“We are starting to rent this weekend, but people have already called in advance, so we expect a lot of interest, just like last year,” said Pavl<0xC3><0xAD>na Novakov<0xC3><0xA1>, the operator of the site.
According to her, the interest comparable to the period before the epidemic is also about the ski school.
If we want the successful and the rich not to go abroad, they must have the opportunity to live a quality life abroad.
This certainly does not include socialist health care, where it is often not possible to get a dentist or a specialist.
There are smart and smart people going abroad who don't have any property.
The owner of the company does not go abroad.
I agree with the rest, however.
If these people do not live well in the Czech Republic and if these people do not have a vision of a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, then they simply will not live in the Czech Republic.
The emigration from Hungary began with Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n winning one beautiful day, the year he ruled, and all of a sudden the annual emigration rose by a few tens of thousands.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in a similar position from day to day.
The other question is the choice at all.
If there's going to be a fool living here, then some traditional V4k madman can win here too.
The young and educated will leave, his supporters will remain, and the people whose possessions cannot be thrown into the plane.
Awesome photo!
Langmajer in the blood for beer bet?
While in the Czech Republic it was in full swing autumn, in Thailand the staff of the film Island led by Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Langmajer (55) enjoyed the tropical weather!
The actor posted a bloody photo of his face on social media.
Is it a real injury, or is it a make-up for filming?
The police in London are still searching for the unidentified Czech.
She was last seen on her way home.
“Petra’s disappearance is not at all like her behavior, and we are beginning to worry about her,” Lucy O’Connor of the Lambeth Police Department, where she worked, said in a video on Saturday.
“Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and just wants to know where she is,” she continued.
According to her, the missing Czech Republic left work at around 7:45 p.m. on Sunday, November 28, and headed home to Camberwell.
The last time she was seen on the bus was about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported by one of her co-workers on December 3.
According to British media, Srnc served as a “nurse nurse” at the Evelina London Children’s Hospital, which is part of the Guy’s and St Thomas’ Hospital Association.
"We are extremely concerned about our dear colleague, Peter, who is unknown," a group of medical devices said in a tweet.
“We would like to encourage anyone who could have any information that could help find her to contact the police,” the statement continued.
The public is also invited to cooperate with MP Harriet Harman, who on Saturday alerted to the case of Srncov<0xC3><0xA1> at a press conference.
"She's been unknown for several days, she's only 32 years old, she's from the Czech Republic, her parents are, of course, to death," the Labour politician said, holding a photograph of a woman distributed by the London police.
“I feel that we all have a special responsibility to try to find her because she was outside of her home country, away from her family and worked here for our health care,” Harman said.
Police have previously arrested one man in connection with the case, who remains in custody.
However, according to the BBC, the police did not provide any information about his identity or what the man was suspected of.
Russia is not able to occupy Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (i.e. about 5 divisions).
I don't underestimate Ukraine either.
These are not “huge quantities”, but about 8 percent of the Russian army.
Note that Ukraine is constantly repeating that we amplify the threat of the Invasion and is beginning to have our entry full of teeth.
I cited above.
I don't know what you thought Russia wanted war.
War is a damn expensive joke and Russia has GDP of Italy.
Compared to the situation in 38 years, there are so many things out there that I don’t even know where to start.
I can now compare it to the first Punic War and the "annexion" of Sicily :D
I can imagine that after Ukraine has announced that it does not intend to comply with the Minsk agreement, Russia is annexing these ridiculous republics.
That's all, and that would correspond to that "concentration" at the borders.
I'm a servant...
In Prague from Sunday, new timetables apply, will affect mainly suburban connections
Passengers in Prague’s Integrated Transport (PID) are expecting several changes from Sunday, which relate in particular to suburban connections.
New lines have emerged, some have changed the route, and others have disappeared.
Mladoboleslavsko is newly involved in the integrated system.
In the capital, from Sunday the speedboats stop from <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice at the station Zahradn<0xC3><0xAD> M<0xC4><0x9B>sto.
In suburban train transport, S7 trains depart, which on the route from Beroun to <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> Brod pass through Prague main station.
At the recently operated Prague-Zahradn<0xC3><0xAD> M<0xC4><0x9B>sto station, the R17 from <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice and Bene<0xC5><0xA1>ov will stop again.
The PID will be extended to other areas.
Among other things, there are buses to Svetla nad S<0xC3><0xA1>zavou, Blatna u Jesenice, Stary Splav<0xC3><0xB3>w and Turnova.
Buses to Mladoboleslavska will be included, including lines to the Liberec and Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lovéhradek region.
With the integration, 77 lines will be cancelled, 37 new ones will be introduced and traffic will be adjusted to 12 operating ones.
From Prague’s Zlic<0xC3><0xAD>n, a new bus line 405 will take you all the way to <0xC5><0xBD>atce.
A new direct connection between Prague and Kralovice u Rakovn<0xC3><0xAD>k was also created, which replaces the cancelled train line S53.
Connections from Prague to Rakovn<0xC3><0xAD>k will be reinforced in the morning peak and on the weekend, when the express line number 404 will be issued.
Newly included in the PID system are the lines 400 and 410 driving to the Liberec region.
They depart from St<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xBE>kov metro station, not from Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice Station.
The back line 400 runs through M<0xC4><0x9B>ln<0xC3><0xAD>k, Duboa and <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xA1> L<0xC3><0xAD>pa to Nov<0xC3><0xBD> Bor and the selected routes continue to Rumburk or Cvikova.
Additional line 410 runs through M<0xC4><0x9B>ln<0xC3><0xAD>k and Duboa to Doks, Mimon<0xC4><0x9B> and Jablonné in Podje<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B>d<0xC3><0xAD>.
On the contrary, new operations on ten Central Bohemian local lines have been cancelled or restricted, including to Mochov, Dob<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xA1> or Ro<0xC5><0xBE>mit<0xC3><0xA1>l under T<0xC5><0x99>em<0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xAD>n.
All trains departing from Prague at 02:30 are cancelled.
Due to the modernisation of the railway, the long-term restrictions on the routes Prague – Beroun, Prague – Lys<0xC3><0xA1> nad Labem and around Cologne continue.
Changes are also expected for passengers in other places.
The buses replace some cancelled railway lines or extend the section on line 420 from Dob<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xA1> with the continuation from Prague, where it is possible to use PID tickets to Milevska.
The routes of lines 540 to 543 in Nymbursk have changed and some of the bus routes on the border of central Bohemia and Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovick in the Pilsen region have been modified.
Healthy snack/lunch to the office from the supermarket
Hi, I'm doing classic 9-5 with a 30-minute break and my only way to get food is to go next to Billy or a little further to Lidl.
Since I have no movement, after work I do not have the strength to exercise, so I have to eat as healthy and diet as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy and in a hurry I will buy the maximum pizza on the ground and for a snack of yogurt and apples.
Question: What healthy without the need for heat treatment would you recommend me to buy in the supermarket?
Not everyone waits for a meter of snow like you, so unfortunately it is.
And it’s not about the trees that you need to see.
Under the snow, only the tip of the tree can be hidden.
If destroyed, the tree may be more susceptible to fungal diseases.
I'm not saying that's the only reason we're banned from off-piste, but it's one of them.
Confession of the Gift of the Relationship with the Witness: This I Didn't Enjoy at All
The Czech show business pond has lived since Friday with nothing but the revelation of the relationship between Darya Rolins and Pavel Nedv<0xC4><0x9B>d.
They've been pulling it together for years, the famous footballer even got divorced because of the singer.
Dara now sent a comprehensive message to the fans explaining why she had hidden her love from them for a long half-year.
“I can say that there is currently no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who would have escaped if Dara had caught a bear, that is, sorry, Nedv<0xC4><0x9B>da,” jokes Dara Rollins, who is in love with the most successful Czech footballer.
But he said he packed it, not the other way around.
Three days are the center of attention, and although they are used to the public interest, they are not happy about it.
And it's here.
What we both didn’t look forward to, but we knew it would happen one day, the singer continues.
I just don't know who's worse.
If those who do not care at all, and it jumps on them from the can, or we, whose lives they dissipate in detail.
It’s as if one of you wants to hear the opinion of whether you’re good enough for yourself with your husband or girlfriend, or you’ve insisted that really everyone knows the list of your ex-partners in detail and be familiar with the list of your mistakes and mistakes.
That's what it's all about, that's what you want, it's Dara's problem.
The couple got together in Italy, where Rolins drove for the preparations of her new fashion collection.
Nedv<0xC3><0xBD>d has been the vice president of Juventus football club for a long time.
They went out with the truth until now, because they were waiting for the completion of Nedvyd's divorce.
Ivana and his wife had been separated for three years, but they were only three weeks apart on paper.
Anyway, to those who are happy with us and wish us that, we thank you.
We are just people, we have families, we have children, we have a past and we have dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we both have hearts in the right place.
That's why I love my new husband, and just like him with me, I'm with him, both good and bad.
Hi, the other commentators have said almost everything essential, I just confirm that the colleges are great to begin with, my classmates usually met and made friends during the first semester or two and then found each other's dinners together, which would seem to me to be the best flight option, because you know, with them.
Apartments usually don’t advertise too long in advance, so you probably won’t find much at the moment, but looking at the offer certainly won’t hurt.
Otherwise, be sure to avoid not only Ceylon, but also the surrounding area (streets like Vranovsk<0xC3><0xA1>, French, etc., that’s a pretty bad address), and some parts of the <0xC5><0xBD>idenic are a bit ghetto.
Conversely, the Veve<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> district is very student-friendly, Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lovo field and in that direction it is fine, besides it is close to most VUT faculties (I do not know where exactly you are entering).
I have never scanned the rent, but I am a native of Brno, so I can consult with Brno as such if you lack any more information :)
This is an example of “normal” thinking.
Due to what several doctors have decided to do somewhere in Poland, it is actually perfectly okay that the state does not adequately finance some schools.
Either they learn what they want and pay for what they want, or they go according to the state and pay the state.
After all, we can’t let a private actor control a piece of education just because a few crowns fall into a full-fledged state contribution and he will be able to learn whatever he wants in schools.
Such a claim loses some weight when written by a man who two days before expressed himself as follows about a petition for a boycott of a totalitarian state:
So the vote against if someone goes to abortion is the same for you as the vote against a statue standing in the square?
I'd consult with you directly with the person who gave you the job.
Otherwise, I have already experienced in cataloguing/digitalizing that (and this is also for many years professionals) either throw it out of the eye somehow, or write something in the way xxx *** or ... (according to the convention) and to the note that it is unreadable.
The truth is that in this case it is quite legible, so I would probably not recommend it at all.
Personally, I'd probably deal with it in some way in a note depending on what program you're using.
If you want to be a decent and diligent student, you can check out some character databases and search the nearest one.
But since it looks like you’re drawing from a book, I’d assume that the author or printer simply created his own character that sits next to what’s physically on that coin.
PS: Isn't this the Odyssey Empire (Kingdom) rather than the Odyssey?
P.S. Someone has already told you this.
Look at that comment with <0xD0><0xA4><0xD0><0x98><0xD0><0x9B>H
Politicians have no idea what the "theme" of our presidency will be.
That's a much worse travesty than having interpreters with them.
The idea that they would approve something, because no one understood some text, is smiling.
All the important approved documents are examined word for word, for that any basic knowledge of English is not enough, it is a matter of lawyers.
Hundreds of translators and interpreters work in different EU institutions, English is better suited to politicians for informal relations, establishing superstandard relations.
In addition, with that English, it is quite interesting, after the departure of GB from the EU.
I don't understand Ceil's hatred.
I’ve been working there for the third year and it’s fine.
How many times do I get out of work at 10 p.m. and never a problem.
The fact that it is a ghetto can only be said by someone who has hardly crossed there in his life.
Yes, most of the Romani population of Brno live there, but the only thing they do is to block them in the sidewalk and park where they do not have :D certainly it is not that I would be afraid to climb out on the street in the evening.
So if you are looking for relatively cheap housing with good accessibility to the center, then I would go for it.
A lot of apartments are there now newly renovated or newly built.
Felix Slov<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek (78) without Dada and the mistress Gelemov<0xC3><0xA1> as a stake in the fence!
Who will spend Christmas with?
On Sunday, most people on the Advent wreath lit the first candle, Felix Slov<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek did not.
I don't have an Advent wreath, so there was nothing to light.
I've seen a wreath, and Lucie certainly has one too, said the saxophonist, who confirmed Patras's words that he visits her often.
He visits, but does not live in their house on Vinohrady, where Dada remained alone after his departure.
The Slovak still doesn't know where he's going on Christmas Eve.
We recently met with Ani<0xC4><0x8D>ka, Felix and our two grandchildren.
VIDEO: Felix Slov<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek and Lucie Gelemov<0xC3><0xA1>: At the Sex!
Felix Slov<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek and Lucie Gelemov<0xC3><0xA1>: At the Sex!
But we were always talking about something, so it didn't happen at Christmas.
I really don't know where I'm going.
I buy presents all the time and I'm sure I'll buy something for Dada and Lucy, maybe some perfume.
I’m a gentleman, added Felix, who himself came to the baptism of the music video for the Richman Club.
I'm here alone, but I don't feel alone.
I will always find someone I like to have fun with, says Slov<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek, who was happy to meet Lu<0xC4><0x8D>ek’s wife Sobota Adrian or singer Kamila N<0xC3><0xBD>vltova.
And he made it clear.
And we're Iceland so we can afford not to have soldiers or weapons?
I doubt someone will defend us for us, and our location is so strategic that the aggressor would have to be a complete idiot not to occupy this territory.
And I don't understand why this should be a bad argument, so you'll explain that to me?
I don't know of any other components that could be deployed in hospitals during the crisis.
There are few police officers and they can’t afford it, so firefighters and nowhere else is such a high percentage of health-trained people at such a level.
And the fact that our army is able to defend Ostrava only goes to the head of the previous governments, not the army, they have been asking for new toys for a long time.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change agricultural subsidies, the landscape should not be just a food factory, says the journalist.
The Czech Republic is going through the worst dry season in recent years.
According to the scientists, the water was in the mountainous and sub-mountain areas, a smaller amount of precipitation is also recorded in places where so far there was no need for moisture.
The cause of the drought, which is prevalent in much of Central Europe, is climate change.
However, the impacts are also reinforced by the way we deal with the soil.
What should I prepare for in connection with drought?
And how can we help nature in difficult times?
Yeah it will be, I can barely stay on ice skates, mushrooms I know what it is to play hockey and the tactics (which I tried in Franchise Hockey Manager) is also a total hallucination.
And whether you're a hockey team "Bear Russia" or "Lama China" losing two goals, even if you don't have to win a match at all costs, it's different than when compared.
But just as I listen to Czech commentators explode, what the referees do not notice whether it is men's or women's hockey, it's all weird, but it's so with all the sport, UEFA and "Italian players" or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
Controversy is everywhere.
And if it were the other way around, it's like always, and that the Czech Republic and Russia have already lost more often than they have won, it would probably be the classic "they lost" vs "WE have won".
Coronavirus: The number of infections in Russia exceeded 10 million
On Saturday, December 11, the Czech Republic recorded 9,080 daily infections.
There are 5766 people hospitalized.
A total of 34,451 people died in the Czech Republic, another 74.
Confirmed cases in the last 14 days are in the Czech Republic in 1967 per 100,000, 871 per 100,000 in the last week.
The number of infections in Russia on Sunday exceeded 10 million.
In the last 24 hours, 29,929 new infections have been registered.
It is the lowest number of days since October 13.
The total number of registered infections in Russia is 10,016,896.
The number of daily deaths is 1,132, the lowest daily death toll since the end of October.
Britain is facing an "inevitable" large wave of infection caused by Omicron, Dr. Susan Hopkins, the lead medical advisory for the British Health Safety Authority, said on Sunday.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
People infected with omicronium are already hospitalized in the UK and Hopkins expects their number to increase.
No one has died of omicron yet, but hospitalizations occur about fourteen days after the infection, and deaths occur about three weeks after the infection.
British Labour chief Keir Starmer said on Sunday that Boris Johnson allegedly broke the law by organising a Christmas quiz in Downing Street last December, when a lockdown was introduced and Christmas parties were banned.
One minister of Johnson's government argued that the quiz was conducted "virtually" through a computer.
However, he was attended by a group of employees gathered around the computers in Downing Street.
In Britain, pressure is mounting to remove Johnson from office.
During last December, when a stringent lockdown was introduced in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson’s ministers organized a number of parties despite the lockdown.
The British public and the media are angry that Johnson and his government made fun of them:
Paul Brand, editor of commercial television ITV for Britain: Two years ago, Boris Johnson won the overwhelming majority in the general election.
This morning, the Conservative Party is talking about the need to remove him from office as prime minister.
It is remarkable how quickly the events have evolved.
You want to turn around and save your skin?
Hungary is awaiting elections in the spring to end the 12-year rule of Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n.
These will be elections of European significance.
How long can we expect them to be fair?
They won't be fair.
They will probably not even be free, because that was not the case in the last two elections under Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n.
His Fidesz party controls the media, changes the boundaries of the constituencies to profit from it, and makes other little or no tricks.
In the meantime, the last one sounds like everyone can vote in practice wherever they want.
This will allow Fidesz to narrow voters from determined districts to those where the outcome is uncertain and the opposition could succeed.
So I'm just repeating that they're not fair at all.
Do you think it will be as unfair as it was in 2014 and 2018?
It's a very different situation.
It was not about whether Fidesz will win, but how much and whether he will have a constitutional majority.
Now there is a real chance that more votes and mandates will be won by the united opposition.
This is a great custom for Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n and his side.
Will they not be able to keep playing much harder?
Yes, we have some indications that they're willing to go beyond what they've done so far.
Recently, an independent media footage of the president of the parliament and one of the leaders of Fidesz L<0xC3><0xA1>szl<0xC3><0xB3> Kover has escaped, where he explains to heads of the secret services that the opposition is a threat to national security.
Are these signs of a new approach you’re talking about?
Yeah, that's one of those newspapers.
It all starts with the language.
I was bitten quite often, the last time at 14, my mom's parents don't have much patience, I don't, my daddy has her for a long time, but then it hurts extremely (only in relation to me).
At the same time, I was very choleric and angry as a little boy, to the extent that I lay on the ground in a cramp and was all blue, it took me about 2x under the shower to calm down.
Sometimes they danced to me educationally, sometimes it was more like they didn't know anymore.
Definitely now I have a tendency to deal with things by force, as a little I was quite washed, now I hit at least something to get out and as a younger I may have cried my parents over my hand (to not get too much power over my hand), so never anything extreme, extreme but
I'm not able to determine the extent to which it's my explosives, but I'm sure that education has its share in it, too.
I'm afraid I'm also going to lose my patience with all the kids and deal with it the same way.
I think that beating children is simply wrong and that my parents should not have done it, especially not at the time when it was no longer "educational," but out of frustration, on the other hand, maybe every parent just poses something, I guess not possible to give their children so much, at least three.
It doesn’t bother me at all, I don’t understand why OP should be ashamed of something.
The laws must be clear and unambiguous.
I would therefore call them the ones who make up the laws in such a quality.
Otherwise, I'd like to know if you're not afraid of an income loss.
Can you really count on people wanting and buying the product and you will have to pay for the mortgage?
The cowardly world.
Where will Slovakia move the case with the killers of the journalist Kuciak?
In Slovakia, the main prosecution begins in the process with the four accused for the murder of J<0xC3><0xA1>n Kuciak and Martina Ku<0xC5><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xAD>r.
The death of the investigative reporter and his partner changed Slovakia.
It has spread civil society, but also revealed the practices of the accused businessman Mari<0xC3><0xA1>n Ko<0xC4><0x8D>ner and his connection to the top of Slovak politics and justice.
How important will the process be for Slovakia?
Journalists can do a lot about this.
How is it possible that this petition had a lot more media attention than the anti-petition of the deans of all medical schools that came out a day or two later?
Somehow, they let themselves go, and the company blew it off.
On Czech television, he died with covid just six months ago.
The next government ends and the law on the involvement of the municipality in the selection of the repository is nowhere
Minister Karl Havl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek's proposal needs to be substantially revised
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1> is at an end and the law, which was supposed to ensure respect for the interests of the municipalities and their citizens when selecting and allowing deep storage of highly radioactive waste, still does not exist.
The Legislative Council of the Government interrupted the discussion of the proposal, which the Ministry of Industry and Commerce submitted to the Government after years of travel.
However, its content is in serious conflict not only with the affected municipalities united in the Platform against Deep Storage, but also with the Union of Cities and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
Self-governments expect from the law a more significant increase in their capacity to decide on the storage facility, which has been promised to the mayors since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began, and which is required by Czech nuclear law and European directives.
We expect the new government, in line with its coalition agreement, to rework the proposal in cooperation with the municipalities.
The draft law by Minister Karl Havl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek, who has the Platform at his disposal, highlights in particular the following: The proposed level of involvement of the municipality and the public in the decision-making process on the selection of a storage location is insufficient and cannot ensure respect for the interests of the municipality and its citizens.
It can only be really effective if the community or the public can influence whether the process will continue at a given location.
This can be ensured by depositing the obligation of the Warehouse Administration to request the consent of the municipalities concerned before the start of a specific procedure.
The submitted proposal for a substantive intention almost completely ignores the involvement of the public and makes citizens of the municipality practically mere statisticians in authorisation procedures.
The design lacks systemic compensation settings for the municipalities for the entire process of searching and selecting the location for the storage, its authorization and operation.
According to today’s legal norms, the representatives of the municipality really do not have much opportunity to defend the interests of their citizens in the search for a place for storage.
Only in certain authorisation procedures may they submit their comments or appeal, but the authority or minister in whose interest the authorisation is to be issued shall decide.
Any action shall not have an immediate effect on the conduct of investigations or construction works.
The self-government co-decision required by the Platform is a principle commonly used in many democratically developed countries, and certainly in those where they have already made progress in permitting storage facilities, such as in Sweden or Finland.
The preparation of the law is, moreover, another failure of the state administration, which hires external law firms to prepare the legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o. concluded by S<0xC3><0x9A>RAO and based on the contracts with the lawyer Jan Zem<0xC3><0xA1>nek.
According to the contract register, the total amount for these works is about 4 million kroner.
Anton<0xC3><0xAD>n Sekni<0xC4><0x8D>ka, deputy mayor of the municipality of Ceyle from Hr<0xC3><0xA1>dek and spokesperson for the Platform against Deep Storage said: “After the Ministers of Industry, who have taken the position of the municipalities towards the state authorities in the search for a more deep storage facility, we have only taken away the high levels of radioactive waste.
We also offer a helping hand.
We also thank the Union of Cities and Municipalities for their support, which sees the problem of the inadequacy of municipal rights in such essential constructions in a similar way as the directly affected municipality in the selected localities.
The Deep Storage Platform brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and 16 associations) to bring about a change in the state’s approach to managing spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not be limited to deep storage.
The platform further promotes that the decision to select a location for storage should be subject to the prior consent of the municipalities concerned.
Duke John Goodman (69) forced to lose weight fear: Shodil 90 kg.
Although he had no need to change his lifestyle for many years, he was eventually scared by doctors.
They told him if he didn't get sick, he'd die.
And it took a while.
Goodman gradually dropped 90 kilograms, which is half his original weight of 180 kilograms, reports The Sun.
His new character was featured in Los Angeles at the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers.
From the thick of the sitcom Roseanne is a completely different person!
John liked to joke that his friends and family asked him to lose weight, because his large body caused the furniture to crack.
“I put everything in my mouth,” the actor said in a 2018 interview with AARP.

It also depends on what boss you want to use the word "boss" for.
If it’s some text on the platform that expects readers from the gaming environment, I wouldn’t translate it at all.
If it were a formal text and a college text, I would probably look for a way to describe or explain the bosse.
There are more types of bosses.
Maybe a game like Dark Souls etc. has several bosses that do, and so the "boss" is something like the master / ruler of a given level, and then there is the final boss...
In many games, there are hidden bosses (super boss, hidden boss), which are not at all necessary to defeat in order for the game or level to be completed, but are often even stronger than the standard boss.
Then there are games like Half-Life, where the bosses are, but the player does not directly deal with them (Tentacle, Gargantua), and they can be called anyway?
And then there's the mini-boss.
It is not possible to translate the boss in one word or another, Czech and other languages do not solve it in any way (interesting is that you need only Catalan, which translates the bosse as the final opponent).
It is simply for a story or game of general importance, computer-controlled, opponent stronger than all previous and guarding completion of any level or task.
After Peter's disappearance from London, the whole world is searching for him.
The Czech police were also involved.
The missing Petra Srncova has been searched by British police since December 3.
The Czech police were also involved in the search.
This 32-year-old woman from Uherskohradi<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B>ska has been looking for since December 7.
At the same time, Interpol is helping the British police.
The Czech Petra Srncova was last seen by her colleagues on November 28.
British police have been searching for her since December 3.
Interpol has issued a so-called yellow circular because of it.
The whole world is looking for Peter.
“The Czech police are working closely with the British police,” police spokeswoman Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Rendlov<0xC3><0xA1> confirmed.
“We’re sharing information on the case,” she added.
The announced search for Peter has already appeared on the police website.
According to him, she is 168 centimeters tall, thin and has brown eyes and long straight hair of the same color.
It should come from Uherskohradi<0xC5><0xA1>tsk.
Petra worked as a nurse in one of London’s hospitals.
Friends and colleagues worry about her, because such a disappearance is very unusual for her.
Harriet Harman was also involved in the search for Peter.
She was involved in hanging up leaflets with Peter's face.
"We are very concerned about her," she said at a press conference on Saturday.
In connection with the disappearance, British police have already arrested one of the suspects.
However, it is not clear who it was and what it had to do with Peter.
The Czech Republic is terrorizing Agent Tesla.
While data in October indicated a slight decline in the offensive campaigns, last month with the end of the year approaching, the attacks significantly intensified.
We recorded a major campaign in connection with Agent Tesla on November 18th.
The attacks are targeted at the Czech Republic.
The strategy of the attackers remains the same for now.
The infected attachment in the email should draw the user’s attention with a name that refers to payments and financial transactions.
While last month there was a dangerous attachment in the name of the word invoice, this time it was marked as Copy of Account Repairs for 11,2021...exe," said Martin Jirkal of Esetu.
Spyware contains features that are scanned by web browsers and other programs, such as Microsoft Outlook email clients, Mozilla Thunderbird or Yandex.
The malicious code actively searches for the stored login information, which it then sends to the attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the turn of August and September and with the holidays approaching and the end of the year, the activity of the attackers is growing again.
In November, the Spyware Formbook remained active.
Unlike Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case are not specifically targeting the Czech Republic, and security specialists in November captured campaigns with a global reach.
Compared to October’s data, the Formbook weakened slightly in November, but still accounts for nearly a fifth of all detections.
The attacks continued throughout the month with increased activity on November 3, 10 and 15, respectively.
The formbook most often contained an attachment with the .exe extension, which was named REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
However, the name of the account continues to appear.
An attachment in Czech can then be much more dangerous for the Czech user.
A significant decline and mitigation of activity are recorded by security analysts in the Fareit program, which cost 1.6 percent of attacks and in the last few months had no major offensive campaign in the Czech Republic.

According to the footage of the waterfront parade and my experience of the demonstrator, I am not afraid to estimate about 10,000 people.
The people in the escort filled the waterfront and bridge and the opposite waterfront communication.
This means that people really do a lot.
To the march of some 4,000 demonstrators, an unprecedented number of people are spontaneously added.

Sometimes I get the impression that they also rent the same stage and technique.
It is difficult to say what movement could be drawn from this dissatisfaction depends not only on the inflow of money, but also on whether the three-dose vaccine from Pfizer will become a square and more dose.
It's definitely not going to be a left or center movement, bet it.
A three-dose vaccine will almost certainly become a multidose vaccine, because it is obvious that we will have to be re-vaccinated every six months.
I'm very glad that vaccines have saved us.
The brilliant action of scientists, on which humanity is rightly proud.
End of the road, Bulgaria has a new prime minister announcing change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev has commissioned the formation of the new government of Kiril Petkov from the anti-corruption movement We continue in the change that won the November elections.
It has already managed to form a government of a broad coalition, which should take office in a few days.
The political crisis in the country has been going on since April, when the previous government, under the weight of anti-corruption protests, lost the election.
However, the winning parties announcing the fight against bribery and abuse of power were not able to agree, so two more early elections followed.
What do cats do when no one is watching?
From the “secret” footage taken is a global hit.
In Britain over the weekend, concerns about the fate of the 32-year-old Czech, after which London police have been searching for several days.
Petra Srncova was last seen two weeks ago when she was going home from work to the south of the British metropolis.
According to information about the child hospital employee, she calls the police and her previous employer or a member representing the part of London where she lived.
“Petra’s disappearance is not at all like her behavior, and we are beginning to worry about her,” Lucy O’Connor of the Lambeth Police Department, where she worked, said in a video on Saturday.
“Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and just wants to know where she is,” she continued.
According to her, the missing Czech Republic left work at around 7:45 p.m. on Sunday, November 28, and headed home to Camberwell.
The last time she was seen on the bus was about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported by one of her co-workers on December 3.
According to British media, Srnc served as a “nurse nurse” at the Evelina London Children’s Hospital, which is part of the Guy’s and St Thomas’ Hospital Association.
"We are extremely concerned about our dear colleague, Peter, who is unknown," a group of medical devices said in a tweet.
“We would like to encourage anyone who could have any information that could help find her to contact the police,” the statement continued.

In <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem there was a bad month of hole in the road in the form of a canal without a cover.
It was about life.
The magistrate referred the complaints to the <0xC5><0x98>SD, to which the road belongs, and because it did not respond, the hole went on.
Finally, the authorities clarified their responsibilities and ownership, and after a month, the <0xC5><0x98>SD began to “resolve the situation intensively”.
