Thomas Bjorn, a European captain, from his own experience, knows that a high-ranking captain who is on the bench on the last day of individual competitions in a rower's cup will easily become a market for a successful career.

The German warship was once again slammed into the air.
In 2014, the German navy's newest navy was ordered to begin operations until the beginning of the warship from the Cold War era, but this year's naval battleship made it difficult to get to the point where the system and the economy of the country are going to collapse.
On the basis of the daily diet, traditionally from the singular system, the activity of the "Reinland-Petals", the large ship of the modern Mark Baden-Vietnam-Klasse Elima has been introduced in the second year of 2019.
It was believed that the ship with the navy was toppled in 2014, but the difficulties caused after the transition until the end of this great provocation changed.
Quadruple vessels of the BDV-Class were ordered from the Navy in 2007 so that the start of the ship could be converted to the upper Braim-Class.
This is how they will know that they are mighty men, and that they will set the battles against Happim, and against the ships, and against the multitude of the wise men of the seas, and against Madun, and against the signs of the sea.
Other important possibilities include long-distance patrols - it should be possible for the latest ships to be sent away from inland ports, to the Dosala Islands.
The oil signifies that if what is said, "permanent burdens" means that the ships of war will be destroyed, which will allow the Germans to carry out their foreign duties, they will be destroyed before the beginning of service.
The warship F125 had been around for the past year, when the German navy decommissioned the ship and released it to the merchant ship Blohm & Wes in Hamburg.
This was the first boat, when the sailors had come back to the ship, and had lowered the boat into the sea.
With regard to the aftermath of the raid, the ship did not have enough information, but the number of German ships indicated a number of "disturbances in the soft and heavy" which had been the result of the attack, which was the result of the attack, if in the opinion of the military.
The insufficiency was particularly important as the ships of the Baden-Weitertemberg-Klasse were to be captains of a group of 120 commanders - only nine human forces who had previously been active in the Bremen warship.
And the ship being caught and driven, and not able to bring her head to the wind, letting her go we were driven [before it], being driven along [by the wind].
The 7,000-tonne "Reinland-Kinder" ship recently passed, the weight of which is similar to that which Germany took advantage of during the Second World War.
Only in view of the severe inadequacies, the price of all the proceeds, including the employers, also made it difficult.
It should be noted that its cost is <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6bn) - <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion more than expected.
Difficulties in the latest warships, especially in light of the latest developments based on the small size of the German naval forces, are important.
On the eve of the year, Hans-Peter Bartles, a German defence committee, admitted that the naval force was originally "roboro at the shortage of ships that have to sail to Mamourite."
And he said, This has been more difficult in the past, because the priests' ships were still in service, but there was no other ship left to raise it up.
And he explained to him that none of the ships of war were able to sail with the ships of Tartim, so that they might catch the ships of the sea.
