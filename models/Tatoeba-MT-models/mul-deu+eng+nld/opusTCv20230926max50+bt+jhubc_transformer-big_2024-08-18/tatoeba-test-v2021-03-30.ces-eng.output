Would you like it?

Mary seemed to be about weddings.
No dissipation against taste.
When Tom returned home last night, he found that there was no dinner left for him.
He knows them.
I'm sure they're too proud of their daughter.
Tom turned to the right and Mary went to the other side.
There's one left.
He began to explain what had happened.
Tom has a cast-iron stomach, he can eat almost anything.

Tom left a high potion on the table.
It's not over a glass of beer after all day's work.

To be you, I'll ask him.
Leave them for us.
Here's a map.
Come on, let's get out of here.
I didn't go to the meeting even though I was invited.

Moscow is the capital of Russia.
Buy as much as you want.
Tom hesitated to mention the subject.
We drink a lot of beer here.
Would you send Tom to my office, please?
I bought it for Tom.
You shouldn't be selfish.
The old habits are rapidly disappearing today.
Tom still has a lot of work to do.
You'd better get out of here right now.

I like to read.
We cut the rope.
I don't like to disturb you, I just came to apologize.
Tom won't help us tomorrow.

It's a beautiful language.
I won't be home for a week.
Who sent you there?
We complained to the manager about the noise in the next room.
You're a kind person.

We didn't do as well as we'd like.
Please close the door when you leave.
I'll be back tonight.

Tom won't be at school today.
I'm mad at Tom.
Who is Tom visiting?
It could be Tom, not Mary.
Why don't you invite me for a drink?
Why didn't Tom answer Mary's questions?
Is she married?
Tom wanted to know where Mary was and what she was doing.
I can't answer that question.
I'm not sure what Tom bought.
There's another question.
I won't be surprised if that happens.
He's free.
That's what people don't normally say.
Ask your mother.
Tom carefully washed his feet.
Did you have breakfast this morning?
Jana was as happy as a fleas when she got the recording contract.
I wish you'd come with us.
He spends a lot of time on his computer.
We wouldn't be in this mess if you could help us.
I don't know what to do anymore.

I'm completely happy on my own.
You did what you had to.
We need to understand that we are still learning.
Tell Tom I won't be there.

Their father is Czech and their mother is from Hungary.
I'm thinking about getting a divorce.
I bought one of my bags.
Do you know where your father came from?
What are you?
Did you do it on purpose?
There was absolutely no doubt about it.
This letter is personal, I don't want anyone else to read it.
As far as I know, he's not married.
I can't say anything wrong about Tom.
Stand over there and you'll see it better.
He's old enough to stand on his own feet.
As soon as we saw what Tom was wearing, we were struck with laughter.
Tom's wrong, isn't he?
It's better to be dead than to live red.
