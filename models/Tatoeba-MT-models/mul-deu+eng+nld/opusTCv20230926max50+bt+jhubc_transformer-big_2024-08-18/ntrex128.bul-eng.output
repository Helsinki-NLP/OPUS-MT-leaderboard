Members of the Assembly of Wales are concerned that they “look like dumbbells”
Some of the members of the Assembly were deposed by the proposal to change their title to "CUP" (Members of the Welsh Parliament).
This proposal was provoked by plans to change the name of the Assembly of the "Parliament of Wales".
Members of the entire political spectrum are concerned that this may be a cause for laughter.
One of the Labour leaders said his group was worried that the new name was "remixed with Stupid and Stupid."
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, this is definitely offensive.
According to one of the members of the Plaid party, the whole group "is not happy" and has proposed alternatives.
A representative of the Welsh Conservative Party said his group was "not convinced" of the name change, but noted that the new name CCP (MWP) had a definite verbal resemblance to "blindness".
In this context, the Welsh letter W is pronounced similar to the English Yorkshire pronunciation of the letter U.
The Committee of the Assembly, which is currently drafting the draft law to change the name, made the following statement: “Of course, the final decision on all descriptive names by which the members of the Assembly are called will belong to the members themselves.”
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 gave the Assembly of Wales the power to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which established broad support for the Assembly to start calling itself the ‘Parliament of Wales’.
As far as the position of its members is concerned, the Commission prefers "members of the Parliament of Wales, in short "CPU", but the "CUP" option has received the greatest support after consultation with the public.
Members of the Assembly are proposing alternative options, but reaching a consensus is likely to be a headache for President Ellen Jones, who is expected to table the draft bill for the change within a few weeks.
The reform bill will also include other changes in the way the Assembly works, including rules on disqualification of its members, as well as the design of the commission system itself.
The members of the Assembly will have the final vote on what they will be called when they come to the discussion of the bill.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum on whether to change the name of their country
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change the name of their country to “Republic of North Macedonia”.
The referendum is planned to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, in which there is an administrative area called “Macedonia”.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor is a claim to Greek state territory, and has repeatedly objected to its attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Georgi Ivanov, who is opposed to the referendum on the change of the name of the country, has said he will not notice the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name of the country is simply the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin are silent against the backdrop of the difficulties of the churches in Harlem
“If we look from a historical perspective, according to the old people I was talking to, there was a bar and a church literally on every corner,” Adams said.
“They’re both gone today.”
Adams says the disappearance of the bars is understandable.
“People today socialize in different ways,” he adds.
“Bars are no longer the neighborhood living rooms where everyone gathers regularly.”
As for the churches, he expresses concern that the money from the sale of the assets will not reach as long as the leaders expect, “and sooner or later they will be in the same position.”
The man adds that churches can be replaced by blocks of apartments where people do not help to survive the other shrines in the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who buy housing in these buildings will be white, which will speed up the process of closing these churches, as it is not particularly likely that most of the new settlers will visit them.”
Both churches were built by white pastures before Harlem became a neighborhood for the Blacks – the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist pasture was introduced in the 1930s.
Then the building became the property of the black residents of the neighborhood.
St. Martin was a black Christian poet under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who organized a boycott against retailers on 125th Street, which is Harlem's main shopping street, because they didn't want to give it to him.
In 1939, the building suffered heavy casualties in a fire, but Father Johnson's parishioners drafted a plan for its restoration and ordered the bells.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin, proudly calls them "poor bells".
The expert, who used the bells in July, has a different description: “Cultural treasure” and “an indispensable historical tool.”
The relevant expert, Tiffany Nguyen of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first bell system in the world to be used by a black musician – Dionysio A. Linde, who transferred to the larger system in the Riversa church for 18 years.
Mr. Meriwaeder mentions that St. Martin's has never been replaced.
What has been going on in St. Martin’s over the past few weeks has been a complex tale, woven by architects and performers, some brought by the church’s secular leaders, and others by the episcopal diocese.
From the diocese – which is the governing body of the pastorate, consisting of secular leaders – they wrote to the diocese in July, expressing their concerns that the diocese “would be inclined to transfer the expenses of the diocese from the diocese to the diocese, and the diocese did not have a role in the diocese.
Some parishioners have complained about the diocese’s lack of transparency.
13-year-old boy injured by shark in California lobster hunt
The shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday as he dived for lobsters in California on the first day of the hunting season, the representative authorities said.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hamle told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had dived with friends about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy scream for help and went in with a whole group to get him out of the water.
Hamle first thought that the child had caught lobster and was excited, then realized how he was yelling, “Biss me!
It bites me!"
Hamle said that when he reached the boy, he realized that the entire area of his key had been ripped apart.
“I’ve called everyone out of the water because there’s a shark!” adds Hamle.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the Radi Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted in critical condition.
It is not yet known what type of shark was responsible for the attack.
Rescue Captain Larry Giles told a news briefing that a shark had been spotted in the water a few weeks earlier, but it was deemed not to be a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper part of her body.
The authorities have shut down access to the coastline from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Suomi in Ensitinas for 48 hours for security reasons while the investigation is underway.
Giles notes that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, most of which do not pose a threat to humans.
Sainsbury is planning an offensive on the UK market for stunning products
Sainsbury faces Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by opening stands for stunning products in its facilities, where customers will be served by special assistants.
As part of a significant offensive in the UK market for beauty products, which is estimated to be <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion and continues to grow, while sales of fashion and household products in the aftermath will be downsizing in countries, the 11 largest to date will be downsizing in products.
The investment turn in the beautifying industry is made at a time when supermarkets are looking for ways to use the free space on the shelves previously occupied by TVs, microwaves and other household appliances.
Sainsbury said they would double the number of stunning products offered to 3000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The current product ranges from L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also gain more space, similar to the Boots stores offers.
The supermarket is also relaunching its boutique makeup range so that most products can be used by vegans – something that is increasingly sought after by younger consumers.
In addition, fragrance retailer Fragrance Shop will test discount programs at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Crawden, South London last week, while the second will be opened in Sally Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Shopping online and a shifting focus on shopping for smaller amounts of food daily at convenient moments leads to the need for supermarkets to put more effort into attracting buyers.
Mike Cope, Sainsbury’s chief executive, said the facilities will look more and more like universal stores, while the supermarket chain is trying to fight off discounters Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food goods.
Sainsbury has Argos’ facilities in hundreds of stores, as well as Habitats’ facilities since they bought both chains two years ago — which the company claims has increased food sales and made the gains even more lucrative.
The previous attempt by the supermarket chain to redesign its facilities for aesthetic and pharmaceutical products has been unsuccessful.
Sainsbury made a joint experiment with Boots at the beginning of the new century, but the association ended after a dispute over the distribution of profits from the pharmaceutical company's facilities in supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed after Sainsbury sold its pharmaceutical business with 281 properties to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
Lloyds will play a role in the plan by providing a rich range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s Chief Commercial Officer, said: “We have transformed the look and feel of our stunning stands to improve the overall experience for our customers.
We have also invested in special training of our colleagues, who will offer professional advice on the spot.
The range of brands offered by us is designed to meet every taste and everything you need in a captivating setting with a convenient location, and this combination makes us an attractive destination for stunning products that challenges the concept of the old way of keeping."
Peter Jones "angry" after Holly Willby's refusal of a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Dragons star Peter Jones has been "angry" after television star Holly Willuby dropped an 11-million-pound deal with his lifestyle company to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willuby doesn't have time for truly branded household appliances and accessories.
The pair's business is compared to Guinness Poltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old star of “This Morning” has announced her departure on Instagram.
Holly Willaby left the Dragons Den Peter Jones star "to boil" after pulling out of their lucrative business with the lifestyle brand at the last minute - in order to focus on her own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was “angry” when the “golden girl” on television admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts were worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million, meaning she had no more time.
The business is similar to Gwyneth Poltrow’s Goop brand, with rumors of having doubled Willuby’s wealth, which is projected to be <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willuby, 37, announced on Instagram her departure from Truly, Jones left the UK by plane to go to one of her vacation properties.
One of the sources shared the following: “Truely was definitely Holly’s highest priority.
It was expected to be her long-term commitment to secure her future over the next few decades.
Her decision to leave boils absolutely all of them completely unprepared.
No one thought that this could happen on Tuesday, so close to the start.
There is a warehouse at the Marlowe plant that is full of waiting products to be sold.”
Experts believe the withdrawal of this morning’s lead star, which is one of Britain’s most successful stars, could cost the company millions due to the huge investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and household products.
And last but not least, it can also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willuby, who is the mother of three, along with her husband Dan Baldwin, has been a close friend of Jones and his wife Tara Cap for ten years.
Willabee herself founded Truly together with Cap in 2016, as Jones, who is 52, joined as the company’s chairman in March.
The two families often go on vacation together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become the brand’s “ambassador” for M&S and will also replace Ann McParlin as the lead on ITV’s “I’m a Celebrity.”
A source close to Jones made the following statement last night: “We will not comment on his business affairs.”
Difficult Negotiations Leading to a “Strengthening of Relations”
He joked about the criticism he would have received from the news channels for making a comment that some would consider “unfit for the president” and too positive for the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump responded in his “journalistic” way.
“I have given up nothing.”
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after the first one was held in Singapore in June and was declared by Trump as a “great step toward the elimination of North Korea’s nuclear weapons.”
But negotiations for the elimination of this weapon are stagnant.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told UN General Assembly representatives that North Korea “sees no reciprocal relationship” by the United States to the country’s first steps along the way.
Instead, the diplomat noted that the United States is continuing with the sanctions, which are aimed at maintaining the tension.
In his speech, Trump presented a much more optimistic view of things.
"Our relations with North Korea are wonderful," he said.
“We were at war with this country.
Millions of people would be killed.
Instead, we are now enjoying a wonderful relationship with each other.”
The president said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had resulted in positive results — cessation of missile tests, the release of hostages and the return of the bodies of U.S. military personnel.
He also defended his unorthodox approach to negotiations with Kim.
“It’s extremely easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded area, we’d have about 200 people right there,” Trump said.
Tsunami and earthquakes in Indonesia devastate the island and cause hundreds of deaths
After the earthquake in Lombok, foreign non-governmental organizations were declared that they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population were forced to leave their homes, no national disaster was declared, which is a requirement for initiating international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, there is an unequivocal view that international aid is not sought, which makes things a little challenging,” she said.
While “Save the Children” is teaming up to go to Palu, it is not yet certain whether foreign personnel will be allowed to operate on the country’s territory.
The national spokesman for the disaster agency, Mr Sutopo, said Indonesian authorities were currently assessing the situation in Palu in order to decide whether international agencies were allowed to contribute to the recovery efforts.
Given the ongoing earthquakes in Indonesia, the country remains unprepared for this kind of natural disasters.
Although shelters were built in Aceh in the event of a tsunami, they are not a common sight on the other shores.
The apparent absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu has probably contributed to the loss of life, although a warning has been issued.
Even under the best conditions, transport between the many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters complicate this logistics even more.
Recently stationed in Lombok to serve the victims of the earthquake, a hospital ship has gone to Palu, but it will be at least three days before he manages to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of Indonesia’s remaining infrastructure the centerpiece of his election campaign by investing a large amount of funds in roads and railways.
But insufficient finances are constantly harassing his office, as Joko re-opens the dungeon the following year.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure from ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands were forced to leave their homes, while Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machetes, bows and arrows, as well as other primitive weapons.
Watch: Daniel Stridge Brings Late Equality to Liverpool vs Chelsea
Daniel Stirge saved Liverpool from a loss in the Premier League against Chelsea with an 89th-minute goal this Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Stirridge received a lead from Gerdan Shakiri about 27-28 meters from Chelsea's door, while his team was behind 1-0.
He placed the ball on his left leg, then made a precise shot at the far corner of the door.
The ball flew over the penalty area and headed to the top right corner of the net.
She transferred the plumber Kepa Arisabalaga and intertwined inexorably in the net.
“I tried to take a good position to master the ball because players like Shack are always looking for submissions in front positions, so I just tried to earn as much time as possible for a good shot at the door,” Stirge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Cante, I pushed my ball and I just shot without thinking much about it.”
Chelsea led 1-0 in the 25th minute after a goal for Belgian star Eden Azar.
The attacker of the "blue" handed the heel to Mateo Kovacic, then sprinted from the middle of the field to the half of Liverpool.
The forger exchanged a quick double serving in the center.
He then released a quick shotgun, with which he brought Azar to a clear position in the criminal field.
Azar ran over the defenders and scored with his left foot in the far corner next to Liverpool goalkeeper Alison Becker.
Liverpool will face Naples in the group stage of the Champions League at 15:00 this Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea’s next opponent will be Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 15:00 on Thursday in London.
The number of deaths from the tsunami in Indonesia has increased to 832
The death toll after the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, the country’s disaster agency reported early Sunday.
Crowds of people have been trapped among the ruins of buildings that collapsed after the 7.5-magnitude earthquake hit the country on Friday and led to waves up to 20 feet high, Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a spokesman for the news conference, reported.
The city of Palu with a population of over 380,000 is besieged with ruins from snails built.
Police Arrest 32-Year-Old Man Suspected of Murder After Woman Became Murdered
A murder investigation has been launched after a woman's body was discovered in Berkenhead this morning.
The remains of the 44-year-old woman were found at 7:55 a.m. with injuries from a sneezing of Grayson Muzz on John Street, with a 32-year-old man arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police are asking for assistance from everyone in the area who has seen or heard nothing.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is still at an early stage, but I urge everyone who has been close to John Street in Burkenhead and has seen or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have shot something with the cameras on their dashboard, to contact us as it is possible to have vital information for the investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Berkenhead and that she was found in a private property.
This afternoon a group of friends, who consider the woman to be their acquaintance, arrived on the spot and questioned where she was found on the morning.
The investigation continues as police say they are currently informing the victim’s relatives.
A taxi driver who lives on Grayson Muzz has tried to get home to his apartment, but has been informed by the police that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
The man remained silent when he learned of what had happened.
Residents have been informed that it will be hours before they are allowed to return home.
One of the police officers reported to a man that the entire area was being treated as a crime scene.
There was a crying woman on the spot.
She kept repeating, “It’s so horrible.”
At 2 p.m., two police vans crossed the border, while another van stayed outside.
There are police officers on the border who are watching the housing block.
Anyone with the information is asked to contact <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111, code 247 on September 30.
The Parliamentary statue of Cromwell becomes the newest memorial hit by “rewriting history”
Her ban would be poetic justice for his near-Taliban destruction of so many of the English cultural and religious artifacts that was carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But Cromwell's Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "an insanity" and an "experiment to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, the chairman of Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in the current debate on removing statues of Oliver Cromwell from Westminster Palace to become a goal.
The iconic battle of the English Civil War was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be made a victim because of the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent performance of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Tornickroft is evidence of the opinion in the 19th century and part of the historiography of a figure that many still regard as worthy of respect.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Kromuel is considered by many, perhaps even more in the 19th century, than today, to be a defender of parliament against external pressure, and in his case, of course, it is the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate presentation is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
What is certain is the conflict in the middle of the 17th century, which has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a clearly recognizable person, representing one side of the split.
His accomplishments as a Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and celebrated.”
Pig Killer Injures Deadly Chinese Farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwestern China, local media reported.
The man, identified only by his surname as Yuan, was found dead with a broken artery and covered in blood near a chimney at Liupanshui Market in Guangzhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
The pig breeder prepared to inject his pigs with vaccines on May 30, 2005 in Xinin, Qinhai Province, China.
He and his cousin from neighbouring Yunnan province are believed to have arrived on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and he also welded the door to the neighboring carriage open.
He also reported that there was a large male pig with a bloody turkey in the cab.
The forensic investigation has confirmed that the 550-pound pig attacked a deadly farmer, the report reports.
“My cousin’s legs were bleeding and deformed,” said cousin Wu, quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
A security camera footage shows Juan going to the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday morning to feed his pigs.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The animal killer did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The head of the market told Evening News that the pig had been locked so that it could not attack anyone else as the police collected evidence of the crime scene.
It is also reported that Yuan’s family and market leadership are negotiating compensation for the death toll.
Although they are rare, and have previously been reported of pigs attacking humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, with the man suffering critical injuries after the attack.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound pig was hooked by a Welsh farmer to his tractor while his wife managed to drive him out.
After an Oregonian farmer was eaten by his own pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a “spuggle.”
“They’re just playing.
Pigs are like little kids, they're very curious... they're not meant to hurt anyone.
But you also have to treat them with respect,” the man concludes.
Weakening Hurricane Rose Will Lead to Frequent and Flooding Rains in Southwestern United States
According to the weather forecast, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves over the cold waters of Mexico’s northern coast.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will cause flooding rains in northern Mexico and the southwestern parts of the United States.
Rosa includes winds of 85 miles per hour, which is a Category 1 hurricane at around 5 a.m. on Sunday, east time, and is located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rose is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific Ocean, the synclin begins to form, which moves eastwards to the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the peninsula of Baha California on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, it will begin to squeeze into the tropics.
On Monday, Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in some areas of Mexico.
Over the next few days, the tropical humidity along with the approaching synclin will create frequent heavy rains in the southwest.
At the local level, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous and rapid flooding, suffering debris flows and probable landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity will cause precipitation of 2 to 3 inches per hour in certain locations, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some parts of the southwest, it is expected to rain 2 to 4 inches, especially over most of Arizona.
It is possible to have lightning floods under rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rains.
It would be extremely unwise to travel a handful in the desert when there is a threat of tropical rains.
Heavy rain can turn the canyons into stormy rivers, and thunderstorms will lead to uplifted dust and gusty winds.
The approaching Sinclair will cause heavy rains in some parts of California’s southern coastline.
It is possible to reach rainfall of more than half an inch, which will lead to carried small waste streams and sliding roads.
This will be the first rainfall in the rainy season.
On late Sunday and early Monday, scattered clouds carrying tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona before the rains cover a larger area on late Mondays and on Tuesdays.
Heavy rain will spread over the four corners on Tuesday and will continue until Wednesday.
October may bring large temperature fluctuations in the United States as the Arctic Ocean cools, but the tropics remain warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in the temperature at short distances.
On Sunday, there is a wonderful example of dramatic temperature changes in the central part of the United States.
There is a nearly 20-degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and De Moyne, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the rest of the summer heat will try to rise and expand.
In most of the central and eastern U.S., there is expected to be a warm start in October, with temperatures expected to dominate around 80 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
The temperature in New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which will be about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a high probability of above-average temperatures in the eastern part of the United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Bret Kavanaugh’s audition
More than 20 million people watched Thursday on six television networks the fascinating scene of the testimony of Supreme Court nominees Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blaise Ford – the woman who accused him of sexual assault in the 80s during the 20s.
Meanwhile, the political opposition continued, with the networks interrupting their regular reversal programs in the last minutes of Friday: a deal arranged by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake and according to which the FBI should conduct a one-week investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee she was 100 percent convinced that Kavanaugh had been pushing her drunk and trying to take off her clothes during a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in his devoid of emotion testimony, is absolutely categorical that such a thing has not happened.
It is likely even more than the 20.4 million viewers reported by Nielsen had seen the testimony on Friday.
The company has listed average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There was no data directly available for the other networks that broadcast the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Also, Nielsen has traditionally had difficulty measuring the number of people watching from their jobs.
For comparison, we’re talking about an audience similar in size to that of a championship football match or the Hollywood awards.
The Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, is the first of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the full-day hearing, Nielsen reports.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million, NBC - 2.94 million, MSNBC - 2.89 million and CNN - 2.52 million.
Interest remained high even after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican's office came out with a statement that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras filmed Friday how protesters cheered him as he tried to grab an elevator for a Judicial Commission meeting.
During all the harassment for a few minutes, he never looked up from the ground, which was broadcast live on CNN.
“I’m right here, standing in front of you,” said one woman.
“Do you think he presents the truth to the state?
“You have power, while many women are completely helpless,” the attacks continued.
Flake replied that they had already come out of his office with a statement, and before closing the elevator doors, he announced that he would make a further statement during the hearing by the committee.
Cable and broadcasting networks provided close coverage live a few hours later, when the Judiciary Commission had to decide whether to transfer Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate for the vote.
Ala Flake said he would only do so if he was sure that the FBI would review the charges against the nominees next week, which the opposition Democrats are insisting.
Flake was partially convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Party Senator Chris Cuens.
After a conversation with Queens and a few Senators, Pleck made the decision.
His choice was definitely important, as it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has ordered the FBI to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May Accuses Critics of ‘Political Playing’ With Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of “political play” with Britain’s future and of undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom on September 29, 2018. . . .
In another interview published with her on the front page of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister, Boris Johnson, intensified his attack on her so-called "Dame's Game Plan" about the Brexit abruptly, saying that the collection of customs duties was a "abrupt" for Brexit.
The shooting of Wade Sims: Police Arrest Suspected LSU Player's Death by Dean Simpson
Police have arrested a suspect in a fatal shooting at Wade Simms, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
The 20-year-old Simpson has been arrested and jailed on second-degree murder charges, the Batton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials presented a video of the confrontation between Simms and Simpson, with police reporting that Simms had lost his glasses during the battle.
Police discovered the glasses on the spot and also found Simpson's DNA on them, according to the CBS branch of WAFB.
After Simpson's interrogation, the police announced that he had confessed to the fatal shooting at Wade.
His bail is set at $350,000, reported by Advocate.
East Batton Rouge's forensic service released a preliminary report on Friday that cited a gunshot wound to the head and neck as the cause of death.
The authorities expressed their gratitude to the Louisiana State Police Refugee Search Department, the Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police, and the locals for the help they provided in the investigation that contributed to the arrest.
LSU’s athletic sports director Joe Aleva thanked local law enforcement for “temporary justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The tall 6-foot and 6-inch player grew up in Batton Rouge, where his father Waynes also played basketball for the LSU team.
In the last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade reported that the team was "struck" and "shocked" after Wade's death.
Wade said, “It’s something that worries a person all the time.”
Volcano spreads ash over Mexico City
The ash ejected from the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern quarters of Mexico’s capital.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexican citizens on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater increased and 183 gas and ash discharges were recorded in the last 24 hours.
The center watched a lot of cowardice and tremors.
Photos posted on social media show a thin layer of dust that covers the front windows of cars in some of Mexico City’s neighborhoods, such as Hokimilco.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in the activity of the volcano, which is located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital, since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, also known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists on the occasion of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence protesters clashed with the gendarmerie, when thousands joined the opposition demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarizing vote of ouster.
A group of masked separatists, who were not allowed by the gendarmerie, began to measure the guards of the world with eggs and powder paint, thus creating dark and dusty clouds on the streets that are usually crowded with tourists.
Later in the day there were other clashes with the police, as the police resorted to their own sticks to take over the situation.
For hours in support of independence, groups shouted “Don’t forget, don’t forgive”, while those who declared to preserve the integrity of the country responded with “Spain Forever”.
Local media reported that as a result of the protests, fourteen people have received medical care for minor injuries.
Tensions remain high in the desirable independence region even a year after a referendum held on October 1 was deemed illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by separatist-minded Catalans.
The vast majority voted to vote for independence, although the activity was low, as most opponents of the secession boycotted the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting in polling stations in the region with a series of violent clashes.
Independence-seeking groups spent Friday night on the street in order to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
However, the demonstration took place, but she was forced to go on a different route.
Narcissus Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who joined the separatist protest with his wife, says he no longer hides hope for Catalonia's chances of gaining independence.
“Last year was one of our best moments.
“I saw my parents cry with joy when they could vote, but now it looks like we’re stuck.”
Despite the notable important victory of the regional elections last December, the Catalan political parties in favour of the independence of Catalonia are experiencing difficulties this year, as many of their most well-known leaders are either in self-imposed, self-imposed, or self-imposed.
Joan Peugeot, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded a protest on his phone in support of the police, said the conflict was provoked by politicians on both sides.
His comment is that “it’s getting more and more tense.”
On Saturday, Oriol Hunkeras, one of nine Catalan leaders arrested in anticipation of a preliminary process last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament elections next year.
“My candidacy for the European elections is the best way to oppose the regression of democratic values and the repression we are witnessing by the Spanish government,” he said.
Londoners: Arrested men after car crashed into house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39, respectively, were arrested after a car hit a house in Londondery several times.
The incident took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19:30 British time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemings has announced that damage has been done to both the gate and the building itself.
It is also possible that the car was shot with an arballet.
Menga's goal brings Livingston's victory 1-0 over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secures victory
The newcomer in the Higher League surprised the Rangers and caused only a second loss to Steven Gerard in his first 18 games as manager of the club at Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's goal proved decisive, and Gary Holt's team leveled by points with the second in the Hibernian ranking.
Gerard's team remains without a foreign field victory in the Higher League this season, and the following Sunday he faces manager Harts, from whom he is behind by eight points in the standings.
But before that, Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston is already in a series of six games without a loss in the championship, and manager Holt has still not felt the taste of the loss since he switched to Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses good chances against homeless guests
Holt's team had to lead the score well before scoring a goal, and his direct style of play made the Rangers extremely difficult.
Scott Robinson tried the defense, but his blow passed to the side, after which Allen Litgow shot along the grid after Craig Halket returned the ball with his head to him.
The hosts let the Rangers play the ball, knowing that they could seriously make it difficult for the guests from static positions.
And that’s how he got to the winning goal.
The Rangers committed a foul, and Livingston played well, as Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined and brought out Menga, who led the ball and scored from the middle of the penalty area.
Up to that point, the Rangers had mastered the ball more, but faced the unbreakable defense of the hosts, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly rarely had to intervene.
This style of play continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a save.
Rangers' goalkeeper saved Scott Pittman's kick, and a blow to Littlelow's head passed through the door after another static position for Livingston.
In the penalty area of Livingston centred, however, which was easily cleared, and the judge twice did not respect the guests' claims of the dup – first after a single fight between Halket and the Glen Middleton reserve, and then in case of doubt about the game.
“Phenomenal” by Livingston – analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal game and a great result for Livingston.
The team plays just superbly, continuing to surpass expectations and improve their performance.
The style of the game and the composition barely changed after the team returned to the Higher League, but Holt deserves a lot of praise for the way he transformed the team after his appointment.
He has real heroes on the field.
Captain Chalket was amazing, organizing the defense in a superb way, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Warrel under tension.
At the same time, Rangers did not show anything inspiring.
Under Gerard's leadership, they demonstrate some great things, but in the case they were far below these standards.
They missed the last pass before the goal, and only once managed to break the home team’s defense – this loss must awaken the Rangers, who are currently in the middle of the rankings.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an receives mixed reception in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th) we witnessed smiles and blue spaces when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This was the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations between NATO allies.
The friendship cools because of problems affecting human rights, freedom of the media and Turkey’s acceptance in the EU.
After that, Erdogan went to Cologne to discover a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest group of Turks living outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police prevented a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but nevertheless many supporters slammed around who wanted to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, many of them Kurds, also raised their voices, condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to allow him into the country.
The various protests reflect the rupture caused by a visitor who is considered a hero by some German Turks and at the same time is despised as a despot by others.
Deptford Road Crash: A Rider Rests After A Car Collision
A cyclist has died after a car crash in London.
The disaster occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the southeastern part of the city, around 10:15 a.m. British time.
The driver of the car stopped and medical help arrived, but nevertheless the cyclist died on the spot.
The crash comes a few months after another cyclist died after being hit by a runaway driver on Childers Street, located about a mile from the scene of the Saturday crash.
The city police said that her employees are working on the identification of the man, after which they will notify his relatives.
The road is closed and the bus lines are diverted, and it is also recommended for motorists to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Surveillance Officers Injured in Jail
Six prison guards were injured in a riot in a male prison with a high level of security, according to the Office of Prisons.
The quake erupted at Long Lartin Prison in Worcester at around 9:30 a.m. British time on Sunday and is still ongoing.
In order to master it, special officers from the Tordano unit have been summoned, who will have to deal with eight detainees, such as the beating itself in a limited wing of the prison.
The injured bodyguards suffered minor injuries to the face and received medical attention on the spot.
A spokesman for the Office of Prisons said: “Specially trained staff have been called in to deal with the incident at Long Lartin Prison.
Six supervisors have received medical attention.
“We do not tolerate any violence in our prisons and we make it extremely clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and that their sentences may be extended.”
There are more than 500 inmates in Long Lartin prison, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that after the attack on a prisoner, the director of the prison had to be treated in a hospital.
Also in October last year, police from the anti-revolutionary units were called to the prison, where they could master a heavy blow, in which the staff was attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens flash flooding in Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City (although dry areas may benefit)
It’s rare for Arizona to be hit by a tropical storm, but it’s likely that this will happen early next week, as debilitating Hurricane Rosa moves through the southwest desert, carrying a risk of lightning flooding.
The National Meteorological Service has already established spots against lightning floods on Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, in southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including in the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a different route over Phoenix on Tuesday, as it may bring rain on late Monday.
The National Meteorological Service of Phoenix tweeted that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have sustained tropical storms within 200 miles of Phoenix!!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 2 to 4 inches of rain with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches in Mogolon Rome, Arizona.
Other areas of the southwest desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, will likely receive 1 to 2 inches of rain, with up to 4 inches of precipitation possible in some places.
For those who are not at risk of lightning floods, the rain caused by the Rose may actually be a blessing, as the region is severely affected by drought.
Although floods are extremely serious concerns, some of the rains are likely to be useful, as the southwestern part is currently on land.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitoring Commission, just over 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least excessive drought, which is the second heaviest category.
First, Hurricane Rosa's path leads to landfall on the Baha California peninsula in Mexico.
The rose, which on Sunday morning still boasts a maximum wind speed of 85 miles per hour, is located 385 miles from Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm encounters colder waters over the Pacific Ocean and therefore weakens.
As a result, it is expected to reach land near Mexico with the force of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
The rain over part of Mexico can be severe and lead to a significant risk of flooding.
“We expect total rainfall of up to 6 inches from the Baha California to northwestern Sonora, with up to 10 inches possible,” weather.com reported.
Rosa will then head north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then pass through Arizona in southern Utah until late Tuesday night.
"The main risk of Rosa or its consequences is extremely heavy rainfall in the Baha California, northwestern Sonora and desert southwestern United States," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These rains are expected to lead to life-threatening lightning floods and various waste streams in the deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsummer Northen Assault: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The wounded boy was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsummer North at around 04:00 a.m. British time on Saturday.
It is placed in a hospital, where its condition remains “stable”.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, police in Aven and Somerset said.
The police are asking everyone who may have captured what happened to them to contact them.
Trump says Kavanaugh "has suffered from the greed and anger" of the Democratic Party
“Every vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that rejects the deceptive and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Willingdon, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had “suffered from the greed and anger” of the Democratic Party during his nomination.
Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress on Thursday, categorically rejecting Christine Blaise Ford’s accusation of sexual assault decades ago at a time when the two were teenagers.
Ford also testified during the indictment's hearing.
The president made a statement on Saturday that “today the American people have witnessed the intelligence, courage and qualities” of Kavanaugh.
“Any vote in favor of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote in favor of one of the most brilliant legal minds of our century, a true lawyer with a great reputation in the service of the public,” the president told a crowd of supporters from West Virginia.
The president indirectly addressed Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke about the importance of Republican votes for the general election.
“There are five weeks left to one of the most important elections of our time.
“Although I’m not a candidate, I’m actually participating too,” Trump said.
“That’s why I’m running around and fighting in support of good candidates.”
Trump said the Democrats had set themselves a mission to “obstruct and obstruct.”
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, one of the senior representatives of the Republican party told CNN.
Hundreds are dying after earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia, the number of victims increases
At least 384 people have lost their lives after many were taken away from the ravaged coast by gigantic waves when a severe earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when at dinner the coast was swollen by waves as high as six meters (18 feet), taking many to their death and destroying everything along their way.
The tsunami hit after an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5.
"When the threat of a tsunami rose yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not flee immediately, which is why many became the victim of the disaster," said Indja Bia Biagio in Jakarta.
“The water had taken with it cars, trees, entire houses, hit everything on its way,” Nugroho continued, adding that the tsunami had crossed the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 m/h) before it hit the coast.
“Some people climbed the trees and so managed to save themselves from the water,” he added.
Nearly 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Disaster photos from the air, published by the agency, showed multiple destroyed buildings and shops, demolished and twisted bridges, as well as a water-circulated mosque.
Secondary quakes continued to sway the coastal city on the Sabbath day.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area inhabited by 2.4 million people.
Indonesia’s Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) has issued a statement saying that the energy released from Friday’s massive earthquake was about 200 times stronger than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The declaration also mentions that the geographic location of the city, which is located at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as “huge” and specified that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been demolished.
The bodies of some of the victims were found under the ruins of the crashed buildings, the spokesman added, after adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the victims and damage could be higher along the coast at 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the panty.
He also added that “the communications are completely intercepted and there is no information from Donggala.”
The Red Cross, in turn, said more than 300,000 people were living there, adding that its teams and volunteers had already made their way to the affected areas.
“It’s already a tragedy, but it can get even worse.”
On Saturday, the agency was vehemently criticized for not informing about the Palu tsunami, although officials explained that the waves had arrived at the time of the announcement.
Shared on social media, amateur clips show a man on the upper floor of the building screaming to people on the street panic warnings of the approaching tsunami.
After a few minutes, a huge water wall bumps into the coast and applies to both cars and buildings.
Reuters was unable to verify the authenticity of the video in a timely manner.
The earthquake and tsunami led to a severe power outage, which halted communications around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army began to send cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, the authorities said, but the evacuated still desperately need food and other essential products.
The city’s airport was reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit the evacuation centers in Pali on Sunday.
The death toll in the Indonesian tsunami is over 800.
The situation is extremely bad.
While employees of World Vision from Donggala have managed to get safely to Palu, where they have found shelter in tarpaulin shelters crisscrossed in their office yard, they have passed a number of scenes of devastation, Mr. Doseba says.
“They told me they’ve seen countless houses destroyed.”
The situation is extremely bad.
Despite the beginning of work on rescue and recovery operations emergency groups, some complain that those with rich experience in such situations are prevented from reaching Palu by foreign rescuers.
According to Indonesian regulations, the funding, dispatch of personnel and supplies from abroad can only be started if the affected site is declared a national disaster zone.
And that hasn't happened yet.
“The disaster is still at the regional level,” said Aulia Ariani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“Once the government has announced that it is a national disaster, we can accept international aid, but they have not yet declared such a status.”
As the second night of the Friday earthquake and tsunami falls over Palu, the friends and families of those still in ignorance continue to hope for a miracle and that their loved ones have somehow survived the natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken out of the sewer.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who had been smashed under the ruins for two days along with her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of Indonesia's national paragliding team, has trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Championship, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Among those trapped in the Roa-Roa hotel were his students, Mr. Mandagi added.
“As a senior in the paragliding field, I carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon recalled that in the hours after the news of the collapse of the hotel "Roa-Roa" reached the paragliding community, he desperately sent messages on WhatsApp to the competitors in Palu, who participated in the beach festival.
Instead of a pair of blue markings, however, the only answer to his messages was a single gray one.
“I think that means the messages have not been delivered,” he added.
Thieves raise $26,750 while charging an ATM in Newport on Levi
On Friday morning, thieves raised $26,750 from a Brink employee who charged an ATM in Newport on Levi, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car has emptied the ATM in the amusement complex and has prepared to charge it with money, Detective Denis Makarti writes in the message.
While the man was busy, another man “came up running behind the back of Brink’s employee” and stole a bag of money.
Witnesses have noticed many suspects fleeing the scene, the message continues, but police have not indicated the number of those involved in the theft.
Anyone who has information on the identity of the suspects must contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper Changes His Name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changed his name to Yee.
Along with the announcement of the change on Twitter on Saturday, he also wrote: “The Man Officially Known as Kanye West.”
West, 41, has been wearing the acronym Ye for some time and has been using it as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change preceded his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He replaced singer Ariana Grande on the show, who declined “for emotional reasons,” the show’s creator told us.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West had previously claimed that the word had religious significance for him.
“I believe that ‘yee’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, where it means ‘you’ or ‘you’,” West shared earlier this year while discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
“I am you, I am us, it is us.
He passed from Kanye, which means only one person, just to Him – which is a reflection of the good in us, the evil, the confusion, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of our essence.”
The rapper is one of many famous in his field who changed his name.
Sean Combs has a number of nicknames and nicknames, including Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the pseudonyms Lion and Brother Lion.
One of West's previous collaborators, Jay Zee, has also performed in a variant with or without indents and/or capital letters in his recital.
Mexico's President vows not to use the military against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andrés Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force as the country nears the 50th anniversary of bloody repression against students.
On Saturday in Tlatelolco Plaza, President L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador promised "never to use the army to repress the Mexican people."
Soldiers fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people, while left-wing student movements gradually spread across Latin America.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador took an oath to support young Mexicans by providing monthly scholarships to students and opening more free public universities.
The president also concluded that unemployment and the lack of access to education attract young people to criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double the funding for the development of AI
As China becomes increasingly active on the AI front, the U.S. must double its budget for research in this area, said AI researcher and developer Kai-Fu Loi, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment was made after various units of the U.S. government made statements on the topic of AI, although the U.S. generally does not have an official strategy for AI.
At the same time, China presented its plan last year: the country aims to become the number 1 innovation in AI by 2030.
“Doubling the budget for developing AI would be a good start, given that all other countries are far ahead of the United States and are about to make further breakthroughs in terms of AI,” Lee said.
Doubling funding could also double the chances of the next major AI achievement coming from the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview last week.
Lee, whose book “The Superpowers of AI: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the largest AI companies in China – Face<0x2B>.
In the 1980s at Carnegie University, Melanie Lee worked on an AI system that defeated the most successful hotel player in America, after which he was CEO of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee gave what he owed to the federal government’s previous technology competitions, such as the Agency’s Robotics Competition for Advanced Defense Research Projects, and asked when the next one would be to help identify new visionaries.
“U.S. investigators often have to work hard to earn funding from the government,” Lee said.
“It’s not China that takes away academic leaders, it’s corporations,” he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired university lights to work on AI.
Lee also argues that changes in immigration policy can help the U.S. strengthen its AI program.
“I think that doctors of AI sciences should automatically be offered green cards,” he said.
The U.S. State Council announced its plan to develop the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences of China provides funding for people from academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations fund researchers in the U.S., but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Center on Artificial Intelligence, which aims to include partners from the industry and academic backgrounds, and the White House announced the creation of a Special Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
Also this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As far as the NSF is concerned, they are currently investing more than $100 million a year in the development of AI.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislature, which wanted to establish a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, has not noted any activity for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on whether to change the name of their country
Macedonia’s citizens voted in a referendum on Sunday whether the country’s name should be changed to “Republic of North Macedonia”. This is a move that would resolve the decades-long dispute with Greece that blocks Macedonia’s membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, where there is an area called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor represents claims against its territorial integrity, which is why it imposes a veto on its membership in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist-minded opponents say the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia’s Slavic majority.
President George Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, while a campaign to boycott him cast a shadow of doubt as to whether the referendum would reach the minimum 50 percent required for the recognition of the validity.
The bulletin question reads: “Do you support NATO and EU membership by adopting the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, which includes Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price is worth paying to achieve the entry of the formed after the collapse of the Yugoslav state of Macedonia into organizations such as the EU and NATO.
“Today I came to give my vote for the future of the country, for the young Macedonians, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska, a 79-year-old citizen of Skopje.
Although the referendum does not have a binding force, enough Members of Parliament have said that they will comply with the result of it to such an extent that the vote already has a decisive weight.
In order to change the name of the state, two thirds of parliamentarians must vote for it.
The State Electoral Commission said there had been no reports of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, electoral activity was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters visited the polls.
“I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Giose Tanevski, a 62-year-old citizen from the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko voted in a referendum in Macedonia to change the name of the country, which will open the way for accession to NATO and the European Union, in Strumica on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavadarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and arranged chairs in front of the tents, stretched by boycotting referendums.
“We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with proudly raised heads, not through the door for servants,” Kavadarkov said.
“Our country may be poor, but we still have dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the Eurasian Union.”
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would lead to the necessary investments for Macedonia, as the unemployment in the country is more than 20 percent.
“I believe the vast majority will be with us, as over 80 percent of the citizens prefer us to the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after giving his own voice.
He also said that the positive outcome would lead to “confirmation of the future of our people.”
Last Monday, the Macedonian Institute for Political Studies published the results of a survey, according to which between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum – which is under the necessary activity.
Another study, a work of the Macedonian television station Telma, reported that 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent of them said they would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the electoral activity must be 50% plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since it won power in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passes through all of Brighton's defense and scores goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling overcame Brighton's defense and brought Manchester City's 2-0 victory on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero's scoring in the 65th minute seemed too easy.
It all started when the Argentine goalkeeper was found with a pass in the middle of the field.
He ran three defenders from Brighton before sprinting with the ball in the empty space ahead.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four players in the green.
He sneaked past one of the defenders, then left behind the rest on the frontier of Brighton's criminal court.
Then he turned left to Sterling.
The English striker with one touch brought the ball back to Aguero, who with a right-footed hit over Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan and found the right corner of his neck.
“Aguero is struggling with some injuries in his legs,” City Manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We wanted him to play for 55-60 minutes.
And look what happened.
We were lucky to have scored a goal at the moment.”
But Sterling was the one who provided the initial advance of the "heavens" in this match of the High League of England.
He scored in the 29th minute.
In the situation for the goal Aguero got a submission deep in the half of Brighton.
He immediately released an outgoing pass on the left flank to Lira Sane.
Sane advanced with the ball, then found Sterling with a pass on the remote beam.
The attacker of the "heavenly relations" managed to spot close, shortly before the ball came out.
City will face Hofenheim in a group stage match of the Champions League at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday afternoon at the Rhein Neckar Arena in Zinsheim, Germany.
Chercer wants to play determine the fate of the Rockies
Since the Nationals did not qualify for the playoffs, it makes no particular sense for another game on a title starting pitcher.
And yet the always-ambitious Chercer hopes to be a champion on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, if the game is of importance to the Rockies, who lead with a match against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West rankings.
The Rockies secured at least a Wild Card game after a 5-2 win against the Nationals on Friday night, but it is still unclear if they will win their first title in the division.
“Although we’re not fighting for anything ourselves, we want to end the season with a nice game in Denver, where the audience and the other team will do their best to win perhaps the most important game for them in the year.
“Why would I want to miss a game like that?”
The Nationals have not yet announced a starting pitcher for Sunday, but are expected to allow Scherzer to participate if the match is decisive.
For Scherzer this would be the 34th game as a starting pitcher this year, as he held a practice on Thursday and would have the normal rest time until Sunday.
Washington's right-handed pitcher has a balance of 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump Recommends Supporters in West Virginia
President Koso hinted at the situation with his Supreme Court voter Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of Republican votes in the general election.
“By November, everything we have achieved will be at risk.
There are five weeks left to one of the most important choices of our lives.
"This is one of the greatest moments in our history - I also declare that while I am not a candidate, I am actually also a participant, which is why I am fighting with all my might for the right nominations," Trump said.
“You all see this terrible, terrifying radical group of Democrats, you see them with your own eyes.
They are determined to regain their power in any way, you yourself have witnessed their ruthlessness, their evil.
They don’t care when they can hurt who they have to smash into power and government, because they care only about power and government, but we won’t give them.”
The Democrats, according to the president, have set themselves the goal of “obstructing and obstructing”.
“What we’ve all seen in the last four days,” he continued, calling the Democrats “angry, ugly, ugly and infidel.”
The president recalled the Senate Judiciary Committee, mentioning Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein by name, which caused strong crowd cheers.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you disseminate the document?
Please, what?
No, no, I waited – it was really a horrible gesture – perhaps the worst I’ve ever seen.”
The Labours are no longer broad-minded.
The party is not tolerant of those who speak openly.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, few were surprised.
After all, I’m just the last member of the Labour Party to have been told that he was not welcome – just because I’m speaking frankly.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, received a similar attitude because she was resolutely opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, censorship is criticizing me for my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, topics that are ironically similar to those with which Jeremy expressed disagreement at the time of previous leaders.
In a press release for the Labour meeting in Nottingham East on Friday, it was said that “we want the meetings to include everyone and be beneficial.”
In most of my eight years as a local representative of the Labour Party in Parliament, Friday’s meetings were just that.
Unfortunately, today the tone of most meetings and the promises of a “lighter and more measured” policy have long been forgotten, if ever they were on the agenda at all.
It became increasingly evident that different views were not tolerated in the Labour Party, and that every opinion was judged on the basis of how much the party’s leadership liked it.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, while the colleagues I had previously worked for, I thought, shared similar political views, began to expect me to make a reverse turn and take positions that I would never agree with the EU – whether on national security or on one side.
Whenever I make public statements – no matter what I’m actually saying – there is an entire offensive tyranny on social media, calling for a recall, a rejection of moderate politics, statements that I don’t belong to the Labour Party.
This doesn't just happen to me.
In the interest of truth, I know that I have even drawn more luck than some of my colleagues, since the comments for me are at least mostly of a political nature.
I can only admire the professionalism and purposefulness of those colleagues who face sexist or racist swindlers every day without being afraid of them.
One of the biggest disappointments of this era in politics is how such offenses have become the norm.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said that Labour should embrace a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that the party is far from wide-screened, with every sign of distrust or change in the rules of choice becoming ever narrower.
Over the past two years, I’ve received a lot of advice to calm down, not to talk so much, and then “everything will be okay.”
That’s not why I went into politics.
Ever since I joined the Labourists 32 years ago as a pupil provoked by the Thatcher government, which, through its neglect, led to the literal collapse of my excellent school, I have fought for better public services than I did for those who have the greatest need of them.
I’ve never had a political turmoil, even during the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be confused in any way by my political stance and my disagreement with the current leadership.
To all those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would like to say that when the state rushes to Brexit, it will hurt households, businesses and the public sector, and I do not understand the desire to waste my time and energy in loyalty to the leaders.
But really my message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: It is my pride to serve you and I promise that no threat of recall or political disengagement in your interest will deny me to act in the way I consider it to be.

Air 38-17 Melrose: Invincible Air lead in the ranking
The two late essays may have slightly changed the final result, but there’s no doubt that Air deserved to triumph in this incredibly interesting match from Tennent’s High League.
The team is already leading the ranking and the only of the ten teams is without loss so far.
Better defense and better use of opportunities proved decisive in the match, with coach Peter Murchi and his team being able to be very happy.
"I'm happy because the other teams tested us pretty seriously in the past games and we're still without a loss," Murchi said.
Robin Christy of Melrose said, “Congratulations to Aire, they really took advantage of their situation better than we did.”
Grant Anderson's essay in the 14th minute, followed by a successful extra hit by Frazier Climo, brought Air forward in the result, but a yellow card for Scottish national Rory House, a free-kick to the Reeves after the Reeves was relegated from the Warriors, allowing Melrose to take the lead.
Klimo increased the lead for Air from a penalty kick just before halftime, scoring an ace after a solo action, and then realizing the extra kick, with which he made a score of 17-5 for Air on the break.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's essay, followed by a successful additional blow to Bagot, reduced the lead by only five points.
This was followed by a prolonged stoppage of the game due to a severe injury to Ruaryd Nott, who was carried on a carrier, and after the rematch of the match Air increased their advance after Stafford McDowell's essay and a successful additional blow to Climo.
Air Blair Macferson's acting captain then received a yellow card and Melrose again took advantage of their numerical advantage, exerting strong pressure and realizing an essay through Bruce Colvin, followed by an unsuccessful additional blow.
However, the hosts returned the presence of the spirit, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card, after smashing Klimo without a ball, from the subsequent penalty play McFerson realized the essay using Air's advancing offensive line.
Klimo made the extra hit, and not long after he did it again, after Kyle Rowe caught the kicked ball from David Armstrong and took the winger Gregor Henry on the flank for the hosts' fifth essay.
The star of Still Game seems to be gearing up for a new career in the restaurant business
Still Game star Ford Kirnan seems to have headed toward a more direct and warmer industry after it was discovered that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC broadcast, on which he is also a screenwriter and one of the two stars along with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hamphile.
The two announced that the upcoming ninth season would be the last for the show, as it looks like Kirnan is already planning his life after Craigling.
According to the official registers, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refrained from commenting, though a source from the Scottish Sun suggested that Kirnan intended to join Glasgow's "flowering restaurant business."
"The sea is ours": Bolivia's sealess ship hopes to reopen its way to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors are constantly patrolling ambushes with a tachelage sea headquarters in La Paz.
There is an ocean blue flag above the public buildings.
The sea bases from Lake Titikaka to the Amazon are decorated with the motto: “The sea belongs to us rightfully.
It is our duty to get it back.”
In all of Bolivia, which has no access to the ocean, the memory of the lost exit handed over to Chile after a bloody conflict in the 19th century is still alive – as is the call to re-float the Pacific Ocean.
In fact, this hope is now the strongest in decades, while Bolivia is awaiting a judgement by the International Court of Justice on October 1, after five years of deliberation.
“The power is in Bolivia, everywhere there is a sense of audacity and unity, and the country expects a positive result,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will watch the international court judgement on the big screen across the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will support Bolivia’s demand and that after decades of negotiations Chile will be forced to give Bolivia sovereign access to the ocean.
Here’s Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic local president, who is about to go to a contested re-election battle next year, has also relied heavily on the judgement of the court on Monday.
“We are very close to regaining access to the Pacific Ocean,” Moralez promised last August.
But some analysts believe that the likelihood of the court making a decision in favor of Bolivia is quite small, and even if it judges in favor of Bolivia, it would not change things into reality.
The UN body in the Netherlands does not have the authority to take over Chile and has decided that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the judgement of the international court is only six months after the hearing of the latest arguments indicates that the case is “not complicated,” said Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And instead of contributing to the cause of Bolivia, the last four years may have actually hurt her.
“The problem of access to the ocean has been inflated by the current government of Bolivia,” Zarate said.
He then hinted that Morales's war rhetoric had eroded Chile's goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but it will be extremely difficult after a normal dialogue has taken place.
The two countries have not supported each other’s diplomatic missions since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltze, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision was taken unusually quickly.
On Monday, he said, Bolivia will have “an incredible opportunity to open the page of a new era in its relations with Chile” as well as a chance to “put an end to 139 years of disagreement by achieving benefits for both countries.”
Calzadilla also rejected the idea that Morales – who continues to be one of the most popular presidents in Latin America – used the problem of access to the ocean as a “political scoundrel.”
"Bolivia will never give up its right to exit the Pacific," he added.
“Reconciliation is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome our past problems.”
North Korea Says It Won't Continue Nuclear Disarmament Until It Can Trust The U.S.
North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never engage in nuclear disarmament first if it is not able to trust Washington to do so.
Ri made his speech on Saturday before the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to keep the promises it made during the meeting between the leaders of the opposing countries in Singapore.
His comment comes after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the brink of resuming unparalleled nuclear diplomacy more than three months after his meeting in Singapore with Kim Jong Un from North Korea.
Ri called the idea “empty hope” that a continuation of U.S. sanctions and objections to a declaration that would put an end to the Korean War would cause the North to fall to its knees.
Washington is not inclined to agree with the declaration without Pyongyang first making a significant gesture on the path to disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about its abandonment of an arsenal they see as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Fashion magazines in Paris reveal the latest whistle on massive hats that will soon be in the fashion stores next to you
If you want to enlarge your collection of hats or completely block the sun’s rays, you don’t need to look any further.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown unveiled a range of incredibly large hats from their upcoming SS19 collection, which smiling the fashion podium during Fashion Week in Paris.
Pretty impractical hats caused a wave on Instagram in the summer, as designers sent their eye-catching creations to smash the fashion community.
Valentino's prominence was an extravagant beige hat with a pen-like wide periphery that literally swallowed the heads of the models.
Other overly huge accessories included jewelry-decorated dill, magic hat, and even pineapple – but they’re not meant to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also introduced a selection of strange masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had sewn lips and resembled not so much high fashion as Hannibal Lecter.
One of the designs resembled diving equipment in a full set of snorkel and glasses, while the other looked like melted funnel ice cream.
If you fall for similar fashion trends, you are in luck.
Fashion specialists predict that the huge hats will soon be sold at fashion stores near you.
The huge hats come soon after La Bomba – the straw hat with a two-foot periphery that was seen on everyone’s heads – from Riana to Emily Rataykovsky.
The cult of the extremely impractical hat that took over social networks led to the appearance of another huge design of the fashion podium – a straw beach bag, almost as big as the wearer wearing a bathing suit.
The orange-coloured raffia bag, with raffia lashes and a white leather handle, was the eye-catching item in Jacquemus’ La Riviera SS19 collection during Fashion Week in Paris.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitid told FEMAIL: “I expect to see big hats and beach bags in fashion stores next summer – once the designer made such a big impression, it will be hard to ignore the demand for a drugstore.”
John Edward: Language Skills are Essential to Global Citizens <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a reputation for academic excellence, and this continues in 2018 with another outstanding presentation of the test results, which is only reinforced by individual and collective successes in the sports disciplines, the arts, and other music.
With up to 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Association of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to offer the best level to their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for their further education, their chosen careers, and their place in a global world.
As an educational sector that can compose and implement a personal curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to someone in an understandable language, your words will get to him.
But if you speak his own language, you touch his heart.”
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely only on the English language when we want to build relationships and trust with the peoples of other countries.
Through the results of this year’s exams, we can see that languages are in the first place with the highest success for independent schools.
In total, 68% of students who studied foreign languages achieved a high A score.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72% of students achieved an A rating in Chinese, with the same rating having 72% of German learners, 69% of French learners and 63% of those with Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland perceive foreign languages as vital skills, which children and young people will definitely need in the future.
Currently, languages as a subject of free choice by the students receive the same attitude as the natural-mathematical disciplines (scientific, technological, engineering and mathematical disciplines) both in the programs of independent schools and beyond them.
A 2014 survey by the UK Employment and Employment Skills Commission found that 17% of respondents indicated insufficient language skills due to the reasons employers find it difficult to find employees.
As a result, more and more foreign language proficiency becomes obligatory in order to prepare young people for their future careers.
More and more job positions require the mastery of a foreign language, which makes these skills essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the chosen career, if a person masters a foreign language, he will have a real advantage in the future, having mastered such a skill that remains for life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts the master of several languages one breasts ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 UK citizens in 2013, 75% of them did not speak a foreign language well enough to be able to speak a language, while French was the only language to have a double-digit literacy rate of 1 percent.
That’s why investing in language learning today is important for children now.
The ability to speak several languages, especially those of developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding a good job.
In Scotland, every school will be different from the language taught.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are deemed more important to the UK in the future by 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever interests your child has, there will always be enough languages to choose from in independent schools, as teachers will be specialists in their field.
Independent schools in Scotland are firmly committed to providing an educational environment that will prepare children and give them the skills they need to succeed in life, no matter what the future holds.
At the moment, it cannot be denied that in a global business environment, languages continue to play an incredibly important role for the future of any country that requires this to be taken into account in the education system.
And indeed, modern languages must really be regarded as “international communication skills.”
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, along with diversity and excellent quality, to young people in Scotland.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Association of Independent Schools.
LeBron will make his Lakers debut this week in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans who are excited to see LeBron James’ first match with the Los Angeles Lakers team.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will take part in the team's first game of pre-season training against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It is not yet clear how many minutes he will play in the match.
"He'll be on the pitch in one to 48 minutes," Walton said via Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudeau said in a tweet that James is likely to play a relatively few minutes in the game.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the six matches of Lakers' pre-season training.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need pre-season games to prepare for the new season,” he said.
Trump's rally in West Virginia, a YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a series of election rallies tonight in Willingdon, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five planned Trump rallyes, which include stops at well-known locations, including Tennessee and the Mississippi.
By delaying the confirmation vote for his election to fill the vacancy in the Supreme Court, Trump is aiming to support the upcoming mid-term elections, as Republicans are threatened with losing control of Congress on the ballot.
What time will Trump’s rally be held in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump’s visit to Willing, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. Eastern time tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s visit to Willing, West Virginia below by streaming live on YouTube.
Trump is likely to consider this week's hearings for Supreme Court nominees Brett Kavanaugh, which saw tensions over allegations of immoral sexual acts, which held the Senate's confirmation vote for up to a week until the country's split.
The main goal of this series of rallies, however, is to help Republicans gain momentum for the November elections.
That’s why in President Donald Trump’s campaign, it was announced that these five rallyes next week are aimed at “activating volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and in the House of Representatives.”
“Control over Congress is so vital to his program that the president will visit as many states as possible and we are starting a campaign season full of commitments,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
The rally tonight, planned for Wesbanco Arena in Willingdon, could bring back supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw the attention of the Pittsburgh media, according to West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, Trump’s second visit this month will be to West Virginia, the state where he won more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the West Virginia Senate candidate, Republican Patrick Morrissey, who is lagging behind in sociological studies.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrissey that the president has come to give him a boost in sociological studies,” said Simon Heather, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Rider Cup 2018: The U.S. team will fight to the last, keeping its hopes alive before the singles on Sunday
After three consecutive sessions without the intrigue of Foursom, Sunday afternoon matches may have brought what Rider Cup needed.
The change of advantage in sport is a rather subjective concept, however, in which players believe unreservedly, even more in competitions like this one.
Which team is in a better position at the moment?
“They came with six points and now they’re only four, so I guess we’ve gotten a little inertia,” Jordan Spite said at the end of today’s race day.
Of course, Europe has an advantage of four points with only twelve to allocate.
However, as Spite says, the Americans have more to show and their fans should not lose hope if we have to judge the sporting form of Spite and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each of them took three out of four possible points.
The spear shows an excellent shape from the beginning to the end of each hole and is the true leader of his team.
The fans' cheers were getting stronger as he advanced to the round in which, with a precise blow, he levelled the score in the fourth match, after being left behind with Thomas with two blows after the first two holes.
His hit, which won the match on the 15th hole, was met with strong excited reactions that make us believe that not everything is really lost for the American team.
“The important thing is not to think about anything else and to focus on your own game,” Spite said.
That’s all that’s left for these players now.
18 holes to be remembered.
The only players with more points than Spite and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed heroes of the Rider Cup so far.
The strange but adorable couple from Europe, won four out of four and it looks like everything is working out for them.
Mollywood was the only couple who didn’t make “gods” on Sunday afternoons, but they also didn’t have a “god” either on Saturday mornings, or on Friday afternoons or mornings.
These successes, as well as the way in which energy seemed to pass between them and the enthusiastic fans, confirmed the opinion that they are the players who will win on Sunday and there will be no better pair for the National team than the Fluitwood and the Molinaires, which will bring the potential European victory.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, the tales of European fame turned out to be a little premature.
Buba Watson and Web Simpson quickly coped with Sergio Garcia, the protagonist of the morning four-ball matches while he partnered with Alex Norren.
The "Gods" and two "doubles" of the first nine holes put the Spaniard and the Swede in trouble that they couldn't cope with.
However, in Sunday games, there is no way anyone else can solve your problems.
"Fourball" and "Foursom" matches are extremely interesting to watch closely due to the interactions between the pairs, the advice they exchange between them, and the way a strategy can undergo changes at any given moment.
The Europeans played better on the team and therefore gained a significant lead before the last day, but this four-game session showed that the American team is also ready to fight to the last – something that many people, especially in the United States, strongly doubted.
Europe lead with 10-6 on the final day of the Rider Cup.
Europe will have a solid lead ahead of the final day of the Rider Cup after leading the United States 10-6 after playing the matches of the formats "Fourball" and "Foursom" on Saturday.
The inspirational duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari began with two victories against the unconvincing Tiger Woods, with which their race asset at Le Golf National increased by four points.
In an attempt to regain the trophy he lost to Hazeltine two years ago, Thomas Bjorn's European team dominated the morning "fourball" matches over the Americans who made a mistake after a mistake, and eventually Europe won the series with 3–1 wins.
The U.S. made more resistance in the Foursom games, where they won two victories, but failed to narrow the gap.
Jim Furrick's team needs 8 points out of 12 singles games on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Floyd is the first newcomer in Europe to win four points in a row, and he and Molinari, known by the nickname "Mollywood", after this sensational weekend only became the second pair to win four points of their first four matches in history.
After unappealingly beating Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-ball games, they were highly motivated to beat broken Woods and American rookie Bryson Decambu with an even more categorical 5&4 score.
Woods, who barely went through his two games on Saturday, only occasionally showed flaws in his genius, but so far there have been 19 losses out of 29 in the Foursom and Foursom matches, as well as a total of seven consecutive losses.
Justin Rose, who got a break for the morning Fourball games, partnered with Henry Stanson in the Foursom clashes in a 2&1 victory over Justin Johnson and Brooks Coppa – number one and number three in the world, respectively.
However, the team of Europe failed to enjoy a completely pleasant, cool and cloudy day south-west of Paris.
Three-time winner Jordan Spite and Justin Thomas returned the hopes of the Americans by winning two points on Saturday.
They scored a tough 2–1 win against the Spaniards John Ram and Jan Polter in the four-ball games, and later returned to defeat Polter and Rory McIlroy with 4–3 in the fours, despite losing the first two games.
Only twice in the history of the Rider Cup, there has been a team to score four points deficit before the singles, and according to the rules, the team will retain the trophy even on an equal footing.
However, since they were overrun in two consecutive days, it seems that their chances of a return on Sunday are not particularly high.
North Korea says there is “no way” to disarm unilaterally, without trust
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the ongoing sanctions deepen distrust of the United States and there is no way for the country to give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally in such circumstances.
At the annual general meeting of the World Organization, Ri Yong-hou said that “significant measures of goodwill” have been taken in the past year, such as a halt to nuclear and missile tests, the destruction of the nuclear test facility, and promises to not spread nuclear weapons and weapons.
“However, we don’t see a corresponding reaction from the United States,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, we will not believe in our own national security, and under no circumstances can we first disarm unilaterally.”
While Ri expressed North Korea’s well-known complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “poet-stage” approach to the elimination of nuclear weapons, in which North Korea would be rewarded for the smuggling as it did in a single-stage manner, his statement seemed unimportant.
Ri recalled a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the U.S. President and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work on the “Seranth nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula.”
North Korea is aiming for an official end to the Korean War of 1950-1953, but the United States says Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls for easing stringent international sanctions against North Korea.
“The U.S. is insisting ‘we should remove nuclear weapons first’ and is increasing pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal through coercion, and is even opposed to the ‘declaration of the end of the war,’” he said.
“The realization that sanctions can make us fall on our knees is a meaningless dream for those who don’t know us.
The problem, however, is that the ongoing sanctions are deepening our distrust.”
Ri did not mention whether a second meeting between Kim and Trump was planned, which the U.S. leader underlined at the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister emphasized the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If the country on the issue of nuclear disarmament was South Korea, not the United States, it would not have been for the United States, but for the United States, the removal of the Korean peninsula.
However, Ri’s tone of speech was significantly different from the previous year when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting North Korean missiles to the continental U.S. was inevitable after Trump’s “bad president” called Kim a “human.”
This year at the UN, Trump, who last year threatened North Korea with “full destruction,” praised Kim for his courage to take disarmament measures, but said there was still a lot of work ahead and sanctions should remain in place until North Korea passed.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no deadline for this and said: “It doesn’t matter if it takes two years, three years or five months.”
China and Russia say the U.N. Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures it has taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that “the implementation of the Security Council sanctions must necessarily continue until it is fully, definitively and affirmatively implemented.”
The Security Council has unanimously tightened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to halt funding for Pyongyang's nuclear program and ballistic missile program.
Pompeo met with Ri in the backroom of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
This year, Pompeo visited North Korea three times, but his last trip went well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying he had made progress, but only a few hours later North Korea accused him of sending “gangster demands.”
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to destroy a missile facility and a nuclear complex if the United States takes “appropriate measures.”
According to him, Kim told him that the “relevant measures” he is pursuing are the security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and that he wants to achieve a normalization of relations with Washington.
Students in Harvard take a full-time course
A new course at Harvard University this year causes all students to sleep more in an attempt to combat the growing culture of learning “all night” using caffeine.
A professor found that students at the number one university in the world often do not even think about when it comes to the very foundations of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Keisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Hospital and Women's Hospital, prepared the course he believes to be the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“Finally, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why are they telling me that right now, in my last year?’
She said no one ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is held for the first time this year, explains to students the most essentials of how good sleep habits help academic and sporting achievements, as well as to improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University’s health services, said the university had decided to introduce the course after it was found that students were suffering from a severe lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one part there is an image of a room in a dormitory where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, boots and books to explain to them the effects of caffeine and light, how athletic achievements are affected by lack of sleep, as well as the importance of bedtime routine.
In another part of the study, participants were told how long-term sleep deprivation could increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Then a campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that this will not immediately change the behavior of the students.
But we believe they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke,” added Prof. Keisler.
The culture of pride of “all-night learning” still exists, he says, adding that modern technologies and the ever-increasing pressure on students mean that deprivation of sleep is a growing problem.
Ensuring adequate and quality sleep should be the students’ “secret weapon” in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he says – even in order to avoid filling, as sleep deprivation puts the brain into a state of hunger, which causes them to be constantly starving.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California who studies chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Keisler prepare the course by taking one of his classes during his first year at Harvard.
He says his course "opened his eyes" and inspired him to spread it across the campus.
It is hoped that the next step will be for all graduate students to be asked to complete a similar curriculum before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Keisler recommends that students think about whether to set the alarm for bedtime and waking up and know the detrimental effects of the “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can disrupt the circadian rhythm and dove problem.
Livingston 1 – 0 Rangers: Menga's goal smashed Gerard's team
The Rangers suffered another loss after Dolly Menga's joke broke Steven Gerard's non-Jewish team and brought a 1–0 victory for Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to record their first win as a guest of triumph in February by 4–1 over St. Johnston, but the team of Gary Holt only inflicted Gerard's second defeat in the 18th-seeded match of the Wichita's victory as a manager, leaving his team eight points behind La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Menga scored seven minutes before the break, and Rangers's devoid of constructive ideas team at no point seemed close to a draw.
After the match, the Rangers finished in sixth place, and Livingston are already third, leaving the second Hibernian only by goal difference.
For Rangers, there could be additional problems, as side judge Callum Spence suffered a head injury after being hit with an item that was apparently thrown by the guests' fans.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that defeated Air in the semi-finals of the Scottish League Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, came out with the same eleven-year-old Livingston who scored a point against Harts last week, and he should be pleased with the way his aggressive team parroted all of the opponent’s actions.
Rangers may have dominated possession of the ball, but Livingston did better in the rarer cases when they owned it.
They should have scored in the second minute, when Menga brought out Scott Pittman against goalkeeper Alan McGregor with one touch, but the midfielder missed the good chance.
Later centering Keegan Jacobs from the Fault found Captain Craig Halket, but his defense partner Alan Litgow diverted the ball aside from the rear beam.
The Rangers took control of the game, but failed to create anything meaningful in the last third of the field.
Alfredo Morelos definitely thought he should have a 15-minute duel when he clashed with Steven Lowelles, but referee Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian's claims.
The Rangers made only two accurate hits in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly easily managed to hit Lasana Kulibali's head and Ovie Ezjaria's weak shot.
Although Livi's 34th minute hit was surprising in terms of possession of the ball, it was fully deserved.
The Rangers again failed to cope with Jacobs' deep centering.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who gave it cold-blooded to Menga, for whom it was easy to realize.
Gerard responded to the break by changing Kulibali with Ryan Kent and this shift almost immediately resulted in a result when the wing handed over to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came out decisively and blocked the blow.
Livingston, however, continued to force guests to play in a style that was comfortable for the hosts of the game, with Litgow and Chalket constantly throwing away the long balls sent forward.
Holt's team could have increased their lead in the last few minutes, but McGregor managed to cope with Jacobs's blow, and in the following corner Litgow shot his head by the grate.
Glenn Middleton of Rangers, who entered the reserve, called for a duel at the end of the match after a lone fight with Jacobs, but Tomson did not see anything wrong with the situation again.
Yearbook: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
Page from our journal Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and BROWN... the day the future physicist Johann Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that ultimately led to the creation of a device known as a Geiger counter.
A cradlestone in science since then, the Geiger counter has also become a cornerstone of pop culture when the 1950 film The Bells of Coronado was released, featuring seemingly incredible scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.
Man: “What, for God’s sake, is this?
Rogers: This is a geiger counter and is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms separated by the radioactivity in the minerals.”
Evans: “I’m sure it doesn’t matter right now!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the discovery that bears his name is still alive.
New Cancer Vaccine Could Train the Immune System to “See” Foreign Cells
New Cancer Vaccine Could Train the Immune System to “See” Foreign Cells and Kill Them
The vaccine trains the immune system to recognize foreign cells as part of the treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory.
They can then “see” a protein that is common to many types of cancer and be injected back into the patient.
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which trains the immune system to recognize foreign cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory so that they can “see” a protein common to many types of cancer called HER2, and then injecting it back into the patient.
According to Professor Jay Berzoffski of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, “The results suggest we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “stimulates the growth of several types of cancer,” including breast, ovaries, lung and colorectal cancer, explained Prof. Berzofski.
A similar approach to taking immune cells from patients and “teaching” them how to target cancer cells was used in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kenny West gave a speech in support of Trump, wearing a hat with the inscription “Let’s make America great again” while participating in SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kenny West was cast in the studio during Saturday Night Live after making a pointless performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
After performing his third song for the evening called Ghost Town, during which he wore a hat with the inscription “Let’s make America great again,” he protested against the Democrats and said his support for Trump.
“I talk to white people a lot and they ask me, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s a racist?’
“Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
SNL began the show with the participation of Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star bragged about Bret Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Sexual Violence Complaints by Christine Blaise Ford.
Although it wasn't broadcast, West's performance was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear why Rock tried to make fun of West with his publication.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had problems behind the scenes because of his hat.
“They pushed me behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go out with that hat."
I've been braked!
And then they say I'm on a sinking ship," he said according to the Washington Examiner.
West continues, “Do you want to see the sinking ship?”, claiming that he will wear Superman’s suit, because that means you can’t tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go on?
Try it with love.”
The comments triggered at least two public outcry and SNL team members seemed embarrassed, Variety reported, one of whom said: “The whole studio was silent.”
West was invited at the last minute to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West puzzled many with the performance of the song "I Love It", dressed as a bottle of "Perie".
West received the support of TPUSA's leader, Candes Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "To one of the most daring: PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE TALK."
Karen Hunter, the show’s host, tweeted: “West was just herself, and that’s great.”
“But I choose NOT to reward a person (by buying music or his clothing or supporting his ‘art’) whom I think he welcomes and disseminates an ideology that is harmful to society.
He's free.
That’s how we are,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper said on Twitter that he changed his name, now “officially known as Kenny West.”
He is not the first artist to change his name, and follows the example of Didy, also known as Puff Dedy, Puffy and P. Didy.
His friend, rapper Snoop Dog, was named Snoop Lion, and musical legend Prince changed his name to a symbol.
Accused of attempted murder after stabbed to death in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed with a knife in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrate's Court on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the prosecutor's office.
Game of Thrones star Keith Harrington is against toxic masculinity
Keith Harrington is best known for his role as the swinging sword John Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series of the NGO Game of Thrones.
But the actor, who is 31, has spoken out against the stereotype of the match hero, saying that showing such roles on the screen causes young people to often think they need to be “crude” to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Keith said she believed "something went wrong" and asked how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the era of <0x23>MeToo.
Keith, who recently married his "Game of Thrones" partner Rose Leslie, also aged 31, admits that he feels "strongly convinced" that this problem needs to be solved.
“At the moment, I am personally firmly convinced – what have we been wrong about masculinity?” he said.
“What do we teach teenage men about the problem we’re seeing now?”
Keith believes that television may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to the many masculine characters.
He continued: “What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television and on the street that makes the boys feel they have to become this particular type of men?
I think that’s really one of the big issues of our time – how do we change it?
Because obviously something's wrong with the young men."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in a prehistory or sequel to Game of Thrones after the end of the series next summer, claiming that he had “finished the battlefields and horses.”
From November, Keith will play a part in Sam Shepherd's "True West" remake, a story about a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently said that meeting his wife, Rose, was the best thing that ever happened in Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife in this series, so in this way he gave me my future family and set my life ahead,” he said.
Rose plays the game, the girl in which Keith's hero John Snow falls in love, in the fantasy series, the winner of the Emmy Award.
The two married in June 2018 at Leslie's family's estate in Scotland.
HIV/Spain: China Reports 14% Increase in New Cases
China reported a 14% jump in the number of citizens living with HIV and spine.
According to health services, more than 820,000 people have been affected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
Most of the new cases are triggered by sexual contact, which is a change compared to the past.
Traditionally, HIV spreads rapidly in some parts of China as a result of transfusion of infected blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, China’s health services said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, each year the number of those living with HIV and spin in China is increasing by 100,000.
Transmission of HIV through sexual contact is a serious problem in the LGBT community in China.
In 1997, homosexuality was decriminalized in China, but discrimination against people in the KGBT communities is widespread.
According to studies, due to conservative values, 70-90% of men who have had sexual contact with men end up marrying women.
Many of the cases of transmission of diseases are the result of improper protection in these relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government pledged to provide universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies leaking data from Republican senators, denouncing "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
On Saturday, U.S. House of Representatives member Maxine Waters denounced allegations that a member of her team had posted personal information to three U.S. senators from Republicans on Wikipedia's lawmakers' pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the claims were made by experts and websites of the “ultra-right wing.”
“Lies, lies, and more disgusting lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information includes the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsay Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hutch, who are from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person from the Capitol during a Senate hearing on the allegations of immoral sexual behavior against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak was carried out after the three senators interviewed Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the publications was linked to Waters’ office, and released information about a member of its team, Hill said.
“This unfounded claim is completely untrue and is an absolute lie,” Waters said.
“The member of my team – whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false claims – is in no way responsible for leaking this information.
This unfounded claim is completely untrue and is an absolute lie.”
Waters’ statement quickly sparked online criticism, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleisher.
“There is poison in this denial,” Flicker wrote.
“This suggests that she does not have the temperament appropriate for a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they haven’t done, they shouldn’t be angry.
It should not be provocative.
I should not question the motives of the prosecutor.
It has to be calm and balanced.”
Flicker compared Waters’ reaction to the Democrats’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of appearing angry during Thursday’s hearing.
Omar Navaro, a Republican candidate for Waters' place in the midterm elections, also said on Twitter.
“Certainly, if it’s true,” he wrote.
In a statement, Waters said her office had targeted the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies for these fraudulent allegations.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators will be exposed and that they will be brought under legal responsibility for all their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to all members of my team."
Review of "Johnny English Explodes Again" – The Weak Spionage Parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is already traditional to look for references to Brexit in every new British-involved film, and it seems that this also applies to the revival of the action-comedy, spy franchise for Johnny English – which launched in 2003 with Johnny English.
Will self-deception and mimicry, which speak as obvious as being stupid, become a new opportunity for the nation’s export?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with his roots and a “gum” face is allowed to repeat things for the second time – his name is of the utmost importance when it comes to a great comic creation designed for fans of cinema who do not speak English.
He is, of course, a stupid secret agent who, despite his strange claims of graceful brilliance, possesses little of Clouseau, little of Mr. Bean, and much of the man who contributed a note to the 2012 musical theme of the Loriots of Fire at the opening ceremonies.
In addition, he is initially based on the leaving chaos behind him a traveler and an international man, whom Atkinson plays in Barclaycard's already-forgotten television commercials.
In the last film with Johnny English, there are two good moments.
I liked it when Johnny English approached the helicopter, carrying it in a medieval armor and for a short time the fins slammed into his helmet.
Atkinson's contribution to physical comedy is obvious, but the humor is rather weak and strangely overstated, especially when "serious" film brands like "007" and "Mission Impossible" include a dose of comedy.
Humor seems to be geared towards children rather than adults, and Johnny English’s unfortunate accidents are not innovative and focused in my opinion, as the lack of Actinson’s game reminds me of Mr. Bean.
The current premise is that the UK is faced with serious problems.
Cyberhacker hacked Britain’s super-secret network of spies and revealed the identity of all operative horror agents of the operative – unfortunately, a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last drop for the prime minister, who is inflated and confessed to the figure and is already suffering from a complete collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best for this quasi-Theresa-May role, but there is nothing to deal with in the script.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that she must summon a retired agent, as all of the acting agents are compromised.
And that means Johnny English himself, who is currently working as a teacher in a chic center, but illegally teaches lessons on how to be an undercover agent: here are some good shots when English recreates a spy rock academy.
English is called to Whitehall for emergency instruction and reunited with his former longtime assistant Bo, played again by Ben Miller.
Bo is already a family man, married to a submarine commander, a fun role in which Vicky Pepperdine's talent is a bit wasted.
So, Batman and Robin are back in the game to solve the great problems of Her Majesty's secret services and face the fatal beautiful Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurilenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls under the dangerous influence of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s computer problems: the villainous Jason Volta, played by Jack Lacey.
English and Bo begin their odyssey of farce: disguised as waiters, set fire to a French restaurant; create chaos when they sneak into the luxury yacht of Volta; and English provokes a real anarchy when she tries to use a helmet for a virtual reality.
All the laughs are certainly taken from the previous film, but since it is so cute and lush, here there is a lot more content designed for children.
It's a rather medium-sized production.
As with other films about Johnny English, I keep thinking: Can’t the British film industry give Atkinson a role that matches his talent?
Labour denies developing a plan for the British to work four days a week, but to get paid for five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan that would allow the British to work four times a week, but get paid five times a week.
The party says it wants the heads of companies to provide the economies made by revolutionary artificial intelligence (AI) to the workers by giving them another day off.
She wants the workers to enjoy a three-day weekend, but to get the same pay.
Sources say the idea would “threaten” the economic program and the party’s plans to shake the country in favor of the workers.
The move to a four-day working week was approved by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to benefit from the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: “It is expected to be announced before the end of the year for a policy review.
“It’s not going to happen right away, but the four-day working week is an aspiration that fits into the approach to rebalancing the economy for the benefit of the workers, as well as into the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party will not be the first to have such an idea, the Green Party has promised a four-day working week during its general election campaign in 2017.
At the moment, however, this aspiration does not meet the approval of the entire Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said: “The four-day working week is not in the politics of the party is not considered by it.”
Shadow Chancellor John MacDonald used last week’s Labour conference to uncover his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
MacDonald said he was determined to take back power from “impersonal directors” and “speculators” in utility companies.
The Chancellor’s plans in the shadow also mean that the current shareholders in the water supply companies may not receive their full share, as the Labour government could impose “clamps” on the basis of the established violations.
In addition, he confirmed plans to bring workers into the boards of companies and create privatization funds to transfer 10 percent of the net capital of private companies to employees, who can accumulate annual dividends up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy say 60 minutes ago whether the FBI’s investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI’s investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed his final vote for the Supreme Court nomination by at least a week and raised the question of whether the Bureau’s findings could lead to the ouster of some of the Republican senators.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelly asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could find anything that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed to be more open-minded than his South Carolina counterparts.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“When I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the incident, after that statement came out, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was decisive, categorical, and unambiguous.”
Graham’s voice, however, seemed uncompromising.
“I have an opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and to change that, there needs to be a shaking accusation,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett categorically denied it,” Graham added, addressing Christine Blasey Ford.
“And no one she mentioned, but could confirm it.
That was 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new."
What is the “Global Citizen” festival and does it help to reduce poverty at all?
This Saturday, New York City will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has an impressive cast of performers and performs an equally impressive mission: to eradicate poverty around the world.
Now, in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will bring together tens of thousands of people at the large mooring in Central Park, who will not only enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi Bie and Sean Mendes, but will also get acquainted with the true purpose of the events.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free event ticket (unless you don’t want to pay for a VIP ticket), visitors had to perform a number of tasks or “actions” such as voluntary participation, sending a non-email to a world leader, relaying a call to a phone call or otherwise connecting to a call.
But how successful is a “Global Citizen” 12 years before he achieves his goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a brilliant way to convince them to call for action or is it just another case of so-called “clicitism” – people think they’re doing something meaningful when they sign an online petition or post a post on Twitter?
Since 2011, “Global Citizen” has recorded more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters, who insist on many different goals.
It says these actions have helped world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and messages resulting from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or collected.
The group believes that the insured funds have already directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include the “Power of Food” established in the UK partnership between investors and contractors, a commitment to “helping children to develop their full potential more” by the nation after Twitter pledged to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments, and global citizens like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into just a historical note,” Tracy Ulman, the U.S. ambassador for the Food Forces, told the audience at a live concert in London in 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions have been taken that call for Britain to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government has announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the CBC’s website, he asked, “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”
“Global Citizen” replied: “It will be a long and difficult journey – sometimes we will fail and again we will fail.
But just like the big civil rights movement and the anti-apartheid movement before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardi Bee, Janelle Mona are just some of the performers at this year’s event in New York, to which Deborah-Lee Fernes and Hugh Jackman will lead.
U.S. May Use Navy Forces to ‘Block’ and Block Energy Exports – Home Secretary <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Washington may, if necessary, resort to its naval forces to prevent Russian energy products from entering markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinck said on Tuesday, citing the Washington Examiner.
Zink argues that Russia’s involvement in Syria – specifically where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government – is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to sell energy, just like they did in Eastern and Southern Europe,” he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to deal with this.
“The United States can, through our naval forces, ensure that the seaways are open and, if necessary, block them to make sure that energy products don’t reach the market,” he said.
Zink addressed the attendees of the event, organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that presents itself as the “voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He aimed to compare Washington’s approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are the same.
“The economic option for Iraq and Russia is, more or less, stimulating and replacing fuel,” he said, while at the same time defining Russia as “one-size-fits-all” with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statement comes at a time when the Trump administration is tasked with stepping up liquid gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, which is the much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, officials in the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” pipeline project Nord Stream 2, which Trump says is turning Berlin into an “insurance”.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion North Stream 2 pipeline, which will double its existing capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s fierce opposition to the project was dictated simply for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in Sept.
The U.S. position provoked a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industry organisation, the German Federation of Industry (DBDI), called on the United States not to interfere in the EU’s energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third country interferes in our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
“Elizabeth Warren will take a serious look at the 2020 presidential nomination,” Massachusetts Senator said.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday he would “seriously look” at the presidential nomination after the midterm elections.
During a city council meeting in Hollywood, Massachusetts Warren confirmed that he was considering running for office.
“It’s time for Washington to get women in and fix our broken government, and that includes a woman at the top,” she said.
“After November 6th, I will take a serious look at the candidacy for president.”
Warren expressed his judgment of President Donald Trump during the city council, saying that he “led this country in the wrong direction.
“I’m feeling down to the bottom of my soul as Donald Trump does with our democracy,” she said.
Warren was exposed in her criticisms of Trump and his High Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
In a Twitter post on Friday, Warren said, “Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote.”
A sociological survey conducted on Thursday, however, showed that most of Warren’s own voters do not think she should run for office in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts’ “probable” voters said the senator should not run for office, according to a study by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported this candidacy.
The sociological survey showed more support for former governor Dewal Patrick's candidacy, with 38 percent for and 48 percent against.
Other high-ranking Democratic Party representatives discussed regarding a potential candidacy in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin points to Trac Palin's PTSD at a rally for Donald Trump
Trak Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after recording in September.
He was arrested and charged in an incident of domestic violence on Monday night.
“What my own son is going through when he comes back is known to other families who are feeling the effects of PTSD and some of the wounds our soldiers are coming home with,” she told the audience at a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "an elephant in the room" and said of his son and other veterans of the war that "they come back a little changed, hardened, come back and wonder if they will get the respect that both they and their brothers have given the country with weapons."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with assault and domestic violence against a woman, was included in a report on domestic violence and possession of a weapon in a state of intrepidity, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for Vasilla's police department.
18 states and the District of Columbia support the contestation of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the legal challenge of a new U.S. policy that denies asylum for victims of gangster and domestic violence.
On Friday, representatives from the 18 states and districts filed a goodwill petition in Washington in support of asylum seekers and contesting the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grays v. Sessions case, which the American Civil Liberties Union filed against federal policy in August, has not been disclosed.
She claims that her partner “and the sons of the brutal members of his gang” had abused her, but U.S. officials rejected the asylum application on July 20.
She's being held in Texas.
The U.S. attorneys who assist Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum seekers come to the United States, as nations facing widespread gang problems and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy returned the 2014 decision of the Immigrant Appeals Board, which allowed immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Attorney Carl Rasin said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law."
“Federal law requires all asylum applications to be considered according to specific facts and circumstances and such a ban violates this principle,” the report said.
In addition, the lawyers argue in the report that the policy that refuses entry of immigrants is detrimental to the U.S. economy, pointing out that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary workforce.”
In June, Chief Prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to suspend the provision of asylum to victims fleeing domestic harassment and gangster violence.
“Refugee is granted to those who leave their home country for persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political belief,” Sessions said in a July 11 policy statement.
Asylum has never been intended to alleviate all the problems – not even all the serious ones – that people face every day, everywhere in the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as deaths doubling during the search for survivors
The situation for the survivors is getting more and more difficult.
“I feel very tense,” said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, reassuring her sick boy at an evacuation center in the desolate city of Palu.
“Every minute the ambulance carries more bodies.
“Clean water is scarce.”
Residents have been spotted returning to their destroyed homes to try to save something from their flooded things.
Hundreds of people have been injured and hospitals damaged by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake are overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwight Harris, who had suffered a fracture of his spine and shoulder, were housed outside the Army Hospital in Palu, where patients are being treated outdoors due to ongoing secondary shocks.
His eyes are filled with tears as he remembers how he felt the brutal earthquake in the hotel room on the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to save ourselves.
I think I was pushed into the broken wall,” Harris told the Associated Press, adding that he had come to town with his family to attend the wedding.
“I heard my wife cry for help, but then she shut up.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of ‘Terrorism’ with ‘Propaganda’
A week after an official newspaper in China ran a four-page ad in a U.S. daily about the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread the propaganda.
Last Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump referred to the paid publication of the China Daily in the Des Moines Register – the best-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa – after accusing China of seeking to interfere in the U.S. congressional elections on November 6.
Trump’s indictment that Beijing is trying to interfere in the U.S. congressional elections noted what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in Washington’s escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to issue commercials to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an escalating trade war, in which import tariffs are leveled between countries.
According to experts from the United States and China at the start of the trade war, tariffs in China were intended to hit exporters in states such as Iowa, which support Trump’s Republican party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had harmed U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, writes Branstad in a commentary on the Sunday issue of the Des Moines Register, “is currently doubling this harassment by posting propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of America’s respected tradition of freedom of speech and the press by posting paid advertising in the Des Moines Register,” writes Branstad.
“In contrast, at the newspaper stand down the street here in Beijing, you’ll find limited speeches and you won’t see a real reflection of the divergent views that the Chinese people may have with regard to the commune’s peer-to-peer control over China’s disturbing economic trajectory,” he said.
He added that “one of the most famous Chinese newspapers avoids the proposal to publish” his article, although it does not specify exactly who.
With Kavanaugh’s pogrom, Republicans repel women voters for midterm elections, analysts warn
As many high-ranking Republicans stand behind and defend Supreme Court nominees for Bret Kavanaugh on several counts of sexual assault, analysts have warned that there will be a backlash from midfielders, more specifically women, during the uprising.
Emotions around the plateau are extremely strong and most Republicans have already noted that they want to continue voting.
These things can't be brought back," said Grant Rahur, a professor of political science at the University of Syracuse's Maxwell School, in front of The Hill for an article published Saturday.
Rahor said he doubted whether Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute insistence on an FBI investigation would be enough to calm the angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday — they will not forget it either tomorrow or November,” Karin Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, told the Washington newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted “November is coming!” during a demonstration in the Senate corridor, as the Republicans, who control the Judiciary Commission, decided to continue with the nomination of Mr. Kavanaugh despite Mr. Miorist’s testimony.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be excluded,” Stu Rothenberg, a non-party political analyst, told the news.
“People say the problem is already serious; it’s true.
But it can get even more serious, especially among the electorate women in the suburbs and younger voters, between the ages of 18 and 29, who often don’t vote because they don’t like the president.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony describing her allegations of sexual assault against Supreme Court nominees, analysts suggest there could be a backlash if Republicans insist on confirming the candidacy.
“This has become a big mess for the Republican Party,” Michael Steele, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
“It’s not just about the committee vote, the final vote, or whether Cavanaugh was put on the bench. It’s about how Republicans deal with it and how they deal with it,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, told the news channel.
However, the Americans seem somewhat divided on who to believe as a result of Ford and Cavanaugh's testimony, with a little more prone to the latter.
A new sociological survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believe in Ford’s statements, and 35 percent say they definitely or probably believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent say that they believe Kavanaugh probably or certainly lied during his testimony, while 30 percent say the same about Ford.
Following Flake’s insistence, the FBI is currently investigating Ford’s claims, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Last week, Ford testified under oath to the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh attacked her in a state of insecurity when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed her genitals while they were at a party during her follow-up in Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web Inventor Plans to Launch New Internet to Attack Google and Facebook
The inventor of the World Wide Web, Tim Burners-Lee, starts a venture that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds the open-source platform of Burners-Lee Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people have permission to access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Burners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt was “world dominance.”
“We have to do it now,” he said regarding the initiative.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid technology that allows people to create their own “online repository of personal data” or POD.
It contains lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It is similar to Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, which are accessible through each browser, and at the same time they are all at the same time.
The unique thing about the online repository of personal data is that the user determines who has access to what information.
The company calls it “given authority for personal data.”
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company’s CEO John Bruce, is to invest resources, processes, and appropriate skills to help Solid become accessible to all.
The company currently consists of Burners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several developers contracted to work on the project, and a group of volunteer programmers.
As of this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not to make a complete change when all of their business models are fully updated in one night.
“We don’t want permission from them.”
In a publication in Medium on Saturday, Burners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s mission is to provide energy for trade and the ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on the basis of Solid.
In 1994, Burners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Technical Institute.
In recent months, Burners-Lee has had a strong influence in the debate over net neutrality.
Although he started Inrupt, Burners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
“I’m extremely optimistic about this new era on the internet,” Burners-Lee said.
Bernard Van: In memory of a priest awarded the Victoria Cross during the First World War
Celebrating 100 years in the home town of the only Anglican priest awarded the Victoria Cross for his participation in hostilities during World War I.
Lt. Col. Bernard Van won the prize on 29 September 1918 in the attack of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper, not realizing that he had been awarded Britain's highest military honors.
A memorial was discovered on Saturday by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said it was "extremely symbolic" for the monument to be discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather's work, awarded a medal.
According to the London Gazette on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van led his battalion through the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in very dense fog and under heavy shelling by artillery and artillery."
He later attacked the line of fire and, with "unbelievable courage," led the building forward before attacking an artillery gun with one hand and killing three of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I could never do, but it makes me feel humble.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, placed a wreath after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said it was "a great honor to participate in the parade" and added "the true character's bravery is demonstrated by the support that will be given to many people."
MMA fans waited all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead got Peppa Pig
Imagine you've been waiting all night to watch the full edition of Bellator 206 and finally you can't witness the main event.
The San Jose program contained 13 matches, including six from the main map, and was to be broadcast live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 p.m., just as Gegard Musassi and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other, audiences in the UK were stunned when the show switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were disappointed after they had been built until the early hours, especially because of the fight.
Fen described the switching of the children's animated film on Twitter as "some kind of sick joke."
“The government regulations that at 6 a.m. this content is inappropriate, so the program was replaced with a children’s broadcast,” said Dave Schwarz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, in response to a question about the broadcast.
"Peppa pig," yes.
Bellator company president Scott Cocker said he would work on planning the meetings to involve viewers from the UK in the future.
“I think when it comes to repetitions, we can solve the problem,” Cocker said.
“But it’s six in the morning on Sunday and we can’t plan things so that the event takes place here on Sunday and there on Monday.
We're still working on it.
Believe me, when the program was changed, we got a lot of messages and not all were friendly.
We tried to fix it because we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't that way, it was government.
I can promise you that next time it won't happen.
We will stick to the inclusion of five matches instead of six – as we usually do. We tried to give more to the fans, but we overdid.
This is an unpleasant situation.”
Previous articleDesert Island Discs: Tom Dale felt “lower” because of his sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he’s grown up feeling inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality — but that’s what motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old athlete claims that until he started high school, he didn’t realize that “not everyone is like me.”
In an interview for the first edition of Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, led by Lauren Laverne, he talked about gay rights to give “hope” to others.
He also said that when he became a parent, he began to be less interested in winning the Olympics.
The show's permanent host, Cursti Young, has been in the hospital for a few months.
During his participation in Laverne Daley's first show, he said he felt "less" than everyone else as he grew up because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like both girls and boys."
He said, “Until today, the feeling of inferiority and being different from others are actually the things that give me the energy and the power to succeed.”
He wanted to prove it was “something,” he said, so he wouldn’t disappoint anyone when he finally learned about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist became an active participant in LGBT campaigns and used his participation in this year’s British Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he does this because he is happy that he can live openly, without consequences, and wants to inspire “hope” to others.
The three-time world champion said that when he fell in love with a man – American director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – he was “surprised.”
Daley married an Oscar winner who is 20 years older than him last year, but claims that the age difference has never been a problem.
“When you go through so much while you’re so young,” he said at the Olympics for the first time at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later, “it’s hard to find someone your age has experienced similar ups and downs.”
The two became parents in June and have a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley himself says his "whole worldview" has changed.
“If you had asked me last year, I would have told you that I’m only interested in winning a gold medal,” he said.
“You know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Dalee said his father could not accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if they already had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics – because he wanted to be first.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘You’re not going to be next to me, Dad, or the first line,’” he said.
“I held his hand until he stopped breathing and at that moment when I found out he was dead, I finally admitted he wasn’t invulnerable,” he said.
The following year Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
“I just knew that all my life I’ve dreamt of – jumping at the Olympics in front of the audience at home. There was no more terrifying feeling,” he said.
This also inspired the choice of his first song – “Proud” by Heather Small – which accompanied him during his preparations for the Olympics and still makes him nervous.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays from 11:15 p.m., British summer time.
Michelson's Lost Form Remains on the Rider Cup Saturday
American Phil Michaelson will set a record on Sunday when he will play his 47th game in the Rider Cup, but he will have to regain his old form if he doesn’t want his record to be tied to a failure.
Michaelson, who took part in the two-year event for the record-breaking 12th time, was left on the bench by Captain Jim Furrick for the Fourball and Foursom matches on Saturday.
Instead of being once again a main character on the U.S. team, the five-time grand-tournament winner spent his day as a fan and in training his strikes from a distance in the hope of correcting his weaknesses.
The 48-year-old athlete, who even at the top of his career has never been among the most straight players, is not in the best shape for Le Golf National’s tough playground, where long uneven terrain usually punishes every wrong shot.
And if the field itself is not disturbing enough, in the ninth game on Sunday, Michelson will face the precise champion of the British Open, Francesco Molinari, who is on a team with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood and strive to win all four of their matches.
If the Americans, who are behind four points before the 12th singles game, make a strong start, it may turn out that Michelson’s game is absolutely decisive.
Fourik expressed confidence in his teammate, although he could hardly say anything much different.
“He fully understood his role today, smashed my back, hugged me and said he’d be ready tomorrow,” Furick said.
“He is confident in himself.
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has given as much as in the past and this week.
I probably didn't think he'd play in just two games.
“I expected him to play more, but that’s just how it worked and we believe we’ve made the right decision.
He wants to be on the golf course and play, just like everyone else.”
Mikelson will improve Nick Faldo's record for most of the Rider Cup games played on Sunday.
This could put an end to his career at Rider Cup, which has never come close to his impressive individual achievements.
Michaelson has 18 victories, 20 losses and seven straight matches, but Furick said his presence brings other benefits for the team that are not measured by numbers.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, witty, he likes to joke with people and he’s a great person for every team,” he said.
“I think the younger players were having a lot of fun with him, especially this week.
He gives a lot more than just playing."
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, is aware that the great advantage can soon be resolved
The captain of the Europa team, Thomas Bjorn, knows from personal experience that the great advantage accumulated before the singles matches from the last day of the Rider Cup can easily be eliminated.
The Dutchman made his debut in the Valderrama match in 1997, when the team with Captain Seve Balisteros led by five points ahead of the Americans, but it was at the finals that he was almost reached and barely able to hold the win by 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead at Valderrama; we had a big lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama we won with a win, but it was very difficult,” Bjorn said at the Golf 10 and at the Golf 6, after the European team played 5 in 2018.
So the story has to show both me and everyone on the team that it’s not all over.
Be ready for the attack tomorrow.
Go out and do what you need to do.
Nothing is done until you see the final result on the board.
We have a goal and it’s to try to win this trophy and that’s exactly where we need to stay focused.
All the time I have said that I think only of the 12 players in our team, but we are also aware of our rivals who are some of the greatest players in the world."
Satisfied with the performance of the players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never rush with the festivities.
Tomorrow will be different.
Tomorrow, the individual performances will come out in the foreground and that’s different.
It’s great to be there with a partner when everything goes well, but when you go out on your own, then you test your full capacity as a golfer.
This is the message that should reach the players: tomorrow you have to give the best of yourself.
Now you can turn your partner’s back, as he too has to give up to the end.”
Unlike Bjorn, rival captain Jim Furick will want his players to perform better individually than as partners, with the exceptions being only Jordan Spite and Justin Thomas, who took three out of four possible points.
Fourick himself was on both sides of these big setbacks on the last day – he was part of the triumph of Brookline, and then on the losing side when the Europeans performed the Miracle of Medinah.
“I remember every damn word,” he said in response to the question of how Ben Krenshau, the captain in 1999, led his players on the final day.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but it would be good to make the same good start as you saw at Brookline and Medinah.
When the advantage passes from one direction to the other, these intermediate matches are played under enormous tension.
That’s why we formed our band and distributed our boys the way we wanted to, so we can try to do the impossible tomorrow.”
Thomas is tasked with leading our counterattack and facing Rory McIlroy in the most important match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Jan Polter will meet the other Europeans in the top half of the lineup.
“I chose these players in this order because I think that gives us the greatest chance of success,” Bjorn said of his choice for the singles.
Germany postpones the launch of a new warship
The German fleet's newest frigate was to be put into operation in 2014 to replace the outdated warships of the Cold War era, but this would not happen at least until the following year due to malfunctioning systems and overcrowding.
The commissioning of Rheinland-Pfalz, the brand’s flagship of new frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit, a spokesman for the army.
The vessel was due to join the navy in 2014, but the problems that arose after its delivery affected the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships ordered by the fleet in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
It is understandable that they will have a powerful gun, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – the latest frigates should be able to be used for up to two years before returning to docking ports.
Continuous delays, however, mean that the avant-garde warships – which are said to allow Germany to demonstrate force beyond the ocean – will already be old when they go into operation, Die Zeit notes.
The unfortunate F125 frigate entered the headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to put the vessel into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the fleet has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media cited a number of substantial "software and hardware defects" that make the warship unusable if sent to a combat mission.
Software deficiencies are particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels will be operated by a crew of around 120 sailors – only half of the crew of the older Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it turned out that the ship is significantly overloaded, which reduces its efficiency and limits the ability of the navy to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is believed to be twice as heavy as the ships of this class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the cost of the entire project – including crew training – also becomes a problem.
It is estimated to have reached the staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) – out of the initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
Problems with the latest frigates have become especially important in the light of recent warnings that Germany’s naval forces are shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee of the German parliament, admitted that the fleet was actually “depleting from ships capable of carrying out missions.”
The official said the problem has become bigger over time, as the old ships have been put out of service, but no new ones have been provided.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates could join the fleet.
The National Trust tracks the secret life of butterflies
A new study conducted in a mansion in the Scottish Mountains aims to determine how bats use the landscape when they hunt.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of unique flying mammals and will help guide future conservation actions.
The study by scientists from the National Trust of Scotland will follow common bats, as well as brown arrowheads water nocturnes at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed in key locations on the property to track the activities of bats during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
The expert sound analysis of all the recordings will determine the frequency of the call sounds of the bats, as well as what types they emit.
A map of the habitat and a report will then be drawn up to create a detailed landscape picture of their behavior.
Rob Duar, Nature Conservation Adviser for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important for butterflies and how they are used by any species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work, e.g. the creation of meadows, as well as the best way to maintain forest areas for butterflies and other related species.
Flea populations in Scotland and the United Kingdom as a whole have declined significantly in the last century.
They are endangered by construction activities that affect their shelters and lead to the loss of habitat.
Populations may be at risk from wind turbines and lighting, aeroplanes and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
In fact, the butterflies are not blind.
However, due to their hunting habits at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching a prey.
They use advanced echolocation techniques to detect insects and obstacles along their flight trajectory.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 large gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes the bats very seriously.
The trust has trained experts who carry out regular surveys, asylum inspections, and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization has even created the first in Scotland and the only special butterfly reserve in the Thrave estate in the Dumfries and Galloway area, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten butterfly species.
The manager of the estate, David Thompson, says it's an ideal territory for them.
“Here in Thrave, we have a great butterfly field,” he said.
“We have old buildings, many mature trees and a well-fitted habitat.
But there’s a lot more about bats that aren’t known, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us better understand what they need to thrive.”
He stresses that it is important to check for bats before carrying out property maintenance activities, as it is possible to involuntary destruction of a shelter to kill up to 400 female and young bats, as well as to destroy a whole local population.
Fleas are a protected species and it is illegal to kill, harass, embarrass or destroy their shelters.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish clerk in the Flemish Conservation Trust, encouraged society to help.
She said: “I still have a lot to learn about our bats and many of our animal species, because we just don’t know what’s going on with their populations.”
Ronaldo rejects rape allegation and his lawyers will sue a German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape allegations against him “fake news,” saying people “want to be known” using his name.
His lawyers will judge the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which publishes these claims.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus was accused of raping the American Catherine Majorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is alleged that he then paid her $375,000 to silence the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In an Instagram video, addressing its 142 million followers, a few hours after the allegations were posted, 33-year-old Ronaldo branded the post as “fake news.”
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they said about me today is fake news,” the five-time Golden Ball bearer told the camera.
“They want to be famous by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to gain popularity on my back, but that's part of the job.
"I'm a happy person and everything's fine," the footballer smiled.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the allegations they call “unacceptable disclosure of suspicions in the area of privacy,” according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the footballer would seek compensation for "moral damages in magnitude corresponding to the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
It is alleged that the incident occurred in June 2009 in an apartment at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga went to the player’s room, where he is alleged to have raped her anal, according to documents filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that after the incident, Ronaldo fell to his knees and told her he was a “good boy” of “99 percent”, but in the case he just gave up on “one percent.”
According to the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that they had had sex, but this happened with her consent.
Mayorga also claimed that she went to the police and photographs of her injuries were taken in a hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court agreement because she felt “horrified by revenge” and was worried not to “put a puddle down.”
The 34-year-old woman says she wants to cancel the deal as she continues to live with the trauma of the incident.
At the time of the incident, Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer he moved to the Italian Grand Juventus for the sum of 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain will "forever regret" that it has lost its car makers
Britain will "forever regret" if it loses its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clarke said.
He added that it was “concerning” that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” he said.
The Japanese carmaker said the impact of the border delay in the case of a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
At the plant in Burnaston, where the Auris and Avensis models are produced, nearly 150,000 cars were produced last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My opinion is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our plant will stop,” said Marvin Cook, director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other UK automakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have voiced concerns about leaving the EU without a deal and how cross-border trade will work.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of automakers are related to the risks to the supply chain in the case of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line works on the “precisely on time” principle, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers from both the UK and the EU for custom-made cars.
If Britain leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be border problems, which the industry believes could lead to delays and a shortage of parts.
For Toyota it would be impossible to wait more than a day to replenish their inventory at the plant in Derbyshire, the company said, and therefore production will stop.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's "chess" plan for future relations with the EU was "precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks."
"We want to make the best deal that will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to be able to seize that opportunity," he said on BBC Radio's 4's Today.
“Following the claims not only of Toyota, but also of other manufacturers, we are absolutely convinced that we need to be able to continue to provide successful supply chains.”
Toyota can’t say how long production will be halted, but in the longer term they warn that additional costs will reduce the plant’s competitiveness and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsuvalaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is the founder of the Unite Union at the plant, said that its members are increasingly concerned: “From experience I judge that if these jobs go, they will never come back.
A spokesman for the government said: “We have put in place a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU.”
The meeting between Trump and Rosenstein may be postponed again, says the White House
The extremely important meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed by another week” as the Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavanaugh’s fight continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump and Russia’s aides, and the potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, and thus endanger Mueller’s independence, has been fueling rumors of Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the possibility of carrying a microphone to record talks with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denies this allegation.
But last Monday he went to the White House after reports that he would resign.
Instead, while Trump was at the U.N. headquarters in New York, a meeting with him was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer to not" fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, which was witnessed by both Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into complaints against Kavanaugh, further delaying the full Senate vote.
Trump's spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about her meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “There is still no set date for this, it could be this week, but seeing all the other things that happen in the Supreme Court, I think it can be postponed for the next week.
But we’ll see, and I always try to keep the press informed.”
Some reporters would dispute this claim: Sanders did not hold a press conference by the White House on September 10.
The head of the show, Chris Wallace, asked about the reason.
Sanders replied that the rare press conferences were not due to disapproval of the "demonstrative behavior" of television journalists, although he shared: "I cannot say that I disagree with the fact that they have demonstrative behavior."
She then hinted that the direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
“The president holds more sessions with questions and answers than any president before him,” she said, adding, without quoting evidence: “We checked these statistics.”
There will still be press conferences, Sanders continued, but “if representatives of the press have a chance to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it’s far better than talking to me.
We are trying to do it often, and you have seen it quite often in recent weeks, and that will replace the press conferences once you have the opportunity to speak with the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or press conferences with visiting high-ranking figures.
Self-contained press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why, with his eccentric and at times odd behavior in front of the gathered journalists.
Health Minister Addresses EU Workers at Scotland's National Health Service on Brexit-Related Concerns
The Minister of Health addressed EU staff working at the National Health Service of Scotland in writing to express the country's gratitude and desire to remain in place after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter to those who remained less than six months before Britain’s exit from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to the costs of the established procedures for the status of EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: “During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on leaving have continued, and decisions are expected this autumn.
But the UK government is also making progress in its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I'm sure this is a very insecure period for all of you.
Therefore, I want to remind you how much I appreciate each employee’s contribution, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond contribute with valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, benefiting the patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we would love you to stay here.”
Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after having a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Chris Abercrombie underwent an emergency operation after he suffered a head injury during a meeting on Saturday when his team lost to Vanderbilt Commodore 31-27, Tennessee's Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State's senior coach Rod Reid told reporters that the injury had occurred just before half-time.
“He went to the sideline and somehow just fell there,” Reed said.
Trainers and medical personnel submitted oxygen to Abercrombie on the sideline before it was placed on a carrier and taken to the dressing rooms for further examination.
A Tennessee State official confirmed to Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had left surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no details about the type/seriousness of the injury" and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a college scholarship graduate, is for his first season at Tennessee State after his transfer from Illinois.
On Saturday, he made a total of five blockades before leaving the game, making a total of 18 blockades for him this season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher coat of arms tax when buying real estate in the UK.
According to the new plans of the Conservatives, foreign buyers will be charged a higher coat of arms tax when buying real estate in the UK, with the additional funds will help the homeless.
This move will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters.
The increase in the coat of arms tax will affect those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The state treasury expects an increase of more than <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year, which will help the homeless
Theresa May will announce today the decision of foreign buyers to pay a higher coat of arms tax when buying real estate in the UK, with additional income going to help the homeless.
This move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters by promising more affordable housing and targeting high-income people.
The increase in the coat of arms tax will affect individuals and businesses that do not pay taxes in the UK, with additional revenues to support the government’s efforts to limit the number of people sleeping on the street.
The supplement – which is an addition to the current coat of arms tax, including higher levels introduced two years ago for second homes and properties purchased for grant purposes – could amount to up to three percent.
The state treasury expects revenues to rise by up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
About 13 percent of newly built buildings in London are bought by people with citizenship outside the UK, which leads to price increases and makes it difficult for people who buy property for the first time to intervene in the real estate market.
Many of the rich areas – especially in the capital – have become “ghost cities” due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the coat of arms tax to help more young people own their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high property prices by seizing land but not using it, and asked Ms. May to abandon the quotas for affordable housing in order to correct Britain’s “shame with housing.”
Mr Corbyn announced an attractive series of proposals for housing reforms, including control over rents and the end of “no-wine” expulsions.
He also wants to give the councils greater powers to build new homes.
May said: “Last year I shared that I would like to devote my time as prime minister to restoring the British dream of making life better for every new generation.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
The UK will always have open doors for those who want to live, work and build their lives here.
But it is not right for people who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies, to buy housing as easily as the hard-working residents of the UK.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home has gone too far in time, and the embarrassment of sleeping on the street remains too realistic.”
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to lead the Scotland team"
Sunderland manager Jack Ross said his "greatest ambition" in his career was to be a senior coach for Scotland's national team.
The 42-year-old accepted the challenge to revive the club from north-east England, which is currently in third place in the First League, at three points from first place.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St. Mirren back to the Scottish Higher League last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I recorded one game for the B team and that was all," Ross told BBC Sportsound.
“But I grew up with the Scottish games at Hampton, which as a child we watched together with my father, so the national team has always attracted me.
“But this opportunity would only open up if I had success at the club level.”
Among Ross' predecessors as Sunderland managers were names such as Dick Lawyer, David Moiss, Sam Alderdays, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keen, Gus Poyet and Paolo Di Canio.
Aloe Athletic's former mentor said he was not concerned as an heir to such established names in a similarly famous club, having previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“For me, success at the moment will be measured with a positive answer to the question, ‘Can I return this club to the Higher League?’
Because in terms of structure, base and conditions, he is undoubtedly at the level of the Higher League,” he said.
“It’s not going to be easy to get back to the highest level of football, but I’ll assume that I’ve achieved success here only if I manage to get the team back there.”
Ross has been a manager for only three years after spending some time as an assistant at Dumbarton and 15 months at Harts' coaching staff.
He then helped Aloe avoid falling into the Third Division and turned St. Mirren from a falling team into a Champions League winner the following season.
Ross says he now feels more comfortable than he did during his career as a footballer at Clyde, Hartlepool, Folkerk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“I was really at the crossroads,” he recalls of the time when he took Aloa.
“I really believed that being a manager was the best area for me, including being an active player.
It sounds strange because I was doing well, I was making good money, and I had some significant successes.
But being a player is sometimes difficult.
There are a lot of things you have to deal with every week.
I’m still facing the same levels of stress and stress at work, but I just feel like being a manager is the right direction for me.
“I’ve always wanted to be a manager, and now that I’m really doing it, I’ve never felt more comfortable in my skin in my entire conscious life.”

The ideal time for beer is 5:30pm on Saturday, reveals research
The summer heat has boosted the revenues of those struggling to survive British pubs, but has amassed more tension for chains of restaurants.
Groups of pubs and bars reported a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July, but restaurant revenues fell by 4.8 percent, the statistics show.
Peter Martin of the CGA Business Consultancy, which compiled the statistics, said: “Due to the prolonged sunshine and longer than expected England’s participation in the World Cup, a similar pattern was observed in July, when the polls reported 2nd June.
The 1.8 percent decline in the restaurant business in June only deepened in July.
The pubs and bars for drinks reported the best results in their growth, compared to the downward movement of the restaurants.
Eating pubs also suffered from sunny weather, but not as much as restaurant owners.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and drink something.
In pubs and bars, sales of beverages jumped 6.6 percent over the month, while in food there was a 3 percent drop.”
Paul Newman, from RSM Recreation and Entertainment Analysts, said: “These results continue the trend we saw at the end of April.
The time and influence of large social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the field of out-of-home services.
It’s no surprise that restaurant groups continue to suffer, although a 4.8 percent drop in sales on an annual basis can be particularly painful in addition to the constant costs.
The long hot summer couldn’t have come at a worse time for food business managers, and only the weather will show whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will bring the desired holiday.”
Total sales growth at pubs and restaurants, including new ones, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in brand rollout.

One in five children hide a secret profile from their parents on a social network
One in five children – some only 11 – has a secret social networking profile that they hide from their parents and teachers, a study found.
A study conducted among 20,000 high school students shows the growth of fake Insta pages
The news has raised fears that material with sexual content is being published.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a “fundamental” profile that they showed to their parents.
One in five children – some one in 11 – create a profile on a social network that keeps it a secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed growth in fake Insta accounts – a link to the Instagram photo-sharing site.
The news has heightened fears that material with sexual content is being published.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a cleaned-up “fundamental” profile, which they showed to their parents, while also having secret profiles.
A mother who stumbled across her 13-year-old daughter’s secret site discovered a teenage boy who encouraged others to “rape him.”
A study by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors of Independent Schools (HMC) found that 40 percent of children between the ages of 11 and 18 have two profiles, with half of them admitting that they keep their profiles secret.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, said: “It’s alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Aiden Doyle will be the voice of the athletics in Scotland’s Board of Athletics
Aided Doyle was elected to join the Board of Athletics in Scotland as director without executive duties at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland’s most accomplished lightweight and President Ian Beetle has defined this move as a great opportunity for those leading in the sport to take advantage of her rich international experience over the past decade.
"Elyde enjoys tremendous respect in the athletic communities of Scotland, the UK and the world, and we are convinced that lightweight athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from its attraction," Beety said.
Doyle said: “I have a desire to be the voice of the athletes and I really hope I can contribute and help promote the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won the finals of the Olympic Games in Atlanta in 1996, adding to a total of four Olympic gold medals, and is currently a regular commentator on the BBC, lost his ability to walk after receiving a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: “I got hit a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I will recover and to what extent.
It was exhausting work, but I achieved a full recovery, I learned to walk again and today I do mobility workouts!
“Thank you for the encouraging messages!”
Advertising for a milk pump that compares mothers to cows, splits online opinions
A company that manufactures milk pumps has divided online opinions with advertising that compares breastfeeding mothers to cows that are breastfeeding.
To mark the launch of the expected “world’s first wearable, noiseless breast pump,” consumer technology company Elvie has launched a humorous music-video ad to showcase the freedom that the new pump provides to breastfeeding.
Four real mothers dance in a cow’s belly full of hay, against the background of a song with a text that includes: “Yes, I’m breastfeeding, but you don’t see any tail” and “If you haven’t noticed, it’s not a whim, it’s my breasts.”
The chant goes on: "Pump, pump, feed the babies, pump, pump, milk your girlfriends."
However, the advertisement, posted on the company’s Facebook page, caused online disagreements.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the clip received mixed reactions from viewers, with many stating that it undermines the "horror" of the dairy industry.
“A very stupid decision is to use cows to advertise this product.
“Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies take them a few days after birth.”
Elvie's Milk Pump Collects Discreetly in a Breastfeeding Bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: “It is completely understandable that it is traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But yes, why not use them for breastfeeding pump advertising for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added, “So inadequate advertising.”
Others defended the advertisement, with one woman admitting that she considered the song "extremely fun".
“I think the idea is brilliant.
I'd buy one if I was still breastfeeding.
The deforestation made me feel like a cow.
Advertisement is a little ratty, but I accept it as it is.
“This product is brilliant,” someone wrote.
Another comment: “It’s a funny advertisement aimed at mothers who get bored (often at their workplaces or in the toilets) and feel like “cows.”
It is not an advertisement that praises or condemns the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the group of women reveal that they were dancing with the discrete pumps placed in their joints.
The concept of the campaign is based on the view that many women who breastfeed feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, however, is completely silent, no wires or pipes, and is discreetly assembled into a breastfeeding bra that gives women the freedom to move around, hold their babies and even go outside while they dry out.
Ana Ballarin, partner and executive creative director at Mother, comments: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves to be boldly and provocatively marketed.
By drawing a parallel between breastfeeding and breastfeeding cows, we wanted to draw attention to breastfeeding and all the challenges associated with it, while showing in a fun and understandable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This isn't the first time that Elvie's pump has been in the news.
During Fashion Week in London, the mother of two children appeared on the podium for designer Martha Jakubowski, using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children have been secretly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border.
The number of detained children of migrants has skyrocketed, although monthly border crossings remain relatively unchanged, in part because the Trump administration’s harsh rhetoric and policies have made it difficult to accommodate children with guardians.
Usually most guardians are immigrants without documents who are afraid to risk staying in the country if they wish to recognize a child.
The risk escalated in June, when federal authorities announced that potential guardians and other adults from the family should provide fingerprints, as this data will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Service, testified to Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who wanted to become custodians of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have previous criminal records.
“Nearly 80 percent of persons who are either guardians or members of the guardians’ family reside illegally in the country, most of whom are foreign criminals.
So we will continue to pursue these people,” Albens said.
In an effort to deal more quickly with the registration of these children, the authorities imposed new rules that require some of them to appear in court within a month of their detention, rather than after 60 days, as was the previous norm, according to shelter officials.
Many appear in a video conferencing conversation, not in person, to present their case for legal status to an immigration judge.
Those identified as unsuitable for admission will be deported as soon as possible.
The longer children stay in detention, the more likely they are to become repressed or depressed, which can lead to violent riots or escape attempts, according to shelter officials and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Lawyers said this concern is growing at large facilities, such as the one in Tornillo, where signs that a child has problems are more likely to be overlooked because of the scale of the site.
They added that moving children to a “tent city” without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say good-bye to their friends could exacerbate the trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria urges U.S., France and Turkey’s “occupation forces” to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the civil war has been going on for eight years.
Mualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign troops were illegally residing on Syrian soil under the pretext of combating terrorism and “relevant action will be taken against them.”
“They must be withdrawn immediately and without any conditions,” he said at the meeting.
Mualem insisted that “the war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011 and millions have been forcibly displaced from their homes.
He said Damascus will continue to “fight this sacred battle until all Syrian lands are cleared” by both terrorist organizations and by “any illegal presence of foreigners.”
The U.S. has about 2,000 military personnel in Syria who mainly train and advise both the Kurdish and Syrian forces, opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 military personnel in the countries of the war-torn country.
Regarding the refugees, Mualem said the conditions were tolerable and could be returned, accusing "some Western countries of "exhaling groundless fears" that prompted refugees to stay away.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to cooperate in these returns,” he said.
“They’re turning into a political issue, something that’s completely humanitarian.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that no aid will be provided to restore Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to halt the war.
U.N. diplomats said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib provides an opportunity for progress in political dialogue.
The deal between Russia and Turkey prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
Mualem, however, stressed that the agreement had “clear deadlines” and expressed hope that the military actions would be directed at jihadists, including fighters from the Al-Qaeda-linked Al Nusra front, who “will be destroyed.”
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of the new committee, made up of members of the government and opposition, to draw up a draft of Syria’s post-war constitution and pave the way for elections.
Mualem set out the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be limited to "reviewing the members of the current constitution" and warned that there should be no interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
Under this logic, Trump will win re-election in 2020, unless – as many liberal viewers hope – his presidency is not prematurely terminated due to impeachment and scandal.
This would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic end of the presidency ever!”
So far, there are no signs of fatigue in the audience.
Since 2014, the primetime rating has doubled to 1.05 million for CNN and nearly three times to 1.6 million for MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during primetime, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" is at the top of the rankings for cable television, with up to 3.5 million viewers on big news nights.
“It’s a fire that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” says Neil Baer, executive producer of ABC’s drama The Last Candidate, where he talks about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack on the Capitol.
Neal Scowell, who is a veteran comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys’ Club, has another theory.
She recalled driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The taxi driver told her he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
She asked, “Why?”
Mrs. Scowell told me that he replied, "Because he's making me laugh."
There's fun in chaos.
Of course, unlike everything else shown on television, the stories coming out of Washington can determine the future of Row vs. Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite, as well as the good state of the world economy.
Exclusion is a luxury that can only be afforded by the most privileged viewers.
Yet, the desire to be an informed citizen does not correspond to this in six hours to watch as a group of experts discuss Bob Woodward, who uses "deep historical information" as a source for his book "Fear" and "Archived copy"; the pilot jacket of Paul Manafort (referred to as "Strive Skin").
I'll never look at Super Mario in the same way again.
“Part of what he does to make you feel like part of a real-life show is to give you a little bit of every night,” said Brent Montgomery, chief executive producer of Wheelhouse Entertainment’s “Chevrolet” and creator of “Pawn Stars.”
You can't afford to miss an episode because you're gonna be late.
When I contacted Mr. Flash this week, it was sunny, 80 degrees at the north coast of Kauai, but he had shut himself up at home to watch MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not separate himself from the television, especially when Brett Cavanaugh had to face the Senate's legal commission, and the Supreme Court's future depended on it.
“I remember when we used to do all those rat shows and people were like, ‘This is the beginning of the end for Western civilization,’” Mr. Flash told me.
“I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Investments are pouring into the most contested competition in the early elections for a seat in Congress
Not surprisingly, Pennsylvania’s 17th district is getting a flow of money, thanks to the reorganization of congressional districts and from there two headlines for the same place.
The newly redistributed district in the suburbs of Pittsburgh has named conservative Democrat Connor Lamb, who won his place from another district in a partial election last spring.
Lamb is facing another titular, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who is currently representing Pennsylvania's old 12th district, which is significantly opposed to the new 17th.
The maps were rewritten after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally manipulated in favor of the Republicans.
The competition in the new 17th district sparked a financial dispute between the party’s main funding institutions, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Commission (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Commission (NRCC).
Lamb broke out in Pennsylvania after a difficult victory in the widely debated March 18th congressional district of Pennsylvania.
The position was held by Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the county by 20 points.
Political experts believe that the Democrats have a slight advantage.
U.S. considers imposing sanctions on El Salvador over its support for China, then resigns
Diplomats note that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little pressure from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a heartfelt meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017, and also owned a hotel in Panama until the partners fired the Trump Organization management team.
Representatives of the State Department have decided to withdraw the heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, due to “recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan,” Heather Nauert said earlier this month.
But sanctions were envisaged only against El Salvador, which in 2017 received about $140 million in U.S. aid to fight drugs, for development and economic aid.
The proposed sanctions, including cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would be tortuous for the Central American state with its unemployment and murder rate.
As internal meetings progressed, officials from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic well-being, which served as a continuation of a similar gathering of mines in the past year, seen as a step forward in strength.
But by mid-September, senior governing bodies had clarified that their wish was to hold the conference, effectively ending any discussion of sanctions against El Salvador.
Now Vice President Mike Pence has announced that he will participate in the conference, scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the gathering, diplomats say.
All three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without new stringent announcements or sanctions from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who wished to remain anonymous, who agreed to participate in the internal discussions.
Their accounts were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration, who also wished to remain anonymous.
History of the study
The next step may be the report by Special Adviser Robert Mueller on a possible impediment to justice by Mr. Trump, with the report currently being significant evidence in the public register.
It is alleged that Mr. Muller is also directing his investigation into whether Mr. Trump conspired with Russia during his campaign to attack our elections.
If the leadership of Congress changes, it will turn out that Mr. Trump will have to be accounted for in this body, just as he prepares to face voters, and perhaps also in front of jurors made up of his colleagues.
There are many unknowns here, and I do not suggest that Mr. Trump’s fall is inevitable – nor that of those like him in Europe.
All of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, must make these choices that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a coup d'état against Hitler, as long as the West had resisted him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the subsequent years of the massacre.
The course of history depends on such turbulent moments, and the relentless march of democracy is speeding up or slowing down.
At the moment, the Americans are facing several such nodes at the moment.
What do we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who holds in his hands the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in danger since the newspaper reported that last year he secretly proposed to register the president and speculated that he was unsuitable for the post.
Mr. Rosenstein said the story in The Times was inaccurate.
“How will we react if the new investigation against Brett Kavanaugh, demanded by the FBI, is not complete or fair – or if it is approved for the Supreme Court despite allegations of sexual assault and forgery?
And most of all, are we going to vote in the early elections to Congress if that will force Mr. Trump to take responsibility?
If we fail in these trials, democracy is waiting for a long winter.
But I don't think we're going to fail because I learned from Prague.
My mother was a Jewish woman from Czechoslovakia who was taken to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had once occupied my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to light the Sabbath candles on that table, wearing a swastika.
With a legacy like this, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorans of Rangers is optimistic about the clash with Rapid Vienna
The Rangers are hosting Rapid Vienna on Thursday, aware that a victory over the Austrians after the impressive draw in Spain against Vilareal earlier this month will give them a significant chance to continue ahead of Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury did not allow midfielder Graham Dorans to play his first game of the season before the 2–2 draw with Villareal, but he believes that for the Rangers this result could become a stepping stone to greater achievements.
"We won an important point because Villareal are a good opponent," the 31-year-old said.
“We got into the game in the hopes that we could win something and we left with a point.
Maybe we could even win at the end of the match, but overall the equality seems to be a fair result.
They were better in the first half and we were better in the second.
We have taken a look at Thursday, another great evening of our matches in Europe.
I hope that we will be able to fight for the three points, it will be a difficult match, because they achieved a good result in the last meeting, but I am sure that with the support of our audience we can do our best and achieve a good result.
“Last year was definitely tough after everything that happened alongside my injuries and changes at the club, but now things seem to be moving in the direction of the rules.
The team is good and the boys really have fun, the workouts are beneficial.
I hope that we will be able to make every effort to forget the last season and achieve the desired success.”
Women Are Worried About Fears About Their Retirement Savings
Despite the fact that the study participants had a clear idea of what care they wanted to receive, few people discuss this with family members.
About half of the participants in the Nationwide study said they had discussed with their spouses the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent of them have talked to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they haven’t taken the steps to conduct this conversation,” said Holly Snyder, Vice President of the Life Insurance Sector at Nationwide.
Here's what you can start with.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to provide you with care unless you state your wishes in advance.
Together with your counselor and your family, discuss where and how you want to be taken care of, as these decisions can be a decisive factor in determining costs.
Include your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you with an idea of how to pay for these expenses.
Your decisions when choosing a financial institution for long-term care can include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a mixed life insurance policy with a monetary value to help you cover those expenses, or self-insurance with your funds.
Prepare your legal documents: Deal with legal battles from the very beginning.
Appoint a health care representative so that you have a certain trustee who oversees your medical care and ensures that the professionals comply with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Consider also the idea of an attorney in financial matters.
You can choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your bills are paid if you are incapacitated.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine that your adult parent needs urgent medical attention and travels to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Discuss these details in writing in order to be prepared.
“It’s not just about the financial aspect, it’s about who the doctors will be,” Martin said.
“What are the medications?
Who will take care of the dog?
Make a plan.”
A man was shot several times with an air rifle in Ilfracomb
A man was shot several times with an air rifle while he was coming home in the evening outside.
The victim, about 40, was found in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and arm.
Police described the shooting, which took place around 2:30 a.m. British summer time, as an “accidental act.”
The victim was unable to see the attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening and the police are trying to attract witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities said, with the death toll expected to increase.
Due to disrupted communications, aid organizations are unable to receive information from the Dongala Regency, an area north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu after the disaster.
Here are some basic facts about Palu and Dongala, which are located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow beach on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of 379,800 people in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
Dongala is a regency that extends over 300 km (180 miles) along the coastline of the island of Sulawesi.
The regency, which is an administrative region smaller than a province, has an approximate population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the basis of the economy of the central province of Sulawesi, especially in the coastal area of Dongala.
The production of nickel is also important for the province, but is concentrated mainly in Morovali, on the opposite shore of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have been hit several times by tsunami over the past 100 years, according to data from the Indonesian Disaster Recovery Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of buildings in Dongala.
Tsunami struck the western part of Dongala and in 1996, when nine people died.
Indonesia is located on the seismic “Pacific Ring of Fire” and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunami waves in recent years:
2004: A powerful tsunami on December 26 on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in North Sumatra triggers a wave of tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people across the coastline of the Indian Ocean, with more than half of them in A.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias on the shores of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude quake struck Indonesia’s most populous island, Java, by triggering a tsunami that broke out on the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Mentavai Islands and triggered a 10-metre tsunami wave that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A sluggish earthquake hit the Pidy Jaya Regency in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as people remembered the devastation caused by the deadly earthquakes and tsunami in 2004.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people were killed by collapsed buildings.
2018: Strong thunderstorms hit Indonesia’s tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, most of them on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily left thousands of tourists in the ditch.

Trac Paylin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Paylin, has been arrested on charges of violence.
Peylin, a 29-year-old from Wasila, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference with a report of domestic violence, and resistance to arrest, according to a report by the Alaska State Police published on Saturday.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took the phone from her.
Peylin was detained in the Mat-Su Pre-Detention Building and under a $500 unsecured guarantee, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he pleaded "innocent, certainly" when asked to loot, the media reported.
Peylin is threatened with punishment for three Class A offenses, meaning he could be deprived of liberty for up to a year and pay a $250,000 fine.
He is also charged with a Class B offence, which is punishable by one day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time a criminal charge has been filed against Peylin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Payline.
His mother, Sarah Payline, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently being examined by the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interference in reporting a crime of domestic violence and possession of a weapon under the influence of narcotics in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claims that he hit her with a fist in the face.
Sarah Paylin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 when she linked her son’s aggressive behavior to post-traumatic stress stemming from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds Killed
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electrical and communications networks have been cut off, with the number of deaths expected to increase in the coming days.
The quake struck near central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
On social media, there are clips that show the moment of the collision.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in Palu when a tsunami surged over the coast.
Federal prosecutors want rare death penalty for suspect in New York terror attack <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Federal prosecutors in New York are demanding the death penalty for Saifulo Saipov, the suspect in the New York terror attack in which eight people were killed — a rare punishment that has not been executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saypov, 30, is alleged to have used a truck leased from Home Depot to carry out the October attack on the bike lane near the West Side highway in Lower Manhattan, gazing pedestrians and cyclists on his way.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious bodily harm, according to the notification of intent in connection with the request for the death penalty.
According to the court document, both charges can result in a death sentence.
Weeks after the assassination, an expanded federal judiciary filed a 22-point indictment against Saipov, including eight counts of murder-related retaliation commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as an indictment of rape and rape.
The attack required “serious planning and deliberateness,” prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov was carried out as “terrible, cruel and perverted.”
“Saifulo Habibulaevich Saipov caused injuries, injuries and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, An-Lori Decad, Darren Drake, Ariel Irley, Hernand Feluci and Alejandro Damian Panuko”, in Senuko.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last time the Southern District of New York sought the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug dealers, but was subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a federal death sentence was executed in New York City was in 1953 – Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a family couple who were executed after a conviction for conspiracy and two years of espionage for the Soviet Union during the Second World War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saypov, a Uzbek by nationality, did not show a sense of regret in the days and months after the assassination, according to court documents.
He told the investigators that he felt good about what he did, police said.
Saipov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching clips of ISIS on his phone, the indictment said.
He also asked for the ISIS flag to be placed in his hospital room, police said.
He pleads innocent in the indictment, consisting of 22 points.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, noted that they were “obviously disappointed” by the prosecutor’s decision.
“In our view, the decision to seek a death sentence instead of a sentence of guilty and life imprisonment without the possibility of early release will only prolong the traumatic effect of these events for all those affected,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team has previously asked the prosecutor’s office not to seek a death sentence.
Conservative MP Says NIJEL FARAZ Must Lead Brexit Negotiations <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Nigel Farage has vowed to “mobilize the army of the people” today, during a protest at the Conservatives’ conference.
The former leader of the British Independence Party said politicians should “feel pressure” — as one of Theresa May’s own party members suggested he lead the negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bone, a Conservative MP, said in March in Birmingham that Britain “would have been out so far” if Mr Farage was secretary on Brexit issues.
But the challenge Ms. May faces to agree with the deeply divided lines of the party has been underscored by conservatives backing the stay, who have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to keep his compromised Chequers plan, despite attacks by Brexit-backed, EU-backed and EU-backed supporters.
The allies insist that it will make progress in its attempt to reach a deal with Brussels despite hostile reactions, and urge Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its package and “chaos.”
Mr. Bon told protesters with the slogan “Exit means exit” in Solihull that he wanted to “throw Chequers.”
He stressed that Mr Farage should have participated equally with the others and that he should have been given the responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had been in the lead, we would have left by now,” he said.
Wellingborough MP added: “I support Brexit, but we must reject the Chequers plan.”
Declaring his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be laborers.
We want to create our own laws in our own country.”
Mr. Bone rejected the claims that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The notion that the British have changed their mind and want to stay is completely false.”
Conservative spokeswoman Andrea Jenkins also attended the rally, telling reporters: “I’m just saying, Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is not popular among the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular in our party and our activists, who actually went out on the street and really helped us get elected.
Please, cut out the "Checkers" and start listening."
In an open message to Ms May, she added: "Premiers retain their position when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage told the rally that politicians must “feel pressure” if they plan to change the decision made after the 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s about the trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to change Brexit, and we’ve gathered here today to say, ‘We’re not going to let you get away with this.’
In an address to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is on the verge of changing Brexit, feel pressure.
“We are mobilizing the army of the people of this country that has helped us win Brexit, and we will never stop until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.”
At the same time, supporters of the stay went on a march through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city center.
Six activists raised flags with the words “Conservatives against Brexit” after the group’s launch this weekend.
Labour’s Lord Adonis joked with the Conservatives about the party’s security issues when he opened the conference.
“These are the people who tell us that they can deploy the IT systems and all of Canada’s technology and more, and more, for unhindered border crossings, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“This is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren Says He Will “Seriously Consider” His Candidacy for President
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said he would “seriously consider the possibility of running for president” after the November election.
Boston Globe reported that the representative of the Massachusetts Democrats had spoken about her future during a city council in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a permanent critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Republican U.S. Representative Jeff Dale, who was a co-chairman of the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
She is at the center of speculation that she could take the post of Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Hollywood was her 36th meeting with voters in the mayor’s building after Trump took office.
One of the attendees asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren said it was time for “women to go to Washington and repair our damaged government, and that includes women at the top.”
He was arrested for the death of Sims from LSU.
Police in Batton Rouge, Los Angeles, on Saturday said they had arrested a suspect in the shooting on Friday when LSU basketball player Wade Simms was killed.
The Batton Rouge Police Department reported the arrest of 20-year-old Dayton Simpson during a press conference at 11 a.m. Eastern time.
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying the man who was seen on the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University area early in the morning on Friday.
"Wayd Sims was shot in the head, which ultimately led to his death," Murphy J. Paul, the police chief, told the press on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wade intervened to protect his friend and was shot by the Simpsons.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted he was at the crime scene, had a gun, and shot Wade Simms.
Simpson has been arrested without problems and detained in the East Batton Rouge Police Department's arrest.

Grand Prix of Russia: Louis Hamilton is getting closer to the world title after the team's instructions helped him win Sebastian Fettel
From the moment Valteri Botas came ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the Mercedes team's instructions would play an important role in the race.
Bottas made a good start from the first position and seriously worried Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two laps, allowing Fetel to attack his teammate.
Fettel was the first to make a pit stop and let Hamilton handle traffic at the end of the column, which seemed to be crucial to the outcome of the race.
The Mercedes also made a pit stop on the next lap and came out after Fettle, but Hamilton managed to overtake him after a daring maneuver and riding "rubber to tire", which forced Ferrari's driver to steer a sledgehammer with a sledgehammer was a sledgehammered sledgehammer to free the inside of the track to escape.
On top of his 21st birthday, Max Verstappen started from the back rows of the starting grid and was seventh after the end of the first round.
He then even led for a long period of time from the race, as he had decided to change his tyres later on, which would allow him to be faster at the end of the race and eventually overtake Kimi Raikonen in the fourth-place fight.
He finally entered the pit-stop in the 44th lap, but failed to make it through the next eight lap and ultimately finished fourth.
It was a tough day because Walter did a great job all weekend and showed up as a real gentleman when he let me go ahead of him.
“The team did an exceptional job to win the first two places on the podium,” Hamilton said.
It was really a bad body language.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Diane Feinstein at a rally on Saturday over her claim that she had not circulated the letter from Christine Blaise Ford, accusing Supreme Court candidate Bret Cavanaugh of sexual assault.
During a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford’s testimony to the Senate Legal Committee, but instead commented on how what is happening in the Senate shows that people are “evil and disgusting and dishonest.”
“What can happen is the good things that happen in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see angry people and evil, and disgusting, and dishonest,” he said.
“When you look at publications and distribution, and they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you spread it?
Do you remember her answer... did you release the document – “Oh, um, what?
Oh, no.
I didn’t spread it.”
Well, wait a minute.
Did we spread... No, we didn't spread," he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein sent the letter detailing Ford’s claims against Kavanaugh back in July, and it was circulated earlier in September — but Feinstein denies that this had happened from her office.
“I didn’t cover up Ford’s claims, I didn’t spread her story,” Feinstein told the commission.
“She asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she wished.”
But her refusal was not well received by the president, who commented during the rally on Saturday night: “I will tell you that it was a very bad body language.
She may not have done it, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing to defend the claimant for the Supreme Court accused of sexual crimes against three women, the president stressed that Democrats are using the claims for their own purposes.
“They are determined to return to power with all possible means.
“Look at the dishonesty, the shamelessness, they don’t care who they’re going to hurt, who they have to beat to regain power and control,” he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Janets against Dundee
Dundee Stars returned for Friday's Elite League loss against Belfast Giants, winning a 5-3 rematch at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants led early in the match with two goals after hits by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bovilier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney leveled up for the hosts before Dwyer regained Giants' lead.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Buchar equalized for Dundee before Lucas Lundwald Nilsen's two goals to confirm their victory.
This is the third victory in the Elite League for Adam Keef's boys who came out of the bottom to beat Dundy in Belfast 2-1 on Friday night.
This was the fourth clash between the opponents this season, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
The punch with which Dwyer found the result came in the fourth minute, at 3:35 with the assistance of Kendall McFaul, and then David Ruderford doubled the lead, assisting Bovilier four minutes later.
It was a tense start, Sullivan brought the hosts back into the game at 13:10, before Matt Markart helped to level with the help of Kauney at 15:16.
Dwyer tried to lead the Giants before the first break, scoring a second goal for the evening at the end of the first half.
The hosts regrouped and Bushar again leveled the odds with a powerful knock on the door at 27:37.
Cooney and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time at the end of the second half, as he gave his best and confirmed the team's victory with a fifth goal in the middle but the last half.
The Giants, who lost the last four games out of a total of five games, are hosting Milton Keynes for their next game on Friday.
A flight attendant has died to make sure that hundreds of people on board the plane can escape an earthquake.
A flight manager in Indonesia has been hailed as a hero after he died, ensuring that a plane with hundreds of passengers on board was able to fly safely.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are unknown in a powerful earthquake that struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami wave.
Strong secondary quakes continued to hit the area and many were trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung has refused to leave his post in the highly shaking control tower at Mutiara Sis al-Jufri airport.
He remained in place to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, would be able to fly safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he decided he was going to collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
A spokesman for Air Control, Indonesia, Johannes Syritt, said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News Australia reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“Our hearts were broken when we heard about it,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach thousands after the country’s disaster response agency announced that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Butong is limited.
“We expect that the number of deaths will increase as many bodies are still under the debris and many people cannot be reached,” said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves that reached six meters devastated Palu, where a mass funeral took place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft carry aids and supplies.
Riza Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute the ambulance brings more bodies.
There is a shortage of clean water.
There's marathons everywhere in the mini-markets."
Jan Gelfand, chairman of the International Red Cross Movement in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Red Cross in Indonesia is fighting to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
It’s already a tragedy, but it can get a lot worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country’s army: “I ask you to work day and night to complete all evacuation-related tasks.
“Are you ready?” he told CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok, in which more than 550 people died.
Micronesia plane crash: Now Air Niugini reports that one person is in the unknown after plane crash in a lagoon
The airline, which carried out a flight with a plane that crashed in a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean, now reports that one person has been reported missing after previously said that all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
In a press release, Air Niugini said it was not possible to contact a male passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The airline added that they are working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in their attempts to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, e.g. age and nationality.
Boats of locals helped rescue passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water as it tried to land at the Chowk Island airport.
Authorities said on Friday that seven people had been admitted to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, all of whom were in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane had landed in the lagoon just before the runway.
Some of the witnesses thought the plane had crossed the runway.
The American Bill Janes, a passenger on the plane, said the plane had landed very low.
“It’s very nice,” says Janes.
Janes tells us that he and the others have managed to traverse the deep water to the cross to get to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said the stewardesses had panicked and yelled, and that he had suffered a slight head injury.
U.S. naval forces say sailors repairing the nearby port also helped in the rescue operation by using an inflatable boat to take people to the shore before the plane sank in the depths of about 30 meters (100 ft).
Data from the Safe Aviation Network indicate that over the past two decades, 111 people have died on flights with airlines registered to PNG, but Air Niugini has not been involved in any case.
Analyst exposes the chronology of the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor’s office ended its case on Saturday in a retrial against a man who was accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
Analyst Paul Roulet of the U.S. Department of Justice is witnessing hours in a row as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used cell phone footage to fuse the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Teles and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers the night she died.
Roulet said she received location data from several mobile phones indicating that Telis was with Chambers on the night of her death, back to his previous claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in Chambers at the time when he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to interrogate Sanford.
Sanford went to court on Saturday and testified that he was out of town on that day.
When the prosecutors asked him if Telis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said that "this is a lie because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency is that Telis said she knew Chambers for two weeks before her death.
The cell phone records indicate that they've only known each other for a week.
Roulet said that shortly after Chambers Teles’ death, he had deleted her text messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
“He took her out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin with its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to be presented to the judges later the same day.
The High Breed: What is Conscious Hip-Hop?

The High Breed of Bristol argues that hip hop has deviated from its origins of political statements and engagement with social problems.
They want to go back to his roots and promote conscientious hip hop again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common are reborn in the UK through performers such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?!
New York babysitter sues couple after firing for ‘racist’ message
A New York babysitter sued a couple for being fired for discrimination after receiving a wrongly sent message from her mother complaining that she was “the next black woman.”
The couple denies being racist, citing a desire for “extortion.”
Linze Plasco-Flaksman, the mother of two, was upset when she learned that the new babysitter, Giselle Morris, was black when she arrived for her first working day in 2016.
“NEEEEEEEEEEEEE, THE SOMETHING BLACK,” Ms. Plasco-Flaksman wrote in a text message to her husband.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it to Mrs. Morris, and that twice.
After realizing her mistake, Ms. Plasco-Flaksman fired Ms. Morris, stating that the former midwife, who was an African-American, was not doing her job well and that she was expecting a Filipino.
Mrs. Morris received a paycheck for a working day and was then sent home by taxi.
Morris now sues the couple for compensation for the dismissal, demanding the amount of $350 a day for the six-month contract for which she was originally hired, even though she did not have a contract.
“I want to show them, look, you shouldn’t do that,” she told the Post on Friday, adding, “I’m sure it’s discrimination.”
In response to the request, the couple claimed that they were not racist, adding that the termination of Maurice’s employment was a reasonable act, as they feared that they would not be able to trust her after she was offended.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,” husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you’ve offended, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn?
Imagine it."
Referring to the demand for "extortion", Plasco claims that his wife gave birth only two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation".
“Are you going to attack someone in this situation?
That’s not very nice,” added the investment banker.
While the case is still in the process of being examined, public opinion quickly condemned the couple on social media, denying them their behavior and logic.
The publishers of Paddington feared that readers would not have felt a connection with a talking bear, reveals a new letter
Bond’s daughter, Karen Yankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted by the public, said of the letter: “It is difficult to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it is published.
It’s really fun now that we’re aware of Paddington’s huge success.”
She said her father, who worked as an operator for the BBC before being inspired to write the children's book about a little bear-toy, would feel optimistic about the eventual rebuffing of the book, adding the following year's sensibility "convenes the 60th anniversary of the book."
As for Paddington, whom she describes as “an important member of our family,” she added that her father secretly felt proud of the ultimate success.
“He was a very humble man and he wasn’t self-righteous,” she said.
“But since Paddington felt so real, it’s like having a child that’s accomplished something: you’re proud of him, even though it’s not really your business.
I think you kind of accepted Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always attributed the merits to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors fought in vain to save her life.
“He was constantly calling to say that the situation was really bad, that he didn’t expect to survive,” said Ednan-Laperuz.
“After that, Nad called me to say that he was going to die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I said to her, “Daddy, honey, I love you so much.
I'm coming to see you soon.
I'll come to you.
The medications given to her by doctors to support her heart, slowly stop working and leave her system. . . .
She's been gone a while before, and that's how it's all over.
I just had to sit there and wait, realizing that all this was happening.
I couldn’t scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to get tight."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz, who still mourns the loss of her daughter, boards the plane along with the other passengers who have no idea of the test she is going through.
“Nobody understands,” she said.
“I had tilted my head and all the time my tears dripped.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I felt this all-encompassing feeling of empathy with Nad.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much you loved her.”
<0xE2><0x86><0x90> Women Put Cards on a Bridge to Prevent Suicide
Two women, who have lost their loved ones for suicide, are trying to prevent other suicides.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put on a bridge in Wales cards with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call to get help.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 when he began suffering from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want a parent to feel the way I feel every day,” she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, from Lidney, says her son was a promising chef with an infectious smile.
“Everybody knew him with a smile.
They always said that his smile brightened every room.
However, he gave up his job before leaving, and found himself in a “really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was then 11 years old, found his brother after he took his life.
Ms. Davis said: “I’m constantly worried that this will have some consequences.”
Mrs. Davis created the cards, “to let people know that there is someone to go to and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Don’t be silent, you have to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davis, has lost Mark, her companion in life for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he felt depressed or depressed or anything,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He reached the bottom of Christmas – when the children opened their presents, he didn’t look at them or anything.”
She said it was a terrible trauma for them, but they had to deal with it: “This opens a gap in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we have to move on and fight.”

Bret Kavanaugh's future is in question after the FBI launches an investigation
I wondered if we could really achieve what he wants — an investigation of limited duration and limited scope — perhaps we could unite our efforts,” Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared that the commission would “dissolve” despite the tightening of the bloc.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to conduct an investigation?
Their reluctance is for the moment.
The early elections are only five weeks away, on November 6th – if, as expected, Republicans do not present themselves well, their attempts to be elected to the country’s highest court will be seriously affected.
George W. Bush called senators, inviting them to support Mr. Cavanaugh, who works for Mr. Bush at the White House, and with his help met his wife, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What's going to happen after the FBI draws up its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which will allow Vice President Mike Pence to declare equality and confirm his candidacy for the Supreme Court.
North Korea’s number of refugees is “decreased” by Kim
South Korean lawmakers say the number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Bieong Sug, citing data from the South Korean ministry of the association, said last year there were 1,127 refugees, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
According to Park, stricter border controls between North Korea and China, as well as higher amounts demanded by human smugglers, are key factors.
There is no official comment from Pyongyang.
The vast majority of refugees from the North eventually get citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, where the longest border with North Korea is located, and crosses more easily than the strictly guarded demilitarized zone (DMZ), which divides the two cores.
China considers refugees to be illegal migrants rather than refugees, often forcibly repatriating them.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are technically still at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the heads of state of the two sides met in Pyongyang for talks focused on stagnant nuclear disarmament talks.
This happened after the historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed to jointly work for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
“In the absence of confidence in the United States, we will not be confident in our national security and in these circumstances there is no first way to unilaterally disarm,” Mr. Ree said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Cavano "hysterical" and said he was not fit for Supreme Court service
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was too unbalanced to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented on this during an interview this Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help but think that if a woman had reacted in this way, they would have called her “hysterical,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally rejected the allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blaise Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his introductory speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, at times almost yelling and feeling when discussing his family and his student years.
He also categorically condemned the Democrats in the commission, calling the allegations against him a “grotesque and coordinated attack on the personality” organized by liberals who are dissatisfied that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said Kavano’s testimony proves that he is not able to work in the Supreme Court, as it has become clear that he is biased towards the Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with these claims and the way he persecutes the Clinton family and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi denied when asked if she would try to discredit Cavano if he was appointed and in case Democrats get a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’ll say it this way – if he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he’s not only unfit to go to the Supreme Court, but also to the court he’s in now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Washington Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that in her capacity as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh’s potential decisions regarding the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, as he was considered a conservative judge.
In the preliminary hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would reject certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“Now is not the time for a hysterical, prejudiced person to go to court and expect us to say, ‘Isn’t that great?’
And women have to master themselves.
It’s a sound criticism, after months and years of spreading anger, and she can’t accept it without crying.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Ms. Stein told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s unusual, do you?”
She continued, “I got a huge help from a woman who was an executive somewhere who shared that she too was crying when she was angry, but she developed her technique, thanks to which when she was angry and crying, she said to her interviewer, ‘I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then it just goes on.
I thought it was brilliant.”
Tears are allowed when expressing anger, partly because they are misunderstood at first.
One of my clearest memories of a previous job, in an office mostly with men, is how once, as I sneered at inexpressible anger, a woman older than me grabbed me by the door—the frosty boss I was always a little afraid of—and she was.
“Never let them see you cry,” she told me.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you're sad, and they'll be glad they did it to you."
Patricia Schröder, a Democratic congressman from Colorado at the time, worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on a yacht called "Monkey Business", and withdrew from the race, Mrs. Schröder, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason not to consider the idea of running for president.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she told me 30 years later, laughing.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they wanted to happen was another one.
Someone called the situation Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Since she is involved in the campaign late, she lags behind in raising funds and decides that she will not stay in the race if she fails to raise $2 million.
The battle was pre-determined to failure.
She understands that some of her supporters, who give $1,000 to men, would only give $250 to her.
“Do they think I’m getting a discount?” she wondered.
During her speech, in which she declared that she would not continue with an official campaign, she was filled with so many feelings – gratitude to the people who supported her, dissatisfaction with the system, for which it is so difficult for them to gather money and to be able to turn to the voters.
“One might think I had a nervous breakdown,” recalls Mrs. Schröder’s reaction to the media.
“Someone might think that Kleenex is my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what would they write on my tombstone?
“She was crying?”
How the U.S.-China trade war could serve Beijing
The first shots in the U.S.-China trade war were staggering, and while the battle is still gaining momentum, a break between the two countries will benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired the first warning lance this year, taxing key elements from China’s exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation of tensions this week came with new tariffs affecting US$200 billion in production (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) with an effective taxation of half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Each time Beijing retaliated with counter-duty tariffs of five to ten percent of U.S. goods for $60 billion.
China has vowed to retaliate against any U.S. blow, and the world’s second-largest economy is not expected to ignore it.
To get Washington to refuse means to surrender to the demands, but to put a head in public before Washington would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Yet, according to experts, if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the pressure from the trade war with the United States could help China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a hasty political decision in both Washington and Beijing could create the conditions for an economic crisis in one of the two countries is actually more dangerous than the César’s observers had previously admitted to being a member of the group,” said Abigail Grace, a research associate.
Syria is “ready” for the return of refugees, the foreign minister said
Syria said it was ready for the voluntary return of refugees and begged for assistance in the recovery of the war-torn country that lasted more than seven years.
In an address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem said conditions in the country were improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and safe, thanks to the progress we have made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore the areas devastated by the terrorists in order to restore them to their normal state.
Now there are all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people who still live there are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Mualem said the Syrian regime would welcome any assistance in restoring the devastated state.
But he stressed that conditional aid or aid from countries that have financed the insurgents would not be accepted.
Europe wins the Rider Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Rider Cup, surpassing the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National in the outskirts of Paris, France.
The United States has six consecutive losses on European soil and has not won the Rider Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained its championship crown in the tournament after the team led by Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached the necessary 14.5 points to guarantee a victory over the United States.
U.S. star Phil Michaelson, who played poorly during most of the tournament, took his first hit on the 16th hole (with a "par" 3) in the water, losing his match against Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has performed excellently in all rounds, becoming one of the four players in the history of the tournament to reach a 5-0-0 balance since the competition was held in the current format after 1979.
The American Jordan Spite has lost categorically by 5&4 of the player in the Europa team, which is in the lowest place in the rankings – Torbjörn Olessen of Denmark.
World ranking leader Justin Johnson lost 2 and 1 to England's Ian Poulter, for whom this is probably the last Rider Cup appearance.
Spain’s Sergio Garcia, a veteran of eight races at the Rider Cup, became the European with the most points won in the tournament of all time, increasing his assets to 25.5 points this year.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t hold back.
It's been a tough year.
I am extremely grateful to Thomas for calling me and believing in me.
I'm so glad I can pick up the cup again.
The most important thing is the team and I’m happy that I was able to help,” Garcia said after winning Europe.
He handed over the relay to his compatriot John Ram, who defeated American legend Tiger Woods with 2&1 on the singles on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to have defeated Tiger Woods, yet I grew up watching him play," Ram, 23, said in a statement.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and his overall balance of the Rider Cup is already 13-21-3.
A strange statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, he won 14 major titles – an indicator on which he resigned only to Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team was experiencing difficulties throughout the weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finnau, who showed high-class golf on all days of the tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Fourick said after the disappointing performance of the team: “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
At one point this morning we pushed the team of Europe.
There was a battle.
I'm taking off Thomas' hat.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players performed very well.
We will regroup, discuss the important issues with the U.S. Professional Golfers Association and our Rider Cup Committee, and we will only look ahead.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
There's no way you can't take off your opponent's hat.
We were just overjoyed.”
