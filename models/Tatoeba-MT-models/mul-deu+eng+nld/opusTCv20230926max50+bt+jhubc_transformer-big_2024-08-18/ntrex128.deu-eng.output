Members of the National Assembly for Wales fear confusion with the Muppets
In the case of some Members of the National Assembly, the proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Welsh Parliament) is a cause of regret.
This is due to plans to change the name of the National Assembly to "Welsh Parliament".
Members of the National Assembly from all political directions are afraid to become the target of the spot.
A member of the Labour Party’s National Assembly said his group was concerned that the name rhymes with “Twp” and “Pwp”.
For non-Walesian readers: In Welsh, "twp" stands for "doof" and "pwp" stands for "Aa".
A member of the National Assembly of the party Plaid Cymru stated that the entire group was “not happy” and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his group was open to the name change, but pointed to the great similarity between "MWP" and "Muppet".
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced similar to the letter u in the English spoken in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting a law on name changes, said: “The final decision on names for the members of the National Assembly, of course, lies with the members themselves.”
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 authorized the Welsh National Assembly to change its name.
In June, the panel published the results of a public hearing on the proposals, which resulted in broad support for the name "Welsh Parliament" for the National Assembly.
As regards the titles of the members of the National Assembly, the Welsh Parliament Members or WMPs preferred, while the MWP option was the most favoured at a public hearing.
Members of the National Assembly appear to be proposing alternative options, but calling for a consensus for President Elin Jones, who is due to table a bill within weeks, could be a problem.
The Reforms Act will include further changes to the way the National Assembly works, including rules for disqualifying members of the National Assembly and for shaping the committee system.
The members of the National Assembly may, in their debate on the law, vote definitively on their names.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on a change of country name
Voters will decide on Sunday whether to change the name of their country to “Republic of North Macedonia”.
The referendum was set up to settle a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has a province of the same name as Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor means that this claim is raised on Greek territory, and has repeatedly spoken out against its accession to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the name change, said he would not recognize the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's are silent in the face of the difficulties of the churches in Harlem
“The old people I spoke to said in the past there was a bar and a church on every corner,” Adams said.
“There are no more of them today.”
He said the disappearance of the bars was traceable.
“People’s social lives today look different,” he said.
“Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood where people regularly find themselves.”
At the churches, he fears that the money from the sale of assets will not be enough for as long as the church leaders assume, and that they will “before or after they start again”.
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums in which people who do not support the remaining shelters live.
“The overwhelming majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white,” he said, “and thus accelerate the complete closure of these churches, since it is unlikely that most of the people who will enter these condominiums will be members of these churches.”
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis: Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist community moved out in the 1930s.
A black community that kept their services nearby became the owner of the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black community under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem that refused to hire or support blacks.
In a fire in 1939, the building was severely damaged, but when Father Johnson's community members planned the reconstruction, they commissioned the bell game.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin's, proudly described the bell game as "the bells of the poor".
The expert who played the bell game in July used other words: “a cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument”.
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the world’s first bell play played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who switched to the larger bell play at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said he was not replaced by St. Martin's.
What has taken place in St. Martin’s in recent months is a complicated story with architects and contractors who were drawn in part by the Church’s lay leaders and in part by the Diocese of Bishops.
In July, the council of the municipality – the governing body of the community consisting of lay leaders – expressed in writing concerns to the diocese that the diocese would try to pass on the costs to the council of the municipality, even though the diocese did not devote themselves to the commission of the bishops and the archdiocese.
Some members of the congregation complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark Injured 13-Year-Old in California Diving After Lobster
In California, on Saturday, the first day of the lobster season, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy while diving for lobsters, according to official statements.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
As Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego, he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy’s cry for help and paddled with several others to the boy to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought the boy was happy to have caught a lobster, but then he realized that the boy was yelling, “I’ve been bitten!
I've been bitten!"
When Hammel arrived at the boy, he noticed that his entire key bone had been torn open.
“I yelled that everyone should come out of the water, ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” added Hammel.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is in critical condition.
The type of shark responsible for the attack was not known.
Rescue swimmer Captain Larry Giles told the media that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was concluded that it was not a dangerous hairstyle.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper body area.
Officials blocked beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Encinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
According to Giles, there are over 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to advance the cosmetics market in the UK
Sainsbury’s is targeting departments of cosmetics at department stores that are staffed with specialized assistants, boats, superdrugs and Debenhams.
As part of a major leap forward in the UK’s 2.8 billion-pound cosmetics market, which continues to grow as fashion and household goods turnover declines, larger cosmetics departments in eleven branches across the country will be tested for next time.
The investment in cosmetics coincides with the search of supermarkets for ways to otherwise use store areas previously used for televisions, microwaves and household goods.
According to Sainsbury’s, the scope of its cosmetics offering is doubling for the first time to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Also available series of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees receive more space and branded areas similar to those in stores such as boats.
In addition, the supermarket is conducting a relaunch of its makeup series “Boutique”, so that most of the products are vegan-friendly – an aspect that is increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop will test at two Sainsbury's stores, the first store opened last week in Croydon, South London, and a second one will open later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Online shopping and the transition to daily buying small amounts of food in local convenience stores mean that supermarkets need to do more to get customers to visit them.
According to Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, the outlets will increasingly look like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to fight off discounters Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food items.
Sainsbury's has set up a number of retail outlets in hundreds of Argos stores since the purchase of Argos and Habitat chains two years ago, increasing food sales and profitability of acquisitions.
The supermarket’s previous attempt to reorganize its cosmetics and pharmaceutical departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with boats in the early 2000s, but this ended after a dispute over the distribution of revenues from the drug dealer's stores to supermarkets.
The new strategy follows Sainsbury’s sale of its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
The company said Lloyds will play a role in the plan when an expanded range of luxury skincare brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy is added to four branches.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director at Sainsbury’s, said: “We have redesigned the appearance of our cosmetics departments to create a more attractive environment for our customers.
In addition, we have invested in specially trained colleagues who are available as consultants.
Our brand range is tailored to all needs, and due to the attractive surroundings and convenient locations, we are now an attractive destination for cosmetics purchases that questions the current type of shopping."
Peter Jones 'wounded' after withdrawing Holly Willoughby from a <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
“Dragons’ Den” star Peter Jones is “twisting” after TV host Holly Willoughby withdrew from a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for the common homewear and accessories brand Truly.
The business of the two was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop.
The “This Morning” moderator, 37, announced her retirement on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby angered “Dragons” star Peter Jones for her extremely short-term withdrawal from her lucrative lifestyle brand company to focus on her own new connection contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Jones is said to have been “whelming” when the television’s “Golden Girl” admitted at a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, due to their new business – worth up to 1.5 million British pounds more – could not afford access to the common home.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and would likely have doubled Willoughby’s estimated assets of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
While Willoughby, 37, announced her retirement from Truly on Instagram, Jones left the UK on her way to one of his vacation homes.
A source said: “Truely was by far the highest priority for Holly.
It should ensure their future over the next few decades in the long run.
Their decision to withdraw came as a surprise to all those involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, just before the market launch.
At the headquarters in Marlow, a warehouse full of goods is waiting to be sold."
Experts believe the withdrawal of the “This Morning” moderator, one of Britain’s most promising stars, could cost the company millions due to high investment in products from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear and possible further delays in market launch.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly in 2016 with Capp, and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couple spend the holiday together, and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin’s TV production company.
Willoughby is set to become a brand ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as the moderator of the ITV show "I'm A Celebrity".
A source close to Jones said last night: “We are not commenting on his business affairs.”
Hard words "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he expected from the news media for a comment some would consider “not presidential” and for such positive remarks about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said, imitating the voice of a news moderator:
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting, as the first meeting in Singapore in June was praised by Trump as a major step towards denuclearization by North Korea.
However, the denuclearization negotiations have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, Ri Yong Ho, the top diplomat of North Korea, told leading politicians from around the world on Saturday at the UN General Assembly that the North had not responded “correspondingly” to the U.S.’s first disarmament action.
Instead, he noted, the U.S. was imposing sanctions that should maintain pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
“We are very successful with North Korea,” he said.
“We were at war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim showed positive results: end of missile tests, support for the release of hostages, and repatriation of the deadly remnants of U.S. military personnel.
He also defended his unusual way of talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people standing outside and trying to get into this crowded arena, about 200 people would be standing here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquakes devastated an island in Indonesia and cost hundreds of lives
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were told they would not be needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok were displaced, no national emergency was declared, a prerequisite for mobilizing international aid.
“Unfortunately, they have made it very clear in many cases that they are not asking for international support, so that’s a bit difficult,” Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is teaming up to travel to Palu, it’s not yet clear whether foreign employees can work on site.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the Disaster Relief Authority, said Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu on whether international bodies should participate in the relief measures.
In the face of the earthquakes that Indonesia is constantly struggling with, the country is still sadly ill-prepared for natural forces.
While tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not a daily sight on other coastlines.
The apparent lack of tsunami warning siren in Palu, despite a warning coming into force, probably contributed to the deaths.
Traveling between Indonesia’s numerous islands is, at best, a challenge.
Natural disasters make the logistics even more complicated.
A Lazaret ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but will reach the site of the new disaster at the earliest in three days.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of the affected Indonesian infrastructure a core piece of his election campaign and spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
However, the government of Joko, who is seeking re-election next year, suffers from funding deficits.
In addition, Joko is under pressure from ongoing religious tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority practice a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were displaced from their homes and apartments as gangs of Christians and Muslims fought in the streets with machetes, arrows and bows, and other primitive weapons.
View: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge scores deep against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool at London's Stamford Bridge Stadium on Saturday with a hit in the 89th minute before a Premier League loss to Chelsea.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri at his team's 0-1 draw in about 27 metres away from Chelsea's goal.
He pointed the ball to the left and then shot it towards the back post.
The shot sailed high over the penalty area and drifted into the upper right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball fell over the jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and then into the net.
“I just tried to get myself into this position and get to the ball. Players like Shaq always play as much as possible forward, so I just tried to create as much time for myself as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw edge come and had contact with the ball. I didn’t think too much about it and just accepted the shot.”
Chelsea led by Belgian star Eden Hazard to the semi-final with 1-0 in the 25th minute.
The Blues stormer gave a pass with the heel back to Mateo, then turned off near the midfield and sprinted into the Liverpool half.
Kovacic played a fast double pass in the midfield.
Then he fired a good steep pass, so Hazard got into the penalty room.
Hazard left the defenders behind and locked Liverpool's Alisson Becker in the back of the net with a left-handed shot.
Liverpool will play in the group stage of the Champions League on Wednesday at 15:00 at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
Tsunami death toll in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the disaster protection authority said on Sunday morning.
Many people are said to have been trapped in the rubble of buildings caused by Friday's 7.5 magnitude earthquake, which had triggered waves up to six meters high, official spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was dotted with the ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police Arrest 32-Year-Old Man on Murder Suspicion After Arresting Woman
After finding a woman's body this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside, a murder investigation was launched.
The 44-year-old was found in Grayson Mews on John Street at 7:55 a.m., and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police are urging residents to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is in an early phase, but I ask everyone who has stopped near John Street in Birkenhead and seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
In addition, I ask all persons, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something with a Dashcam, to contact us. They may have information that is of utmost importance to our investigation."
A police spokesperson confirmed that the woman whose body was found lived in Birkenhead and was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman have arrived at the scene to find out where she was found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing, and the police said they are in the process of informing the next relatives of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews was just trying to get into his apartment, but was informed by police that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he learned what had happened.
Residents are now informed that it will take hours before they can enter the building again.
It was heard that a police officer told a man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears dissolved at the scene.
She kept saying, “It’s so terrible.”
At 2:00 p.m., two police vehicles were inside the lockdown and another vehicle before the lockdown.
Within the lockdown were several police officers who were monitoring the housing block.
Persons with information are asked to send a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call number 101, or call 0800 555 111 anonymously to Crimestoppers, and refer to Minutes entry 247 dated September 30.
The Cromwell statue in front of Parliament will be the latest monument to be the subject of the dispute over the rewrite of history
Her banishment would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious art products by his fanatical Puritan followers.
The Cromwell Society, however, described Crick's proposal as "stupidity" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the current debate about removing statues, it was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Palace of Westminster became the target.
The picture tower in the English Civil War was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent depiction of Cromwell is evidence of the prevailing opinion and part of the historical writing of a figure that many believe is still worth celebrating.
Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is being defended by many, perhaps by the end of the 19th century, more than today, by someone who defended parliament against pressure from the outside, in his case, of course, by the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely correct representation is the subject of continued historical debates.
It is certain that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a single recognizable figure that represents one side of this gap.
His accomplishments as a Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and remembering."
Killer pig bites Chinese farmers dead
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwestern China.
The man, named only after Yuan, was found dead in a bloody artery near a pig market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, according to the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject pig vaccines on May 30, 2005, in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He was reportedly traveling with his cousin from the neighbouring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and saw that a door to a neighboring pig barn was open.
He said there was a large male pig with blood on the snail in the stable.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that the 250-pound pig had killed the farmers.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and mutilated,” the cousin, nicknamed “Wu,” was quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
Footage of a security camera showed Yuan entering the market on Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man belonged neither to Yuan nor to his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been locked in order to prevent attacks on other people while police collected evidence at the scene.
Yuan’s family and the market authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although it is rare for pigs to attack humans, such cases are known.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, where the man suffered serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a 290-pound pig hugged a Welsh farmer between himself and a tractor until the farmer’s wife was able to hide the animal.
After a farmer was eaten by his pigs in Oregon in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a “trigger.”
“They’re just playing.
They like to swindle and are very curious, ... they are not out to hurt someone.
You just have to treat them with the right amount of respect," he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa bring widespread heavy rains to the southwest of the United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakens on its way across the colder water off the northern coast of Mexico.
In the coming days, however, Rosa will bring flooding-provoking rainfall to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
On Sunday at 5:00 a.m. East Coast time, Rosa had wind speeds of 136 km/h, which corresponds to a Category 1 hurricane, and was 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a trough begins to form over the Pacific Ocean, moving east to the west coast of the United States. When Rosa on Monday reaches the Baja California peninsula as a tropical storm, high tropical humidity is transported north to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will trigger rainfall of up to 25 centimeters in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then the tropical humidity in the coming days will generate widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest due to interactions with the emerging trog.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 centimetres of rainfall can cause dangerous floating flooding, water-driving mudslides, and possibly landslides in the desert.
High tropical humidity occasionally leads to precipitation rates of nearly 5 to 7.5 centimeters per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwest, especially in much of Arizona, precipitation is expected up to 5 to 10 centimeters.
Due to the spread of tropical rainfall, there is the possibility of floating floods with rapidly deteriorating conditions.
In the face of the threatening tropical rainfall, it is strongly advised not to walk into the desert.
Heavy rainfall can cause canyons to become ripple streams, and storms bring local winds as well as wind that carries dust.
The nearby trout brings locally heavy rains in parts of the coast of Southern California.
Total precipitation amounts of more than one centimeter are possible, which can lead to small amounts of dirt driving in the water and to smooth lanes.
This would be the first rainfall of the rainy season in this region.
The first single tropical rainstorms reach Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning. On Monday evening and Tuesday it rains widely.
On Tuesday, heavy rain spreads into the Four Corners region and continues on Wednesday.
In October, severe temperature fluctuations throughout the United States are possible as the Arctic cools while the tropics remain relatively warm.
This sometimes leads to drastic temperature differences over short distances.
On Sunday, there is a good example of drastic temperature differences in the middle of the United States.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, there is a temperature difference of almost 12 oC.
In the coming days, the persistent summer heat is trying to develop and expand again.
For much of the middle and east of the United States, a warm beginning of October with widespread temperatures of 27 <0xC2><0xB0>C is expected from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
New York City could reach 27 oC on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast suggests a high probability of above-average temperatures in the first half of October in the eastern United States.
Over 20 million viewers have watched Brett Kavanaugh’s audition
Over 20 million viewers on Thursday saw on six television networks the captivating statements of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and his wife, Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political stalemate persisted, and on Friday the television stations interrupted their regular program due to a last-minute turnaround: an agreement negotiated by Jeff Flake, a senator from Arizona, according to which the FBI is expected to conduct a one-week investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee to be 100% sure that Kavanaugh had been drunk at a high school party, harassed her, and tried to remove her clothes.
Kavanaugh said in a passionate statement that he was 100% sure that this had not happened.
It is likely that more than the 20.4 million viewers reported by Nielsen have seen the audition.
The company found the average viewer numbers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
For other networks such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network that broadcast the hearing, the numbers were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen usually has trouble measuring viewer numbers in offices.
To put this in the right perspective: This corresponds to the number of spectators in a play-off football game or at the Oscars.
The Fox News Channel, whose opinion-oriented moderators strongly support Kavanaugh’s nomination, recorded the highest numbers of all networks, according to Nielsen, with an average of 5.69 million viewers listening all day.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday’s drama.
After the moderate Republican’s office released a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was filmed on Friday morning by cameras from CNN and CBS as protesters slammed him in the elevator on the way to a hearing by the Justice Committee.
He stood with his eyes lowered for minutes while he was being shot and the scene was broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm standing right here in front of you," said one woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the country the truth?”
“You have power while so many women are powerless,” said one woman.
Flake said his office published a statement and added before the elevator closed that he would have more to say at the hearing before the committee.
All cable and radio networks broadcast live hours later, when the Judiciary Committee was to vote on the forwarding of Kavanaugh's nomination to vote in the entire Senate.
However, Flake said he would do so only on the condition that the FBI, as required by the democratic minority, investigate the allegations against the candidate next week.
Flake is convinced in part by conversations with a friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a discussion with Coons and later several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision was of great importance, as it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to confirm Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of using Brexit for political purposes
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union, exploit Britain’s future for political purposes and undermine the nation’s interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will attend the Conservative Party meeting in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In an interview with her on the newspaper’s cover page, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson intensified his attack on her so-called “checkers plan” for Brexit by proposing “the reciprocal imposition of tariffs by Britain and the EU.”
Deadly Shootings on Wayde Sims: Police Arrest Suspect Dyteon Simpson Related to LSU Player's Death
Police have arrested a suspect in connection with the deadly shootings at Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University (LSU).
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and detained by Baton Rouge police for murder.
The authorities released video footage of the fight between Sims and Simpson. According to the police, Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
As the CBS partner station WAFB reports, police secured the glasses at the scene and said that Simpson’s DNA was found on the glasses.
After Simpson’s interrogation, police said he had stood the deadly shots on Wayde.
The lawyer reports that the security deposit has been set at $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office published an interim report on Friday that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
The police thank the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the state police’s forensic laboratory, the Southern University Police, and the citizens of the area for their support in the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the regional executive for “their care and their quest for justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1.98-metre winger grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne had also played for LSU basketball.
In the last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "deeply shocked" by Wayne's death and "be shocked".
“You’re always afraid of something like that,” Wade said.
Volcano spews ash on Mexico City.
Ash ejected from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern part of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater increased and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded within 24 hours.
The Authority monitored numerous cases of riots and riots.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash on the windshields of cars in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted that since September 2017, an earthquake of magnitude 7.1 shook central Mexico, increased activity at the volcano located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital.
The Don Goyo volcano has been active since 1994.
clashes between police and Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
In Barcelona on Saturday, after clashes between the police and pro-independence protesters, six people were arrested, thousands took part in other demonstrations to commemorate the first anniversary of the polarizing independence referendum in Catalonia.
A group of masked pro-separatists, detained by the preparedness police, threw them with eggs and also smuggled colored powder, causing dark dust clouds in the streets normally populated with tourists.
Over the course of the day, there were also hand-to-hand encounters with the police, who used their batons to curb the fighting.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted “No Forgetting, No Forgiveness”, while Unionists were facing them, who shouted “Long live Spain”.
As the local press reported, fourteen people were treated for minor injuries suffered during the protests.
However, a year after the referendum on October 1, which Madrid saw as illegal, was celebrated by separatist Catalans, the situation in the independent region remains very tense.
Voters had opted for independence by an overwhelming majority, although voter turnout was low, as the separatists boycotted the vote for the most part.
According to Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to prevent the vote in violent clashes in front of polling stations.
Pro-independence groups had camped out in the open over night on Friday to prevent a demonstration for the national police.
The demonstration took place, but was forced to take a different path.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who took part with his wife in the separatist protest, said he saw the prospects that Catalonia would gain independence, no longer with hope.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry for joy because they could choose, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite an important, albeit scarce, victory in the regional elections last December, Catalan pro-independence parties this year had difficulty maintaining the momentum. Many of their most well-known leaders were either in exile and in retaliation to their own incarceration, or in prison, where they were imprisoned.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in favor of the police on his phone, said the conflict had been shaken by politicians on both sides.
“The situation is getting more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in custody since the end of last year, announced his candidacy for the European Parliament election next year.
"As a candidate for the European elections, the best way to do so is to promote the demolition of democratic values and the repression of the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after house hit by car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a house in Londonderry was hit by a car several times.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 19:30 British Summer Time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building itself were damaged.
He may have also been shot in the car with an armrest.
Menga hit means for Livingston 1:0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the win.
The rising Livingston FC surprised the Rangers and led to a second defeat for Steven Gerrard in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's hit proved crucial for Gary Holt's team to be able to match Hibernian in the second half.
Gerrard’s team will remain in the Premiership with no away win this season and will face the Hearts next Sunday, with eight points left.
Previously, the Rangers will host the Europa League for Rapid Vienna on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, can increase his winning series in the division to six games, meaning head coach Holt has not yet suffered a defeat since his takeover of Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses chances against free-to-play guests
Holt’s team should have been in the lead long before the hit, as his directness put the Rangers in the face of all sorts of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through, but got slower in front of the goal, and then Alan Lithgow was only able to shoot far after he was knocked in to hit Craig Halkett's head shot at the goal.
The hosts were pleased to let the Rangers play in front of them, as they knew they could hinder the guests in standard situations.
In this way, the decisive gate came into being.
The Rangers allowed a free kick, and Livingston prepared an opportunity where Declan Gallagher and Robinson put Menga together in the shot position, who shot the goal with a ball contact from the center of the penalty area.
At this stage, the Rangers had dominated the ball possession, but could not overcome the host's defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly remained largely unfit.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos once forced Kelly to defend.
Scott Pittman was kicked off by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow slipped the ball from another standard situation from Livingston.
Flanken repeatedly entered Livingston’s penalty area and were regularly taken out of the danger zone, while two required penalty kicks – one from Halket against the substitute Glenn Middleton and one due to hand play – were denied.
“Phenomenal” by Livingston – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland in the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and a strong result for Livingston.
They were exceptionally excellent and have again exceeded expectations in this upward trend.
Their way of playing and their team have hardly changed since their return to the top teams, but Holt deserves great praise for the way in which he has awakened the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great and led an excellent organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on track throughout the game.
The Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
As good as they were under Gerrard from time to time, they could not reach this standard.
Their last ball was insufficient – only once they could penetrate the host team – and that is something like a wake-up call for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Receiving Erdogan with mixed reactions in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th), smiling faces and blue skies prevailed as the heads of government of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which should serve to repair relations between NATO allies.
There had been disputes over issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Erdogan then traveled to Cologne to open a large new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police called security reasons for preventing a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters came in close proximity to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan demonstrators, many of them Kurds, also listened, condemning Erdogan’s policies as well as the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The opposing protests reflect the polarizing effect of the visitor, who is praised as a hero by some German Turks and humiliated by others as an autocrat.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in car collision
In London, a cyclist was killed in a collision with a car.
The collision occurred at approximately 10:15 a.m. British Summer Time near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped, and ambulancemen took care of the man, but he died at the scene of the accident.
Months before the accident, another cyclist was killed in an accident with a runaway driver on Childers Street, about 1.6 kilometers from Saturday’s accident.
According to the Metropolitan Police, officials were working to identify the man and notify his next relatives.
Roadblocks and reroutes for buses have been set up, and motorists have been advised to avoid the area.
Long-Lartin prison: Six officials injured in riots
According to the Prison Office, six prison officials were injured in riots in a men's high-security prison.
The riots broke out on Sunday at around 9:30 p.m. British Summer Time at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and still stop.
Specialised Tornado officers have been recruited to end the riots involving eight inmates and limited to one wing.
Officials were treated on the spot for minor injuries to the face.
A spokesperson for the Prison Service said: “Specially trained prison personnel have been deployed to fix an ongoing incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and want to clarify that those responsible will be handed over to the police and possibly spend longer time behind bars.”
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison leader was treated by a prisoner in the hospital after an attack.
In October last year, police officers were called to prison to deal with serious unrest in which staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with butterfly floods (dry areas may benefit)
It’s rare for a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but that’s what’s likely to happen early next week when the remnants of Hurricane Rosa move across the desert-painted southwest and bring with them the risk of floating flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings for floating floods on Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada as well as southeastern California and Utah including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will approach with rain on Monday night and move directly across Phoenix on Tuesday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have come close as a tropical storm or tropical depression Phoenix up to 320 kilometers!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 64 kilometers of the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation with individual up to 15 centimeters in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
In other areas of the desert-characterized southwest, including the central rockies and the Great Basin, 2.5 to 5 centimetres are probable and a total of up to 10 centimetres is possible.
For those who do not have the risk of floating floods, the rainfall associated with Rosa due to drought in the region can be a blessing.
Although floods are of great concern, these rains are likely to be useful in part, as drought is currently prevailing in the southwest.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, at least extreme drought occurs in just over 40 percent of Arizona, the second-highest category," weather.com reported.
First of all, the path of the hurricane means that Rosa will meet on land on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa will still have hurricane strength with maximum winds of 136 kilometers per hour, 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, followed by the hurricane moving north with 19 kilometers per hour.
In the Pacific, the storm will hit colder water and weaken as a result.
Therefore, Rosa is expected to land on Monday afternoon or evening in Mexico with the intensity of a tropical storm.
Precipitation can be severe in parts of Mexico, so there is a significant flood risk.
“From Baja California to the northwest of the Sonora Desert, totals of precipitation are expected from 7.5 to 15 centimetres, with up to 25 centimetres possible,” weather.com reported.
Subsequently, Rosa will move as a tropical storm northwards across Mexico, reach the border with Arizona early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, and then until late Tuesday evening through Arizona to the south of Utah.
“The main danger is expected to be very heavy rainfall in connection with Rosa or its remnants in Baja California, the northwest of the Sonora Desert and the desert-charging southwest of the United States,” the National Hurricane Center said.
As a result of these precipitations, life-threatening flooding in the desert and water-driving mudslides as well as landslides in mountainous areas are expected.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four Arrests for Attempted Murder
After finding a 16-year-old with stab wounds in Somerset, three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior-Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday at 4:00 p.m.
He was taken to a hospital and his condition is “stable”.
Police in Avon and Somerset said a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area.
The officials asked everyone who had records of the events on a mobile phone to report.
Trump said Kavanaugh had suffered “under the common, the anger” of the Democrats.
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and unheard-of tactics of the Democrats,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh suffered during the entire nomination process “under the common, the anger” of the Democrats.
Kavanaugh said Thursday before Congress and dismissed the accusation made by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually harassed her decades ago when they were both teenagers.
At the hearing, Ford also spoke about her accusations.
The president said on Saturday that the American people saw the brilliance, quality and courage of Kavanaugh on that day.
“A vote for the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for the confirmation of one of the most experienced legal heads of our time, a lawyer with an excellent balance sheet at the service of the general public,” he told the crowd of his supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke about the importance of the participation of Republican voters in the midterm elections.
“Five weeks before one of the most important choices of our lives.
“I don’t do it, but I really do,” he said.
“That’s why I’m fighting everywhere for great candidates.”
Trump argued that the Democrats see their mission in “resisting and blocking.”
The first important procedural vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected to take place in the Senate no later than Friday, a senior GOP leader told CNN.
Hundreds killed in earthquakes in Indonesia, death tolls rise
According to authorities, at least 384 people were killed on Saturday, many of them flooded as giant waves hit the beaches as a result of a severe earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday at a party on the beach of the city of Palu, when at the break of darkness waves up to six meters high hit the beach, killing many people and destroying everything that stood in their way.
The tsunami was preceded by an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
“When the tsunami threat came up yesterday, people still went after their activities on the beach and didn’t immediately run away from it, and they fell victim to it,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia’s disaster protection agency BNPB, told a conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone, it swam cars, tree trunks and houses, it hit everything on land,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had flown over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before it hit the coast.
Some people were on the run from the tsunami climbing trees and would have survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated and housed in 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial footage published by the Disaster Protection Authority showed numerous destroyed buildings and shops, curved and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city was shaken by further aftershocks.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia’s BPPT (Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology) said in a statement that the energy released in Friday’s massive earthquake corresponded to 200 times the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
Due to the location of the city at the end of a long, narrow bay, the tsunami could have been bigger, the authorities said.
Nugroho described the damage as “comprehensive” and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
According to him, the bodies of some of the victims were found among the ruins of collapsed buildings, 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the number of casualties and damage could have been higher along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
The communication with Donggala was completely paralyzed, according to Nugrohos, and there was no information.
According to a statement by the Red Cross, more than 300,000 people live there, and its employees and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse,” the statement said.
On Saturday, the authorities were repeatedly criticized for not informing them that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the waves, according to official information, occurred at the time of the warning.
Amateur footage posted on social media shows a man on the upper floor of a building desperately warning people on the street beneath him of the approaching tsunami.
Within minutes, a water wall will reach the shore and float buildings and cars from it.
Reuters was not able to verify the authenticity of the footage immediately.
The quake and tsunami caused a massive power outage that interrupted communication around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
According to the authorities, the military has begun to send cargo planes with support from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated still urgently need food and other vital goods.
The city’s airport remained closed until October and was reopened for relief measures only.
A visit by President Joko Widodo to evacuation centres in Palu was planned for Sunday.
The number of tsunami victims has increased to more than 800.
The location is very bad.
The employees of World Vision from Donggala have safely reached the city of Palu, where the employees are housed in tents in the courtyard of their office, but according to Dosebas, on the way passed scenes of destruction.
“They said they had seen a number of destroyed houses,” he said.
The location is very bad.
Even as the aid groups began the tough task of setting up disaster relief, some argued that skilled foreign aid workers would be prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, financial aid, deliveries and personnel from abroad are only possible if the site of an accident has been declared a national disaster area.
This has not happened so far.
“At the moment it is still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says, ‘okay, this is a national disaster,’ we can accept international support, but so far this status does not apply.”
While the second night since the earthquake and tsunami on Friday sank over Palu, friends and family members of the still missing people hoped for one of the miracles that shed light on the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under rubble next to her mother’s body for two days.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding national team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others who were prisoners in the Roa-Roa Hotel, as Mandagi supplemented, were his students.
“As a senior at paragliding, I have to carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon told how in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa-Roa hotel under the paragliders made the round, WhatsApp desperately sent messages to the contestants from Palu who participated in the beach party.
However, his messages, instead of blue checks, only led to gray question marks.
“I think that means the news hasn’t been delivered,” he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 while filling up an ATM in Newport on the Levee
According to a press release from the Newport Police Department, on Friday morning in Newport on the Levee thief stole an employee of Brink’s when filling up a cash machine $26,750.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied a cash machine in the entertainment complex and wanted to raise more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, “a man ran after the employee of Brink’s” and stole a sack full of money that was destined for the vending machine.
According to the press release, witnesses saw several suspects flee the scene, but the police did not specify how many people were involved in the incident.
Persons who have information on the identity of the suspects are asked to contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper Changes His Name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
In announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The being formally known as Kanye West" (The Being officially known as Kanye West).
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and has used it as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change precedes his appearance at Saturday Night Live, where the release of his new album "Yandhi" is expected.
He appears in the show as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the producer, has given up for "emotional reasons".
The word is not only an abbreviation of its current professional name, but it has, in its own words, a religious significance for the West.
"I think 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said in a conversation this year about his album with radio moderator Big Boy.
“I am you, I am us, it is us.
From Kanye, which means ‘the only one’, was only ‘yes’ – simply a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, of everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.”
He is one of several famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, with whom West has previously collaborated, has already written his name with and without indents and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use the military against the civilian population
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed never to use military force against the civilian population as the 50th anniversary of bloody repressions against students in his country approaches.
On Saturday, Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza that “never use the military to oppress the Mexican people.”
Soldiers fired at a peaceful demonstration on the square on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people, at which time left-wing student movements were in the process of establishing themselves throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador vowed to support young Mexicans through monthly student grants and the opening of other free public universities.
He said that unemployment and the lack of training opportunities led to juvenile criminal gangs.
U.S. Should Double Funding for Artificial Intelligence
Given China’s intensified activities in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double its spending on research in this area, says investor and AI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow AI announcements from different areas of the U.S. government, even if the U.S. generally lacks a formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, last year, China presented its plan: the country intends to become the No. 1 in the field of AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start given the fact that all other countries are so far behind the US, and we are looking for the next AI breakthrough,” Lee said.
Doubling the funding could double the chances of the next big AI success in the US, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face<0x2B><0x2B>.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that defeated the highest-ranked American othello player. Later, he was a senior executive at Microsoft Research and president of the Google branch in China.
Lee praised previous U.S. government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotics Challenge (DARPA) and asked about the timing of the next competition as he wanted to help identify the next visionaries.
According to Lees, researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to get state subsidies.
“It’s not China that takes away the academic elite, it’s the companies,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have set up colleges to work on AI.
According to Lees, a modified U.S. immigration policy could also be conducive to U.S. AI efforts.
“I think that in the field of AI, people promoted should automatically be offered greencards,” he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China presented its plan for the development of the next generation of AI technologies (Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan).
According to Lees, the National Natural Science Foundation of China funds individuals at academic institutions similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organizations donating money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, in which partners from industry and science should be involved, and the White House announced the formation of a special committee on artificial intelligence.
In addition, DARPA announced this month the investment of $2 billion in the “AI Next” initiative.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) currently invests more than $100 million annually in AI research.
In the meantime, nothing has been done about U.S. laws regarding the formation of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on a change of country name
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia", which would add to a decade-old dispute with Greece, which blocked Macedonia's applications for admission to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor means that this claim to Greek territory, so Greece has vetoed Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, with a boycott campaign calling into question whether the voter turnout will reach the 50 percent required for the validity of the referendum.
The question on the ballot was: “Are you in favour of membership in NATO and the EU through the adoption of the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that for Macedonia, one of the countries emerging from the collapse of Yugoslavia, the inclusion in organizations such as the EU and NATO is worth the price.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because this means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legally binding, enough MEPs have said they would stick to the result so that it is crucial.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The state election commission said there were no reports of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, voter turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, in which 66 percent of registered voters had cast their votes.
“I am here because of my children to vote, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonia’s Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dusko will give their vote in the referendum on 30 September 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia on changing the country’s name, which would pave the way for Macedonia’s accession to NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and presented chairs in front of tents set up by people who wanted to boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join the raised head, not through the back entrance,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the integration between Europe and Asia.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will result in urgently needed investments for Macedonia, whose unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
“I think a large majority will be in favour of it, as more than 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after his vote.
In his words, a “yes” result would be a “confirmation of our future”.
According to a poll published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, which is below the required electoral participation.
Another survey conducted by Macedonian broadcaster Telma TV found that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent said they would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the voter turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since its takeover in May last year.
View: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City maneuvered through the entire Brighton defense to score goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling crossed the Brighton defence in Manchester City's 2-0 victory on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
Aguero made his hit in the 65th minute look ridiculously simple.
The Argentine striker received a pass in the midfield at the start of the sequence.
He ran between three Brighton defenders and then ran into the open field.
Aguero then saw himself surrounded by four green jerseys.
He played around a defender and then outperformed several other defenders on the edge of the Brighton penalty area.
He then threw a pass to the left of Sterling.
The English striker used his first ball contact in the penalty area to play the ball back to Aguero, who with his right footed Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan crossed over and shot into the right side of the net.
“Aguero is struggling with problems in his feet,” city manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We talked about him having to play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at the moment."
However, it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League duel.
This goal fell in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball on this train far on the side of Brighton.
He shot a good steep pass along the left flank to Leroy Sané.
Sané needed a few trains to control sterling to the long corner.
The Sky-Blues attacker targeted the ball into the net shortly before it slipped out.
City will play in the Champions League group game on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim against Hoffenheim.
Scherzer wants to ruin the game for the Rockies
Since the Nationals were excluded from the playoff competition, there was little reason to force another effort.
However, the always-performing pitcher hopes to stand against the Colorado Rockies on the hill on Sunday, but only if this is relevant for the Rockies, who have a game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West, for the playoffs.
The Rockies scored at least one wildcard on Friday night with a 5:2 win over the Nationals, but still want to secure their first division title.
“Although we’re not playing for anything, we can at least throw because we know the atmosphere with the spectators here in Denver and the other team would probably play at the highest level I’d meet this year.
Why should I not want to take part in this contest?”
The Nationals have not yet announced a starter for Sunday, but are reportedly inclined to throw jokes in such a situation.
Scherzer, for whom this would be the 34th bet as a starting player, practiced in the bullpen on Thursday and would throw on Sunday on his normal rest day.
The Washington right-hander has a stats of 18-7 this season, an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump stops preaching in West Virginia
The President indirectly referred to the situation related to the Brett Kavanaugh, whom he chose for the Supreme Court, when he spoke about the importance of the participation of Republican voters in the midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
Five weeks before one of the most important choices of our lives.
That’s one of the big, big ones – I don’t stand up, but in reality I stand up, which is why I fight everywhere for great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, “You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to take back power by all means, you see the community, the disgust.
It doesn’t matter to them who they hurt, who they have to beat to get power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, we won’t give them.”
The Democrats, he said, see their mission in “resisting and blocking.”
“And you see that in the last four days,” he said, describing the Democrats as “wounding and common and disgusting and dishonest.”
He named the highest-ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Dianne Feinstein, which sparked loud calls from the public.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you send the document to the outside?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh, no, I'm waiting for you one -- that was really a bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer allowing all opinions to apply.
The party is intolerant of those who say their opinion.
When the momentum activists in my local party voted to taunt me, this came as little as a surprise.
Finally, I am the last in a series of Labour Members who are told that they are not welcome – just because we say our opinion.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because she had risen vigorously against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized with the tadel request for representing a different opinion than Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically on similar issues, about which Jeremy and former top politicians did not agree.
The announcement of the session of Nottingham East Labour on Friday said that “the meetings should be inclusive and productive.”
Mostly the Friday GC meetings in my eight years as a local Labour MP were just that.
Unfortunately, today most sessions are not shaped by this tone, and the promised “more friendly, more careful” policy has long been forgotten, if it ever started.
It is becoming increasingly clear that divergent views in the Labour Party are not tolerated and that any opinion is judged according to whether it is accepted by the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became party leader, with colleagues with whom I previously believed to share similar political views, now expected me to make a turnaround and take positions with which I would otherwise never have agreed to market – be it with regard to European national security or national security.
Whenever I speak in public – and it doesn’t matter what I say – there is a mockery on social media that calls for my election, calls for the political center and says that I shouldn’t be a member of the Labour Party.
With this experience, I am not alone.
In fact, I know that I am doing better than some of my colleagues, because the comments I make are mostly political in nature.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues, who face a daily flood of sexist or racist incitements and yet never make a small contribution.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political age is that incitement has become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn last week called on the Labour Party to promote a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we no longer allow all opinions to apply, and with every request for distrust and every change in the electoral rules, the party becomes narrower.
In the last two years I have often been advised to pull my head in and not express my opinion so clearly, then I would have "no problems".
But I did not go into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, prompted by the neglect of the Thatcher government, which literally disintegrated my classroom in the general school, I have advocated for better public services for those like me, as ministers, who most urgently need them.
I have never made a glimpse of my political views, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way be vague about my political positions and about areas where I disagree with the current leadership.
To the supporters of Friday’s motion, I just want to say the following: Given the fact that the country is resting on a Brexit that will hurt households, businesses and our public service, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
In fact, however, I do not address this message to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that I will not be able to deal with so many more electoral threats or political thought among all of you.

Ayr vs Melrose 38:17: Un beaten Ayr team rises to the top
Two late attempts may have distorted the final result somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ayr earned the victory in this extremely entertaining game of the day in the Tennent's Premiership.
They are now the only of the ten teams to be at the top of the table unbeaten.
In the end, the success of the home team was due to their superior defense as well as their better chance recovery, and coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be satisfied.
“We’ve been tested in our games so far and we’re still unbeaten, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, “Thanks to Ayr, they’ve used their chances better than us.”
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, increased by Frazier Climo, led Ayr. However, due to a yellow card for the Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who had been released for the game by the Warriors, Melrose could not speak the numbers.
Climo expanded Ayr's lead with a penalty kick before he scored a hit at half time and then scored an increased try in the lead, so it was a 17:5 break for Ayr.
However, Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was increased by Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
There was a prolonged interruption due to a serious injury to Ruairidh Knott, who was carried by the field, and after the continuation, Ayr built his lead by an attempt by Stafford McDowall increased by Climo.
Then Blair Macpherson, acting as Ayr's captain, received a yellow card, and again, at the end of a phase of enormous pressure, Melrose let the additional man pay for an unincreased attempt by Bruce Colvine.
However, the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for tackle without a ball against Climo, MacPherson scored from the penalty area from a touchdown behind the forward Ayr package.
Climo, as almost since the break, increased after Kyle Rowe captured David Armstrong's boxkick and sent side Gregor Henry off for the home team's fifth attempt.
"Still Game" star appears ready for new career in gastronomy
“Still Game” star Ford Kieran appears to be ready for a change in the hospitality industry after it turned out that he was named the CEO of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, whose screenplays he writes and in which he plays one of the main roles together with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last of the show, and Kiernan seems to be planning a life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the Managing Director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, though a source from the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan was interested in entering Glasgow's "floristic restaurant business".
"The sea belongs to us": Bolivia, which is enclosed by land, hopes that a court will open the way for it to the Pacific
Matrosen patrol in front of the tauwork-decorated naval headquarters in La Paz.
There is a blue flag on public buildings.
Fleet bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon carry the motto: “The sea is our legitimate property.
Recovering it is a duty.”
Everywhere in Bolivia, which is enclosed by land, the memory of Chile’s lost coastal portion of resources in a bloody conflict in the 19th century is as vivid as the desire to travel across the Pacific again.
These hopes may not be as strong as they have been for decades, as Bolivia is awaiting a judgment by the International Court of Justice to be dismissed on October 1 after five-year consultations.
“Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity, and of course expects the result with a positive attitude,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Across the country, many Bolivians will pursue the IGH’s judgement on large screens, in the hope that the court in The Hague will decide in favour of Bolivia’s demand. According to this, Chile is obliged to negotiate on a sovereign access to the Bolivian sea after decades of sporadic talks.
For Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president, who is facing a controversial fight for his re-election next year, there is also much at stake in Monday’s verdict.
“We are about to return to the Pacific,” he vowed at the end of August.
However, some analysts consider it unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia, and believe that this would change little.
The UN body based in the Netherlands is not authorized to assign Chilean territory, and has determined that it will not decide on the outcome of possible talks.
According to Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert on international law, that the IGH judgement is already in place six months after the final plea, the case was "not complicated".
Far from supporting the Bolivian case, the past four years could also mean a setback.
“The current Bolivian government has taken the issue of access to the sea by itself,” Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
She hinted that Morales's war rhetoric had suffocated any remaining goodwill of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their talks at some point, but after these events, this becomes extremely difficult.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the view that the court’s decision had fallen unusually quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia has “an extraordinary opportunity to usher in a new era of relations with Chile” and an opportunity to “end the 139 years of disputes for mutual benefit,” he said.
Calzadilla also argues that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – uses the theme of the sea as a political crossroads.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific,” he added.
“Judgement is a chance to realize that we have to overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will only take place if it can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke in front of the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to put into practice the promises made during a summit between the rival heads of state in Singapore.
His remarks come at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears more than three months after the summit with North Korean chief Kim Jong-un in Singapore shortly before resuming the impending nuclear diplomacy.
Ri called the notion that further sanctions and U.S. resistance to a declaration to end the Korean War would ever push the North to its knees as a “brain spike.”
Washington is sceptical and does not want to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang taking significant disarmament steps first.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning an arsenal in which the country probably sees the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris show the latest collections for huge headwear, which will soon be available in the shopping streets near you
If you want to extend your hat collection or completely shield the sun, you don’t have to look anymore.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne showcased a range of crazy oversized headgear for their summer collection 2019, which fascinated the fashion world at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats have flooded Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their eye-catching creations across the runway.
Valentino’s most outstanding piece was an extravagant beige hat with a feather-like wide rim that almost squeezed the heads of the models.
Other over-sized accessories include jeweled watermelons, a magic hat and even a pineapple, but they are not meant to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a series of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks were fitted with stitched lips and had more resemblance to Hannibal Lecter than with Haute Couture.
One creation resembled a scuba gear, including snorkel and scuba goggles, while another looked like a melted ice bag.
And if you want to put another huge fashion statement, you are in luck.
Fashion observers predict that the huge headgear could find its way into shopping streets near you.
The oversized hats follow directly on “La Bomba”, the straw hat with 60 centimeters wide rim, all worn from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the extremely impractical hat that hit big waves on social media sent another big creation across the treadmill: a straw beach bag that was almost as big as the model wearing a swimsuit that held the bag.
The bass bag in reddish orange with bass fringes and a white leather collar was the highlight of Jacquemus' summer 2019 collection "La Riviera" at Paris Fashion Week.
Prominent stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect that large hats and beach bags will be available next summer in the shopping streets. The designer has gained so much attention that the demand for oversized accessories will be hard to ignore.”
John Edward: Proficiency in the Language of the World's Citizens
Scotland’s independent schools continue to be distinguished by academic excellence. This has continued in 2018 with further outstanding test results and is only supported by individual and shared successes in the fields of sport, art, music and other community businesses.
With more than 30,000 students from all over Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to take care of their students and their parents at the highest possible level.
Independent schools pursue the goal of preparing their students for further and higher education, the profession of their choice and their place as world citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we see that modern languages are still popular and sought after in schools as electives.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to someone in a language they understand, you reach their head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will reach his heart.”
This is an impressive reminder that we can’t rely only on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The current exam results of this year show that languages with the highest rates of existence are at the top of the rankings of independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of the students who learned foreign languages achieved the grade A in the higher examinations.
From the data collected by 74 SCIS member schools, it was found that 72 percent of students in Mandarin achieved the grade A during the higher examinations, while 72 percent of students who learned German, 69 percent of students who learnt French, who learnt French and who learnt French.
This illustrates that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important knowledge that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now regarded as elective subjects as well as STEM subjects (natural sciences, engineering, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere.
According to a survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014, 17 percent of the reasons employers called for the problems in occupying open positions were due to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly necessary when it comes to preparing young people for their future careers.
As more and more open spaces presuppose languages, this knowledge is essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the chosen profession, young people who have learned a second language will have a real advantage in the future through such a lifelong ability.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give multilingual people an advantage over competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to conduct an interview, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage (15 percent).
That’s why it’s important for today’s children to invest in language education now.
Children who speak multiple languages, especially languages from developing countries, will have better chances of finding a meaningful job.
In Scotland, different languages are taught at all schools.
A number of schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while other languages will be taught, which are considered to be the most important for the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Wherever your child’s interests lie, at independent schools there will always be a number of languages with appropriately specialized teachers to choose from.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills necessary for their success, no matter what the future may look like.
At this point, in a global economic environment, it cannot be denied that languages are still of fundamental importance for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should actually be regarded as "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron to make Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego
For fans who want to see LeBron James play for the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time, the wait is coming to an end.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the opening game of the pre-season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
How many minutes he will play, however, is not yet clear.
“It will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play only a few minutes.
Earlier this week, James was asked to train for his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason play schedule.
“I don’t need pre-season games at this stage of my career to prepare myself,” he said.
Time for Trump's announcement in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, a series of campaign announcements.
This is the first of Trump’s five announcements planned for next week, including in well-meaning places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
Given the floating vote on confirming his election to the Supreme Court, Trump wants to build support for the upcoming midterm elections in November, as Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress.
When will Trump’s announcement take place in West Virginia tonight, and how can you watch online?
Trump’s announcement in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for today, Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 19:00 East Coast Time.
You can follow Trump’s announcement in West Virginia below as a live stream on YouTube online.
Trump is likely to appeal to the Supreme Court-appointed Brett Kavanaugh's hearings on allegations of sexual misconduct that were held this week in a tense atmosphere, with the Senate's expected vote on the confirmation being held for up to a week in the swamp, while the FBI is underway.
However, the main goal of this announcement series is to support Republicans who have to face up to a difficult November election.
Therefore, President Trump’s campaign team told Reuters that these five announcements will be used next week to “mobilize volunteers and supporters while Republicans try to retain and expand their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“Control over Congress is so important to his plans that the president will travel to as many states as possible as the campaign season approaches,” a Trump campaign spokesman who did not want to name his name told Reuters.
According to the West Virginia Metro News, supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania could participate in the announcement scheduled for tonight at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, and report to the media from Pittsburgh.
The visit on Saturday is Trump’s second visit this month to West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to support West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is behind polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to try to boost him in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team shows readiness to fight to maintain hope for the single on Sunday
After three one-sided rounds, Saturday afternoon’s four-parts might have been exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of the moment is, as a sporting concept, a pure invention, but one that players really believe in, especially in competitions like this one.
So where do you think the momentum is now?
"They were in the lead with six points, and now it's four, so I think that means a little moment for us," Spieth said when he left the venue.
Europe is, of course, ahead of four points, while there are twelve more to follow.
However, according to Spieth, the Americans feel some wind in their sails and have reason to feel encouraged, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have been playing together all day and can each have three out of four points.
Spieth was incredibly strong from the shot to the green and goes with a good example.
The guttural thrillers became louder in the further course of his round when he lowered an important putt to decide the fourth match with four points for both after he and Thomas had lagged behind by two holes with two points.
His putt, who chose the match on the 15th hole for her, triggered a similar scream that suggests the American team is not out of the game yet.
“I really need to clean up and take care of my own game,” Spieth said.
That’s all there is to the individual players.
18 holes to set a sign.
Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood have scored more points in the last two days than Spieth and Thomas and thus undoubtedly wrote the history of the Ryder Cup.
Europe’s unequal but sympathetic duo is at four out of four points and can’t do anything wrong.
“Moliwood” wasn’t the only couple that didn’t hit a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they had also avoided Bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and at the back nine holes on Friday morning.
This series and the seemingly flowing energy between them and the outpouring of energy underpins the fact that they are the players to beat on Sunday. Fleetwood and Molinari would be the most popular players sealing a possible European victory at sunset over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at different holes at the same time.
Speaking of European fame, however, would be premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a brief trial with Sergio Garcia, the morning’s fourth hero who played alongside Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine holes brought the Spaniards and the Swedes into a clutch they could not nearly overcome.
On Sunday, however, no one can help them out.
The four and four pairs are so fascinating to look at due to the interactions between the pairs, the advice they give or not, and the way in which a strategy can change lightning-fast.
The Europeans have played better as a team so far and are clearly in the lead on the last day, but this fourth round has also shown that the U.S. team is ready to fight, which some, especially in the U.S., had doubted.
Europe take the lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup with 10:6
Europe are 10-6 ahead of the United States after Saturday's fourth and fourth games, and have a solid lead in the final day of the Ryder Cup.
The brilliantly playing duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari went ahead with two victories over the struggling Tiger Woods, scoring four points in Le Golf National.
The European team led by Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, who wants to regain the trophy lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated in the fourth in the morning against the defective American team and won the series with 3:1.
In the four-match, the United States played more resistance and won two matches, but could not recover the remainder.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points in the 12 singles played on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first European to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who were dubbed “Molliwood” after a sensational weekend, won four points as the second duo in Ryder Cup history in their four opening matches.
After hitting Woods and Patrick Reed in the Fours, they harmonized excellently and beat the enchanted Woods and American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau with an even more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who had dragged himself through two matches on Saturday, occasionally flashed his brilliance, but now has lost 19 of his 29 matches in fours and fours and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested during the four in the morning, returned and played as a partner of Henrik Stenson the four-match, winning 2&1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the number one and third in the world.
For Europe, however, on this pleasant windy day southwest of Paris, not everything went according to their ideas.
The three-time major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They scored a tough 2&1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter and beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the 4&3 fours after losing the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, it has only happened twice that a team came back after it had gone into the singles with a four-point draw, but as a title holder, Furyk's team has only one draw to keep the trophy.
Since they have only been in second place for two days, it doesn’t look like they could start a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea Rejects Unilateral Disarmament Without Confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions deepened its distrust of the United States and the country would not give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under these circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organization’s annual general meeting last year that North Korea had taken “substantial measures of goodwill,” for example, stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site, and committing itself not to commit to nuclear weapons and technology.
“But we do not see a corresponding reaction from the United States,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there is no trust in our national security, and under these circumstances, we will not disarm ourselves unilaterally first.”
While Ri repeated North Korea’s complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “phase-wise” denuclearization approach, in which North Korea would be rewarded for successive steps, his statement seemed significant insofar as it had found a one-sided denuclearization as it had done before.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim had pledged to work on the “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula” for the North’s security.
North Korea is seeking an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, while the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
In addition, Washington opposes demands for a loosening of stringent international sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States insists on ‘denuclearization first’ and increases the pressure by sanctions to achieve its goal by coercion, and is even against the ‘declaration of war’,” Ri said.
“The assumption that sanctions can force us to our knees is a brain spin of people who don’t know anything about us.
The problem, however, is that the continued sanctions will deepen our distrust."
Ri did not come up with plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. head of state had highlighted earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, the minister pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korean Head of State Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: “If South Korea were the other party on the denuclearization issue instead of the US, it would not be the denuclearization of the Korean neck.”
Still, the tone of Ris’ speech differed enormously from his speech last year when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to target the mainland of the United States with North Korea’s missiles after “evil President” Trump signed Kim as a “missile man” on a suicide mission.
This year, Trump, who had threatened the “full destruction” of North Korea last year, praised Kim at the United Nations for his courage in terms of disarmament steps, but said there was still a lot of work to be done and the sanctions until denuclearization of North Korea remain in force.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for it: “Whether it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “The enforcement of the Security Council’s sanctions must in any case continue vigorously until we have reached the complete, definitive and verified denuclearization.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously tightened sanctions against North Korea to financially dry out Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and subsequently said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was unsuccessful.
In July, he said on his departure from Pyongyang that progress had been made, only hours later, to be accused by North Korea, that he had made “gang-star-like demands.”
North Korea vowed this month at a meeting with Moon to dismantle a missile base and a nuclear complex if the United States took "corresponding measures".
He said Kim had told him that the “corresponding measures” he sought were security guarantees given by Trump in Singapore, as well as steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard Students Learn in a Course to Get Enough Sleep
A new course at Harvard University ensures that all students in primary school get more sleep this year, a measure against the growing macho culture of waking up with caffeine and learning all night long.
One scientist has found that students at the world’s leading university are often unnecessary when it comes to taking care of themselves.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, and is, in his opinion, the first such course in the United States.
He was inspired to bring the course to life after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
“Finally, a girl came to me and asked, ‘Why do I only learn about it now, in my last year?’
According to her words, no one had ever told her how important sleep is, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
This year’s course, for the first time, taught students how the basics of good sleep habits contribute to academic and athletic performance and also improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the university’s executive director of health services, said the university had opted for the introduction of the course after finding that students were suffering from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In a section, the students see the picture of a room in a residential home and click on coffee cups, curtains, workout shoes and books, where they get information about the effect of caffeine and light, as well as the effects of sleep deprivation on athletic performance and the importance of a sleep routine.
In another section, participants learn that long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and cancer.
Subsequently, using a map of the university landscape with interactive symbols, they are encouraged to think about their daily routine.
“We know that it will not change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know this – just as you have the right to know how the decision to smoke affects your health,” added Professor Czeisler.
The pride of pushing a “night layer” is still widespread, he said, adding that modern technologies and the ever-growing pressure on students made sleep deprivation a growing problem.
To ensure sufficient sleep, the “secret weapon” of all students should be against stress, exhaustion and fear, he said, and also to avoid weight gain, as sleep deprivation puts the brain into hunger mode so that they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, who had completed one of his courses at Harvard last year in his first year.
He said the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to push for a university-wide course.
He hopes that in the next step all postgraduate students will be asked to complete a similar degree program before they begin their studies at the competitive university.
According to the recommendation of Professor Czeisler, students should be able to wake up to sleep and wake-up time and be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" that comes from electronic screens and LED lighting and can cause a problem of the circadian rhythm.
Livingston vs Rangers 1:0: Menga-Tor defeats Gerrards player
The Rangers lost another away game when Dolly Menga's hit for Steven Gerrard's dissenting team meant a 0–1 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to secure their first away win since the 4-1 triumph at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holts team added Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager, leaving his team eight points behind Ladbrokes Premiership with a distance leading.
Menga met seven minutes before half-time, and the poorly inspired Rangers seemed to have no chance of making up.
While the Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third place and is only behind Hibernian in the goal difference.
The Rangers are also in further trouble after line judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound by an object apparently thrown out of the guest block.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, overtaking Ayr and reaching the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, stayed with the same eleven Livingston players who dropped the Hearts a point last week, and would have to be excited about how his well-trained team kept their opponent under pressure.
The Rangers dominated the ball possession, but Livingston achieved more when they had the ball.
They should have scored a goal after only two minutes, when Menga's first leg led Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed his chance and shot next to it.
Then a long free kick from Keaghan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only pass by the rear post.
The Rangers took control, but their game seemed more hopeful than convinced in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos was obviously of the opinion that after a quarter-hour collision between him and Steven Lawless he should have received a penalty kick, but referee Steven Thomson did not apply the Colombian's complaints.
The Rangers only got two shots in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly hardly had a problem with Lassana Coulibaly's headball and a slow shot by Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingston's 34th minute hit may not have matched the game, it is not to be denied that they had earned him alone for their hard work.
Again, the Rangers could not handle a ball shot by Jacobs in a standard situation.
Scott Arfield didn't respond when Declan Gallagher shot the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept quiet and chose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard traded at half time and exchanged Coulibaly for Ryan Kent, and the change was almost immediately effective when the wingman put Morelos in position, but the impressive Kelly ran off his line to block the ball.
Livingston, however, continued to get the guests to play exactly the game that was theirs, with Lithgow and Halket getting one long ball after the other.
Holt's team could have expanded their lead in the final phase, but McGregor held up well and resisted Jacobs before Lithgow passed a headball from the corner.
Rangers exchange player Glenn Middleton also lately demanded a penalty kick for a setback with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanach: The inventor of the violin counter
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: On September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as a violin counter.
The violin counter, which has since become the standard element of science, has also become a standard element of pop culture, for example in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" with the seemingly unusual cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What the hell is that?”
Rogers: “This is a violin counter used to search for radioactive minerals like uranium.
If you put these headphones on, you can hear the effects of radioactive radiation in the minerals."
Evans: “Actually, I hear a knock!”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the invention, which bears his name, continues to live on.
New Cancer Vaccine Can Teach the Immune System to “See” Detarted Cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” and destroy detached cells.
As part of the treatment, the vaccine helps the immune system to detect detarded cells.
With the method, a patient's immune cells are removed, which are altered in the laboratory.
These cells can “see” many types of common protein and are then injected again.
A test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
The ovarian cancer of a woman who was treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to detect detached cells disappeared for more than 18 months.
With the method, a patient's immune cells are removed, which are modified in the laboratory so that they can "see" the protein HER2 common to many cancers, and then the cells are injected again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “supports the growth of different types of cancer,” including breast, ovarian, lung and bowel cancer, as Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar method in which patients are taken immune cells and instructed to attack cancer cells has helped in the treatment of leukemia.
After his appearance at SNL, Kanye West released a pro-Trump tirade and wore a MAGA cap ("Make America Great Again").
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was kicked off at Saturday Night Live in the studio after widely lauded U.S. President Donald Trump and said he wanted to run for president in 2020.
Having sung his third title of the evening, “Ghost Town,” and wearing a make-up America Great Again cap, he continued with a smuggling cannon against the Democrats, once again emphasizing his support for Trump.
“I’m so often asked by white people, ‘How can you like Trump? He’s a racist.’
So if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee on the allegations of sexual harassment raised by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the recording of West's Schimpftirade was not sent, it was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It’s not clear if Rock wanted to make fun of the release about West.
West also complained to the audience that he was having trouble behind the scenes because of his head covering.
“They’ve bullied me behind the scenes.
You said, ‘Don’t go out with your hat.’
You've bullied me!
And then they say I'm in a submerged area," he told the Washington Examiner.
West continues, “Do you want to see the submerged area?” He said, “He’s going to put on my supermanscape because that means you can’t tell me what I have to do. You want it to happen to the world?
Try it with love.”
His remarks triggered calls from the audience at least twice, and SNL contributors seemed embarrassingly touched, Variety reported. One person told the magazine, "It was deadstill in the studio."
West was late to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West confused many with a talk titled "I Love It", in which he was dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West received support from Candace Turner, the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, who tweeted: "To one of the most courageous spirits: THANK YOU THAT YOU HATED THE MASS."
Talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply himself and that was absolutely wonderful.
“But I don’t want to reward someone who, in my opinion, makes an ideology detrimental to my community and gives of itself (by buying his music or his clothes or supporting his ‘art’).
He's free.
The same goes for us,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and is now "The Being formally known as Kanye West" (which is officially known as Kanye West).
He is not the first artist to change his name, and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rapper colleague Snoop Dogg was named Snoop Lion, and of course, Prince, the late music legend, changed his name to a symbol and then to "The Artist Formerly Known As Prince".
Accused of attempted murders in connection with stab wound at Belfaster Restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was injured with a knife at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is due to appear before the arbitral tribunal in Belfast on Monday.
The allegations will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
'Game of Thrones' Star Kit Harington Attacks Toxic Masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as the sword of swinging Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series "Game of Thrones".
The 31-year-old actor, however, attacked the stereotype of the macho hero, saying such roles on the screen would result in boys often feeling the need to be strong in order to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Harington said he believed something went wrong and asked how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Harington, who recently married 31-year-old Rose Leslie, who was also involved in Game of Thrones, admitted that the solution to the problem was "very important."
“I personally think the question is very important at the moment, what went wrong with masculinity,” he said.
“What have we taught grown-up men about the problem we are now observing?”
Harington believes that television may be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity due to its very masculine characters.
He continued: “What is born, and what is learned?
What is taught on television and on the street, giving the boy the feeling of having to embody this particular side of a man?
I think that’s really one of the big questions of our time: how do we change that?
For the young men, something has clearly gone wrong.”
He also admitted in the interview that after the end of the series next summer he will not participate in prequels or sequels of "Game of Thrones", he has "enough of battlefields and horses".
From November, Harington will be seen in a remake of Sam Shepard's "True West", the story of a film producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently revealed that for him, the best thing about "Game of Thrones" was that he met his wife Rose.
“I met my wife on this show, so that’s how I got my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose Leslie played in the Emmy-winning fantasy series Ygritte, the lover of Harington's character Jon Snow.
The two married in June 2018 on Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced an increase of 14<0xC2><0xB0>% in the number of citizens living with HIV or AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
In contrast to the past, the transmission took place in the vast majority of new cases through sexual intercourse.
So far, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way had been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, compared to the year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sexual intercourse is an acute problem in China’s LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against members of the LGBT community is expected to be widespread.
Based on the country’s conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of the disease are due to insufficient protection during sexual intercourse in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged, among other things, universal access to HIV medicines to address the problem.
Maxine Waters argues that employees leaked GOP senators' data, criticizing "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
Maxine Waters, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, denied on Saturday allegations that a member of her staff had published the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the U.S. House of Representatives' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat argued that the claims of “ultra-right” experts and websites would be disseminated.
“Lies, lies, and even more disgusting lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information is intended to include the private addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday and was released during a Senate committee hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct by an unknown person in the government district against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The publication took place after the three senators had interviewed Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was assigned to Waters’ office, and published the information of a member of Waters’ staff, The Hill reported.
“This unfounded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“The member of my staff – whose identity, personal data and security were compromised by these fraudulent and false accusations – was in no way responsible for leaking this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie.”
Waters’ statement quickly sparked criticism online, including that of Ari Fleischer, a former White House press spokesman.
“This dementia is outrageous,” Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that she doesn’t have the right temperament to be a member of Congress.
People who are accused of something they haven’t done should not be angry.
You mustn't be stubborn.
You must not question the motives of the plaintiff.
You have to be calm and relaxed.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters’ reaction to Democrats’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of having acted too angry during Thursday’s hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who takes part in the midterm elections to replace Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
“Great thing if that’s true,” he tweeted.
Waters said in its statement that its office had informed the competent authorities and law enforcement authorities of these fraudulent allegations.
“We will make sure that the perpetrators are exposed,” she continued, “and that they are held accountable for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all members of my staff.”
“Johnny English – You only live three times” – weak espionage parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is now a tradition to look for new Brexit references in every British-coloured film. This also seems to apply to this revival of the action-comedy parody franchise "Johnny English", which in 2003 was relived with "Johnny English - The spy who sifted it down" with "Johnny" and in 2011 English.
Will an ironic self-parody on the subject of how obviously we are confounded become a new export opportunity for the nation?
In any case, the license of the glitzy, grizzly-cutting and incompetent Johnny English has been extended for the second time to masquerade, signaling more than anything else that it is a common comic creation for cinema visitors in the non-English-speaking room.
Of course, he is once again the clumsy secret agent who bizarrely considers himself cool and mundane, while in reality he is made of something Clouseau, a fist Mr. Bean and a bang of this guy, who at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London has a single note at best.
In addition, the character was originally based on the chaos behind retiring travelers and international secret agents who played Atkinson in the now-forgotten Barclaycard television commercials.
The last adventure of Johnny English has one or two nice moments.
I liked how Johnny English approached a helicopter in a medieval armor and the rotor blades tilted briefly to his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is growing, but the humor seems rather weak and strangely superfluous, especially because the "serious" film series such as "007" and "Mission Impossible" now offer self-confident comedic elements.
The humor seems to be more aimed at children than adults, and for me Johnny English’s crazy misconceptions aren’t as intrusive and focused as Atkins’ dumb movie gags in the role of the bean.
The eternally current premise now is that the UK is in great danger.
A cyberhacker has infiltrated the super-secret British spy network and revealed the identities of all British agents in use, much to the disapproval of the in-service agent, a sadly minor role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for the Prime Minister, a bloated and oppressed figure who is already facing the complete collapse due to her political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives her best with this quasi-teresa-May character, but the script doesn’t give up much with which she can work.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that all active spies have been detached and therefore she must take someone out of retirement.
This includes Johnny English himself, who now works as a teacher at a chic institution, but has unofficially been taught to work as an undercover agent, with a couple of gags, as English offers a school of rock-like spying academy.
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunited with his former hard-tested buddy Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a U-boat commander, a nervous woman of the higher society, in whose role Vicki Pepperdine is somewhat wasted.
So Batman and Robin, who in the secret service of your Majesty always do everything terribly wrong, are back in action, meeting Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme Fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously caught in the trap of a charismatic tech billionaire, the dark Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy, who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of grotesque hiccups: As a waiter, they set fire to a chic French restaurant, they smuggle into chaos aboard Volta’s luxury yacht, and English unleashes pure anarchy when he tries to confuse the house with the help of a virtual inn.
In this last sequence, all registers are drawn, but as sympathetic and funny as it is, the topic is already dealt with in detail in children's television.
Quite moderate fabric.
Like the other Johnny English films, I had to ask myself, “Can’t the British film industry Rowan Atkinson give a role that really meets his talent?”
Labour argues to work on a plan according to which the British work four days a week, but are to be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is set to consider a radical plan that provides for the British to work four days a week, but to be paid for five days.
According to reports, the party wants corporate leaders to pass on the savings achieved by the AI revolution (artificial intelligence) in the form of an additional free day to employees.
This would give employees a three-day weekend, but they would still receive the same payment.
According to sources, the idea "fits" to the party's economic agenda and to its plans to shift the balance in the country in favor of workers.
The move to a four-day week was endorsed by the Trades Union Congress as an opportunity for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told the Sunday Times: “A policy review is expected to be announced by the end of the year.
“A shift will not take place overnight, but a four-day working week is an effort consistent with the Party’s approach to restoring economic equilibrium to the benefit of workers and with the Party’s general industrial policy strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first party to support such an idea, as the Green Party already promised the introduction of a 4-day week during the 2017 general election campaign.
At present, however, the Labour Party is not in favour of this approach.
A Labour Party spokesperson said: “A four-day week is not a party policy and it is not considered by the party.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell concretized his notion of a socialist revolution in the economy at the Labour Conference last week.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain the power of “anonymous directors” and “profitmakers” in public utility companies.
The Shadow Chancellor’s plans also mean that current shareholders of water supply companies may not get their full share back, as a Labour government could make “deductions” due to alleged misbehavior.
He also confirmed plans to appoint employees to the boards of directors of companies and set up Inclusive Ownership Funds to transfer 10% of the equity of private companies to employees who cash annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say in the news magazine “60 Minutes” whether the FBI investigation in the Kavanaugh case could change their opinion
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court judge by at least a week and raises the question of whether the authority’s findings could influence Republican senators to win their support.
In an interview on Sunday, 60-minute correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring something to light that could ultimately change their minds.
Kennedy seemed to be more open about it than his South Carolina counterpart.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said in the hearing that I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this claim was made, and asked if he had done it.
He was determined, determined, and unequivocal.”
Graham’s voice appears to be carved in stone.
“My opinion is firm about Brett Kavanaugh, and it would have to blow a bomb,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I do know the following: Brett vehemently disputed this,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And everyone she called couldn’t confirm it.”
It's 36 years now.
And I can't see any changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it helped to reduce poverty as part of this festival?
This Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival takes place in New York, an annual music festival with an impressive lineup of stars and an equally impressive mission to combat poverty in the world.
Tens of thousands will visit the Global Citizen Festival, which is taking place for the 7th time this year, not only to experience the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event’s true goal: combating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which took place for the first time in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project. As part of this project, an international interest group tries to combat poverty by motivating more and more people to take an active part in the fight against poverty.
To get a free ticket for the event (the other option would be to buy a VIP ticket), you have to complete a number of tasks. These include actions such as volunteering, communicating with a leading politician worldwide (by email or phone) or similar measures to encourage awareness.
How successful is the project, given that Global Citizens still have 12 years to reach the goal?
Is the idea of setting up a cool free concert, a meaningful way to convince others that it’s time to act, or just another case of so-called clicktivism – if you’re thinking of changing something by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen announced that the project has been able to record more than 19 million actions from its supporters since 2011 and achieve various goals.
These actions are said to have contributed to motivating leading politicians around the world to announce commitments and strategies worth more than $37 billion that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid out or raised through fundraising.
According to the group’s estimates, the funds secured so far have a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the most important commitments include the project The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of UK-based investors and implementers who have pledged to support children in their optimal development, and who have pledged to give Rwanda more than $35 million in global sales, according to Citi, to help them subsidize.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history,” Tracey Ullman, the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, told the BBC during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve the nutrition situation of mothers and children, the government announced funding for the The Power of Nutrition project, which is expected to reach 5 million women and children and provide nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, namely the question of what are the reasons why Global Citizens can fight extreme poverty,
They replied, “It will be a long and strenuous path with heights and depths.
But like the big civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed as we are stronger and more influential together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are among the artists who will perform at this year’s event in New York, including Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman as moderators.
U.S. Could Use Navy for Blockade Purposes to Prevent Russian Energy Exports – Interior Ministry
According to Washington Examine, Washington can resort to the Navy if needed, so that energy from Russia does not reach markets including the Middle East, US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke said.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s involvement in Syria is an excuse to explore new energy markets. Russia is currently working in these areas at the invitation of the legitimate government.
“I think the real reason for Russia’s involvement in the Middle East is to negotiate new energy markets, just like in Eastern Europe,” he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with this.
“The United States, together with the Navy, can ensure that the seaways remain open, and block them if needed, so as to ensure that energy from Russia does not reach the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the Consumer Energy Alliance event, a non-profit group that understands itself as the “voice of electricity consumers” in the United States.
He drew a comparison between Washington’s approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are practically identical.
“The use and replacement of fuels is more or less the economic option in Iran and Russia,” he said, calling Russia a “One Trick Pony” with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements were made when the Trump administration was about to expand its exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe and thus replace Russia, the far more cost-effective option for consumers in Europe.
To this end, government officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the “immeasurable” pipeline project Nord Stream 2, with which according to Trump Berlin became a “captive” Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly emphasized that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline is worth $11 billion, which is expected to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s massive resistance to the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we are all of the opinion that energy should not be used as a means to exert pressure, and that consumers can choose the suppliers themselves,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry in September in Moscow.
The United States has received counter-wind from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organisation, the Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie (BDI), has called on the United States to refrain from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“It’s a big problem if a third country interferes in our energy supply,” said BDI Dieter Kempf after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren wants to “examine” a 2020 presidential candidate, says Senator for Massachusetts
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would “examine” a presidential candidate after the midterm elections.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering a candidacy.
According to The Hill, Warren said it would be time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and that includes women at the top.
Warren plans to “examine” a presidential candidacy after November 6.
Warren said during the meeting that President Trump is leading this country in the wrong direction.
“I am extremely concerned about how Donald Trump is dealing with our democracy,” she said.
Warren, in her criticism of Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, did not take a leaf out of her mouth.
In a tweet on Friday, she announced that, of course, an FBI investigation is required before the vote.
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that the majority of the Warren electorate does not believe they should run for 2020.
According to a poll by the Suffolk University Political Research Center and Boston Globe, 58 percent of potential voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run.
32% of voters supported such a candidacy.
The poll showed more support for a candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick; with 38 percent who favor a potential candidacy, and 48 percent who oppose it.
Among the other names of prominent Democrats that come into question with a view to a possible 2020 candidacy are former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said he would make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin speaks on the Donald Trump rally for post-traumatic stress disorder, under the track Palin suffers
Track Palin, 26, was in Iraq for a year.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
“What my son is going through, what he’s going through when he comes back, that can all mimic other families who feel the effects of PTBS and some of the wounds our soldiers are coming back with,” she told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "an elephant in space" and said about her son and other war veterans that she changed coming back, that they were coming back sooner, that they were coming back and wondering if there was this respect for what other soldiers and pilots and every other member of the military had given him.
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, said Dan Bennett, a spokesperson for Wasilla police.
18 states and D.C. support legal remedies for new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia support a legal remedy for the new U.S. policy that denies victims of gang activity or domestic violence asylum.
Representatives of the 18 states and the district filed a forensic expert statement in Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker who questions the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace-against-session lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal politics has not been disclosed.
She said her partner “and his violent gang sons” abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The prosecutors who support Grace called El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where many people apply for asylum in the United States, as nations struggling with major problems with criminal gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy lifted a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed illegal immigrants on the run from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The District of Columbia Attorney General, Karl Racine, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of legislation at the state, state and international levels".
“The federal law requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of the respective facts and circumstances of the application, and that court violates this principle,” the statement said.
Furthermore, the lawyers argued in the statement that the policy of denying immigrants access to the country has an adverse effect on the U.S. economy, as immigrants might be more likely to be working as entrepreneurs and could provide the necessary workforce.
Federal Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered in June that immigration judges no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and the violence of criminal gangs.
“There is asylum for all who leave their homeland because they are being persecuted or because of fear of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political belief,” Sessions said in his June 11 announcement of the policy.
It was never the plan to de-escalate all problems, even all the serious problems that people have to struggle with every day worldwide by granting asylum.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu, as the number of deaths in the race doubles over time
For the survivors, the situation has become increasingly worse.
“It’s all very tense,” says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, calming her little feverish son in a rescue center in the devastated downtown Palu.
“Every minute a new ambulance comes with the dead.
Clean drinking water is scarce."
Residents returned to their destroyed houses to collect their wettest property and property and to save everything they could find.
Hundreds were injured, and the staff of hospitals damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake were completely overloaded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who contracted vertebral fractures and a broken shoulder, remained outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside due to the ongoing strong aftershocks.
With tears in his eyes, he told how the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“Everything went too fast.
I think I was stuck under the walls that fell," he told the Associated Press, adding that the reason for staying in the city was a wedding.
“I heard my wife’s calls for help, but then there was peace.
I don't know what happened to my wife and child.
I can only hope that they are in a safe place.”
U.S. ambassador accuses China of tyranny with “propaganda ads”
A week after an official Chinese newspaper turned on a four-page ad in an American daily announcing the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador to China accused the country’s capital Beijing of smuggling the American press for propaganda purposes.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to China Daily's paid allowance in the Des Moines Register, Iowa's best-selling magazine, after accusing China of meddling in the U.S. congressional elections on Nov. 6, a charge that China is contesting.
Trump’s accusations that Beijing has tried to interfere in the U.S. election are consistent with a message from U.S. officials to Reuters; a new phase of an escalating campaign triggered by Washington to exert pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to turn on advertisements to promote the economy, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an ongoing trade war, with tariffs on imports for both countries.
China’s retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war should meet exporters in states like Iowa that supported Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, who exports large-scale agricultural products to China, said Beijing had damaged workers, farm owners and businesses.
China, according to Branstad in a statement in Des Moines Register on Sunday, is now doubling this tyranny by turning on propaganda ads in its own free press in the United States.
“By spreading their propaganda, the Chinese government is claiming the proven tradition of free expression and independent press in America by switching the country’s paid advertising to the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, at the newsstands here in Beijing you will find only a limited number of opponents, and you will not find a real reflection of the differing views the Chinese may have on China’s worrying economic development, given the fact that the media is firmly in the hands of the Communist Party,” he said.
He added that one of China’s best-known newspapers did not accept the offer to publish his article, but did not mention the name of the newspaper.
Republicans scatter voters before midterm elections with the debacle around Kavanaugh, warn observers
Since many of the most influential Republicans support and defend the Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, in the face of multiple allegations of sexual violence, observers have warned of a counter-reaction during the upcoming midterm elections, which could be based on women in particular.
The mood in this regard was extremely tense, and most Republicans have already stated that they will proceed with a vote.
“Such things can’t be reversed,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School The Hill, told an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake’s last-minute advance would be sufficient for an FBI investigation to reassure angry voters.
"Women don't forget what was yesterday, they don't forget tomorrow and they won't forget it in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, first consultant and national spokeswoman for the progressive MoveOn group, told the Washington, D.C., daily.
On Friday morning, demonstrators in the hallway of the Senate called "November is coming!" when the Republicans who control the Justice Committee decided to arrest Kavanaugh's nomination, and despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's statement, Mic reported.
Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are an extremely important topic, said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political observer of the news page.
“People say it’s already high, that’s true.
But it could be higher, especially for voters in the suburbs and for younger voters, people between 18 and 29, who, although they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public statement, in which their allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court’s candidates are detailed, observers suggested that a counter-reaction could be the result if the Republicans put forward the confirmation.
“This situation is a terrible mess for the GOP,” Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
“It’s not just about the board voting, the final vote or the review of Kavanaugh; it’s also about the way the Republicans handled it and how they handled it,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, said in a statement.
However, the Americans seem to disagree on who they are supposed to believe due to the statements of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a slightly larger share on the side of the latter.
A new YouGov survey showed that 41% of respondents were definitively or likely convinced of Ford’s statement, while 35% said they were definitive or likely to give Kavanaugh faith.
Furthermore, 38% said they felt that Kavanaugh was probably or definitely lying about his statement, while 30% said the same about Ford.
Following Flake’s pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford made a statement last week before the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was attacked at the age of 17 by the drunken Kavanaugh.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court had exposed his genitalia to her when they were at a party during their study period in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to face Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is currently launching a startup with the goal of establishing a competition to Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the open-source platform Solid by Berners-Lee.
With Solid, users can choose where their data is stored and who gets access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee said at best that the intention behind Inrupt was “world domination”.
“We need to be active now,” he said about the start-up.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid’s technology, allowing users to create their own personal online data storage or a POD.
It can include contact lists, task lists, a calendar, a music library, and other tools for the private and corporate sectors.
Similar to Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all content is available in one browser and at the same time.
The special thing about the personal online data storage is that the user can decide who can access which data.
The company refers to this concept as personal reinforcement and development of data.
According to John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is that the company will use resources, processes, and appropriate skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, some developers hired to work on this project, as well as a community of volunteer programmers, and a security platform acquired by IBM.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.

Priest Bernard Vann, holder of the Victoria Cross in World War I, was honored
The only clergyman of the Church of England to be awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I was honoured in his hometown 100 years later.
Colonel and priest Bernard Vann won the award for his efforts in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, he was killed four days later by a sniper and never learned that he had won the highest British war award.
His two grandchildren revealed a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Sunday.
One of the grandsons, Michael Vann, said that this act was full of symbolic force, as the memorial stone was unveiled exactly 100 years after the heroic act for which his grandfather was awarded.
According to The London Gazette, Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin on 29 September 1918; through dense fog and under heavy fire from field guns and machine guns.
Later, he pushed forward to the line of fire and, with the "greatest bravery", led the line forward, before moving forward with a field weapon in the entrance alone and turning three of the military units off.
Oberstleutnant Vann was shot dead by a German sniper on 4 October 1918; a little more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were something he could never do, and at the same time something that makes him humble.
Together with his brother Dr. James Vann, he laid down a wreath after the parade under the leadership of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt very honoured to be able to participate in the parade, adding that the bravery of a real hero will be visible primarily through the support of many people.
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, instead there was Peppa Pig
Imagine you've been up all night watching an exciting Bellator 206, and then you can't watch the main event.
The account of San Jose contained 13 fights, including 6 on the main map, and was broadcast live throughout the night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6 p.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for their fight, viewers in the UK were not surprised when Peppa Pig was suddenly seen.
Some remained untouched after staying awake until the early hours of the morning to see the battle in particular.
A fan on Twitter described the switch to the trick film character as a kind of bad joke.
“Due to a regulation by the government, this content is classified as not youth-free, so it had to be switched to a children’s broadcast at 6:00 p.m.,” said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President of Marketing and Communications at Bellator, when he was interviewed for the broadcast.
“Peppa, the pig, exactly.”
Bellator’s CEO, Scott Coker, announced that the company will edit the schedule to accommodate viewers from the UK in the future.
“I think the problem could have been solved already during replay,” he said.
“But it’s 6:00 a.m. on a Sunday at the spectators in the UK, and we won’t solve the incident until Sunday our time, Monday local time there.
But we'll stay.
There was a lot of communication during the change. It went very well and it wasn't always nice.
We have tried to solve the problem and have assumed that it is a technical malfunction.
Which was not the case, it was a problem on the part of the government.
I promise this won't happen again.
We're going to reduce the whole thing to 5 instead of 6 fights, as usual, and we've tried to give fans the best possible experience.
The whole situation is rather unfortunate."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels “underrated” about sexuality
Tom Daley, who has participated as a water jumper at various Olympic Games, says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality. But that feeling motivated him to become so successful.
The 24-year-old said he only realized in high school that he was different from the others.
In the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out on gay rights to encourage others.
He also said that since becoming a father, the victories at the Olympics are no longer so important to him.
The actual moderator of the long-term show, Kirsty Young, paused due to illness for a few months.
In Laverne’s first show, he said he had previously considered himself inferior to others because the love for boys and girls was socially completely unacceptable.
He said, “To this day, the feeling of being inferior to others and different from others is reason for my power and strength and ultimately for my success.”
He wanted to prove that he was a very special personality to not disappoint anyone when his sexual orientation became known.
The two-time bronze medalist at the Olympics is today a prominent LGBT activist and used his appearance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to advance the decriminalization of homosexuality in other countries.
He said he has spoken on this issue because, fortunately, he can live without restrictions and without discrimination and wants to make others brave.
The three-time world champion fell in love with the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013. The realization of falling in love with a man was an absolute surprise for him.
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but he shared that the age difference had never been an issue.
When you had to go through so much as a child and teenager – he took part in the Olympics at the age of 14 for the first time and his father died of cancer three years later, it is difficult to find someone of the same age with similar experiences.
The couple has had a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley since June, and Daley believes that his whole view has changed since then.
Last year, it was all about gold medals.
But for him, there is now more important than Olympic gold medals.
His son Robbie is now his main earner.
He bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain tumor.
Daley said his father did not accept the impending death, and one of the last things he asked about was the tickets to London 2012 as he wanted to be in the forefront.
“I couldn’t tell him he wouldn’t be there anymore,” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it was only after that that that I finally realized that he was not invincible,” he continued.
The following year, Daley won the bronze medal at the 2012 Olympics.
“I just knew that it was always my dream to dive in front of the local audience at the Olympics – that was madness,” he said.
His first song selection – Proud by Heather Small – was also influenced by it. He heard the song ahead of the Olympic Games and still cared for goose skin.

Mickelson, who is currently not in shape, sits on the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record for his 47th Ryder Cup game on Sunday, but he has to work hard to keep the whole thing from becoming a debacle.
Mickelson, who plays for the 12th time at the event, was sent to the reserve bank by Captain Jim Furyk for the Fourballs and Foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of the event as usual, the five-time major winner spent his day firing others and working on his game, hoping to fix the problems that burden him.
Even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old Mickelson was never the most direct golfer and thus not an ideal crew for the narrow Le Golf National golf course, where misguided balls are regularly punished.
And as if the place itself wasn’t discouraging enough, Mickelson meets perfectionist British Open champion Francesco Molinari in the ninth game on Sunday, who has teamed up with Tommy Fleetwood, newcomer at these tournaments, to win all four games this week.
If the Americans with four points left in the 12 singles games make a hot start, Mickelson’s game could prove to be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in Mickelson and could not add much to it either.
“He was completely aware of his role in clearance today, gave me a slap on my back and put his arm around me and said he was ready for tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of self-confidence.
He is one of the world-famous personalities and he has done so much for these teams in the past and this week.
I didn’t think he was in two games.
I had imagined more, but that’s how it went and that’s what we expected.
He wants to be there like everyone else.”
Mickelson will reach the Nick Faldo record for most of the Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
It could mean the end of a Ryder Cup career that never quite matched the highlights of his personal record.
Mickelson can score 18 victories, had to score 20 defeats and reached seven halves, although Furyk announced that his presence alone has enriched the team.
“He’s funny and sarcastic, original and likes to make a few jokes, and he’s a great person who’s popular with the whole team,” he said.
“I think the younger players were happy to get to know him a little bit more this week. It was fun to watch them.
He’s a really interesting person who gives a lot of impulses.”
Captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn knows that the lead may soon be over
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a big lead leading to the last singles in the Ryder Cup can quickly become an unpleasant situation.
The Danish debuted in Valderrama in 1997, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but came just over the finish line and took the lead with the smallest possible lead, achieving a victory of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2–131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“The idea remains that we had a big lead in Valderrama, we had a big lead in Brookline where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won, but that’s just barely,” Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn said (pictured on the photo) after he led golf at 10th place at Lew’s Lew’s Class of 2018.
The experience shows me and all the team members that it’s not over.
It's going to be okay tomorrow.
Put yourself in the stuff and do exactly the right thing.
The whole thing is over only when the dots are on the display.
We have a goal. We want to win this trophy, and that's where our focus is.
I’ve always said I’m focused on the 12 players on our side, but we’re completely clear about what’s on the other side: the best players in the world.”
Froh about the performance his players have accomplished on a difficult golf course, Bjorn went on to say: “I would never overwhelm that.
Tomorrow will be another caliber.
Tomorrow, individual services are at the forefront and that is a completely different matter.
It’s great to work with a partner when things are going well, but if you’re out there alone, you’ll be tested to the limits of your skills as a golfer.
You have to make it clear to the players: get the best out of you tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind and he also has to get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent Jim Furyk will make sure that his players cut better individually than in the team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have won three out of four points.
Furyk himself stood on both sides of that big turn on the last day of the tournament, standing in Brookline on the winning side, before standing on the losing side after Europe's "Wonder of Medinah".
“I remember every damn word,” he answered the question as Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, motivated his players before the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you’d like to take off the quick start you saw in Brookline and Medina.
When the momentum hits one direction, it puts the middle games under a lot of pressure.
We're setting up our team accordingly and sending our guys out as we feel, you know, we're trying to enchant tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned the task of picking up the counter-attack, he must play in the top match against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as other Europeans in the top half of the rankings.
“I chose the guys in this order because I think it covers everything,” Bjorn said of his selection for the singles.
Germany's new warship delayed again
The latest frigate of the German Navy should have been put into service already in 2014 to replace warships from the Cold War era, but according to local media, it will be delivered as early as next year due to faulty systems and rapidly growing costs.
The commissioning of the "Rhineland-Pfalz", the main ship of the brand-new frigates of the "Baden-Württemberg" class, was now postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the time that referred to a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to be put into service by 2014, but the ambitious project was plagued by worrying issues after the delivery.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class, ordered by the Navy in 2007, are intended to replace the old frigates of the Bremen class.
They are intended to include a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft missiles and sea-target aircraft, as well as tar technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic reflection.
Another important feature are longer maintenance periods, and it should be possible that the latest frigates do not have to return to their home ports for up to two years.
However, the ongoing delays may cause the state-of-the-art warships, which are to represent Germany as a naval power, to be outdated at the time of their commissioning, according to Die Zeit.
The F125 frigate, which was pursued by the accident, hit the headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to take off the ship and returned it to the yard of Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to the shipyard after its delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media called a number of significant "software and hardware errors" that had rendered the new ship unusable in a combat situation.
Software problems are particularly serious, as vessels of the Baden-Württemberg class are operated by a crew of only 120 matrons, only about half as many as on the older frigates of the Bremen class.
It has also been known that the ship is much too heavy, which leads to power losses and prevents the Navy from carrying out future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton Rhineland-Palatinate was apparently twice as heavy as ships of a similar class used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the costs of the entire project, including the training costs of the crew, have also become a problem.
Apparently, the cost rose to an astonishing <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion, compared to the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion originally planned.
The problems with the latest frigates are particularly significant given the recent warnings that Germany’s naval power is shrinking.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the German Bundestag’s defence commissioner, confirmed that the navy was “going out the capable ships”.
Bartels said the problem grew larger over time, as old ships were taken out of service but no replacement ships were provided.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class could be removed from the Navy.
National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
In a property in the Scottish Highlands, new research is being carried out to show how bats use the landscape in the search for food.
It is hoped that the results will provide further insight into the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help to guide future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland, will trace dwarf and mosquito-leather mice as well as the brown longhorn and water-leather mice in Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices are placed at key positions on the property to record the activities of the bats throughout the season.
NHS employees and volunteers will also conduct mobile investigations using portable detectors.
In a noise analysis of all recordings by experts, the frequency of the bat calls is determined and determined which species does what.
A map and a report of the habitat is then created to create a detailed picture of their behavior at the landscape level.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation consultant for the NTS, hopes that the results will show which areas of habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This data will help to determine the benefits of habitat management measures, such as the creation of meadows, and to show how to obtain forest areas for bats and other related species.
The stocks of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom as a whole have declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work, which impacts on sleeping places and leads to loss of living space.
Windmills and lighting can also pose a risk, as can flycatchers and the chemical treatment of building materials or even attacks by domestic cats.
Fledermaus are not really blind.
However, because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echo scan to detect insects and obstacles in their trajectory.
The NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout Scotland, takes the issue of bats very seriously.
It has 10 trained experts who carry out regular inspections, inspections of sleeping places and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization has even set up Scotland’s first and only bat reserve at the Thrave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland’s 10 bat species.
Well-managed David Thompson explains that the property is the ideal habitat for her.
“Here in Threave we have a great area for bats,” he explains.
“We have the old buildings, many old trees and an excellent living space.
But there’s a lot we don’t yet know about bats, so we’re doing these work here and on other goods that will help us learn more about what bats need to feel comfortable.”
He stresses how important it is to exclude the presence of bats first before maintenance work in the goods, as it is possible that the involuntary destruction of a single nesting site could kill up to 400 females and young animals and eradicate the entire population on the spot.
Fledermaus are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or destroy their nesting sites.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the population to help.
She explains: “We still have a lot to learn about bats and in many of our species we don’t know what their populations are like.”
Ronaldo disputes rape charges while his lawyers want to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called allegations of rape against him "fake news" and said people wanted to be "famous" by using his name.
His lawyers are planning to sue the news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The striker of Portugal’s national team and Juventus Turin was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He reportedly paid her $375,000 to buy her silence on the incident, according to The Mirror on Friday.
In an Instagram live video to his 142 million followers, 33-year-old Ronaldo called the reports "fake news" just hours after their release.
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they reported today: Fake News,” said the five-time Ballon d’Or winner into the camera.
“They want to profile themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
You want to be famous with my name, but that’s part of the job.
I’m a happy man and everything is good,” the player added smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue the mirror on charges they have described as "inadmissible reporting of suspicions in the area of privacy."
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player demanded compensation for “moral damages in an amount equal to the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The incident was reported to have occurred in 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's room, where he allegedly raped them anal, according to documents filed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo went on his knees after the alleged incident and she said he was "99 percent a good guy" who was "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had sex, but said it had been consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and was allowed to take photographs of her injuries in a hospital, but later entered into an out-of-court agreement because she was "afraid of retaliation" and worried about being "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old said she is now trying to cancel the deal, as she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of switching from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged incident and switched to the Italian giant Juve in a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal this summer.
Brexit: The UK would ‘forever regret’ the loss of automakers
The UK would “forever regret” if it lost its status as a world-leading carmaker after Brexit, according to Economy Minister Greg Clark.
He went on to say that it was “concerning” that Toyota UK told the BBC that it would stop production at the Burnaston plant at Derby in advance should the UK leave the EU.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker stated that the influence of delays at the border in a no-deal Brexit could lead to the loss of jobs.
The plant in Burnaston, where Toyota’s Auris and Avensis product lines are produced, produced nearly 150,000 vehicles last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I am convinced that in the event of an uncontrolled Brexit, we will experience production stops at our plant at the end of March,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s Managing Director at Burnaston.
Other UK automakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also raised concerns about a tough EU exit without an agreement and its impact on cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, says it will close its mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
According to automakers, the main concerns are related to risks within the supply chain in the event of a hard Brexit.
Toyota’s production facility is operated on a “just-in-time” basis, which means that the parts are delivered every 37 minutes from suppliers from both the UK and the EU to manufacture the cars to order.
Should the UK leave the EU on 29 March without an agreement, there could be disruptions at the borders that could lead to delays and bottlenecks in the parts, according to the industry.
It was impossible for Toyota to maintain a stockpile at the plant in Derbyshire that was sufficient for more than a day, the company said, which is why production had to be stopped.
Clark said Theresa May’s Chequers plan on the future relationship with the EU was “exactly designed to avoid such checks at the border.”
“We want the best deal that will allow us, as I said, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to seize this opportunity,” he said in BBC Radio 4’s Today.
“The findings not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers show that we need to be able to continue the very successful supply chains so far.”
Toyota could not specify how long production would have to be interrupted, but warned in the long run that additional costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is the highest official of the Unite union at work, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “My experience is that these jobs never come back once they’re gone.
A government spokesman said: “We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump’s planned meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, White House says
Donald Trump’s important meeting with Deputy Justice Secretary Rod Rosenstein could “be postponed for another week” as the dispute over the Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein has overseen the work of Special Investigator Robert Mueller, who investigates the election interferences by Russia, links between Trump’s advisers and Russia, as well as a possible impediment to justice by the president.
The question of whether Trump would fire the deputy justice minister and thereby endanger Mueller’s independence has been the subject of rumors in Washington for a month.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein sought the possibility of a covert recording of his talks with Trump and the resignation of the president using the 25th Amendment to the Constitution.
Rosenstein denies the report.
However, he went to the White House last Monday, while new reports of his alleged resignation became known.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at that time at the UN General Assembly in New York, was announced for next Thursday.
Trump said he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid colliding with the hearing before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, in which both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying the full Senate vote.
Trump’s spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about a meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “A date has not yet been set for this, it could be this week, but I can also imagine that it will be postponed by another week, given all the things that are going on with the Supreme Court right now.
But I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some reporters would probably contradict this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference of the White House since September 10.
Moderator Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders stated that the low frequency of press conferences did not lead to a reluctance to the TV reporters' "effect hacking", but admitted: "But I would not deny that they operate effect hacking."
She then claimed that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
The president does more question-and-answer rounds than any president before him," she explained, without providing precise evidence: "We have looked at these numbers."
There will still be press conferences, Sanders said, but be it, “if the press has the opportunity to directly ask questions to the President of the United States, but far better than talking to me.
We try to do this often, and you have seen that we have done this often in recent weeks, and that will take the place of the press conference if you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York, the president may have shown why this is the case when he made a run from the rover and sometimes bizarre performance in front of assembled reporters.
Health Minister Writes to Scottish NHS EU Employees over Brexit Concerns
The Minister of Health is addressing people from outside the EU who work in Scotland’s National Health Service (NHS) to express the country’s gratitude and wish that they remain in the country even after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already declared itself to bear the costs of applications for residence permits for EU citizens working in Scotland's decentralised public service.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer, the exit negotiations between the UK and the EU have continued and decisions are expected this fall.
However, the UK government has also stepped up preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I am aware of what disturbing times this must be for all of you.
That is why I would like to express once again how much I appreciate the contribution of each and every employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and thus benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is full and all your home and we would be very happy if you would stay here."
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie was reportedly underwent emergency surgery after a head injury he sustained in Saturday's 31-27 defeat to the Vanderbilt Commodores.
Rod Reed, the head coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the injury occurred just before the half-time break.
“He came to the sideline and just collapsed there,” Reed said.
Trainers and medical staff supplied Abercrombie with oxygen on the sidelines before putting him on a rack and being transported for further examination.
A Tennessee State spokesperson told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie left the OP at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “no details of the nature or extent of the injury have yet been known” and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a so-called redshirt, plays for Tennessee State in his first season after moving from Illinois.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he recorded a total of 5 tackles, increasing his total number in the season to 18 tackles.
Foreign investors will have to pay higher stamp duty for the purchase of real estate in the UK
Investors from abroad will have to impose a higher stamp duty on the purchase of real estate in the UK in the future. The additional revenues will benefit according to the new plans of the Conservative Party Homeless
This step is intended to curb the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign for young voters
The increase in stamp duty will affect all those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance expects additional revenues of up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year to help homeless people
Theresa May will announce today that foreign investors will have to pay a higher stamp fee if you buy real estate in the UK, with multi-income benefits for homeless people.
This step represents an attempt to curb Jeremy Corbyn’s success among young voters, who promises to provide more affordable housing and target top earners.
The increase in stamp duty will be levied on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK and the additional revenues will be allocated to the government's campaign against homelessness.
The surcharge, which is charged in addition to the current stamp tax and including the increase on second-homes and residential properties left for rent introduced two years ago, could amount to up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects additional revenues of up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year through the step.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built properties in London are bought by investors who are not based in the UK, thus driving prices upwards and making it more difficult for first-time buyers to walk into the real estate business.
Many affluent areas of the country, especially in the capital, became “spirit cities” due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the United Kingdom.
The new strategy follows just a few weeks after Boris Johnson advocated a reduction in stamp duty to allow more young people to own their first home.
He accused construction companies of raising real estate prices by buying up land without using it, and urged Theresa May to give up quotas on affordable housing to end Britain's "shadow of housing."
Opposition leader Corbyn announced a remarkable number of proposals for housing reforms, ranging from a tie in rent prices to a ban on housing for no good reason.
He also wants to grant more powers to city councils when building new apartments.
May said: “Last year, I said that I would dedicate my time as prime minister to the restoration of the British dream, according to which life should be better from generation to generation.
And that means repairing our broken housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who live and work here and want to build a life.
However, it may not be correct that it is as easy for people who do not live in the UK as it is for companies based abroad to buy real estate as it is for hard-working British citizens.
The dream of homelessness has become too distant for too many people, and the dignity of homelessness remains a problem too great."
Jack Ross: ‘My biggest goal is to manage Scotland’
Jack Ross, the head of Sunderland, says his “greatest goal” is to become the manager of the Scottish team at some point.
The 42-year-old Scott enjoys the challenge of bringing a new life to the club from North East England, which is currently in third place in League One and missing three points at the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St. Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League in the final season.
“I wanted to play as a player for my country.
I made it to the bank and that’s it,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportsound.
“But as a child, I have often seen Scotland play in Hampden with my father, and that is something that always draws me back.
However, this option would only come if I were successful in club management.”
Ross' predecessors in the role of Sunderland's manager include Dock Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic stated not to be afraid to step in the footsteps of such established names at such a club after previously rejecting offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
At the moment, my success will be measured by whether I can return the club to the Premier League.
Given the structure and the possibilities in this club, he is undoubtedly part of the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not an easy task to get him there, but I would probably only appreciate my time here as a success if I bring the club back there.”
Ross can present a three-year management career, after a phase as deputy chief executive at Dumbarton and a 15-month career as coach at Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from the relegation to the third league and half St. Mirren from the margin of the relegation to win the championship the following season.
Ross says he now feels more comfortable than ever in his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“That was probably a real divorce,” he recalls when he took responsibility for Alloa.
“I really think management was the right thing for me, more than just playing.
It sounds funny, because I did not get a bad job, I was able to live well of it and experienced some very pleasant high phases.
But playing can be hard.
There are a lot of things that you have to go through every week.
I still do this because of the stress and pressure in my job, but management feels right.
I’ve always wanted to manage, and now I do, and I’ve never felt so comfortable in my skin in my whole life as an adult.”

The perfect time for a glass of beer is Saturday at 5:30 p.m., according to a study
The heatwave in the summer has missed a surge in UK's revenues from crippling pubs, while restaurant chains have come under greater pressure.
Pub and bar companies recorded revenue growth of 2.7 percent in July, but revenues at restaurants declined by 4.8 percent according to statistics.
Peter Martin of CGA, which compiled the figures, said: “Continuous sunshine and England’s longer-than-expected continued participation in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar pattern to the previous June, but in the restaurant’s restaurant there were still sales increases of 2.8 percent.
The 1.8 percent decline recorded by the restaurant industry in June continued to rise in July.
Pubs and bars with a focus on beverages showed by far the best performance, with area-adjusted revenue development rising higher than it did at restaurants.
Pubs with a focus on food also suffered in the sun, but not as drastic as the restaurant operators.
It seems like people just want to go out for a drink.
In the managed pubs and bars, beverage sales increased by 6.6 percent per month, while sales of food fell by three percent."
Paul Newman, analyst for the leisure and hospitality industry at RSM, said: “These results continue the trend that we have been able to observe since the end of April.
The weather and the influence of important social or sporting events remain the biggest factors for revenues in the out-of-home market.
It’s not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle with problems, but revenue cuts of 4.8 percent compared to the previous year will be particularly painful in addition to the ongoing cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for operators of food-focused companies, and it remains to be seen whether the more moderate temperatures in August will provide the urgently needed respite."
Revenue growth overall for pubs and restaurants, including the reopenings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the decline in brand rollouts.

One in Five Children Own Secret Social Media Accounts They Hide From Their Parents
One study shows that one in five children, some just 11 years old, has secret social media accounts that keep them secret from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 students at secondary schools has found an increase in so-called “fake Insta” pages
The message fires fears that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of students said they had a “main account” to show it to their parents.
One in five children, some just 11 years old, create social media accounts that can keep it secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 students at secondary schools showed a rapid increase in so-called “fake Insta” accounts, a reference to the photo-sharing website Instagram.
The message fuels fears that sexual content is being shared.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a clean “main account” that they could show their parents, but they also had private accounts.
A mother who stumbled upon the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who urged the other to “rape me.”
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-olds had two profiles, with half admitting to owning private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, chairman of HMC, said: “It’s disturbing that so many teenagers are being seduced into creating online rooms where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle to become ‘Stimme of Athletes’ in Scottish Sports Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected as a non-executive member on the board of the Scottish Athletics Roofing Association Scottish Athletics at its annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland’s most frequently awarded athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described the choice as a great opportunity for sports officials to benefit from their extensive international experience over the past decade.
“Eilidh is respected in the Scottish, UK and world athletics community and we are confident that the athletics industry in Scotland would benefit greatly from their choice in the council,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I look forward to acting as the voice of the athletes and hope that I can make a real contribution and lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the distance over 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, calls a total of four Olympic gold medals his own, and now often appears as a BBC expert, was unable to run after a pre-existing bleeding disorder.
He wrote on Twitter: “One month ago, I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk anymore.
Doctors say no one can tell if or how far I will be healed.
It was hard work, but I completely recovered, learned to run again and do mobility exercises today!
Thank you very much for the encouraging news!”
An advertisement for milk pumps that compares mothers to cows is causing excitement on the web
A manufacturer of milk pumps provided excitement on the net with an advertising clip in which nursing mothers are compared to breastfeeding cows.
For the launch of the world’s first low-noise wearable milk pump, the manufacturer of consumer technology Elvie has released a not-so-serious music video to highlight the freedom that the pump gives nursing mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a hay-filled barn with cows in the background to a song that contains lyrics such as: “Yes, I milk myself, but you don’t see a tail on me” or “if you haven’t noticed, these are not euters but my breasts.”
The chorus continues: “Pump it out, pump it out, I feed the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies.”
However, the advertisement, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, has sparked controversy on the web.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video came across mixed reactions from viewers, many of whom say it is harmless to the dairy industry’s “horrors.”
“It was a very bad decision to promote this product with cows.
“Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to a calf to produce milk, with the difference that their boys will be taken away from them within a few days of giving birth.”
Elvie's milk pump fits discreetly into a still bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment read: “Fully traumatic for mother and baby.
But hey, why don't we use them to promote a milk pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Another person added: “Such an unrealistic advertising.”
Others defended the advertisement and one woman admitted that she found the song "urkomic".
“I think that’s a brilliant idea.
I would have bought one if I was still still.
When I was pumping, I felt like a cow.
The clip is a little crazy, but I’m not trying to overinterpret it.
It’s a great product,” one person wrote.
Another person commented: “This is a funny advertisement aimed at mothers who use milk pumps (often at work or on toilets) and feel like ‘cows’.
This is not advertising for or against the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the group reveals to women that they all danced with the discrete pumps in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the realization that many women who use milk pumps indicate they feel like dairy cows.
However, Elvie’s pump is completely silent, has no wires or hoses and discreetly fits into a breastfeeding bra, giving women the freedom to move around, hold their babies or even walk out during the pumping procedure.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, said: “Elvie’s pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative market introduction.
By comparing breastfeeding mothers with dairy cows, we wanted to focus on milk pumps and all the challenges that come with milk pumps and at the same time to present in an entertaining and understandable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump allows.
This is not the first time Elvie’s pump has hit the headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, designer Marta Jakubowski appeared a double mother on the catwalk while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children were quietly brought to a tent town on the Texas border
The number of interned migrant children is as high as never before, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively the same, including as the Trump administration’s intensified rhetoric and measures have made it harder to accommodate children with caregivers.
Traditionally, most caregivers themselves were illegal immigrants and are now afraid to become the target of an expulsion when they register to take in a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential carers and other adult members of their households would have to make their fingerprints and share this data with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Office, told Congress that the authority had arrested dozens of people who had applied for the care of unaccompanied minors.
The authorities later confirmed that 70 percent of the detainees did not have previous records in the criminal register.
“Nearly 80 percent of the people who are either self-employed or a member of a caregiver’s household remain illegal in the country, and a large proportion of them are criminal aliens.
That’s why we will continue to pursue these people,” Albence said.
In order to be able to process children’s cases more quickly, officials introduced new rules, which, according to accommodation employees, require some children to appear in court within a month rather than 60 days after detention, which was previously the standard.
Many will appear on video and not in person to appear before an immigration judge for their legal status.
In case of negative decisions, the person is quickly deferred.
The longer these children stay in custody, the more likely it is, according to the accommodation staff as well as reports that have become known from the system in the last month, that they become anxious and depressed, which can lead to violent eruptions or eruption attempts.
Defenders say that these concerns are amplified with a larger facility like Tornillo, as there are signs that a child has problems because of the size will be more easily overlooked.
They also explained that it could intensify traumas that many of the children are already suffering from if they are taken to a tent town without emotional preparation or enough time to say goodbye to friends.
Syria calls on U.S., French and Turkish ‘occupation forces’ to withdraw immediately
In a speech before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country’s civil war is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said that the foreign forces are illegally on Syrian soil on the pretext of the fight against terrorism and are being “treated accordingly.”
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died and millions more have been expelled from their homes since 2011.
He said Damascus “will continue to fight this holy battle until all Syrian territories are cleared of terrorist groups as well as any illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has stationed some 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are deployed against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 ground troops in the war-torn country.
Regarding the refugees, Moualem stated that the conditions for their return were given and accused “some Western countries” of spreading “irrational fears” that prevented refugees from going home.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to allow them to return home,” he said.
“They are politicizing a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union warned that no building aid would be granted to Syria as long as there is no political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on a buffer zone in the last large rebel-held city of Idlib represents an opportunity to advance political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey reversed a broad-based offensive by Russia-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had “clear deadlines” and expressed his hope that military measures against jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-allied Nusra Front, would be “delivered.”
U.N. Representative Staffan de Mistura hopes to be able to convene the first meeting of a new committee that consists of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem called on the conditions of the Syrian government to participate in the committee and stated that its work should be limited to “the revision of the articles of the current constitution” and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win his re-election
With this logic, Trump would win his re-election in 2020, should not, as many liberal viewers are likely to hope, end his presidency prematurely with a resignation or a scandal.
This would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic finale of a presidency of all time.”
So far, there are no indications that the audience is tired.
Since 2014, CNN’s best-run broadcasting rate has more than doubled to 1.05 million and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News reaches an average of 2.4 million viewers at its best broadcast time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago. MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" led the turn-on quotas with up to 3.5 million viewers on evenings with important news.
“It’s like a fire that magically attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Bear, showrunner of the drama series Designed Survivor, which aired on ABC, about a cabinet member who becomes president after an attack on the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has a different theory.
She recalls a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Trump.
She asked him why.
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh,’” Scovell told me.
Chaos is entertaining.
Of course, the stories from Washington, in contrast to everything that is on television, can determine the future of the principle decision on abortions Roe v. Wade, the possible reunification of families and the health of the global economy.
Switching off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond being an informed citizen, if one becomes aware of having already watched six hours of a round of experts, about the use of sources from the so-called “Deep Background” by Bob Woodward for his book “Fear”, Paul Manafort’s “Affair” by Störtzuer, and “Affair” by “Affair” by Paul Manafort.
I will never be able to see Super Mario again with the same eyes.
“Part of what he does makes it feel like a reality show that he presents to anyone every night,” says Brent Montgomery, chief executive officer of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the series “The Three of the Penguins”, about Trump’s rotating cast and daily action thrillers.
You can’t afford to miss a sequel, otherwise you won’t come along anymore.
When I reached meat this week, it was sunny 27 degrees in front of his house on the northern coast of the Hawaiian island of Kauai, but he crammed inside and watched MSNBC while simultaneously recording CNN.
He simply couldn’t get rid of the screen, not when Justice candidate Brett Kavanaugh was just about to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Supreme Court’s future was at stake.
“I remember when we made all these crazy missions and people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was kind of a joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Donation money flutters the narrowest races around seats in Congress in the midterm elections
It’s not surprising that Pennsylvania’s 17th constituency is flooded with donations, thanks to the newly drawn boundaries of the constituencies that led to two office holders standing in the race around the same seat.
The newly-drawn suburban district in Pittsburgh is joining Democrat Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb opposes another official, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th District of Pennsylvania, which is heavily overlapping with the new 17th District.
The maps were re-drawn after the Pennsylvania State Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts violated the Constitution and were manipulated in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district triggered an exchange of campaign funding between the party's major financial weapons, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb was announced in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a well-respected special election in March around the state's 18th constituency.
This seat was held by a Republican for over a decade, and Trump won by 20 percentage points.
Polite experts concede to the Democrats a light leadership.
The U.S. examined the punishment of El Salvador for its support for China, but then returned
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing without encountering much resistance from Washington.
Trump held a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Valero in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until the Trump Organization’s management team partnered out.
Officials of the U.S. State Department have decided to withdraw the heads of all U.S. foreign missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to “the recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan”, says Heather Nauert, spokeswoman for the ministry.
However, only in the case of El Salvador, criminal measures were considered, which received an estimated $140 million in US aid in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic aid.
The proposed criminal measures, including cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which was to follow up on a similar meeting last year and represented a step forward in efforts to deter migrants from heading towards the United States.
In mid-September, however, senior government officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place and effectively ended the consideration of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to speak at the conference set for mid-October to signal the importance the government is giving to the assembly, according to diplomats.
The three U.S. diplomatic representatives have quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without new harsh announcements or sanctions from Washington.
A government spokesperson for John Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats who, on condition of anonymity, agreed to comment on the internal meetings.
Their statements were confirmed by an external analyst close to the government, who also spoke under the condition of anonymity.
Learn from history
The next big surprise could be Special Investigator Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s possible impediment to justice, for which there is now enough evidence in public.
Mueller is now allegedly investigating whether Trump’s campaign team conspired with Russia in its attack on the US election.
Should the Congressional majority change, Trump is confronted with an organ that forces him to account at the very moment when he is preparing to step back in front of the electorate; and possibly a jury.
That’s a lot of ‘ifs’ and I don’t want to say that the case of Donald Trump, or that of his European counterparts, is inevitable.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we have to make decisions that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to wage a coup d'état against Hitler if the West had only resisted him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We have failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of barbarism that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and the unstoppable march of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are facing several such turning points.
What do we do if Trump fires Deputy Justice Secretary Rod Rosenstein, the man who decides the future of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein got into Devil's Kitchen since this newspaper last year reported that he proposed to secretly record the president and speculated about it, rather unsuitable for the office.
Rosenstein denies the New York Times.
“How will we respond if Brett Kavanaugh’s newly ordered FBI investigation is not complete or fair or he is confirmed despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and misrepresentation in office?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that is forcing Trump to account?
If we fail in these tests, we have a long winter ahead of us.
But I don’t think we will fail because of what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same regime that once occupied my embassy home.
She survived, immigrated to America and sent me away 60 years later to ignite Sabbath candles on the table with the hook cross.
How can I not be optimistic about this legacy?”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers optimistic before the game against Vienna
The Rangers received Rapid Wien on Thursday in the knowledge that a win against the Austrians after the impressive draw against Villareal in Spain at the beginning of the month will put them in a good position for the Europa League Group G qualification.
Due to a knee injury, Graham Dorrans could not appear until the 2–2 draw against Villareal, but he believes the Rangers can use this result as a springboard for bigger.
“This was an important point for us, as Villareal is very good,” said the 31-year-old.
We went into the game with the conviction that we can make something out of it and we drove home with a point.
Maybe we could have won in the end, but overall, a draw was probably a fair result.
They probably dominated in the first half, but we got excited in the second half and then were the better team.
Thursday will be another great European evening.
Hopefully we will get three points, but this will be a tough game, as they have achieved a good result in the last game, but I am sure we can go through that with the audience behind us and achieve a positive result.
Last year was definitely difficult, with everything that happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there is a kind of well-being factor.
The team is good and the guys are really good at it; the training is good.
Hopefully we can look ahead now, leave the last season behind and be successful.”
Fear of ageing leads to sleepless nights in women.
Although the survey participants knew exactly how to care for them, only a few spoke to their family members about it.
Approximately half of the participants in the nationwide study reported talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they wanted to talk to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but don’t take the necessary steps to conduct the conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of the life insurance department at Nationwide.
You should start with this.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to take care of you if you don’t express your wishes in time.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how you want to be cared for, as these decisions can be an important factor in determining costs.
Bring your financial advisor on board: Your consultant can also help you find a way to finance these expenses.
Your financial decisions for long-term care can include a traditional care insurance, a hybrid capital-forming life insurance to help cover these costs, or self-insurance with your own assets – as long as you have the money.
Work out your legal documents: Dispute disputes at the last minute.
Set up a precautionary authority so that you commission a trusted person to monitor your medical care and ensure that the health care professionals meet your wishes, should you be unable to express them yourself.
Consider also a power of attorney for your finances.
You choose a trusted person who makes financial decisions for you and ensures that your bills are paid, you should not be able to do so.
Don’t forget the details: Imagine that your older parent has a medical emergency and is on their way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medication intake or allergies?
Write down these details in a written plan so that you are ready.
“It’s not just the financial issues that matter. Who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
“What is the drug treatment?”
Who takes care of the dog?
Have you finished this plan?”
Man in Ilfracombe shot several times with air rifle
A man was shot several times with an air gun when he went home after work with friends.
The victim, a man in his forties, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Officials described the shootings, which occurred around 2:30 p.m. British time, as "voluntary act".
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries were not life-threatening and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a severe earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, adding that the death toll is still expected to rise.
Due to the failed communication systems, aid forces were unable to obtain information from the Donggala Government District, an area north of Palu, which is located closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi Province and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a government district in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi, stretching over a coastline of over 300 km (180 miles) in length.
In the district, an administrative unit below the province, an estimated 299,200 people lived in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of income of the Central Sulawesi economy, especially the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it focuses mainly on Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been victims of earthquakes and tsunamis several times over the past 100 years, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Protection Authority.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
West Donggala was hit by a tsunami in 1996, in which nine people died.
Indonesia lies on the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire, and is regularly visited by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A severe earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami on December 26, which struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people in coastal areas of the Indian Ocean, almost half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes shook the west coast of Sumatra between late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the Nias islands off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of magnitude 6.8 shook southern Java, Indonesia’s most populous island, triggering a tsunami that hit the southern coast and claimed nearly 700 lives.
2009: An earthquake of magnitude 7.6 struck the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake rocked one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 meters in height that destroyed dozens of villages and claimed about 300 lives.
2016: A mild earthquake shook the government district of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people died from collapsed buildings.
2018: Severe earthquakes hit the tourist-popular Indonesian island of Lombok and claimed more than 500 deaths, especially on the north side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded on the island.
Sarah Palin's Son Arrested for Domestic Violence Allegations
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and former candidate for the vice president’s office, has been arrested on charges of bodily harm.
The 29-year-old Palin from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of reporting domestic violence, and resistance to state violence, according to a report published by Alaska Police on Saturday.
According to the police report, he picked up a friend’s phone when she wanted to contact the police.
According to KTUU, Palin is in custody at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and a $500 security deposit has been collected.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he, when asked about his plea, responded with "not guilty, absolutely sure," according to the network.
Palin is accused of committing three Class A misdemeanors, which can be fined up to one year in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B misdemeanour that can be punished with a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently being negotiated in front of the Veteran’s Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of reporting a crime and possession of weapons under the influence of narcotics in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of hitting her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran organizations in 2016 after she attributed her son’s behavior to a post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of his time in Iraq.
Tsunami after earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude quake triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks have been disrupted and it is expected that the number of deaths will increase in the coming days.
The quake occurred just off the coast of Central Sulawesi, which is located northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
On social networks, videos circulate from the time the wave hit the country.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal Prosecutors Call for Rare Death Penalty for Suspects in New York Terror Attack
The New York prosecutor's office is demanding the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the defendant in the New York City terror attack, which cost eight lives, a rare punishment that has not been imposed in the state since 1953 for a federal crime.
The 30-year-old Saipov is accused of using a rented pick-up of the construction chain Home Depot for a terrorist attack, in the course of which he ran on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October, transporting pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "targeted" the eight victims and "deliberately" inflicted serious bodily injuries, according to the statement of intent for the demand for the death penalty filed in the southern district of New York.
Both charges could be punishable by death, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal investigative tribunal Saipov filed a 22-point indictment, which includes eight charges of murder against the background of the organized crime, which are usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, as well as a charge of defamation of the violence.
The attack requires "fundamental planning and intent," according to prosecutors, who described the manner in which Saipov carried out the act as "abhorrent, cruel and corrupt".
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov added to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnocco damage, pain and loss,” said the statement.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
For more than a decade, the southern district of New York has not pursued a case with the aim of demanding the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers and eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in New York for a federal offense was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were convicted two years before the conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union.
Both Rosenbergs were executed with the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, testified in the days and months after the attack of lack of repentance, according to court documents.
He told investigators he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to do so after watching videos of ISIS on his phone, the indictment said.
According to police, he also demanded that the flag of ISIS be hung in his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty in all 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "of course disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
“We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty, rather than pleading guilty in exchange for a life sentence without the possibility of dismissal, will only prolong the trauma that all those involved are suffering,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked the indictment not to demand the death penalty.
A member of the Conservative Party calls for NIGEL FARAGE to transfer the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to mobilize “the power of the people” today during a protest at the Tories conference.
Ukip’s former party chief said politicians “must feel the pressure” of Eurosceptics, while a member of Theresa May’s party suggested that Farage should lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told protesters in Birmingham that the UK would be “already out” if Farage was Brexit minister.
May’s challenge to reconcile her deeply disputed party has been heightened by members of her party, who are for a stay in the EU, participating in a separate demonstration against Brexit that took place in the city.
The prime minister has trouble keeping Chequers’s compromise plan on track despite attacks by Brexit proponents, Brexit opponents and the EU.
Allies insisted that, despite the counter-reactions, they should continue to try to negotiate a deal with Brussels and thus force Eurosceptics and the opposition Labour Party to choose between their package and the “chaos”.
Bone explained at the Leave Means Leave demonstration in Solihull that ‘checkers belong on the trash’.
He suggested that Farage should be appointed as a peer and that he should have been entrusted with the responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was responsible for that, we would be out there already,” he said.
The Wellingborough MP added, “I will stand for Brexit, but Chequers belongs to the trash.”
Emphasizing his opposition to the EU, he said: “We have not fought in world wars to be submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone refuted claims that public opinion has changed since the 2016 referendum: “The idea that the British people have changed their mind and now want to stay in the EU is completely wrong.”
The Brexit proponent of conservative Andrea Jenkyns was also at the demonstration and told reporters: ‘I’m just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The compromise is unpopular in the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular in our own party and with our activists, who actually go through the streets and make sure we are elected.
Please give up Chequers and start listening.”
In a top message to May, she continued: ‘Prime Ministers will keep their jobs if they keep their promises.’
Farage said in a speech that politicians must “feel the pressure” should they be in the process of cheating the 2016 referendum decision.
“This is now a question of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” Farage said.
“They’re trying to cheat Brexit and that’s why we’re here today to tell them, ‘That’s not how you get out of it.’
In front of an enthusiastic crowd, he went on to say, “I want you to let our political class, which is just about to betray Brexit, feel the pressure.
“We are mobilizing the power of the people of this country, which will halve us to victory in the referendum and will never rest until we are an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.”
At the same time, Brexit opponents marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A few activists waved banners of the Tories Against Brexit group, a group of Brexit opponents within May’s party, which was launched over the weekend.
Lord Adonis, the Labour Party’s peer, made fun of the Tories who had security issues with a party app at the opening of the conference.
“These are the people who tell us that they can make sure that the IT systems, like all the technology for Canada Plus Plus, are available for the smooth border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” Adonis said.
“This is a farce.
There is simply no good Brexit,” he added.
Warren Plans to ‘Exactly Examine’ Presidential Candidate
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would “examine the presidential nomination closely” after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about her future at a meeting with voters in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, an outspoken critic of President Donald Trump, is currently running for re-election to the Senate against Massachusetts Republican MP Geoff Diehl, who was vice president of Trump’s campaign team in Massachusetts in 2016.
She was the focal point of speculation that she could challenge Trump in 2020.
The event in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was Trump’s 36th meeting with voters in the so-called Town Hall format since his inauguration.
One of the people present asked her if she wanted to run for president.
Warren responded that it would be time for women to “go to Washington and repair our broken government and that includes women at the top.”
Arrest after shootings on LSU players Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that a suspect in the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims was arrested on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced at a press conference that it had arrested 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11 a.m. Eastern Time.
They had released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help in identifying the man to be seen on the footage.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot on Friday morning near the campus of Southern University.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and died as a result of this injury," Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, according to the sports media portal 247sports.
Wayde wanted to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to having been at the scene and possession of a weapon and shooting at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without further incident and arrested at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The two-metre-long Sims grew up in Baton Rouge and played in 32 games with 10 starters in the last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the World Championship after his team gave him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas landed in the qualifying against Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that Stallorder from Mercedes would play a big role in the race.
From the pole position Bottas made a good start and it was almost like he led Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammates.
Vettel first went into the box and got Hamilton into traffic at the end of the field, a decision that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes later went into the box and landed behind Vettel, but Hamilton overtook him after a bare wheel-on-wheel maneuver in which the Ferrari driver reluctantly released the inside, with the risk of holding out after two moves to defend the third curve.
Max Verstappen started on one of the backs of the field and placed seventh on his 21st birthday after the end of the first round.
He was then the fastest for most of the race, as he held on to his tires to finish fast and overtake Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He eventually went into the box in the 44th round and failed to take a step in the remaining eight rounds, while Raikkonen finished fourth.
It was a difficult day, as Valtteri had a great performance all weekend and acted like a real gentleman when he was supposed to pass me by.
The team has done an excellent job to achieve a double win," Hamilton said.
A Case of Really Bad Body Language
President Donald Trump made fun of himself at an election campaign event on Saturday about Senator Dianne Feinstein, which insisted that Christine Blasey Ford’s letter, in which she accused the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse, was not passed on to the press.
At the event in West Virginia, President Ford did not address the statement directly before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that the events in the Senate show that people are “common, evil and dishonest.”
“One thing that could happen, and the wonderful thing that has happened in the Senate in the last few days, is when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and common and evil and dishonest,” he said.
“If you look at the leaks and then say, ‘Oh, that wasn’t me.
It wasn't me."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, were you responsible for the leak?
Think of your answer... Publish the document - “Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't publish it."
Okay, just a moment, please.
“No, we didn’t publish it,” he added, imitating the senator’s voice.
Feinstein played the letter with Ford's accusations against Kavanaugh in July and it was published in early September, but Feinstein argues that the leak came from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t publish your story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep the letter a secret and I responded to her request for secrecy.”
Her dementia did not seem to come well with the president, who said on Saturday night at the campaign event: “I’ll tell you one thing, that was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but that was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
In his continuous defense of the judge-candidate, who is accused of sexual assault by three women, he claimed that the Democrats would use the accusations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to reclaim power by all means.
You see the community, the evil, they don’t care who they hurt when they get under the wheels to gain power and control,” the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made the Elite League defeat on Friday against the Belfast Giants by a 5:3 win in the Dundee rematch on Saturday.
The Giants led early with two goals, after hits by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the balance for the home team before Dwyer regained the lead of the Giants.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory with two goals.
This was for the men of Adam Keefe, who unexpectedly beat Dundee on Friday night 2-1 in Belfast, the third defeat in the Elite League in the season.
This was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the Giant winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute after 3:35 minutes after a performance by Kendall McFaull. Four minutes later, David Rutherford delivered the lead as Beauvillier expanded the lead.
In this exciting opening phase, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game after 13:10 minutes, before Matt Marquardt Cownie halved to his home goal after 15:16 minutes.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead before the halftime break when he scored his second goal of the evening just before the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard again equalled with a power play hit in the 28th minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game late in the second half, then Nielsen secured his team's victory with a fifth goal after barely half of the second half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play at home next Friday at Milton Keynes Stadium.
Flightless man dies after he was sure that hundreds of people in a plane escaped the earthquake
A plane crash in Indonesia is celebrated as a hero after he found the death to get a plane with hundreds of people on board safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after the island of Sulawesi was shaken by a devastating earthquake on Friday that triggered a tsunami.
Severe aftershocks are still visible in the region and many people are trapped under rubble in the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the highly swinging control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed to make sure that flight 6321 from Batik Air, which was on the runway at the time, could safely take off.
He jumped out of the tower when he thought he was crashing.
Agung later died in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Indonesia’s aviation security service, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australia’s ABC News.
“We have provided a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to bring it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter could land in Palu.
We are deeply concerned about this message," he added.
At the same time, authorities fear that the death toll could rise to several thousand, the country’s disaster protection authority said that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The number is expected to continue to rise, as many bodies are still under the rubble, while others cannot be reached,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves up to 6 meters high have devastated Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring auxiliary and supply goods.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute a new ambulance comes with the dead.
Clean drinking water is scarce.
Supermarkets are being looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
It’s already a tragedy, but it could be much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said in a speech before the country’s military: “I ask you to work every day and night to complete all the tasks associated with the evacuation.
How long have you been ready?" he told CNN.
Indonesia has already been hit by earthquakes in Lombok this year, in which more than 550 people have died.
Air Niugini reports missing after plane crash in lagoon in Micronesia
The airline, which carried out the flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now reports a missing person after initially claiming that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that they could not say anything about a passenger's stay until Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it would work with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew members after the plane crashed into the water when it attempted to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, but were in stable condition.
The cause and exact course of the accident remained unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both stated that the plane landed in the lagoon just before the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane was floating over the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane hit very flat.
“That’s a very good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes explained that he and others were able to wade to the emergency exits on the sides of the sinking plane through deep hip water.
He said the flight attendants panicked and shouted and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy stated that matrons working nearby to improve a landing site rushed to help with an inflatable boat to bring people to the coast before the plane sank into about 30 meters (100 ft) of deep water.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people were killed in crashes of Papua New Guinea-registered airlines, but none of them were affected by Air Niugini.
Analyst reconstructs the course of the night in which a woman was burned alive
The indictment ended its trial on Saturday in retrial of a case that accused a man of banning a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett said for hours as an expert in the field of information evaluation.
He explained to the jury how he reconstructed the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on her death night.
Rowlett said he had received location data from various phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the night of her death, contradicting his previous statements, according to the Clarion Ledger newspaper.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers during the time he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford stepped into the witness stand on Saturday and said he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis had told the truth when he claimed to have been in Sanford's pick-up that night, Sandford said he had lied "when my pick-up was in Nashville."
Another objection was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for two weeks at the time of her death.
Cell phone records, however, indicated that they had known each other for a week.
Rowlett stated that some time after Chamber's death, Tellis released their messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
“He has taken them out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense is expected to begin its pleas on Sunday.
The judge assumes that the proceedings will go before the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What Is Hip Hop Conscious?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling its music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol claim that Hip Hop has moved away from its roots of political message and social engagement.
They want to go back to its roots and make socially conscious hip hop again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently experienced a renaissance in the UK by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
New York babysitter sues couple for dismissal after "racist" text message
A New York babysitter sues a couple over a discriminatory dismissal after she received a misguided message from her mother complaining that she was “another black.”
The couple disputed being racist and compared the litigation to a “expression”.
Two-time mother Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed her dismay when she found out that the new day mother, Giselle Maurice, was black when she began her first day of work in 2016.
“NEEEEEEEEEIN, NOT A BLACK,” Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
Instead of sending this to her husband, she sent the message to Maurice.
After realizing her fauxpas, the "shameful" Plasco-Flaxman released Maurice and claimed that the open-minded African-American day mother had done poor work and instead expected her to be a Filipino, the New York Post said.
Maurice was paid for her working day and then sent home with an Uber.
Now, Maurice sues the couple for compensation for the dismissal and claims a claim for compensation for the $350 per day that she should have spent over six months for the job she was originally booked for, but without a contract, and for which she had been used to with the couple.
“I want to show them, look, that’s not what you do,” she told the newspaper on Friday, “I know that’s discrimination.”
The couple rejected the racism allegations, arguing that dismissing the move was a reasonable step, as they feared Maurice, after insulting her, could no longer be trusted.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She is not a racist.
We are not racists,” husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But would you entrust your children to a person who was rude to them, even if it was accidentally?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Plasco compared the litigation to a “extortion” and stated that his wife was expecting a baby in just two months and was “in a difficult situation”.
“Do you want to be interested in such a person?
That's not very nice," the investment banker added.
As the litigation continued, the couple were quickly condemned in public and posted on social media, where they were criticized for their behavior and logic.
Paddington's publishers feared readers wouldn't identify with a talking bear, reveals a new letter
Karen Jankel, daughter of author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in someone who reads it for the first time before it was published.
Today it’s very funny with our knowledge of Paddington’s huge success.”
She said her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired by a small toy bear to write the children's book, had no problem with it, his work had been rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of the publication was "after his death last year."
She explained that her father was secretly proud of Paddington's success, which she described as "a very important family member."
“He was a very quiet man and did not boast,” said Jankel.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a kid who does something special: you’re proud, even if it wasn’t really your own performance.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Although he invented and created him, he always gave Paddington himself the responsibility for his success."
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye to her over the phone
After the landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“Nad called regularly to say that it looked really bad and that doctors gave her little chance,” said Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I got a call from Nad, in which he told me that she would die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And that's what I did.
I said to her, “Tashi, I love you so much, my dear.”
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications the doctors gave her to keep her heart pumping slowly sounded off and left her body.
She had just died and this was the moment when everything went down.
I could do nothing but wait while I knew what was going on.
I couldn’t scream or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and other people.
I really had to tear myself apart.”
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the loss of her daughter, along with the other passengers, who did not get any of what they were going through, went aboard the plane.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
I had lowered my head and tears ran over my cheeks all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt this overwhelming sense of sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and my understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Sad Women Hang Cards to Prevent Suicide on Bridges
Two women, who have lost relatives by suicide, try to keep others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelley Humphreys hung up on a bridge in Wales maps with inspiring messages and phone numbers for counseling agencies.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old when he began suffering from depression and was just 18 years old when he committed suicide.
“I don’t want parents to feel the way I feel every day,” she said.
The 45-year-old Davis, who lives in Lydney, explained that her son had a promising career as a cook and he had a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
Everyone said that his smile could brighten a room.”
However, he announced his job before his death, as he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler's body was found after the suicide of his then 11-year-old brother.
Davis said, “I’ve always been afraid that this could have an impact.”
Davis designed the cards to “show people that there are people you can go to and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Don’t be silent: you have to talk about it.”
Humphreys, who has been friends with Davies for years, lost her partner Mark, with whom she had been together for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he felt down or depressed,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas Day, he was at the lowest point, and when the children unpacked their presents, he didn't look them in the eye or anything."
She said his death was a great trauma for her, but that they had to go through it: “There’s a huge hole in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we all have to go on and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's Future in the Flood as FBI Begins Investigations
“I thought if we could actually get something like this he was asking about, that is, a time-limited and limited investigation, then maybe we could get a bit of an intrusion,” Flake said on Saturday, fearing that the committee would “break apart” in the party-political stalemate.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their reluctance can only be attributed to the timing.
The midterm elections on November 6 are only five weeks away, and if the Republicans cut short as expected, they would be significantly weakened in their attempts to elect their husband to the country's highest court.
George W. Bush took the caller to call senators and convince them to support Kavanaugh, who had worked for Bush in the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
There is a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can unite at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to decide on equality of vote, and to confirm him for the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of survivors 'sinks' under Kim
The number of North Korean overrunners to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean politician.
Park Byeong-seug, based on data from the South Korean Ministry of Reunification, said that last year 1,127 overrunners were recorded, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park called stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher prices of human smugglers as the main factors.
Pyongyang did not publicly comment on this.
The vast majority of surrogates from the north will eventually be offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally.
Most flee over China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean states.
China considers the perpetrators more like illegal immigrants than refugees and often repatriates them with violence.
Relations between the North and the South, which are technically still in a state of war, have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the two heads of state met in Pyongyang to discuss the cease-fire denuclearization negotiations.
This came as a result of the historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, at which they generally agreed to work on a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress.
“Without being able to trust the United States, we have no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to disarm ourselves unilaterally first,” Ri said in a speech before the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and says he’s not fit for the Supreme Court office
The minority leader in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called Justice candidate Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and said he was inherently unsuitable for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t resist the impression that a woman who acted like this would have been called ‘hysterical’,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied any allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes he screamed almost and stood out in tears shortly before talking about his family and his high school time.
He also explicitly denounced the Democrats on the committee and called the charges against him a “great and coordinated infamous murder” organized by Liberals who were angry about Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh’s statement proves he can’t serve at the Supreme Court because it shows he is biased towards Democrats.
“I believe that with these statements and the way he came across the Clintons and the Democrats, he even declared himself unsuitable,” she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to remove Kavanaugh from office, should he be confirmed and the Democrats should win the majority in the House of Representatives.
“I will say so much: if he doesn’t tell Congress or the FBI the truth, then he’s not only unsuitable for the Supreme Court, but also for his current office as a judge,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Federal Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi went on to say that as a Democrat, she is concerned about Kavanaugh’s possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the abortion basic decision Roe v. Wade, as he is judged to be a conservative judge.
In his hearings, Kavanaugh questioned whether he would revise certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"We don't need a hysterical, biased person who goes to this court and expects us to say, 'Oh, that's not wonderful,'" Pelosi said.
Women need to use it as a weapon.
It’s a sincere hate speech, months and years of overcooking anger and she doesn’t get it out without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s rare, and you?”
She went on to say, “I was helped a lot by a woman who was a manager somewhere and said that she also cried when she got angry, but she developed a technique. If she gets angry and starts crying, say to the person she spoke to, ‘You might think I’m sad because I’m sorry.
I'm angry."
And then just keep talking.
I found it brilliant."
Tears are allowed as a valve for anger, in part because they are completely misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories is of a former job, in a male-dominated office, where one day I was crying because of an indescribable anger and being pulled into a stairwell by an older woman, an under-cooled manager I was always a little afraid of.
“Never let her see you cry,” she told me.
“They don’t know you’re stinky.
They think you’re sad and will be satisfied with themselves because they believe you’ve gone to the substance.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential nominations.
In 1987, when Hart was caught aboard a ship called Monkey Business in an extramarital affair and then withdrew his candidacy, the deeply frustrated Schroeder considered that there was no reason not to even consider the idea of the presidential candidacy.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she told me with a laugh 30 years later.
There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the situation “Snowwitch and the Seven Dwarves.”
Since the election campaign had already advanced, she was behind the fundraiser and vowed not to run if she didn’t get $2 million.
It was a hopeless fight.
She found that some of her supporters, who donated $1,000 to men, supported her campaign with only $250.
“Do they think I’m getting a discount?” she asked.
In the speech in which she announced that she would not launch an official campaign, she was so moved by her emotions, gratitude for her supporters, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise funds and address the voters instead of the delegates, as well as to stand up to the anger over sexism, she said.
“You could have assumed that I was suffering from a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalls the press reactions.
“You could have believed that the pocket cloth maker Kleenex was my sponsor.
I still remember asking myself what they would write on my gravestone.
"Did you cry?"
Why Beijing Could Benefit from the U.S.-China Trade War
The opening salves of the trade war between the U.S. and China were deafening. Although the battle is not long over, Beijing could benefit from a long-term trench between the countries, my experts say.
Donald Trump, the US president, fired the first warning shot earlier this year when he imposed fines on important Chinese export goods, including solar cells, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation this week took place with new penalties on goods worth $200 billion, effectively affecting half of all goods imported from China to the United States.
Beijing hit back in the same way every time and recently raised fines of five to ten percent on US goods worth $60 billion.
China vowed to respond to any U.S. measure and it is unlikely that the world’s second-largest economic power will soon stumble.
To move Washington to enlist would mean to give up, but a public outcry towards the United States would be far too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Yet experts believe that if Beijing plays its cards well, China can benefit from the long-term effects of the trade war by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for economic turmoil in both countries is actually far more dangerous than many observers have previously recognized,” said Abigail Grace, a researcher who worked at the think-tank Asik Center for New Security.
Syria 'ready' to return refugees, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help in rebuilding the country devastated by the more than seven years of war.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem stated that the situation in the country is improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government is rebuilding the areas destroyed by terrorists to bring about normality.
All conditions were now given for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that had their daily lives and livelihoods as their goal.
The UN estimates that over 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government welcomed aid in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he stressed that it would not accept conditional aid from countries that had supported the insurgency.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europa won the 2018 Ryder Cup and defeated Team USA with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National near Paris.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown after the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points it took to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had problems over much of the tournament, dropped his kick on the 16th track (par 3) in the water and lost to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari was able to shine in all his rounds and became one of 4 players who scored a 5-0-0 since the tournament started in its current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was beaten 5:4 by the player with the lowest ranking in the team Europa, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The player with the world's best ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 to 1 against the Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
Spaniard Sergio Garcia, a veteran of eight Ryder Cups, became the best European Ryder Cup player of all time with 25.5 career points.
“Normally I don’t cry, but today I couldn’t hold back.
It was a difficult year.
I am so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I’m so happy to win back the cup.
It’s about the team and I’m happy to have made a contribution,” Garcia said after the European victory.
He extends the torch to his countryman John Rahm, who won the singles against American golf legend Tiger Woods on Sunday 2–1.
“I’m so incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods that I’ve been watching on TV since I was a kid,” the 23-year-old said.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and now has a Ryder Cup balance of 13-21-3.
A strange statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 important titles and is only surpassed by Jack Nicklaus.
The USA team had trouble finding the Fairways all weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have played high-profile performances throughout the tournament.
American captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance by his team: “I’m proud of the guys they fought.
There was a time this morning when we put pressure on Europe.
We didn't make anything out of it.
Take a hat off for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players performed well.
We will regroup, I will talk to the PGA America and our Ryder Cup committee and we will look forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to pull the hat.
We were defeated.”
