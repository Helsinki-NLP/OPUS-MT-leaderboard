Members of the Welsh National Assembly fear they will be called muppets
Some members of the National Assembly were dismayed, as a result of a proposal to change their title to Members of the Welsh Parliament (MWP).
The idea arose in connection with plans to change the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly from all sides of the political scene are concerned that they may become the subject of sputna.
One Labour MP expressed concerns about his group, saying the new name rhymes with the Welsh words "twp" and "pwp".
For readers outside of Wales: in Welsh the word “twp” means stupid, and the word “pwp” means departures.
One of the politicians of the Plaid Cymru party stated that his group is "dissatisfied" with the proposal and presented other solutions.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his party was "open" to change the name, but noted that the word "MWP" is very similar to the word "muppet".
In this case, the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similarly to the letter "u" in the English dialect of Yorkshire.
The committee working within the Assembly, which is currently working on a draft law amending the name, took the following position: "The final decision on the future title of the members of the Assembly will naturally belong to them".
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 gave the Welsh National Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the committee published the results of the public consultations on the proposal. The change of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament gained wide support.
In addition, the committee supported the proposal to change the title of the members of the assembly to "Member of the Welsh Parliament", or WMP in English, although the abbreviation "MWP" enjoyed the greatest popularity among society.
Members of the Assembly are proposing alternative solutions. Difficulty in reaching consensus is a pain for Elin Jones, the Speaker of the Assembly, who is expected to present the bill in the coming weeks.
The reform law will also take into account other changes in the way the assembly works, including the principle of dismissal of members and the structure of the committee system.
The members of the National Assembly will be able to vote on their future title when discussing the law.
Macedonians Vote in Referendum on Changing the Name of the Country
On Sunday, voters will decide whether their country will soon bear the name of the Republic of North Macedonia.
The general vote is intended to help end the decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, in which there is a region called Macedonia.
The government in Athens has long claimed that the name of their northern neighbor is a territorial claim, and has repeatedly opposed attempts to join the European Union and NATO.
<0xC7><0xB4>orge Ivanov, the President of Macedonia and opponent of the referendum on the change of name, said he would disapprove of the results of the vote.
However, supporters of the plebiscite, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaew, maintain that the change is necessary to allow the country to join the European Union and NATO.
St. Martin's Church in New York is ringing a bell over problems affecting churches in Harlem
“The older people I’m talking to say that once upon a time you could find a bar and a church on every corner,” said Michael Henry Adams.
"There's no sign of them at the moment."
As he says, the disappearance of bars is understandable.
“Currently, people share socially in a different way,” he noted.
“Bars have ceased to be the site of regular meetings of community members.”
In the case of the churches, however, he is concerned that the funds from the sale of property will not be enough for as long as the decision-makers believe, and that “before or after they will be at the point of departure”.
He added that the churches could be replaced by apartment buildings inhabited by people who would not support the other nearby temples.
As he said, “The overwhelming majority of people buying apartments in such buildings will be of the white race. This will speed up the total closure of churches, because it is unlikely that new residents will become members of these parishes.”
Both churches were built by an assembly of white faithful even before Harlem joined the metropolitan community in 1870 (St. Martin's church joined the community a decade later).
The original assembly of white Methodists left the district in the 1930s of the last century.
The surrounding assembly of African-Americans then took ownership of the building.
St. Martin's Church was taken over by an assembly led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott against vendors from 125th Street (Harlem's main shopping street), opposing the employment or promotion of African Americans.
The 1939 fire damaged the building considerably, but John Howard Johnson's parishioner made plans to rebuild the temple and ordered the construction of a bell system.
Noble David Johnson, the son of John Howard Johnson and his successor in St. Martin's Church, proudly called the new carillon "the bells of the poor".
The expert, who called the bells in July, described them in a different way, as "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noticed that it was the first carillon in the world to be served by black music. The artist was Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to Riverside Church 18 years ago, where he was waiting for him.
Malcolm J. Merriweather said that the Church of St. Martin did not replace him.
In recent months, there have been a number of complicated events in St. Martin’s Church involving architects and performers, some of which have been brought in by lay leaders of the church, and some by the diocese of the Episcopal Church.
In July, the parish council (the governing body of the parish composed of secular leaders) addressed its concerns to the diocese, stating that "it wants to pass the costs to the council", although the council did not take part in the employment of architects and contractors.
Some parishioners also complain of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark Injured 13-Year-Old Scuba Diving in California
Authorities reported that on Saturday, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old scuba diving in search of lobsters in California. The incident occurred on the first day of the lobster season.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in the American city of Encinitas.
Chad Hammel reported on KSWB-TV in San Diego that on Saturday morning he was diving with his friends for about half an hour when he heard a cry for help. Immediately with a group of friends they floated to the boy to help get him out of the water.
As Hammel said, at first it seemed to him that the boy was excited about catching a lobster, but he soon realized that the baby was screaming: “I was biting!
I've been bitten!"
After arriving at the scene, Chad Hammel noticed that the boy had completely ripped skin around the elbow.
“I started yelling at everyone to get out of the water, ‘There are sharks in the water!’” Hammel added.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the Children's Council Hospital in San Diego, and his condition was critical.
The species of shark responsible for the attack remains unknown.
During a press conference, rescue captain Larry Giles said the fish had been spotted a few weeks earlier, but it was not considered to be a species of dangerous sharks.
Larry Giles added that the victim suffered serious injuries to the upper thigh.
In order to carry out the investigation and for security reasons, the authorities closed the entrance to the beach for 48 hours from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami Beach in Ecinitas.
Larry Giles noted that the area is home to more than 135 species of sharks, although most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's Shops Network Plans to Expand Business in UK Cosmetics Market
Sainsbury’s network throws a glove at stores such as Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, introducing its supermarkets with style-referring cosmetic departments to department stores, as well as specially trained retailers.
As part of a significant investment in the British cosmetics market – which is worth <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion and is constantly developing despite the declines in the fashion industry and household items – in 11 stores belonging to the network will have more shelves with cosmetic products at the end of the year.
The return to the cosmetics industry stems from the search for ways to manage the space previously occupied by televisions, microwaves and household items.
According to Sainsbury's, the network will double the number of cosmetic products and will offer up to 3,000 items. In the assortment will appear for the first time goods such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman or Dr. PawPaw.
Currently sold items by L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees brands will also receive more space and separate areas close to those known even from Boots stores.
In addition, a chain of supermarkets plans to refresh their offer of Boutique makeup products. From now on, most items will be vegan-friendly, which is increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In addition, fragrance retailer Fragrance Shop will create test points at two Sainsbury's supermarkets. The first opened last week in Croydon, in southern London, and the second in Selly Oak, in Birmingham, later in the year.
The prevalence of online sales and daily shopping for small amounts of food in local stores makes supermarkets need to encourage more customers to visit.
Mike Coupe, president of Sainsbury’s, said points of sale will increasingly resemble department stores as the network tries to fight off discounts such as Aldi or Lidl, offering more services and products other than food.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos network points in hundreds of stores and has introduced a number of Habitat network points since taking over both companies two years ago. According to the company, this contributes to increased food sales and increased return on investment.
The previous attempt to reorganize the departments with cosmetics and pharmaceuticals ended in failure.
At the beginning of the 21st century Sainsbury's created a joint-venture company with Boots for trial. However, the cooperation was terminated following a conflict over the division of revenues from pharmacies operating in supermarkets.
Sainsbury's is launching a new strategy following the sale of 281 pharmacies to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
According to reports, Lloyds will contribute to the plan by introducing an expanded range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four online stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s Commercial Director, said: “We have transformed the look and feel of cosmetics departments to improve customer experience.
We have invested in special training for our co-workers so that they can help consumers with their purchases.
Our brands are able to meet all needs, and the friendly environment and convenient locations allow us to attract the attention of customers looking for cosmetic products, as well as question the current ways of making purchases.”
Peter Jones ‘angry’ after Holly Willoughby withdraws from <0xC2><0xA3>11m contract
Peter Jones, the star of the television show Dragons' Den, was "angry" when he learned that Holly Willoughby was going to retire from the <0xC2><0xA3>11 million lifestyle brand to focus on the newly formed collaboration with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Holly Willoughby has no time for their brand offering accessories and household items under the name Truly.
The activity has been repeatedly compared to the Goop brand owned by Gwyneth Paltrow.
This morning, a 37-year-old presenter announced her resignation via Instagram.
The sudden decision to leave a well-developed lifestyle brand and focus on the newly established collaboration with Marks & Spencer and ITV by Holly Willoughby angered Peter Jones, the star of Dragons' Den.
According to sources, Peter Jones was "angry" when a popular television presenter announced during a nervous Tuesday meeting at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire that he was struggling to make a new home contract worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5m and he would have no time to spare.
The company was previously compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand. It was also to double the assets of Holly Willoughby estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
After announcing the decision to leave the truly brand by 37-year-old Holly Willoughby on Instagram, Peter Jones left the UK, going to one of his holiday homes.
According to the source, “The truly brand was a priority for Holly Willoughby.
She tied her future to it and wanted to take care of it for the next several decades.
The decision to withdraw from the activity completely surprised all the people involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday. It was already so close to entering the market.
In the warehouse in Marlow, there are ready-to-sell goods.”
Experts believe the resignation of the presenter of This Morning and one of the UK’s most successful stars could cost the company millions of pounds due to significant investments in products – including household items from pillows to candles to candles and articles.
It can also mean the end of a long-term friendship.
Holly Willoughby (the mother of three children) and her husband Dan Baldwin for ten years had a close relationship with Peter Jones and his wife Tara Capp.
Holly Willoughby and Tara Capp founded True in 2016, and 52-year-old Peter Jones joined them in March as president.
The couple spent their vacations together, and Jones held a 40% stake in a television production company owned by Dan Baldwin.
Holly Willoughby is set to become M&S brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Peter Jones said last night: “We will not comment on his business affairs.”
Difficult conversation, "and then we fell in love with each other"
The president joked about the criticism of the media caused by the remarks that some considered “unfit for the husband of the state” as well as a positive attitude towards the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give so much?
Trump said in a smiling voice, making a television presenter:
“I gave up nothing.”
The president pointed out that Kim Jong Un is interested in a second meeting. The first meeting took place in Singapore in June and was called by Trump a big step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
Negotiations on nuclear disarmament, however, are lagging behind.
After more than three months since the June summit in Singapore, the head of North Korean diplomacy, Ri Yong Ho, told the world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that he did not see a “analogous response” by the United States to the United States.
He noted that instead, the United States is upholding sanctions and putting pressure on them.
President Trump expressed a much more optimistic view in his speech.
“We are doing very well with North Korea,” he said.
“We are planning a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
“We have a great relationship now.”
The president said his efforts to improve relations with Kim Jong Un had a positive impact: they led to the end of missile tests, helped to release hostages, and to return the remaining U.S. soldiers home.
In addition, he defended his unusual approach when discussing relations with Kim Jong Un.
“It’s easy to behave after the presidency, but instead of 10,000 people waiting outside and trying to get to the crowded stadium, we’d have 200 people here,” Trump said, pointing his finger at the crowd gathered right in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia have happily destroyed one of the islands, killing hundreds of people
After the earthquake on the island of Lombok foreign NGOs were told that their help is not needed.
Despite the loss of a roof over the head by more than 10% of the population of Lombok, the authorities have not declared a disaster, which is a prerequisite for accelerating international aid efforts.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, the authorities have made it very clear that they are not asking for international support, so the situation is difficult,” said Selina Sumbung.
While Save the Children is preparing to travel to the Indonesian city of Palu, it is not yet certain whether international staff will be able to operate on the scene.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the national agency for disasters, said Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see if assistance from international organizations should be allowed.
In the face of the shocks constantly felt in Indonesia, the country remains completely unprepared to cope with the forces of nature.
Although shelters were built in the province of Aceh in the event of a tsunami, they are rare for the rest of the coastline.
The lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu – despite the warning being issued – likely had an impact on the number of deaths.
Even in the most favourable conditions, travelling between the Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters are making it even more difficult for logistics.
The hospital ship, which was stationed on the island of Lombok, is going with help for the victims of the earthquake to the city of Palu. However, it will take at least three days to reach the destination.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of Indonesian infrastructure the main point of his campaign and has allocated a lot of funds to roads and railways.
However, in the face of next year's elections, the administration of the president is struggling with a lack of funds.
In addition, Joko Widodo was under pressure due to the ongoing tensions in the country on a religious basis. Members of the majority of the Muslim community adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than a thousand people were killed, and tens of thousands of residents lost their roof over their heads as a result of clashes between Christian and Muslim gangs using macsets, bows, shotguns and other simple weapons on the streets.
See: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge wins a goal in a draw against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the English Premier League, scoring the goal in the 89th minute of Saturday's match at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge received a referee from Xherdan Shaqiri at a distance of about 27 metres from Chelsea's goal in a 1-0 draw to his team's disadvantage.
Before taking the shot towards the far-off goal, he put the ball on his left leg.
The ball veered high above the penalty field towards the upper right corner of the net.
Then she entered the gate, flying over the one falling into it by Kep Arrizabalaga.
“I just tried to take the position and accept the ball, knowing that players like Shaqiri are always trying to get it as far as possible. I wanted to give myself the best shot opportunity,” Sturridge said in an interview with LiverpoolFC.com.
“I noticed Kante coming up, I took the ball, and I shot him without even thinking about it.”
Chelsea led 1-0 in the middle of the match after the goal of Belgian star Eden Hazard shot in the 25th minute.
The Blues striker kicked the ball with a heel to Mateo Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> and then ran towards the half of Liverpool.
Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> quickly accepted the application in the middle of the field.
He then made a beautiful play forward in the penalty area back to Hazard.
The gamble went ahead of the defenders and with his left foot he fired a shot towards the long pole that passed Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League on Wednesday at 15:00 at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia has increased to 832
According to the Indonesian disaster agency, the number of victims of the recent earthquake and tsunami in the country has risen to 832.
During the conference, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency, said that as a result of Friday’s 7.5-degree earthquake on the Richter scale, many people were trapped under rubble.
Inhabited by more than 380,000 people, the city of Palu is full of debris of collapsed buildings.
Police Arrest 32-Year-Old Man Suspected of Harassment
After a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside County, an investigation into the murder was launched.
A 44-year-old woman was found dead at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested.
The police are asking for contact from people in the area who have seen or heard of any suspicious incident.

I am also addressing all drivers, and in particular taxi drivers, whose registrars may have been able to secure material useful during the investigation.”
A police spokesperson confirmed that the woman was living in Birkenhead and that her body was found inside the property.
In the afternoon, people claiming to know the woman came to the scene to find out where she was found.
Police said they were informing the victim’s family about the incident.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews recently tried to get into the apartment building, but he was informed by police that entry to the facility and leaving it is currently prohibited.
He hesitated when he found out what had happened.
Residents have been informed that they will not be able to return to their homes in the near future.
It was heard that one of the officials explained to the man that the area is currently considered a crime scene.
There was a woman crying at the scene of the incident.
She kept saying, “It’s so terrible.”
At 2:00 p.m., there were two police cars in the fenced area and another police vehicle was parked next to it.
Inside the segregated zone are the officials guarding the residential building.
Persons with the information are requested to contact us via Twitter (<0x40>MerPolCC) or by telephone at number 101, or to register anonymously through the Crimestoppers organization at number 0800 555 111, giving the event number 247 of September 30.
Cromwell Monument in front of British Parliament to be the last victim in the dispute over “write history again”
The removal of the monument would bring justice for the reminiscent actions of the Taliban to the destruction of many English cultural and religious monuments by its radical, Puritan supporters.
However, the Cromwell Society described Jeremy Crick’s proposal as “crazy” and “trying to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “Considering the ongoing debate over the removal of monuments, the dispute over the figure of Oliver Cromwell before the Palace of Westminster was a matter of time.
The imagery during the English Civil War was neither commissioned nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps for the actions of his ancestor Thomas a century earlier it was decided to punish the wrong Cromwell.
The manner in which Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft presented Cromwell at the monument is a testament to the opinion that this politician enjoyed in the 19th century and that for many people it is a figure that is still worth remembering.
John Goldsmith said in an interview with The Sunday Telegraph: “Many people have seen Cromwell – perhaps more often in the nineteenth century than now – as a defender of parliament against external pressures, in which case, of course, it was a monarchy.
The assessment, insofar as this is true, is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
It is certain, however, that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure that identifies one of the parties to the division.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be honoured and commemorated.”
In China, there was a deadly disturbance of a farmer by a pig
According to local media, there was a deadly swine attack on a farmer at the trade fair in southwestern China.
On Sunday, the South China Morning Post reported that a dead man named Yuan was found bleeding and with a broken artery near a beef shop in Liupanshui, Kuejczou province.
A pig breeder is preparing to vaccinate in a pighouse on May 30, 2005, in the city of Xining, in Qinghai Province, China.
According to reports, the man came to the market with his cousin from the neighbouring Junnan province to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, the cousin found the body of the man and noticed an open door to the nearby pig.
He said there was a big request in the pork with blood on the rye.
The body section confirmed that it was a nearly 250-pound pig that was fatally disturbed by the farmer.
“My cousin’s legs were bleeded and pointed,” said a man named Wu, quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
The surveillance footage shows that Yuan came to the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed a man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The trade fair manager said in an interview with Guiyang Evening News that at the time of collecting evidence by the police, the request was isolated in order to avoid another attack.
According to reports, the man's family and the trade fair authorities are negotiating compensation for death.
Cases of swine attacks on humans have already been reported in the past, although they are rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts. The man suffered fatal wounds.
Ten years earlier in Wales, a nearly 300-kilogram pig drove a farmer to a tractor. The man’s wife managed to pull the animal away.
After eating a pig farmer from Oregon in 2012, one of the farmers in Manitoba told CBC News that these animals are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can liberate brutal behavior in them.
“They just want to play.
They're as intriguing as kids... they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to show them the proper respect,” he said.
Remains after Hurricane Rosa will cause heavy rainfall in the southwestern part of the United States
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is losing power, moving over the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
In the coming days, however, it will cause heavy rainfall in northern Mexico and the southwestern part of the United States.
Hurricane Rosa winds at a speed of almost 137 km/h. On Sunday at 5:00 a.m. Eastern time he was given the category 1. He was then located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
According to forecasts on Sunday, Rosa will move north.
In the meantime, over the Pacific Ocean, it begins to form rather than moving eastwards to the west coast of the United States. On Monday, the Rose will approach the California Peninsula in the form of a tropical storm, moving the masses of the humid plain.
On Monday it will bring rainfall of up to 25 cm on some of the territory of Mexico.
In the coming days, humid tropical air coming into contact with the approaching low will cause heavy rainfall in the Southwestern United States.
In some places, rainfall ranging in height from 2.5 to 10 cm will lead to sudden flooding, pollution movement and possible landslides in desert areas.
The humid tropical air will cause rain anywhere from 5 to 7.5 cm per hour, especially in parts of Nevada and Arizona.
Even 5 to 10 cm of rain is forecast in some regions of the Southwestern United States, especially over much of Arizona.
Due to the scattered nature of tropical rainfall, sudden flooding and sudden changes in conditions are possible.
In the face of the threat of tropical rains, it is definitely advisable to move on foot through the desert area.
Abundant floods can turn canyons into steep rivers, and storms with plumes will cause local gusty winds and dust to move.
Coming sooner than it will bring abundant local rainfall on the southern coast of California.
There is a possibility of rainfall with a total height of more than 1.3 cm, which can cause minor pollution movements and danger on the roads.
This would be the first rainfall in the region.
Tropical rainfall will begin to approach Arizona on late Sundays and early Mondays. On Monday afternoons and Tuesdays, rainfall will occur in a larger number of areas.
On Tuesday, heavy rains will reach the Four Corners region in the western United States and last until Wednesday.
Temperature fluctuations may occur throughout the United States in October, with cooling in the Arctic region. However, in the intervertebral zone it will be rather warm.
This can lead to sudden changes in temperature over short distances.
A good example is the Sunday temperature differences in the central part of the United States.
Between Kansas City (Missouri State) and Omaha (Nebraska State) and between St. Louis (Missouri State) and Des Moines (Iowa State) these differences are almost 10 degrees Celsius.
In the coming days, the rising summer temperatures may rise again.
In much of the central and eastern United States, warm early October is expected. Temperatures are expected to range from 26 to 32 degrees Celsius in the area from the southern part of the Great Plains to part of the North East.
On Tuesday in New York, the temperature can reach up to 27 degrees Celsius, or about 5 degrees above the average.
Long-term climate forecasts indicate a high probability of occurring above-average temperatures in the east of the United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh’s interview
More than 20 million people watched on six television stations on Thursday a hearing of a candidate for Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh and Christina Blasey Ford, a woman who accused a lawyer of sexual harassment in the 1980s.
Despite the ongoing political impasse on Friday, commentators had to stop regularly broadcasting programs to inform of an immediate return: an agreement proposed by Senator Jeff Flake, according to which the FBI will conduct a weekly investigation into the charges.
Christine Blasey Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh had framed her in a state of impunity and tried to remove her clothes during a high school party.
In his emotional testimony, however, Kavanaugh said that he was convinced that such a situation did not take place.
It is possible that the fifth number of televisions was even greater than Nielsen’s 20.4 million.
The company calculated the average number of television stations on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
However, for other stations, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, numerical data was not yet available.
In addition, Nielsen usually has difficulty measuring the visibility among people in the workplace.
The number is similar to the number of American football cup matches or the awarding of the American Academy of Film Awards.
According to Nielsen, the Fox News Channel station, whose presenters strongly supported Kavanaugh's nomination, had the highest viewership, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day's audition.
In second place was the ABC station with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
Interest in the topic remained high after the hearing had ended.
Jeff Flake has become a key figure in Friday’s events.
In the morning, he was captured by CNN and CBS cameras after the moderate Republican's office issued a statement that he decided to support Kavanaugh's nomination. On recording, he yells at protesters who prevented him from entering the elevator on the way to the hearing.
Flake with his head down for a few minutes listened to unfavorable opinions. The whole event was broadcast on CNN.
“I’m standing here in front of you and asking.
Do you think he's telling the people the truth?
You have strength in the face of the powerlessness of so many women," he said from a demonstrative woman.
Prior to closing the elevator door, Jeff Flake said his office had made a statement and that he would be speaking during the hearing of the committee.
Later on, television stations continued to broadcast the events in anticipation of a vote on the passing of Kavanaugh's nomination before the entire Senate.
Flake said he would only support the nomination if he knew that the FBI would investigate the charges next week, which was demanded by a minority of Democrats.
Flake was convinced in part of a conversation with his friend, Senator Chris Coons of the Democratic Party.
Flake made the decision after meeting with Chris Coons and several other senators.
Flake's choice was important because the Republicans would not have the votes needed to approve Brett Kavanaugh's nomination without an investigation.
President Trump has initiated an FBI proceeding on charges brought against Brett Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of using Brexit to their own advantage
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of playing Britain’s future and undermining the national interest.
Prime Minister Theresa May attends the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with the former foreign minister in her government, Boris Johnson attacked a plan for future relations with the European Union in the wake of Brexit, according to which the United Kingdom and the EU would not be able to “take a tax on their own behalf”.
Wayde Sims Shooting: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson Suspected of LSU Player Murder
Police have arrested the suspect in connection with the deadly shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from Louisiana State University (LSU).
According to reports, 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested in Baton Rouge and arrested on second-degree murder charges.
Authorities have released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson. Police have reported that Sims lost their glasses during the fight.
According to a CBS-linked WAFB station, police officers found the glasses on the spot and detected traces of Simpson's DNA on them.
Police said after Simpson's interrogation that he confessed to shooting Wayde.
According to a lawyer, the amount of the bail was set at $350,000.
On Friday, the East Baton Rouge Coroner’s office released an introductory report that the cause of death was a head and neck gunshot wound.
The police command expressed its gratitude to the Louisiana state police search team, the state police criminal lab, Southern University police and nearby residents for their help in the investigation leading to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, LSU’s director of sports, thanked the local law enforcement for “workfulness and the pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The 198-cm man grew up in Baton Rouge. His father Wayne Sims also played basketball at LSU.
In his last season, he scored an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was “devastated” and “shocked” by Wayde’s death.
“That’s one of those things we’re constantly afraid of,” Will Wade said.
The ash emitted by the volcano reaches the city of Mexico
The ash extracted from the Popocatépetl volcano reached the southern districts of Mexico’s capital.
On Saturday, the National Center for the Prevention of Natural Disasters warned residents of approaching the volcano due to increased crater activity and 183 cases of gas and ash emissions within 24 hours.
The centre has experienced numerous tremors and shocks.
Photos posted on social media show the front windows of cars covered with a thin layer of ash in Mexico's neighborhoods, such as Xochimilco.
Since the 7.1-degree earthquake that struck Mexico in September 2017, geophysicists have seen an increase in volcanic activity located 72 km southeast of the country’s capital.
The volcano, also known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
The start of the police with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the referendum on independence
On Saturday in Barcelona, six people were arrested as a result of the protests in support of Catalonia’s independence with the preventive police units. On that day, thousands of people took part in the hostile demonstrations commemorating the first anniversary of the emboldening referendum.
A group of masked separatists threw eggs and powdered paint from police officers. Dark dust clouds swept the streets usually full of tourists.
The fight also took place later in the day. In order to stop the fighting, police forces used a stick.
For a few hours, independence groups chanted “We don’t forget, we don’t forgive”, while opponents of the secession shouted “Let Spain live”.
Fourteen people, according to the local press, received medical help in connection with minor injuries sustained during the protests.
A year after the referendum on 1 October, tensions will not weaken. Although the authorities in Madrid considered them illegal, it is still a reason to celebrate for the secession of Catalans.
The majority of the voters spoke for independence, but the attendance was low due to the widespread boycott of the opponents.
According to Catalan authorities, almost a thousand people were injured last year in brutal clashes with police trying to prevent voting in polling stations.
On Friday evening, a group of people supporting the independence of the region decided to prevent a demonstration supporting the police.
The demonstration took place in spite of this, however, the route was forced to change.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician taking part in a separatist protest with his wife, said there was no longer any hope for Catalonia’s independence.
“Last year we went through some of the most beautiful moments of our lives.
“My parents were crying with joy that they could vote, but now we’re stuck at a point where there’s no way out,” he said.
Despite a significant, but small, victory in the local elections in December last year, the parties supporting Catalonia’s secession have difficulty with continuing their activities. Many of the most recognized leaders have decided not to resign from the referendum and are not expected to leave the process.
Joan Puig, a forty-two-year-old mechanic who recorded a protest by telephone supporting the police, said politicians on both sides of the dispute were encouraging the conflict.
“The situation is getting more and more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders detained since the end of last year, announced the desire to start next year’s European Parliament elections.
"Candidating for the European Parliament elections is the best way to condemn the crisis of democratic values of the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: men arrested after entering the house by car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested in the wake of a car crash at a house in the city of Londonderry.
The event took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19:30 British Time (BST).
Investigation commissioner Bob Blemmings said the damage covered the gate and the building.
At some point in the direction of the car could also be given a shot from the cockpit.
Mengi's goal ensures Livingston's victory over the Rangers 1:0
Dolly Mengi's first goal for Livingston brought the team victory
Ever since that season, Livingston have been disappointing to the Rangers by giving Steven Gerrard a second defeat in his 18 games as the club's coach at Ibrox Park.
Dolly Mengi's goal turned out to be a winner, and Gary Holt's team moved to second place in the table with Hibernian.
The team under Gerrard will be left without a win in the Premiership this season. Next Sunday, the team will face the leader of the Hearts, who loses eight points.
Earlier, because on Thursday, the Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna team as part of the UEFA Europa League matches.
Livingston extends his division's winning streak to six games, with coach Holt failing to replace Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston has missed several chances against undefeated opponents
The team led by Holt should have taken the lead much earlier, as the team's game has caused the Rangers a lot of trouble.
First, Scott Robinson broke through the defense and shot in the light of the goal, but he failed to shoot the goal. Then Alan Lithgow failed to hit after taking over Craig Halkett's head.
The hosts allowed the Rangers to play closer to the goal, knowing that they could threaten rivals during fixed chunks of the game.
And that's how the decisive goal fell.
After the Rangers surrendered their free throw, the Livingston team found an opportunity. Declan Gallagher and Robinson together created the Menda situation, which gained a goal from the center of the penalty area.
At this stage, the Rangers had more holdings, but were unable to advance the host's defenses and did not cause much trouble for goalkeeper Liam Kelly.
Alfredo Morelos fired one shot at Kelly's goal in the second half.
Scott Pittman's attempt was defended by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow failed to reach the goal light from another permanent snippet in favour of Livingston.
The Rangers continued their attacks on the Livingston penalty area, but could not take advantage of the situation. They claimed two penalty shots after Halkett's intervention against Glenn Middleton and one hand play. In both cases, however, the players' claims were denied.
"Phenomenal" performance of Livingston – analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland in Almondvale Park
Great performance and result for Livingston.
In his opinion, they played wonderfully, once again exceeding expectations.
Their style and composition have hardly changed since returning to the extra-class, but Holt should be appreciated for motivating the team to play.
This game had a lot of heroes.
Captain Craig Halkett played a huge role in directing a well-organized defense, while Menga made Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall very careful throughout the game.
The Rangers lacked the will to fight.
Although they had great moments under Gerrard’s leadership, they did not maintain their standards in the match.
There seemed to be something missing in their game: only once managed to break through the defense of the host. This should be a serious warning for the Rangers, who were in the middle of the table.
Mixed reactions to Erdogan's visit to Cologne
During Saturday’s breakfast in Berlin (29 September), the leaders of Turkey and Germany were accompanied by smiles and beautiful weather.
This was the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan to Germany, whose visits were aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
Disagreements on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the European Union have led to disputes.
After the meeting, Erdogan went to Cologne, where he opened a new, huge mosque.
The city is home to the largest number of Turks outside its homeland.
According to the police, for security reasons, a crowd of 25,000 was blocked in front of the temple, but supporters of the president gathered in the area to see their leader.
Hundreds of Erdogan’s opponents, including many Kurds, also decided to express their opinion, condemning Turkey’s leader’s policy and the German government’s decision to adopt a policy in the country.
The protests against each other reflect the divisions aroused by the visit of the politics of a hero shouted by some Turks living in Germany and recognized as an autocrat by others.
Deptford Road Accident: Bicyclist Died in Car Crash
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London, England.
The accident occurred near the crowded intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street in Deptford, a southeastern part of the city, around 10:15 BST.
After the incident, the driver stopped the vehicle, and medical rescuers arrived at the scene. Despite the intervention, the man died at the scene of the accident.
A few months ago, there was another fatal accident on Childers Street (about one and a half kilometers away from Saturday’s crash site) involving a cyclist, and the perpetrator ran away from the crash site.
The Metropolitan Police reported that the officials are working on identifying the deceased man and informing the family members of the incident.
The roads were closed and bus tours were organized, and drivers were advised to avoid the nearby area.
Long Lartin Penalty Facility: Six Officials Reportedly Injured As A Result Of Disturbances
According to the authorities of the facility, six officials were injured as a result of riots in a criminal facility for men with an elevated level of security.
The riots at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire began on Sunday at around 9:30 p.m. British Time (BST) and are still ongoing.
A specialised unit “Tornado” was called to the riots involving eight prisoners in one of the plant’s wings.
Officers on the scene suffered minor injuries to the face.
The agency’s spokesperson said: “Specially trained personnel were involved in the action at the HMP Long Lartin criminal facility.
Six of the officers suffered minor injuries in the area.
We do not tolerate violence in our facilities. We are confident that those responsible will be handed over to the police and may spend more time in prison."
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 inmates, including one of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
According to reports in June, the plant’s director had to go to the hospital after he was attacked by one of the prisoners.
In October of last year, the plant was called to the prevention units due to the dangerous riots, in which employees were attacked with balls to play billiards.
Sudden flooding caused by Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (possible beneficial impact on drought-affected areas)
It is rare for tropical depression to reach the state of Arizona. It is likely to occur at the beginning of next week. Remains after Hurricane Rosa move through the desert areas of the Southwest, creating a threat of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning about the possibility of emergency flooding on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, south-eastern Vegas, California and Utah, including cities such as Las Vegas and Lake Flax.
According to forecasts on Tuesday, Rosa will pass directly over Phoenix. On Monday afternoon, the rain will begin.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix reported via Twitter that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have maintained a storm or tropical depression at a distance of 320 km from Phoenix.
Hurricane Katrina (in 1967) approached a distance of 65 km from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict rainfall with a height of 5 to 10 cm. In some areas of Mogollon Rim in Arizona they can reach a height of up to 15 cm.
In the rest of the desert areas of the Southwest – including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Wall – the rainfall is likely to range from 2.5 to 5 cm, and in some areas up to 10 cm.
People outside areas at risk of sudden flooding, the rains accompanying Hurricane Rosa can bring relief, as the region has been struggling with drought for some time.
While floods pose a serious threat, some of the rains will improve the situation in the Southwest, where drought is prevalent.
According to weather.com, U.S. Drought Monitor estimates that nearly 40% of the Arizona area is struggling with severe droughts belonging to the second highest category.
Hurricane Rosa first arrives on the California Peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa continued to move with the force of the hurricane, reaching a speed of 137 km/h. It is now at a distance of 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and heads north at a speed of 19 km/h.
Hurricane encounters the colder waters of the Pacific Ocean, causing its weakening.
According to forecasts, it will hit Mexico with a strong tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Intensive rainfall in some parts of Mexico can pose a major flood threat.
Weather.com reported that "in the area from the California Peninsula to the northwestern part of the state of Sonora, precipitation is expected to be between 7 and 15 cm in height, although it may reach 25 cm."
Then Hurricane Rosa will pass through Mexico in the north in the form of a tropical storm. On Tuesday, in the early hours of the morning, it will reach the border of the state of Arizona as a tropical depression. By Tuesday evening, it narrows to the southern part of the state of Utah.
"The most serious threat posed by Hurricane Rosa or its remnants is heavy rainfall on the California Peninsula, in the northwestern part of the state of Sonora, and in the southwestern desert areas of the United States of America."
According to forecasts, the rains will cause life-threatening floods and pollution movements in the desert and muddy avalanches in mountainous terrain.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four People Arrested for Attempting Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on charges of attempting the murder of a 16-year-old found with a stab wound in Somerset County.
The boy was found at Excelsior Terrace, in the town of Midsomer Norton, on Saturday, around 4:00 a.m. British Time (BST).
The victim was taken to the hospital and her condition remains “stable”.
Police in Avon and Somerset say a seventeen-year-old, two eighteen-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested in the Radstock area last night.
Officials are asked to contact all persons who have the recordings of the event.
Trump says Brett Kavanaugh has “recognized the dullness and anger” of the Democratic Party
“The vote against Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the Democratic Party’s absolute and outrageous conduct,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "recognized the dullness and anger" of the Democratic Party during the nomination process.
On Thursday, Brett Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress. He strongly and emotionally denied the accusations of Christina Blasey Ford. The woman claims that a few decades ago, when both were teenagers, a man committed sexual assault against her.
Ford also testified during the interrogation on the charges that she made.
On Saturday, the president said that on that day, “Americans could have convinced themselves of the brilliance, class and courage” of Kavanaugh.
“The vote given to Judge Kavanaugh is a voice of support from one of the most prominent lawyers of our time, a law expert on great merits for the community,” he said in front of a crowd of supporters at the age in West Virginia.
The president did not directly refer to the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh, discussing the importance of Republican attendance in the half-presidential elections.
“The most important choices in our lives are separated by five weeks of time.
I don’t start this election, but I remain very active,” he said.
“I’m still fighting to defend our great candidates.”
Trump says the Democrats are pursuing a policy of “resisting and hindering activities.”
As one of the assistants of the Republican Party’s important policy told CNN, the first key Senate vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected no later than Friday.
Hundreds of victims of earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia. The number of victims is growing
Authorities said on Saturday at least 384 people were killed – many of them abducted by high waves breaking across beaches – in the wake of a severe earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
On Friday in Palu, hundreds of people gathered on the beach to take part in the festival taking place in the city. On the way to the shore, waves of up to 6 meters high hit, kidnapping many people and destroying everything on their way.
The tsunami was the result of a 7.5-degree earthquake.
“When the threat emerged yesterday, people on the beach did not immediately escape and were victims of the tsunami,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia’s BNPD disaster agency, told a conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami attacked everything on its way, hijacking cars, logs and houses,” Nugroho said, adding that before reaching the coastline, the animal was moving at a speed of 800 km/h.
As he said, some escaped by climbing trees and managed to survive.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
On the aerial photographs published by the agency for disasters, you can see many damaged houses and shops, damaged and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city was hit by secondary shocks.
There have been a number of earthquakes in the area inhabited by 2.4 million people.
According to a statement by the Indonesian Technology Assessment and Use Agency (BPPT), the energy released by an extensive Friday earthquake was about two hundred times greater than the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The statement said that the geographic location of the city, which is at the end of a long, narrow bay, could have aggravated the effects of the tsunami.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho described the damage as “significant” and said hundreds of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He then added that the bodies of parts of the victims were found under collapsed buildings, 540 people were injured, and 29 people were deemed missing.
Nugroho said the fatalities and damage could be greater along the coastline 300 km north of Pal, in an area called Donggala, which was located closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
According to Nugroh, the communication "has been completely paralysed", so there are no reports from the Donggala province.
“There are more than 300,000 people living there,” read the statement of the Red Cross, adding that the workers and volunteers of the organization are going to the places affected by the disaster.
“We can already talk about the tragedy, although the situation can be significantly deteriorated,” the statement said.
On Saturday, the agency met with widespread criticism for the lack of information about the tsunami in Palu, but authorities said the waves came just after the warning was issued.
On an amateur footage shared on social media, you see a man screaming from the building, trying to warn of an impending tsunami of people on the street.
Within minutes, the water wall collapsed along the shore, hijacking buildings and cars.
Reuters was not able to immediately confirm the authenticity of the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami caused significant shortages in the supply of electricity, preventing communication within the Pal, which in turn made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
According to the authorities, the military began sending transport planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, however, the evacuated people still very much need food and other basic items of first need.
The airport, located in the city, is open for humanitarian transport only. The airport will remain inactive until October.
On Sunday, President Joko Widodo will visit the evacuation centres in Palu.
More than 800 victims of the tsunami in Indonesia.
The situation is very bad.
According to Doseba T. Sinai, the national director of World Vision, the staff of this organization arrived safely from the province of Donggala to the city of Palu and found shelter in birch tents placed in the courtyard of the office.
“They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses,” he said.
The situation is very bad.
Although some groups are slowly beginning to carry aid, there have been voices of criticism that foreign humanitarian workers with a wealth of experience are prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, receiving funding, resources and personnel from abroad can only be started after the disaster site has been declared an area of national disaster.
It hasn't been done yet.
“Officially, we are still dealing with a disaster of regional scope,” a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross said.
“When the government recognizes that there has been a national disaster, we will be able to start accepting international aid, but that has not happened yet.”
Two days after Friday's earthquake and tsunami in Palu, friends and families of missing persons still live in the hope that their loved ones will somehow find themselves in the midst of destruction.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of the canals.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who spent two days under the rubble next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, a coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, trained two missing paragliders participating in the Asian Games that ended this month in Indonesia.
As Petra Mandagi said, the other people imprisoned at the Roa Roa Hotel were his students.
“As an experienced paratrooper, I struggle with my own emotional weight,” he said.
Gendon Subandono said that within a few hours of the appearance among the community of paragliders, information about the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel was desperately sending messages via WhatsApp to athletes participating in the festival on the beach.
His messages were marked with only one grey hook instead of a pair of blue-coloured hooks.
“It seems to me that this means that the news has not been delivered,” he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 while cashing at an ATM at Newport on the Levee mall
According to a statement from Newport Police Command on Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was filling in cash at an ATM at the Newport on the Levee mall.
“The driver of the car emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to replenish the cash,” Detective Dennis McCarthy said in a statement.
Another man "run from the back to the Brink employee" and stole a bag of money for the ATM.
According to the statement, the witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not say how many people were involved in the theft.
All persons with information about the identity of the thief are requested to contact the Newport Police Command at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West decided to change his name to Ye.
Speaking on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote about himself: “A person formerly known as Kanye West.”
The forty-one-year-old musician has been using the pseudonym Ye for some time. It is also the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change took place prior to a visit to Saturday Night Live. The artist is expected to present his new album, Yandhi, during the performance.
He will replace singer Arian Grande on the show, who, according to the creators, has given up on "emotional reasons".
West has previously stated that the word “Ye” is not only an abbreviation of his current artistic nickname, but has a religious meaning.
“It seems to me that ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible. In the Bible it means ‘you’,” West said earlier this year, discussing the title of the album with a radio presenter named Big Boy.
"I'm you, I'm us, it's about us.
First, I was Kanye, which means one person. Now I am Ye – a reflection of all our good, bad and puzzled traits.
The album shows who we are.”
West found himself among other famous rappers who decided to change their name.
Sean Combs, known by the pseudonyms Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, announced this year that he wants to be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, a former West collaborator, also recorded his pseudonym in various ways, with a connector, without a connector and in capital letters.
Mexican President-elect Andrés Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador vows not to use military force against civilians
On the eve of the 50th anniversary of the bloody suppression of student demonstrations, Mexican President-elect Andrés Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador (AMLO) has pledged never to use the military against civilians.
On Saturday, L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador promised to “never use the military to repress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, the soldiers opened fire on the square towards a peaceful demonstration, killing as many as 300 people. The incident occurred at a time when the leftist student movements began to develop throughout Latin America.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador pledged to support Mexico’s young people by providing monthly financial assistance to learners as well as creating more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities pushes young people towards criminal groups.
The U.S. should double funding for artificial intelligence research.
According to Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and artificial intelligence expert working for Google, Microsoft and Apple, as China’s activity in this area increases, the United States should double its spending on SI research.
The remark is related to announcements on artificial intelligence published by various U.S. government agencies, even though the U.S. does not have an official strategy on ISIS.
China, meanwhile, presented its plan last year, according to which by 2030 it wants to become the most innovative country in the field of artificial intelligence.
“To begin with, we need to double the budget for SI research: all other countries are far behind the United States, and we are trying to make another breakthrough in this area,” said Kai-Fu Lee.
In an interview with CNBC this week, he also said that doubling the funds could double the chances of making another breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence in the United States.
Lee, whose book titled “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” (The Artificial Intelligence Superpower: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order) was published this month in China’s most recent edition of the Houghton Mifflin Harbiurt.
In the 1980s, Kai-Fu Lee worked at Carnegie Mellon University to create an SI system that defeated the then-best American player in the game Othello. He then held a senior position at Microsoft Research and was president of the Chinese Google branch of the company.
Lee recognized the success of previous technology initiatives of the US government, e.g. the Advanced Research Projects in the Defense Area Agency (DARPA) organized a competition for the most interesting robot projects. He also asked about the date of the next edition of the robots.
As Kai-Fu Lee said, scientists in the United States often have to work hard to get government grants.
“It’s not China that gets us the best representatives of the academic world, it’s corporations,” Lee said.
For several years now, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have been employing outstanding scientists to work on artificial intelligence.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policy could also help the United States in the development of SI.
“I believe that people who are dealing with artificial intelligence who have obtained a doctoral degree should automatically be granted a green card,” he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council published a plan to create the next generation of artificial intelligence.
As Lee noted, the Chinese National Natural Science Foundation of China provides funding to members of academic institutions in a manner similar to the U.S. National Science Foundation and other governmental organizations that grant funding to U.S. academics. However, China does not provide funding to U.S. scientists.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a joint artificial intelligence center (Joint Artificial Intelligence Center), which will engage in the work of partners from the world of industry and science. Artificial intelligence.The White House announced intemittly Intel.
This month, DARPA also announced the allocation of $2 billion for an initiative called AI Next.
The National Science Foundation currently invests more than $100 billion annually in research on SI.
At the same time, the U.S. initiative aimed at creating a national commission on the security of artificial intelligence has not been moving forward for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on changing the name of their country
On Sunday, Macedonians voted in a referendum to change the name of their country to the Republic of North Macedonia, which would lead to a decades-long dispute with Greece, which blocks the country's efforts to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, in which the historical land of Macedonia is located, maintains that the name of the northern neighbor constitutes a claim to its territory. Therefore, the country has been restricted to joining the EU and NATO.
In June, the governments of the two countries reached an agreement on naming, but nationalists argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority living in Macedonia.
President <0xC7><0xB4>orge Ivanov has said he will not take part in the vote. A campaign encouraging a boycott has raised doubts as to whether attendance will reach the minimum level of 50% required to consider the referendum binding.
The referendum asked the following question: “Do you support joining NATO and the EU following the adoption of the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaew, argue that it is worth paying the price for the possibility of Macedonia – one of the countries created after the collapse of Yugoslavia – joining organisations such as the European Union or NATO.
“I voted for the future of my country so that young Macedonians can live free under the umbrella of the European Union. Membership in the EU will provide greater security for all of us,” said Oliwera Georgievska, 79, from Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, a sufficient number of parliamentarians have stated that they respect the results of the vote.
The change of name requires the support of two-thirds of the members of parliament.
The State Electoral Commission reported that no unusual events had been reported until 1 p.m.
However, attendance at this time was only 16%, compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections of 2016, when 66% of eligible voters cast their votes.
"I voted because of my children. Our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old <0xC7><0xB4>osze Tanewski, a voter from Skopje.
On September 30, 2018, in Strumica, Macedonia, Prime Minister Zoran Zaew, his wife Zorica and son Duszko voted in a referendum on changing the country’s name to pave the way for NATO and EU membership.
In front of the parliament building in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kawardarkow prepared a small stage and set up chairs in front of tents scattered by people boycotting the referendum.
“We support membership in NATO and the EU, but we want to join these organizations with their heads tied up and not the back door,” Kawardarkow said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don’t want us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China or Russia, and become part of the Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaew says NATO membership will bring the necessary investment to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20%.
“I believe that the vast majority will be in favour of a name change in the referendum, because 80% of the citizens support the European Union and NATO,” Zaew said after the vote.
He said the “yes” vote was a “confirmation of our future.”
In a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Public Surveys, between 30 and 43% of voters declared their willingness to participate in the referendum. This is less than the required attendance.
According to another poll conducted by Macedonian TV Telma TV, in a Sunday referendum, 57% of respondents plan to vote.
70% of respondents said they would support a name change.
In order for the vote to be successful, attendance must be 50% <0x2B> 1 vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first major blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since taking power in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City will defeat all of Brighton’s defense and win the goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling returned Brighton's defence home in a Saturday's final 2-0 match for Manchester City. The match was played at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
The goal won by Aguera in 65 minutes looked childishly easy.
The action began with a midfielder handing over to an Argentine attacker.
The player has overtaken three Brighton defenders.
Aguero was then among the four players of Brighton.
First, he played one of them, then surpassed the others and was on the edge of Brighton's penal field.
Then he played the ball to the left, where Sterling was waiting for her.
The English striker immediately handed the ball back to Aguera in the penalty area, who defeated Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan by shooting to the right of the goal.
"Aguero is battling a foot injury," Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We talked about the possibility of playing 55, 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky to have won the goal in that time.”
However, it was Sterling who provided the Blues with their first lead in the Premier League.
The goal we're talking about fell in the 29th minute.
In the action of this Aguero he got the ball deep in the middle of Brighton.
He sent a wonderful submission along the left side of the field to Leroy Sane.
Sane made a few moves, allowing Sterling to move on a long pole.
The Manchester City striker pointed the ball to the net just before it crashed into the car.
Manchester City will face Hoffenheim in the group stage of the UEFA Champions League on Tuesday at 12:55. The match will take place at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim (Germany).
Scherzer wants to spoil his chances of winning the Rockies
After losing a chance to play in the play-offs by the Washington Nationals, Scherzer did not have to appear in the first leg.
However, Scherzer is hoping to play Sunday's game against the Colorado Rockies if only the Rockies have a chance to play in the play-offs.The team currently has one more win than the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West division.
The Rockies can count on at least a wild card if they win Friday's match against the Nationals with a score of 5:2. However, they still want to get their first division champion title.
“Although we’re playing ‘for nothing’, at least we’re going to go out on the pitch, knowing that the atmosphere in Denver and the opponents’ performance will be at the highest level as in the rest of the season.
Why wouldn’t I want to take part in this meeting?”
The Nationals have not yet announced the starting goalkeeper for Sunday's meeting, but the team is seeking to put Scherzer on the front line.
It would be Scherzer's thirty-fourth appearance in the first line-up. The competitor took part in Thursday's kick-off training and hopes to perform on Sunday.
The Washington team's right-hand goalkeeper scores 18-7 and ERA 2.53. He eliminated the batsmen 300 times and counted 220 and 2/3 rounds in the season.
So Trump in West Virginia?
Trump did not directly refer to his nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a judge of the Supreme Court, discussing the importance of Republican attendance in the mid-presidential elections.
“In November, we’re putting all of our achievements at risk.
One of the most important choices in our lives is that we are separated by five weeks.
Although I don’t start, I remain very active. I am constantly defending our great candidates,” he said.
He continued: “We are dealing with a terrible group of radical Democrats, and we see their actions with our own eyes.
They're determined to take power by any means possible, they're subjugated and malicious.
They don't care who they hurt and who they have to hurt to gain power and control. Taking power and control is their goal, but we won't give it to them."
As he said, the Democrats are carrying out the mission of “setting resistance and hindering activity.”
"It's been very good to see it in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "evil, malignant, unpleasant and unbelievable."
The president referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee, calling on the name and the name of the U.S. Senator from the Democratic Party Dianne Feinstein, which met with a loud outcry from the crowd.
“Do you remember her answer?
Are you responsible for leaking the document?
“Uh, do I listen?
No... that means... no." Her body language was fatal. It was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a grouping of people of different opinions.
The party is intolerant of people expressing their own opinions
When Momentum activists in my party voted to give me a nagana, I was not surprised.
Finally, I am a member of a group of Labour Members who have been told recently that they are not welcome, and all this because of their own opinions.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, has met with similar treatment because she has opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the request for granting a nagana stemmed from a difference of opinion between me and Jeremy Corbyn.
The differences concerned the importance of responsible economic policy, national security and Europe. As to the irony of fate, Jeremy Corbyn objected to the position of previous leaders on these issues.
In the announcement of Friday’s meeting of Labour Party MPs from Nottingham East County, it was read: “We want the meetings to be open and productive.”
In my eight years as a member of the Labour Party, most of the Friday afternoon meetings of the General Committee looked like this.
Unfortunately, many meetings are currently taking place in a different way: the promise of a "softer and more gentler" policy has long been forgotten, as long as it has ever been remembered.
It is becoming increasingly obvious that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party. Each opinion is assessed in terms of compliance with the leadership of the party.
It all started shortly after Jeremy Corbyn took over as chairman. The colleagues, for whom I thought we had similar views, began to expect me to change the direction of the EU and to take positions that I would not have agreed with earlier.
After every public speech – regardless of the content – I meet on social media with attacks calling for nominations, denunciation of centristism or leaving the Labour Party.
This is not just my experience.
I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments addressed to me are rather political in nature.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who experience treatment in a sexist or racist way every day, but do not avoid further action.
One of the most disappointing aspects of the current policy is the shift to the agenda with the insult of others.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said that the Labour Party should support a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we are no longer a grouping of people of different opinions. With every request for a “vote of distrust” and every change in the principles of party choice, the world view is restricted.
Over the past two years, I have been repeatedly suggested not to tilt and silence certain issues. Then everything would be "okay".
That’s not why I’m involved in politics.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student as a result of Margaret Thatcher’s government’s negligence that led to the collapse of my school class, I’ve been trying to take care of better quality public services for people in need – both as a local councillor and a minister.
I have never concealed my beliefs, even during the last election campaign.
Everyone in Nottingham East knew my position and knew about differences of opinion with the party authorities.
To those who have supported Friday’s proposal, I want to say that I cannot understand the desire to waste time and energy on the issue of my loyalty to the Labour leader in the face of the impending Brexit, which will harm households and households.
The most important message, however, is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents (both Labour Party members and others): I am proud that I can serve you. I promise that no threat of retiring your nominations or your temporary political goals will dissuade me.

Ayr vs Melrose 38:17 – undefeated Ayr again up
The two late appearances may have made the finals somewhat worse, but there’s no doubt that Ayr’s team deserved a victory in this extremely interesting Scottish extraliga match.
The team came in first place in the table and remains the only undefeated team.
In the end, this outstanding defense and better use of opportunities led the host team to victory. Coach Peter Murchie could be pleased with his underdogs.
"The matches so far have been a challenge for us, but we are still undefeated, so I'm happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of the Melrose team said: “We have to respect the Ayr players. They have taken better than we have taken advantage of the opportunities.”
Ayr went on the lead in the 14th minute after applying for Grant Anderson and raising Frazier Clima. However, the yellow card for Scotsman Rory Hughes, who came to the team from the Glasgow Warriors, allowed Melrose to score a goal after a win.
Climo increased Ayr's lead after kicking out of the penalty shootout just before the end of the first half. He first won the draw, and later took the chance to raise, scoring a score of 17:5 for Ayr.
Melrose got a good start in the second half, and the imposition of Patrick Anderson raised by Baggot reduced the loss to five points.
Then there was a longer stoppage of the game due to a serious injury to Ruaridha Knott. The competitor was removed from the field on the nose. After the reinstatement, Ayr increased the lead after the introduction of Stafford McDowall and increased the Climate.
In the following order, the team captain Ayr Blair Macpherson received a yellow card. Melrose again used his number: applying with an unused attempt to raise Bruce Colvin reduced the lead.
The hosts took the initiative when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for letting Clima go without the ball. MacPherson gained an imminent backing defense.
Climo took advantage of the chance to raise. He then again managed to raise the score just after the game resumed, when Kyle Rowe caught the shot from the penalty shootout and allowed wingman Gregor Henry to win the fifth draw for the host.
Star of the series Still Game Begins a Career in the Gastronomy Industry
Ford Kieran, the star of the series Still Game, seems to be starting business in the gastronomic industry. It has recently been discovered that he has become the director of a company that runs restaurants.
The 56-year-old actor plays the role of Jack Jarvis in the popular sitcom of the BBC. He plays and co-creates the series together with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duet announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last in the history of the series. Everything indicates that the Ford Kiernan is already planning the future after leaving the "Craiglang".
According to official data, he became the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the matter, though the whistleblower Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan was trying to engage in the “developing gastronomic industry” in Glasgow.
"The sea belongs to us": deprived of access to the sea Bolivia is alive hope that the court will reopen its way to the Pacific
Marines patrol the area around the naval base in La Paz.
There are blue flags from public buildings.
In the ports of the navy from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the following motto appears: “The sea is ours by law.
It is our duty to recover it.”
In the inaccessible Bolivian sea, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in a bloody 19th-century conflict of resources is still alive. It’s like a dream of a renaissance in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps the highest in several decades. Bolivia is awaiting the judgment of the International Court of Justice. It is to be issued on 1 October after a five-year trial.
“Bolivia’s actions are becoming more and more depressed. The residents are unanimous, optimistic and count on a favorable verdict,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians across the country will be watching the International Court of Justice meeting together. They hope that the organization based in The Hague will recognize the claim of Bolivia and after decades of sealess talks, Chile will have to join non-negotiating countries.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia, who is set to face a controversial re-election fight next year, is also hopeful in Monday’s ruling.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he swore at the end of August.
Some analysts, however, argue that the chances of a verdict favourable to Bolivia are small and that even a favorable decision would not change much.
The United Nations body, headquartered in The Hague, does not have the authority to grant Bolivia the territory of Chile. It has also reserved that it will not affect the establishment of any talks.
As Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert on international law, said, the decision of the International Court of Justice will be issued six months after the submission of the final arguments. Such a short time shows that the case "was not complicated".
Unfortunately, Bolivia has been able to distance the country from its destination for the last four years.
“The issue of access to the sea has been addressed by the current Bolivian administration,” said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate.
Morales’s irresistible rhetoric has deprived the Chileans of any remains of goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume talks at some point, but this will be very difficult in the face of the current situation.
There has been no exchange of ambassadors in both countries since 1962.
Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, the former president and representative of Bolivia in The Hague, disagreed with the view that the court’s decision-making process was extremely fast.
Monday will bring Bolivia “a unique opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and an opportunity to “end a 139-year period of disputes with mutual benefit,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales — still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents — was using the theme of access to the sea as an element of political play.
“Bolivia will never give up the right of access to the Pacific,” he added.
“Judgement is a great opportunity to convince ourselves that we have to deal with the past.”
North Korea’s leaders say that nuclear disarmament will not happen until they can trust the United States to do so.
North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, says his people will never get rid of nuclear weapons as long as they can trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to deliver on the promises made at the summit in Singapore between the leaders of the two countries.
His comments came at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the brink of resuming suspended nuclear diplomacy more than three months after meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Une.
Ri argues that it is as if the lack of abolition of sanctions and U.S. opposition to the declaration ending the Korean War has ever put North Korea on its knees.
Washington does not want to agree to sign the declaration without Pyongyang taking specific disarmament steps in advance.
Both Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump want another meeting.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about the elimination of the arsenal, which is seen in North Korea as the only security-guaranteed measure.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month as part of preparations for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows announce the advent of the latest line of large headwear in clothing stores.
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or completely disguise yourself from the sun, then we have good information for you.
Fashion designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of crazy, oversized headgear that were part of their summer collection for 2019, which shined in style during Paris Fashion Week.
Incredibly impractical hats were featured on Instagram this summer. The aforementioned designers decided to present their stunning creations on the runway.
The distinctive work of Valentino was a huge beige hat decorated with a wide, feathery round that flooded the heads of models.
Other extra-size accessories included jeweled shrubs, a wizard’s hat, and even pineapple —but they weren’t designed to warm up the head.
Thom Browne also showed a number of strange masks — at the same time for Halloween.
Many colored masks had a sewn mouth and resembled more of the Hannibal Lecter style than haute couture.
One creature resembled diving equipment with a tube and glasses, and the other looked like melted ice.
And if you don't want to break up with great fashion, you're in luck.
Observers of styles predict that huge hats can get to clothing stores.
The oversized hats follow the “La Bomba”, a straw hat with a 61 cm wide round, which everyone has already worn – from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic brand that stands behind this extremely impractical hat, which has flown through social media, presented another great creation at the end — a sandbag almost as big as a model wearing a swimsuit.
The burnt orange raffle bag, finished with raffle flanges and finished with a white leather handle, stood out in the Jacquemus La Riviera collection for the summer season 2019 during the fashion week of Paris Fashion Week.
Luke Armitage, a star stylist, told FEMAIL: “I expect big hats and beach bags to appear in stores next summer — because the designer managed to make such a big impact, it would be hard not to use the accelerator.”
John Edward: Language Skills Necessary for the Citizens of the World
Independent schools in Scotland are constantly enjoying their scientific achievements — in 2018, they were able to boast of further excellent exam results, supported by individual and collective successes in sport, art, music, and more.
Represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) schools, attended by more than 30,000 students across Scotland, strive to provide the best level of service to students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further and higher education, the career path they have chosen, and to indicate their role as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector with the opportunity to develop and implement a curriculum tailored to the needs of the school, we see that modern languages are still popular and desirable subjects to choose from in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you speak to another man in a language he understands, then it comes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it comes to his heart.”
It is a clear reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The results of this year’s final exam show that languages rank first in the league rankings, with the highest performance rates in the case of independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who learned foreign languages received a higher A rating.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students had a higher A rating in Mandarin, and 72 percent of German learners, 69 percent of French learners and 63 percent of Spanish learners also had an A rating.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills, which children and young people will no doubt need in the future.
Currently, the study of languages, as subjects of choice, is conducted in the same scope as the study of STEM subjects (strict sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics) within the teaching programmes in independent schools and in other places.
A 2014 survey conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills (UK Commission for Employment and Skills) found that 17 percent of job vacancies were due to a lack of language skills for employers.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly becoming a necessity to prepare young people for the start of a professional career.
These skills are essential in a globalised world with an increasing number of jobs requiring language proficiency,
A lifelong skill, like learning a second language, will provide a huge advantage in the future – no matter what career path it takes.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically increases the chances of a multilingual person in relation to the competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey, which involved more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75% of them were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, and French was the only language with a percentage of 1 percent of the people using it.
That’s why investing in teaching foreign languages is so important for today’s children.
Knowledge of several languages, in particular the languages of developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding the right job.
In Scotland, each school will be different in terms of the languages taught in it.
Many schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered to be the most important for the UK in the 2020 perspective, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the child’s interest, in independent schools there will always be many languages to choose from, which will be taught by specialized teaching staff in this area.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a teaching environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed — no matter what the future holds for them.
At present, it cannot be denied that in the international business environment, languages are still crucial to the future of the country, so it must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should be treated as “international communication skills” (international communication skills).
Independent schools will continue to offer Scottish youth a wide choice, diversity, and level.
You just have to.
John Edward, Chairman of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron made his debut for the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
Fans looking to see the debut of LeBron James at the Los Angeles Lakers have finally met.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that LeBron James will play a Sunday pre-season game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It is not yet known how many minutes he will play.
"More than one, but less than 48," Walton said on Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said on Twitter that James is likely to play an incomplete number of minutes.
After training, which took place earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six pre-season Lakers matches.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need to take part in pre-season games to prepare,” he said.
So Trump's election in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is kicking off a series of ballots tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It will be Trump’s first of five scheduled election ceremonies to take place next week, along with positions in places friendly to him, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote confirming his suspension of his election to hold a vacancy in the Supreme Court, Trump seeks to build support in the upcoming midterm elections because Republicans could threaten to lose control of Congress when the votes are cast.
What time will Trump’s election night take place in West Virginia and where will he be able to watch it online?
So the Trump election in Wheeling, West Virginia, will take place today at 7:00 p.m., that is, on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
So the election Trump in West Virginia will be able to follow live on the Internet on YouTube.
Trump is likely to speak about this week’s hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who took place in a tense atmosphere over accusations of misconduct against a sexual background, as well as alleged sexual misconduct in a foreseeable vote.
However, the main goal of this series of electoral rallies is to provide support to Republicans facing the difficult November elections.
So President Trump’s five-century campaign next week is aimed at “mobilizing volunteers and supporters to help Republicans protect and expand the majority in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
"Congress control is such an important point in the president's schedule that as the hottest campaign season approaches, he will visit as many states as possible," Trump's campaign spokesman, who declined to give his name, told Reuters.
Today's election night at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling may attract supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as the attention of the Pittsburgh media" — West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, Trump will visit West Virginia — a state in which he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016 — for the second time last month.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia’s Senate candidate, Republican Patrick Morrisey, who is losing the polls.
“This is not a good sign for Morrisey when the president comes to support him in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a West Virginia University political scientist.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team shows the spirit of struggle while maintaining hope for victory in Sunday's singles
After three one-sided sessions, the foursome format held on Saturday afternoon could be what the Ryder Cup needed.
The rolling suspension is a completely inventive sporting concept, but one that the athletes really believe in, and already most in such competitions as these.
So what does their dispersion look like at the moment?
“They’ve led by six points and now they’re only leading by four, so I think we have a small gap,” Spieth said.
Europe, of course, has four points, while there are twelve more to be won.
The Americans, however, feel the wind in the sails and have patterns worthy of imitation, especially in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day long and each of them could boast of gaining three points out of four.
Spieth is dangerous in all areas and gives an example.
The screams over the entire throat, which were a sign of excitement, became louder during the course of his round, sinking a key put and winning the match when he and Thomas won two holes in two hits.
His reflection on the ground, which gave them a victory with a score of 15, met with a similar cry — one that makes it clear that the American team is still in play.
“It’s enough to focus and worry about your own game,” Spieth said.
That’s all there is to each of these players.
Eighteen holes to win.
The only players who have scored more points in the last two days than Spieth and Thomas were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable history of the Ryder Cup.
A strange but lovely pair of the European team won four out of four and was not mistaken.
"Moliwood" is the only couple that didn't include the bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided the bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
The way the game is played and how their energy seems to flow both to and from the noisy crowd proves that you must beat these players on Sunday, and also that there is no better player than Fleetwood or Molinari, who could seal the potential victory of the Golfeurope National team.
It would be better if they were playing in different holes at the same time.
However, it is too early to talk about the victory of the European team.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly played Sergio Garcia, the morning fourball hero, when he was shot with Alex Noren.
Bogey and a double on the front nine dug Spain and Sweden into a hole they would never get out of.
There's no one on Sunday who can help get out of the hole.
Fourball and foursome formats are so fascinating due to the interactions between the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give, and how a change of strategy can occur at one point.
Europe played better as a team so far and took a significant lead on the last day, but the foursome also showed that the U.S. team has a tight grip on the fight in which some, especially in the United States, doubted.
Europe with a score of 10-6 includes the lead in the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe with a significant advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after winning 10-6 Saturday's fourball and foursome games with the United States.
Inspired by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, the duo won two victories over Tiger Woods, increasing their previous score at Le Golf National to four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, trying to keep the trophy he lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the low-cost American team in the morning fourball format, winning the series with a score of 3-1.
The U.S. put up more resistance in the foursome format, winning two matches, but could not regain the loss.
To keep the trophy, the Jim Furyka team must earn eight points out of the 12 singles that will take place on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant to score four points in a row, while together with Molinarim (this team was named "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend) they are only the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points in four.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed in a fourball format in great style, they beat out-pomped Woods and American debutant Bryan Dechambeau, achieving an even more empathic 5&4 score.
Woods, who was tired of two games on Saturday, occasionally showed a brilliant genius, but has so far lost 19 out of 29 games in fourball and foursome formats, seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who did not take part in the morning fourball format, returned to Henrik Stenson in the foursome format to beat 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka — taking world rankings 1 and 3 respectively.
However, not everything went well for the European team on this pleasant, cold day on the field to the south-west of Paris.
Three-time main winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a benchmark for the Americans, scoring two points on Saturday.
They won a decisive 2&1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourball format and later returned to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4&3 in foursome format, losing two holes opening.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has it happened that the team made a four-point loss, starting the singles, although the Furyk team would only have been relegated to retain the trophy.
However, taking second place two days ago, Sunday’s counterattack seems to be rather unlikely.
North Korea says it is “resolutely not” to unilateral disarmament without confidence.
North Korea’s foreign minister said on Saturday during a speech at the United Nations that the lack of lifting sanctions only deepens North Korea’s lack of confidence in the United States and there is no way for the country to unilaterally give up such nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho said at the annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken “significant measures of goodwill” last year, such as a halt to nuclear and missile tests, the dismantling of the nuclear test site, and a commitment to nuclear technology and non-proliferation.
“But we don’t see any concrete response from the United States,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no guarantee of our national security, and in such circumstances there is no talk of unilateral disarmament of North Korea.”
While Ri reiterated North Korea’s well-known grievances about Washington’s “stage” denuclearization approach, under which North Korea would be rewarded for unilaterally taking action, his statement did not appear to have been made unilaterally.
Ri referred to the joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit in history between the president of the United States and the leader of the North Korean People's Republic of Korea, which took place on 12 June in Singapore, Koepaon, and Koepaon in Singapore, when it was Kim Jong Un's work.
North Korea expected a formal end to the Korean War (1950–1953), but the U.S. delegation announced that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also backed calls for easing tough international sanctions on North Korea.
“The United States insists on ‘denuclearization first’ and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal by forcibly, even opposing the signing of the ‘declaration of an end to the war,’” Ri said.
“The belief that sanctions can put us on our knees is the hate of people who act ignorantly towards us.
The problem, however, is that the lack of abolition of sanctions deepens our distrust.”
Ri did not mention the plans for a second summit between Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, which the U.S. leader spoke about earlier this week at the UN forum.
Instead, the minister drew attention to three meetings between Kim Jong Un and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, after which he added: “If P<0xC5><0x82>opu<0xC5><0x84>ski was a party to the denuclearization of Kop<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x9B><0xC4><0x87>, South Korea was not a party to the denuclearization.”
To me, the tone of Ri’s speech was completely different from last year when he said at the UN General Assembly that targeting North Korea’s missiles in the territory of the United States was “unavoidable” to Trump’s self-defense after the “Mr Evil” president.
This year, at the UN forum, Trump, who last year threatened “total destruction” of North Korea, praised Kim Jong Un for his courage to take steps to disarm, but also said that he would not have to put a lot of work into his hands.
On Wednesday, Trump said he hadn’t set a timeframe for it, saying: “Whether it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia say the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for taking the steps it has taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday at the UN Security Council forum that “the enforcement of the Security Council sanctions must be continued and continual until we find a complete, definitive and verified denuclearization.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously tightened sanctions against North Korea, trying to snatch funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear program and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly forum and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month as part of preparations for the second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit cannot be called a success.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying progress had been made, after which within a few hours North Korea condemned him for “setting gangster demands.”
North Korea pledged to meet with Moon Jae-in this month to dismantle the missile test site and the nuclear complex if the United States takes “appropriate measures.”
He said Kim Jong Un told him that the “appropriate measures” he cared about were the security guarantees that Trump pledged to ensure in Singapore, and steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard Students Attend a Course on Properly Long-Term Rest
The new course at Harvard University, which took place this year, provided all students with more sleep, aimed at combating the growing macho culture of learning by “all-night caffeine-driven students.”
Academic students from the best university in the world often have no idea about the basics of self-care.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has developed a course that he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to create the course by giving a speech on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“At the end of the speech, a girl approached me and said, ‘Why do I get told that only now that I’m in my last year of study?’
She said that no one ever told her about the meaning of sleep, which surprised me,” the Telegraph said.
During the course, which was held for the first time this year, students are explained how good sleep-related habits help achieve good results in science and sports, as well as improve the overall well-being of students.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health service, said the course was decided to be introduced after it was found that students suffered from a severe lack of sleep within a week.
The hourly course includes a number of interactive tasks.
One section includes a picture of the room in the academy, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, exercise, and books to get information about the effects of caffeine and light, and how sleep deprivation affects sports performance, as well as how important it is to regulate sleep.
In another section, participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
“We know that this will not lead to an immediate change in student behavior.
But we believe they have a right to know — just as everyone has a right to know what the health consequences of smoking cigarettes are,” added Professor Czeisler.
A culture of pride from “all-night science” still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students means an increasing problem of sleep deprivation.
Providing enough good quality sleep should be the student’s “secret weapon” to combat stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, and even to avoid gaining weight, because lack of sleep causes the brain to go into a state of starvation, starving the student.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemistry and physics, helped Professor Cheisler develop the course after taking part in one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to push for the introduction of the course for the whole campus.
The next step, according to him, is to invite all postgraduate students to complete a similar degree program before moving on to a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set an alarm reminding when to go to sleep and when to get up, as well as being aware of the harmful effects of the “blue light” emitted by the screens of electronic devices and lighting problems with LEDs.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga takes care of Gerrard
The Rangers suffered once again during a fight on the way out of Livingston, when Dolly Menga with his shot led to the defeat of dismantled team Steven Gerrard, scoring 1-0.
The team at Ibrox Stadium wanted to record their first win since the February 4-1 triumph over St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team defeated Gerrard in 18 games for the second time, resulting in a difference of eight points for his team, the Premier League.
Menga shot a goal seven minutes before the end of the first half, and the Rangers' lack of involvement didn't seem to improve.
While the Rangers saw a drop to sixth place, Livingston climbed to third place — just behind Hibernian with a one-goal loss.
The Rangers team may have further difficulties due to the need to provide for the head injury of line judge Calum Spence after he was hit with an object thrown from the guest mode.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, leading Ayr to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, in turn, went through with the same eleven-year-old Livingston, who took the Hearts point last week, being delighted with the way his well-trained team bored his opponents every step of the way.
The Rangers may have dominated possession of the ball, but the Livingston team did more with the ball when they got it.
They should have scored in just two minutes, when Menga's first set-up allowed Scott Pittman to face Allan McGregor's goal, but the assistant didn't take his chance.
Keaghan Jacobs then directed a deep free kick to Captain Craig Halkett, but his fellow defender Alan Lithgow could only remain in the back position.
The Rangers regained control in the third quarter, but it looked like they had more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he had to face a penalty kick fifteen minutes before the end of the game, when he and Steven Lawless fell on each other, but Judge Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian claim.
The Rangers managed to give away only two customs shots in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly barely worried about Lassana Coulibaly's head and Ovie Ejaria's weak shot.
While Livingston's 34-minute goal opening match could have been against the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved to him for the effort he put into winning.
Again, the Rangers failed to cope with a deep, steady piece of the game made by Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher threw the ball at Scott Robinson, who kept calm by giving it to Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard did not empty the break and replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent — this replacement almost immediately had an impact on the wingman who threw the ball into Morelos, but the impressive Kelly managed to block it, getting out of his position.
The Livingston team continued to attract guests to the game exactly as they liked when Lithgow and Halkett performed long sets one after the other.
Holt's team could have increased the lead in the last few minutes, but McGregor did well in front of Jacobs, after which Lithgow pulled the game off the corner.
The Rangers' reserve, Glenn Middleton, had once again hoped for a penalty kick when he was confused with Jacobs, but Thomson turned his eye again.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now the page from our edition “Sunday Morning” Almanac: September 30, 1882 — 136 years ago... the day on which the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which eventually led to the creation of a device known as a Geiger counter.
Since then, Geiger's counter has become both an element of science and pop culture, as in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, in which these seemingly unlikely cowboys-scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans performed:
Man: “What the hell is that?”
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter that is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
“When you put on these headphones, you’ll hear the effects of atoms emitted by radioactive minerals.”
Evans: “Now I hear something!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name has survived to this day.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “watch” enemy cells.
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach Your Immune System to “Watch” Enemy Cells and Destroy Them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize enemy cells in the course of treatment.
This method consists of excreting immune cells from the patient and changing them into a laboratory.
Then they can "detect" the protein common to many cancers. Then they are injected back into the body.
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of tumours.
In one woman who was given the vaccine to identify enemy cells to the immune system, ovarian cancer was observed to disappear for more than 18 months.
The method is to extract the immune cells from the patient, change them in the laboratory so that they can “watch” a protein common to many cancers called HER2, and then inject those cells again to the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that this vaccine is very well-suited.”
HER2 “drives the growth of several types of cancers,” including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach to taking immune cells from patients and “learning” their localization of cancer cells worked in the treatment of a certain type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarks on a pro-Trump diatribe on Saturday Night Live — with a MAGA hat on his head.
It didn't go too well.
Kanye West was “exploded” in the studio during the Saturday Night Live program after praising U.S. President Donald Trump and saying he would run for office in 2020.
After performing his third track, Ghost Town, which featured a hat with the cap “Make America Great,” he held a demonstration against the Democrats and again voiced his support for Trump.
“Every time I talk to white people, I hear, ‘How can you like Trump? It’s racist!’”
“If I was concerned with racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL program began with a sketch with Matt Damon, in which a Hollywood star ridiculed Brett Kavanaugh's testimony filed before the Senate Judiciary Committee on allegations of sexual assault filed by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, West's video was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is not known if Rock wanted to make West laugh by posting a post.
In addition, West complained to the public that behind the scenes he had problems with his hat.
“They took me behind the scenes.
They told me not to go out with that hat on my head.
They've got me!
And then they say I have no way out,” said the Washington Examiner.
West continued, “You say I have no choice?”, adding, “I’m going to put on a superman’s pellet so you can’t tell me what to do. You want the world to go forward?
Let's accept it."
His words twice caused the audience to “crush” and members of the SNL team looked troubled, Variety reports. A person in the studio during these events said: “The studio had a grave silence.”
West was invited to the show in place of singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West intrigued many with the performance of I Love it in the Perrier water bottle dressing.
West received support from TPUSA's conservative leader, Candace Turner, who posted the following tweet: "To one of the most daring: CHOOSE TO STAND YOUR MAFIA".
Talk show host Karen Hunter said on Twitter that West was “just himself and it’s absolutely great.”
“However, I will NOT reward people (by buying their music or clothing or supporting their ‘arts’) who, I believe, accept and disseminate ideology that is harmful to my community.
It's free.
We are also free,” he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and that he is now “formally named Kanye West.”
However, he is not the first artist to change his name — he follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
A friendly rapper, Snoop Dogg, took the name Snoop Lion, and music legend, Prince, changed the name to a symbol, and then the artist formerly known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder over stabbed in Belfast restaurant <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after he stabbed a man in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police say.
The defendant is due to appear in court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the prosecutor's office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington raises the issue of toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the medieval HBO series Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor hit a macho hero stereotype, saying that showing such roles on the screen causes young boys to often think they have to play hard to be respected.
In an interview with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit stated that “something went wrong” and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones partner, 31-year-old actress Rose Leslie, has admitted that she feels “quite sure” about it.
“Personally, I feel pretty confident at this point — where did we make a mistake on the subject of masculinity?” he said.
“What did we teach men as they grew up, looking at the problem we’re dealing with right now?”
Kit believes that the development of toxic masculinity may be partly responsible for television because of the portrayal of very male characters.
He continued: “What attitudes are innate, and what are taught?
What does it teach on television and on the streets, which makes young boys start to think they have to stand on a certain side to be a man?
I think this is one of the most important issues of our time — what can be done to change that?
It is clear that not everything is going well with the young men.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would no longer play in any prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones after the series ended next year, saying that he had “finished the battlefields and horses.”
From November, Kit will play Sam Shepard’s “True West,” a story about the filmmaker and his brother, the thief.
The actor recently revealed that he considers meeting his wife Rose to be the best thing that ever happened to him in Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife on the plan, which provided me with my future family and a new life,” he said.
In this multiple Emmy Award-winning fantasy series, Rose played Ygritte — the object of love interest of Kita’s character, Jon Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 on Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
Previous articleHIV/AIDS: China Reports 14 Percent Increase in New Cases
China has announced a 14 percent increase in the number of people living with HIV and suffering from AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected by this problem, according to the country’s health services.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted by gender, which means a change from the past.
Traditionally, the HIV virus spreads rapidly in some parts of China as a result of transfusion of infected blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced almost entirely, according to Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, year on year, the number of people living with HIV and suffering from AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is widespread.
Taking into account the country’s conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry a woman.
Many cases of transmission of the disease result from insufficient protection when having sex in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has provided widespread access to HIV drugs as part of efforts to combat this problem.
Maxine Waters denies that one of her team members has disclosed the data of Republican Senators — “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theory.”
U.S. House of Representatives member Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that a member of her team had posted the personal data of three Republican senators on Wikipedia’s lawmakers’ pages.
A member of the Los Angeles Democratic Party said the accusations were made by experts and websites linked to “ultra-right wing.”
“Lies, lies, and even more vile lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information reportedly included home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch from Utah.
The information was posted on the Internet on Thursday by an unidentified person on the Capitol during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of sexual offences against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred some time after Kavanaugh’s candidacy was questioned by three senators.
Conservative parties such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was linked to the Waters office and published information about a member of the Waters team — Hill reports.
“This baseless accusation is completely false and it’s a 100 percent lie,” Waters said.
“A member of my team — whose identities, personal data and security have been violated as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations — was not in any way responsible for the leakage of this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and it is a 100-percent lie.”
Waters’ statement quickly sparked criticism on the Internet, including by Ari Fleischer, a former White House press spokesman.
“This kind of denial is bad,” Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that she doesn’t have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn’t do, they can’t be wrong.
It can't provoke.
He cannot question the motives of the person making the accusation.
He has to be calm for that.”
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters’ reaction to Democrats’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of exaggerating his anger during Thursday’s hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate starting in midterm elections to replace Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
“It’s a terrible thing if it’s true,” he tweeted.
Waters said in a statement that her cabinet had notified “the competent authorities and law enforcement authorities of these fraudulent allegations.”
“The perpetrators will be exposed and brought to legal responsibility for all their actions that pose a threat to any member of my team,” she said.
Review of Johnny English: Nokaut — a spy parody with a weakened Rowan Atkinson
Looking for references to Brexit in every new film with a British twist has already become the norm. This seems to apply to the new part of the action film series and comedy "Johnny English", which began in 2003 with the film "Johnny English" and which returned to the screen with the film "Johnny English".
Will the self-sacrificing satire about how hopeless we are become the new export commodity of the country?
In any case, eternally surprised, characterised by a rubber face, incompetent Johnny English has again received a license to participle — his name and name more than anything else indicates that he is an elaborate, comical product intended for non-English viewers.
He is of course a stupid secret agent who, despite his bizarre fondness for smoothie glamour, has a little bit of Inspector Clouseau, a pinch of Jasia Fasoli, and a drop of this guy who adds one note to the yearly melody of Loghnye’s 2012 opening theme in Chariots of Fire Cere.
In the past, he was also a traveler and a world-class mystery man — Atkinson once played in the already forgotten Barclaycard television commercials, in which he left behind chaos.
In the latest video from the Johnny English series, one or two moments are worth noting.
I really liked the scene where Johnny English approached the helicopter, dressed in a medieval weapon, while his helmet was rhythmically struck by the rotor blades.
You can clearly see Atkinson’s gift of physical comedy play, but the sense of humor seems to be quite low-flying and unnecessary, especially since now also “serious” film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible, offer comedy-like elements.
The humorous elements seem to be aimed at children rather than adults — in my opinion Johnny English’s crazy adventures are not as ingenious and consistent as the gags in Atkinson’s such films about Jasi Fassoli.
The current assumption has always been that the United Kingdom is in serious trouble.
The cyberhacker penetrates into the British super-secret network of spies, revealing the identities of all British agents operating in the field — to scare the service agent, Kevin Eldon, who unfortunately played a small role.
This is the last drop in the spell of the bitter Prime Minister, who is a pathetic, wasted character already suffering as a result of a nervous breakdown caused by a lack of political popularity: Emma Thompson does everything in her power to scramble into the form of Theresa May, but she can't disperse the scenario.
Her advisers from the intelligence agency inform her that, due to the disclosure of the identity of all active spies, she will have to return to the service of one of the retired agents.
And that means Johnny English's incapacitated in his own person, now employed as a teacher in some elegant school, giving unofficial lessons on how to become a secret agent — a few great gags while giving English spying lessons.
English is called to Whitehall for a hearing, reuniting with his former assistant Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man attached to the commander of the submarine — a cheerful but somewhat tired character played by Vicki Pepperdine.
So, Batman and Robin of the secret service of Her Royal Majesty return to action, meeting the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova, a character played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is endangered by a charismatic tech billionaire maniac who claims he can solve Britain’s computer problems — it’s the villain Jason Volt, run by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their crusade of absurd situations: dressed as waiters set fire to a French restaurant; they enter chaos by smuggling on board a luxury Volta yacht; and English sets the scene of destruction as they use the set to become a virtual reality in order to catch up.
In this latter sequence all the limitations disappear, but despite the nice and rude performance, the whole film is very much like children's television.
Typical middle-aged.
As with other Johnny English films, I couldn’t resist the thought: can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really fits his talent?
The Labour Party denies that it is developing a plan that provides for the British a four-day week of work for which they will receive a salary in five days.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party will consider introducing a radical plan, under which the British will work four days a week, receiving a paycheck for five days.
The party reportedly wants company leaders to pass on savings to employees thanks to the artificial intelligence (AI) development revolution, giving them an extra day off.
Thanks to this, employees could enjoy a three-day weekend, earning the same amount of salary.
Sources say that this idea will “enter” into the party’s economic program and plans to leave the country in front of workers.
The transition to a four-day week of work was supported by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for employees to benefit from economic change.
A senior Labour Party member told The Sunday Times: “It is expected that by the end of this year there will be an announcement of a policy change.”
“This will not happen from day to day, but a four-day week of work is something that fits into the party’s approach to restoring economic equilibrium for the benefit of the employee, as well as into the overall industrial strategy of the party.
The Labour Party is not the first party to support such an idea — the Greens have pledged to introduce a four-day week of work during the 2017 election campaign.
At present, however, these plans are not supported by all members of the Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “The four-day week of work is not a party policy and its introduction is not considered by the party.”
John McDonnell, Chancellor of the Shadow Cabinet, used last week’s Labour Party conference to present his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from “faceless directors” and “speculators” in public utility companies.
The Chancellor’s plans from the shadow cabinet also mean that current shareholders of water companies may not regain their full share, as the Labour government could make “rewards” based on detected abuse.
He also confirmed plans to place employees on the boards of directors of companies and create integrative equity funds to transfer 10 percent of the company’s private sector equity to employees who receive annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy respond in 60 Minutes to the question of whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could cause them to change their mindset.
The FBI's investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week and prompted Senate Republicans to question whether the findings of the Bureau of Investigation could lead to an injunction.
In an interview on Sunday, Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could discover anything that could lead to a change in their attitudes.
Kennedy was more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
“When I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after how it happened, when the allegation came up, and I asked, "Did you do this?"
He was determined, determined and unequivocal.”
Graham's opinion, however, seems to be traced in stone.
“I’ve made a decision about Brett Kavanaugh, and to change it requires a strong charge,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett has definitely denied it," Graham added, addressing Christine Blasey Ford.
“None of the people who reported it could have verified it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't think anything will change."
What is the event of the Global Citizen Festival and has it contributed in any way to reducing the level of poverty?
Next Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival will take place in New York City, an annual music event that boasts an incredibly impressive cast of performing stars and an equally impressive mission – the eradication of poverty in the world.
The 7th Global Citizen Festival will be attended by tens of thousands of people attending the Great Lawn in Central Park to not only enjoy the performances of stars such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to support the achievement of the 30th anniversary of this event.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international group of anti-poverty activists by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To receive a free ticket for this event (unless it was decided to buy a VIP ticket), the concert participants had to perform a number of tasks or “actions” such as volunteering, sending an email message to the world leader, sending a message to the world leader, making a phone call or other important activities.
But what successes can Global Citizen be proud of in the 12 years remaining to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a good way to convince them to demand action, or another case of so-called “clickism” when people feel they’re doing something important by signing an online petition or posting a tweet?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, it has recorded more than 19 million “actions” of people supporting the action, aiming to achieve many different goals.
It also claims that these actions have helped motivate world leaders to announce commitments and regulations worth more than $37 billion that are expected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group relied on 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its activities, under which at least $10 billion has already been paid out or financed.
The group estimates that the safeguards so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK partnership of investors and developers committed to “helping children reach their full potential”, which promised to give Rwandans $35 million in aid to those citizens in the aftermath of their tweets.
“With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and members of Global Citizen like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition go down in history” — Tracey Ullman, 2018’s Power of Nutrition ambassador, during a concert.
The group also said that after carrying out more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve the quality of maternal and child nutrition, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional problems.
On one of the most frequently asked questions on his website, which was, “How can you be sure that you will be able to eliminate extreme poverty?”,
Global citizen responded: “It will be a long and difficult road — sometimes we will stumble and fail.
But just as with the great civil rights movements of the past and the struggle against apartheid, we will be successful because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are among the stars at this year’s event in New York, hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. Could Use Navy to ‘Block’ Russian Energy Exports — Secretary of the Interior <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Washington may "if necessary" run to its navy to prevent the influx of Russian energy into markets, including those in the Middle East, said U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke — Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia’s involvement in Syria — especially where it operates at the invitation of a legitimate government — is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is the desire to mediate in the energy trade, as is the case in Eastern Europe,” he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to solve this problem.
“The United States, through its navy, has the opportunity to ensure that the sea routes remain open and, if necessary, to create a blockade to ensure that their energy does not enter the market,” he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants of the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that calls itself the “voice of the energy consumer” in the United States.
He also compared Washington’s approach to Russia and Iran, noting that they are actually the same.
“The economic option of Iran and Russia is more or less about using and replacing fuels,” he said, comparing Russia to a “single trick-knowing dog” with a fossil fuel-dependent economy.
These statements came at a time when the Trump administration is continuing its mission to increase liquefied natural gas exports to Europe — a much cheaper option for European consumers compared to Russian gas.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the implementation of the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin a “slave” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion-dollar Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is to double its existing capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economical project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s fierce opposition to the implementation of the project is purely for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with the U.S. Secretary of Energy in the United States.
The position of the United States provoked a sudden reaction of Germany, which confirmed its commitment to the implementation of the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organisation, the Federation of German Industry (BDI), called on the United States to remain unaffected by the EU’s energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I think it's a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supplies," Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI), said after German Chancellor Angela Merkel's recent meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts senator, said she would consider running for president in 2020.
Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts senator, said on Saturday that she would consider running for president after the midterm elections.
During a meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering her candidacy.
“The time has come for women to go to Washington and fix the corrupt government, and that applies to women who hold the highest office,” she said.
“After November 6th, I will consider my candidacy for the post of president.”
During the meeting, Warren mentioned President Donald Trump, saying that he was “bringing the country in the wrong direction.”
“I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren without gardens has voiced criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted, “Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that most of Warren’s voters do not believe they should run for office in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts voters who voted for the option “probably” said the senator should not run for office, according to a poll conducted by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidacy.
The poll showed greater support for former governor Deval Patrick's candidacy — 38 percent of people supported his potential candidacy and 48 percent opposed it.
Other well-known names from the Democratic camp taken into account in relation to a potential 2020 candidacy are former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about PTSD (Track Palin’s) post-election stress disorder during Donald Trump’s age
The 26-year-old track Palin spent a year in Iraq after being drafted into the military in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
“What my own son is going through, what he has to go through when he comes back, I understand other families who are experiencing the effects of PTSD and the injuries our soldiers are going back with,” Trump said in a statement.
Palin called her son’s arrest a “taboo theme,” after which she said of her son and other military veterans: “They come back a little changed, they come back hardened, they come back, wondering if their fellow countrymen will be shown respect for what their fellow countrymen are doing and their fellow soldiers are doing.”
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against women, forcing them to make false statements in a report on domestic violence, and for possessing weapons in an immobile state, said Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and the District of Columbia support the fight against a new policy on granting asylum
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that refuses to grant asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives of 18 states and districts filed a letter in Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker struggling with this policy, according to NBC News.
The full name of the reason in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit, which the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy, has not been disclosed.
She said her partner “and his brutal gang sons” had insulted her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Prosecutors in Grace’s state described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where there are a large number of asylum seekers in the U.S., as countries facing widespread gang problems and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy repealed the 2014 Board of Immigration Appeals decision, which allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The Attorney General of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores state, federal and international law in force for decades".
“Federal law requires all asylum applications to be considered on the basis of specific facts and circumstances, and such a ban violates this principle,” the letter said.
Prosecutors further argued in the letter that a policy of refusing entry to immigrants harms the U.S. economy, claiming that they can become entrepreneurs and “convene the necessary labor force.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang-driven violence.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fear of racial, religious, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or having such and no other political convictions,” said Sessions in a statement.
Asylum was never meant to solve all the problems —even the serious ones— that people from all over the world face every day.
Desperate rescue attempts in Palu in a situation where the number of fatalities has doubled in a race aimed at finding survivors
For the survivors, the situation became more and more tragic.
“It’s a very intense feeling,” said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma’s mother, comforting her hot-tempered son at an evacuation center in the desolate city of Palu.
“Every minute the ambulance brings the body.
There is no clean water.”
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, searching for things that were flooded with water and trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5-degree earthquake, quickly filled up.
Some of the wounds, including the Two Haris, who had suffered a fracture of the spine and arm, rested outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside due to severe secondary shocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he recounted the violent earthquake that shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to escape.
I think I was squeezed into the rubble of the wall," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to the city for the wedding.
“I heard my wife calling for help, after which her voice was silenced.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they’re safe.”
The U.S. ambassador accuses China of “intimidating” propaganda.
A week after an official Chinese newspaper posted a four-page ad in a U.S. newspaper advocating mutual benefits from the U.S.-Chinese trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using U.S. propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the paid China Daily supplement in the Des Moines Register — Iowa’s most popular newspaper — accusing China of attempting to interfere in the U.S. Congressional elections, the U.S. president said.
Trump’s allegation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. election confirmed what U.S. officials told Reuters that this is a new stage in Washington’s escalating campaign aimed at putting pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements promoting trade with their countries, Beijing and Washington are currently escalating a trade war that has led to an increase in tariffs on reciprocal imports.
China’s retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were expected to affect exporters in states such as Iowa that supported the Trump Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of the state of Iowa — the main exporter of agricultural products to China — said Beijing had done damage to U.S. workers, farmers and entrepreneurs.
Branstad said in an article in the Sunday edition of the Des Moines Register that “China is now beginning to harass with double force by placing propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the respected American tradition of free speech and free press, placing paid advertising in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
For this, there will be no voices of opposition in the street kiosk in Beijing, and there will be no real reflection of the divergent views that the Chinese may have on the worrying economic direction of the Chinese-backed Chinese-backed Chinese-backed Chinese-backed Chinese-backed Chinese-backed Chinese-backed Chinese-backed party-backs.
He added that "one of China's most famous newspapers refused to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans infringe on midterm elections for women with the right to vote through Kavanaugh affair, analysts warn
While many leading Republicans support and arm Supreme Court-appointed Brett Kavanaugh in the face of several allegations of sexual assault, an analyst warns that your members will meet during impending midterm elections with a violent, special reaction.
The emotions associated with this event are extremely large, and most Republicans already want to officially vote.
“This can’t be reversed,” said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School at the University of Syracuse.
Reeher said he had doubts as to whether Senator Jeff Flake’s (Arizona) efforts to conduct a last-minute FBI investigation were enough to reassure angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday — they will not forget it tomorrow and they will not forget it until November,” Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and spokeswoman for the national progressive group MoveOn, said on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted the slogan “November is coming,” demonstrating in the Senate Hall over the decision by Republicans overseeing the Judiciary Commission not to withdraw Kavanaugh’s nomination despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony, Mic said.
“The level of democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go beyond the scale,” said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, one of the news pages.
“People say it was already high — and it’s true.
But it can be higher, especially among undecided suburban women and younger voters between the ages of 18 and 29, who, although they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony, in which she detailed her allegations of sexual assault directed at the candidate to the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that if Republicans decided to approve the candidacy, it could be retaliatory.
“The Republican Party has to deal with a little mess,” Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier this week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about voting for the committee or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will be elected, it’s also about how the Republicans coped with the situation and how they handled Ford,” said Guy Cecil, director of the U.S. news channel Deboy.
However, the Americans seem to be a bit divided as to who to believe in in the face of Ford and Kavanaugh’s testimony, with the latter having a bit more support.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents firmly or rather believed Ford's testimonies, while 35 percent said they firmly or rather believed Kavanaugh's testimonies.
In addition, 38% of respondents said that Kavanaugh probably or certainly lied when testifying, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
Under pressure from Flake, the FBI has launched an investigation into Ford’s charges, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified last week under oath before the Senate Judiciary Commission that Kavanaugh had attacked her under the influence of alcohol at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed her his genitals during admission while studying at Yale University in the 1980s.
The creator of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet in order to compete with Google and Facebook platforms.
Tim Berners-Lee, creator of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google platforms.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on an open source platform — Solid — belonging to Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which individuals have access to specific information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the goal of creating Inrupt was “dominance over the world.”
“We have to do it now,” he said, referring to the start-up.
“The historic moment has come.”
The application uses Solid platform technology to allow people to create their own “personal data online store” or otherwise POD.
It can include contact lists, lists of things to do, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify available in one browser and at the same time.
The unique feature of an online store with personal data is that it is entirely up to the user who has access to what information.
The company calls this “personal empowerment through data.”
According to the company’s president, John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is to provide the resources, processes, and appropriate skills to help make the Solid platform available to all people.
The company is currently comprised of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several developers employed to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology makers around the world have been able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether to make a complete change that will turn all their business models upside down from day to day.
“Don’t ask them for permission.”
In a post posted on the Medium platform on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that “Inrupt’s mission is to deliver commercial energy and ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on the Solid platform.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has given much to the debate on net neutrality.
Inrupt Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
“I’m extremely excited about the next era of network development,” added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: The Victory of the Cross of the First World War
The memory of England’s only clergyman, who during World War I was awarded the Victory Cross, was commemorated 100 years later in his hometown.
Colonel Bernard Vann was awarded on September 29, 1918, for the conquest of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
He was killed by a sniper four days later, never knowing that he was awarded the highest British military order.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren unearthed a memorial stone during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said the unveiling of the stone on the 100th anniversary of his grandfather’s death had an “extraordinarily symbolic character.”
As reported by the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Pl. Vann led his battalion through the Canal Saint-Quentin “in a very dense fog and under a strong shot from the field and machine guns department.”
He then hastened to the line of fire and "with the greatest courage" led it forward, after which he single-handedly attacked the position of the field divisions, injuring three of them.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 — just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something that I would never be able to cope with, but at the same time something humble.”
Together with his brother, Dr. James Vann, he made a wreath at the end of a parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt “very honored to be able to participate in the parade” and added that “the courage of a true hero is manifested in the support he receives from many people.”
MMA fans didn’t sleep all night to watch the Bellator 206 gallon, instead they got Pig Peppa.
Imagine that you haven’t slept all night to watch the emotionally packed Bellator 206 galley and finally not be able to see the main battle.
The San Jose gala program featured 13 fights, including six on the main board, and was shown live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the fight, the audience in the UK was shocked to change the show to Pig Peppa.
Some were disappointed after not sleeping until the early hours of the morning, especially to see this fight.
One of the fans on Twitter described the switch to children's cartoons as "some sick joke."
“According to the government regulation, content of this type is inappropriate for it to be released at 6 a.m., which required a change to the children’s program,” said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, when asked about the transmission.
"Peppa pig, yes."
Bellator’s chief executive, Scott Coker, said they are working on a timetable to include viewers from the UK in the future.
“When I think about repeating the situation, I think we can fix it,” Coker said.
“But it’s Sunday morning, so we won’t be able to deal with it until Sunday according to our time, and Monday according to their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when there was a change of schedule there, we were flooded with a lot of comments, none of which sounded friendly.
We tried to fix it... we thought it was a technical flaw.
But it wasn’t just a legal issue.
I can promise you that this situation will never happen again.
We’re going to limit the program to five fights instead of six — that’s to the standard amount. We wanted too much to please the fans, and unfortunately, we overtook.
This is an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels “worse” because of sexuality
Tom Daley, an Olympic jumper, says he grew up feeling worse than everyone else because of his sexuality, but it gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize that not everyone was like him until he went to high school.
On the Desert Island Discs program of Radio 4, Lauren Laverne said he was talking about gay rights to give others “hope.”
He also said that being a parent made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the regular host of this long-running program, took a few months off due to illness.
While appearing on Laverne's show for the first time, Daley said that as he grew up, he felt "less valuable" than others because "the simultaneous liking of boys and girls was not socially acceptable".
He said, “To this day, it’s a feeling of less value and being different is something that gives me the strength to succeed.”
He said he wanted to prove that it was "something worth" so as not to disappoint everyone when they finally learn about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a prominent LGBT activist and has used his performance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he decided to express himself because he felt happy, being able to live openly, without any implication, and so wanted to give others “hope.”
The three-time world champion said falling in love with a man — the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 — was "surprised".
Daley married an Oscar winner (who is 20 years older than him) last year, noting that such a age difference was never a problem for him.
“When you go through so much at such a young age,” he meant his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father’s death from cancer three years later, “he said it was difficult for him to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar experiences.
The couple became the parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June. Daley said that his perception of certain things completely changed.
“Last year, the most important thing for me was to win a gold medal,” he said.
“And you know what? There are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My gold medal at the Olympics is Robbie.
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was dying, and one of the last things he asked was if they already had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics — he wanted to take the first place.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘You won’t be with us to be first, Dad,’” he said.
“I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing. It was only when he stopped breathing and died that I realized he wasn’t undefeated,” he said.
The following year, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“I knew that’s what I’ve dreamed of all my life — jumping into the water in front of a crowd of people at the Olympics — it was the best feeling possible,” he said.
It also inspired him to choose the first song — Proud performed by Heather Small — which accompanied him during the preparations for the Olympics and which continues to season him with goose skins.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 every Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson's lack of form on the bench during Saturday's Ryder Cup
Phil Mickelson will set a record for his 47th Ryder Cup game on Sunday, but he will have to work on his form so he doesn’t squeeze his heel.
Mickelson, who played for the twelfth time in a two-year event, was sent to the bench by captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourball and foursome games.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as was often the case with him in the United States team, the five-time main winner had to spend a day pinching the team and working on improving his game in the hopes of fixing the cause.
The 48-year-old, who has never given the simplest blows, even at the height of his career, is not doing very well on the narrow Le Golf National, where erroneous blows are relentlessly punished by long roughs.
And if the field itself is not discouraging enough for Michaelson, in the ninth game on Sunday he must face the precision of British Open winner Francesco Molinari, who joined forces with debutant Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games.
If the Americans (with a loss of four points at the beginning of the 12 singles) start the game with a vertebra, the Michaelson match may prove extremely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player — he couldn’t do anything else.
“He fully understood his role today, slammed me on my back, hugged me with his hand and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
"He's very confident.
He is in the gallery of fame and has brought a lot to the game of his teams both in the past and this week.
I didn't think he'd play two games.
I thought there'd be more of them, but that's how it went and we had to do it.
He wants to play all the time, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for the Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
This may mean the end of his career in the Ryder Cup, which has never matched his individual achievements.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven draws on his account. Furyk said his presence has contributed a lot to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, funny, funny, and it’s good to have him in the team room,” he explained.
“I think the younger players were having a good time with him this week, which was nice to see.
It’s a lot more than just a game.”
The captain of the European team Thomas Bjorn knows that the big point lead could soon shrink
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a significant point lead before the start of the singles on the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a difficult game.
The Dane made his debut in 1997 in a match at Valderrama, where, along with his companion, Vice-Chapter Seven Ballesteros, he had a five-point lead over the Americans, but the finish line passed by the shortest of the possible hairs, winning 142<0xE2><0x81><0x84>.
“It’s not to be forgotten that we had a big lead on the Valderrama field; we also had a big lead on the Brookline field, where we lost, and in the Valderrama field we only won by hair,” Bjorn said, in the photo, after winning the Golf, after giving a 10–3 National proc, in both.
Time will show me and all the members of the team that this is not over yet.
You'll do your best tomorrow.
Go out there and do everything right.
It will only end when the points appear on the board.
We have a goal, which is to win a trophy, and that's what we need to focus on.
“From the beginning, I’ve said that I’m focused on the 12 players who are on our side, but we also know very well who the people on the other side are — the best players in the world.”
Bjorn, excited about how his players handled themselves on the difficult field, added: “I wouldn’t have done it better.
But tomorrow is something else.
Tomorrow the singles start, and that’s a different matter.
It’s good to play with your partner when everything goes on your mind, but when you’re playing alone, your golfing skills are tested to the limit of opportunity.
The message that you need to convey to the players is to give your best tomorrow.
The partner must also do everything in his power.”
Jim Furyk, unlike Bjorn, will expect his players to score better on their own than when playing with a partner, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself experienced a big turnaround last day as a member of the winning team on the Brookline field, after which he suffered a defeat after the European team performed a “miracle on the Medinah field.”
“I remember every word,” said Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, in response to the question of how he warmed up his players to fight on the last day.
“Tomorrow we’re playing 12 important games — you’d like to start the game at a fast pace, like it was at Brookline and Medinah.
If this drive goes one way, it will put a lot of pressure on the midfields.
We set up our squad accordingly and set the boys up in a way that would allow us to enchant tomorrow.”
Thomas was entrusted with the task of leading the counterattack, facing Rory McIlroy in the main match, as well as Paul Case, Justin Rose, John Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter — other players in the European team.
“I’ve decided on this group of guys in this order because I think he’s going to be able to make it through the whole game,” Bjorn said of his singles.
New German Warship Delayed Again <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The latest German navy frigate should be put into service in 2014 to replace the aging warships from the Cold War, but it will not happen at least next year due to a locally-deficient media-like background in the system.
"Rheinland-Pfalz", the main ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate, has been moved to the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit, referring to the words of a military spokesman.
The ship was to be incorporated into the navy in 2014, but due to the problems that arose after delivery, it was necessary to make changes to this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class units ordered by the navy in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
Of course, they will be equipped with a powerful squadron, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-rotation missiles, as well as technological solutions that prevent detection, including reducing radar, infrared and acoustic traces.
Other important features include longer periods between maintenance and operation of new frigates, which should be possible for up to two years away from home ports.
Continuous delays mean, however, that these modern warships, which will allow Germany to respond to situations abroad, will be outdated by the time the service begins, Die Zeit notes.
The unfortunate F125 frigate appeared on the front pages of newspapers last year when the German navy officially refused to put the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned the ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the attack, but the German media reported a number of key "software and hardware leaks" that made the ship useless in the combat mission.
The shortcomings of the software were particularly significant, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships were to be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, which is half the size of the older Bremen-class frigates.
It also turned out that the ship is too heavy, which reduces its achievements and limits the ability of the navy to carry out future modernizations.
It is believed that the 7000-ton Rhineland-Palatinate is twice as heavy as the same class ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the defective equipment, the problem also becomes the cost of the entire project — including the training of the crew.
It is said to have reached an incremental level of EUR 3.1 billion (USD 3.6 billion), while the initial cost amounted to EUR 2.2 billion.
Problems with the deployment of the new frigates are of particular importance in the light of recent warnings that the force of the German navy is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the defence committee of the German parliament, admitted that the navy "will end up with ships capable of being used."
He also said that this problem has increased over time as a result of the withdrawal of old units without providing replacement ships.
In addition, he expressed his dissatisfaction with the fact that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates could be included in the naval fleet.
The National Trust investigates the secret life of bats
The new research on the Scottish Highlands estate is aimed at showing how bats use the landscape in the process of obtaining food. . . .
The results of the study are expected to shed new light on the behaviour of these exceptional flying mammals and help guide future actions to protect them.
Research conducted by researchers from the National Trust for Scotland will involve common and small dwarfs, as well as long-eared brown spotters and night-dwarfs from the ore family at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
In key locations around the property, special registrars will be placed in order to track the activity of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct field tests using portable detectors.
The objective of the expert sound analysis of all recordings is to determine the frequency of signals sent by bats and the behavior of individual species.
A habitat map and report will then be developed in order to create a detailed picture of their behavior on a landscape scale.
Rob Dewar, a wildlife advisor at NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important for bats and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help to identify the benefits of habitat management work, e.g. grassland development, as well as the best ways to maintain forest land for bats and other related species.
The population of bats in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom has declined significantly over the past century.
They are endangered by construction and development works that have an impact on the straits and the loss of housing.
Wind turbines and lighting installations can also pose a threat, as can flies stickers and some chemicals used in building materials, and even cats.
Butterflies aren't really blind.
However, due to nighttime hunting habits, their ears are more helpful than the eyes in catching the conquerors.
They use a complex eco-localization technique to search for worms and obstacles in their way.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It consists of ten trained experts, who regularly carry out surveys, herd checks, and sometimes even rescue actions.
The organization even established Scotland’s first and only dedicated bat reserve on the Thrave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland’s ten bat species.
David Thompson, the estate manager, says it's the perfect territory for bats.
“Threave has a great area for bats,” he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees and excellent habitats.
However, there are still many unknowns when it comes to bats. The work we do here and in other properties will help us better understand what they need to grow."
It underlines the importance of controlling the presence of spotters before they begin to carry out maintenance work on the estates, as the unintentional destruction of a single herd can kill up to 400 females and young people, which can lead to the extinction of the entire local population.
Bats are under protection —killing, harassing, or disturbing them, as well as destroying their nests, is illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish Bat Conservation Trust officer, encouraged the public to provide assistance.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many species, we don’t even know how their populations cope.”
Ronaldo denies charges of rape, while his lawyers intend to sue the German magazine <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Cristiano Ronaldo called the allegations of rape "fake news" against him, saying people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portuguese attacker Juventus was accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to Friday's Der Spiegel, the footballer was supposed to pay a woman $375,000 for silence.
Ronaldo (33), a few hours after the allegations were announced, in an Instagram live feed aimed at his 142 million followers, described the reports as “fake news.”
“No, no, no, no, no.
Today's reports are fake news," said the five-time winner of the gold ball.
“They want to promote themselves by using my name.
It's nothing new.
They want to be famous for saying my name, but that's part of my job.
I’m happy and everything is fine,” added the footballer with a smile on his mouth.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel magazine in connection with allegations they have called “unacceptable reporting of suspicions in the area of privacy” — according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the footballer would seek compensation for “moral damages in the amount corresponding to the weight of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The event was scheduled to take place in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went to the footballer's room, where he allegedly raped the woman anal, according to documents filed in the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after an alleged fall and told her that "99 percent is a good guy" who was visited by that "one percent".
According to the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but it was done with mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that photos of her injuries were taken at the hospital, but later agreed to an extrajudicial agreement because she was "afraid of revenge" and "public humiliation."
The 34-year-old says she wants to cancel the deal now because she still can't forget about the alleged departure.
During the alleged attack, Ronaldo moved from Manchester United to Real Madrid, and that summer he moved to Juventus after paying 100 million euros for him.
Brexit: Britain 'would regret' the departure of automakers 'forever'
The UK would “remorse it forever” if it lost its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after leaving the European Union, Business Minister Greg Clark said.
He added that he was “worried” when a representative of Toyota UK told the BBC that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, production at the Burnaston plant near Derby will be temporarily halted.
“We need an agreement,” Clark said.
A spokesman for the Japanese automaker said the effects of delays at the border in the absence of a Brexit deal could lead to a reduction in jobs.
The Burnaston factory, which produces Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I think if the UK leaves the European Union without a deal at the end of March, then there will be a stoppage of production at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other UK automakers fear leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade works, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, plans to close its Mini car factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns concern — as automakers claim — the risks associated with the supply chain in the event of the UK leaving the European Union without an agreement.
Toyota’s production line operates on a “just-in-time” basis, in which parts are delivered every 37 minutes from suppliers both in the UK and in the EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be difficulties at the border, according to industry representatives, which could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
Toyota would not be able to withstand more than one day without deliveries to its factory in Derbyshire, as a result of which production would be halted.
Clark said the Chequers Theresa May plan for future relations with the EU was “precisely designed to avoid border checks.”
“We need an agreement. We want to reach the best possible agreement that will not only allow us to enjoy the current success, but also allow us to make appropriate use of this situation,” he said in today’s BBC Radio 4 programme.
“The statements not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers show that we need to be able to continue what was made up of a very efficient supply chain.”
Toyota’s representative was unable to determine how long production would be halted, but warned that in the longer term the additional costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness, which would lead to a reduction in employment.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at the Burnaston plant for 24 years and is a member of the Unite corporate board, said that union members are increasingly concerned: “I know from experience that if jobs are eliminated, they will never be restored.
The government spokesperson said: “We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the European Union.”
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, the White House says
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "delayed by another week" due to the relentless fight for Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special prosecutor Robert Mueller, who is investigating the possibility of Russian interference in the election, the links between Trump’s close associates and Russia, and the potential for the president’s impediment to justice.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, thereby threatening Mueller’s independence, has been a hot topic in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was talking about wearing an earplug to record talks with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president from office under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied these reports, however.
Last Monday, however, he went to the White House in the face of reports, as if he were about to resign.
The date of the meeting with Trump, who was then at the UN headquarters in New York, was set for Thursday.
Trump said he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein. There has been a postponement of the meeting to avoid colliding with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, during which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. For Christ.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weekly FBI investigation into charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the vote in the Senate.
Trump’s spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about her meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “A deadline for this meeting has not yet been set, it may be held this week, and it may be postponed by another week, taking into account all the events related to the Supreme Court.
We’ll see, I’ll let the press know.”
Several journalists questioned the statement: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since Sept. 10.
The show's host, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said a small number of press conferences were not caused by a reluctance to “obscene” television journalists, after which she added: “I will not hide that they are “obscene.”
She then suggested that the direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
“The President-in-Office holds more ‘questions and answers’ than any other president before him,” she said, adding, without giving any evidence, “We got to know the numbers.”
The press conferences will continue, Sanders said, but “if journalists have the opportunity to directly ask the President of the United States questions, it’s a much better solution than talking to me.
We are trying to do this regularly, and we have done it very often over the last few weeks, and press conferences will take places for such sessions, during which it will be possible to speak directly with the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with guest dignitaries.
Solo press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have demonstrated why he is, acting too loosely and sometimes oddly in front of assembled journalists.
The Minister of Health writes to workers from European Union countries employed at NHS Scotland in the face of concerns related to Brexit
The health minister issued a letter to workers from the European Union who work in the Scottish health service to convey their gratitude from the country and ask them not to leave after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish parliament, sent a letter less than six months before Britain’s departure from the European Union.
The Scottish government has already committed to cover the costs of examining applications for the granting of "setled status" to EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
Freeman wrote in her letter: “The negotiations on Britain’s exit from the European Union continued in the summer and the appropriate decisions will be taken in the autumn of this year.
The British government has also intensified preparations for a possible exit scenario without a deal.
I know this is a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleges from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and benefit patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we very much want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes surgery due to a head injury
The grueling Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, underwent surgery as a result of a head injury in Saturday's Vanderbilt Commodores match, which ended in a defeat of the Tennessee team with a score of 31-27, Mike Organ reported.
Rod Reed, the head coach of the Tennessee State team, told reporters that the player suffered an injury shortly before the end of the first half.
“He went to the sideline, then he fell to the ground,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sidelines, then placed it on the nose and removed it for further testing.
A Tennessee State representative told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been operated on at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “there is no details yet about the type/size of the injury,” and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie (a second-year student fired from representing the university for a year to train his skills) plays his first season in the Tennessee State team after transferring from Illinois.
On Saturday before the end of the match, he had five streaks, giving him 18 streaks throughout the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher tax on the purchase of real estate in the UK.
In accordance with the new torso plans, buyers from abroad will be charged higher tax fees for the purchase of real estate in the UK. The funds obtained in this way will be allocated to help the homeless.
This move is intended to undermine the success of Jeremy Corbyn's actions aimed at attracting a young electorate.
The tax increase will include those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
The Treasury Department predicts that it will thus receive up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year in help to the homeless.
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers of real estate in the UK will be charged a higher tax, and the additional funds obtained in this way will be allocated to help the homeless.
This move is taken as an attempt to undermine Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract the young electorate with promises of cheaper housing and increase the burden of more earnings.
Higher tax rates will apply to individuals and non-taxable businesses in the UK. Additional measures are intended to help the government in the fight against homelessness.
An additional fee – charged in addition to the current tax, including the higher rates introduced two years ago for second houses and apartments purchased for rent – may amount to up to three percent.
The State Treasury expects this move to raise as much as <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of newly built properties in London are bought by residents of other countries, which leads to price increases and makes it difficult to buy a first home or apartment.
Because many foreigners buy real estate, and spend most of their time abroad, many wealthy regions —and especially the capital— have turned into “spirit cities.”
The new rules come just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a tax cut, which would help young people buy their first home.
He accused large developers of maintaining high property prices by occupying the land, but not using it. He also called on Prime Minister May to lift the limits of cheap housing in order to eradicate the “house scandal” in the UK.
Jeremy Corbyn has announced a number of attractive housing reforms, including rent regulation and the end of dismissal "without cause."
It also wants to give local governments greater powers in the construction of new houses.
Theresa May said: “I said last year that as prime minister, I am committed to rebuilding the British dream of making every next generation’s life better than the previous one.
This also means the repair of our staggering housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is not okay for people who do not live here, as well as foreign companies, to be able to buy properties here as easily as hard-working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of their own home has become very distant, so the humiliation associated with the need to spend the night on the street remains real.”
Jack Ross: "My biggest ambition is to become Scotland's national team"
Sunderland coach Jack Ross says his "greatest ambition" is to become Scotland's national team coach at some point.
This forty-two-year-old Scottish with a commitment is working on the recovery of the North-East club, which currently ranks third in League One with a three-point loss against the best team.
He moved to the Stadium of Light that summer after introducing St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to represent my country as a player.
But I only managed to get to squad B," Ross said in an interview with BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
“When I was a kid, I watched the Scottish father’s game in Hampden a lot and it always attracted me.
But this opportunity will only come if I succeed as a coach of the club.”
Ross' predecessors included Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic coach says he doesn’t feel discouraged by taking on the role of such prominent personalities in such a large club, rejecting previous proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“For me, success will be measured by whether I will be able to bring this club back into the Premier League.
Given its structure and the facilities it has, there is no doubt its place there,” he adds.
“It’s not going to be easy to do this, but I’m sure I’ll feel like I’ve been successful here, just on the condition that I’m successful.”
Rossa's coaching career has only lasted three years. He was previously an assistant coach at Dumbarton and was part of the Hearts coaching team for 15 months.
He then helped Allo again advance to the third league after degradation, and the following season he led the St Mirren team from the edge of the decline to the championship title.
Jack Ross says he now feels much more comfortable than when he played at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“It was a real turning point,” recalls coach Allo.
“I really believed that running a team was a lot better for me than playing.
That sounds strange, because as a player I managed well, I made good money and achieved some measurable successes.
However, playing is a heavy piece of bread.
Every week you have to go through a lot of different situations.
They still meet me when it comes to the stress and pressure associated with coaching, but I feel good in this role.
I’ve always wanted to train others and now I’m doing it. I can say that right now I feel the most in place in my adult life.”
The entire interview at Sportsound can be heard on Sunday, 30 September on Scotland radio between 12:00 and 13:00 BST
Research shows that the best time for beer is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday
The summer heat wave caused a sudden influx of customers to British pubs, but it reflected a snail in restaurant chains.
Research has shown that in July, sales in pubs and bars increased by 2.7 percent, but in restaurants fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin from the CGA consulting firm, which developed the data, says: “Continuous heat and longer than expected England participation in the World Championships caused the July results to form more restaurateurs than the June 2, when the turnover in pubs.
The 1.8 percent decline in restaurant sales in June was even more pronounced in July.
Drinks from pubs and bars were the best — their sales growth outperformed the decline seen in restaurants.
Pubs serving food also suffered during the heat, although not as much as the restaurant owners.
Looks like people just got thirsty, you know?
Sales of beverages in managed pubs and bars increased by 6.6 percent this month, and food — fell by three percent.
Paul Newman from RSM, an industry analyst in the entertainment and tourism industry, said: “These results are part of the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The most important factors influencing the size of consumption 'outside the house' remain the weather and large sports or social events.
The fact that restaurant chains are experiencing difficult moments is not surprising, although a 4.8 percent drop in sales compared to the previous year will have particularly dramatic consequences if you take into account the ongoing pressures to cut costs.
The long and hot summer has come at the least favorable moment for the owners of the premises serving food and the weather will show whether the slightly more moderate temperatures we had in August will bring the much-needed exhalation.”
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including those newly opened, stood at 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in the growth of brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker, which monitors sales in pubs, bars and restaurants in the UK, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups with a total turnover of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion. It sets industry-recognized standards.
One in five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
Research has shown that one in five children — some only 11 years old — have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 pupils of higher education institutions showed an increase in the number of “fake Insta” websites
The news has fueled fears that sexual content is being published on them.
Twenty percent of students say they have a “main” account that they show to their parents
One in five children — some only 11 years old — set up accounts on social media that they do not disclose to adults.
A survey of 20,000 schoolchildren in the U.S. showed a rapid increase in the number of fake Insta accounts — the name refers to an Instagram site where you can share photos.
This news has fueled fears that these accounts are used to publish content of a sexual nature.
Twenty percent of the students admitted that they have a "main" account that they show to their parents, and they also have private accounts.
One of the mothers, who accidentally stumbled upon the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter, met a teenager who urged others to “rape her.”
A study conducted in independent schools by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) found that 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 have two profiles. Half of them admit to keeping private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, president of HMC, said: “It’s worrying that so many teenagers are creating their own places on the internet where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the voice of the athletes in the board of Scottish Athletics
At the Annual General Meeting of Scottish Athletics, Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Board of Directors as non-executive director.
Eilidh Doyle is the most renowned Scottish athlete. President Ian Beattie has described this move as an excellent opportunity for people who manage the sport to benefit from the rich international experience she has gained over the past decade.
“Eilidh enjoys tremendous respect in the communities of Scottish, British and world athletics, and we are confident that introducing it to the board will bring great benefits to Scottish athletics,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I’m very happy to have the opportunity to pass on the voice of the athletes to the board, and I hope I can really help with the management of the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who among his four Olympic gold medals has won the 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, and now regularly appears on the BBC as an expert, cannot walk as a result of a transient anaemia attack.
He tweeted: “I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that time will show if I will regain my fitness and to what extent.
It was a choking job, but I was completely healed, I learned to walk again, and I went back to training!
Thank you for all the words of support!”
Breastfeeding Advertising, which compares mothers to cows, excites extreme emotions on the internet
The dairy company has caused a storm on the internet by publishing an ad that compares breastfeeding mothers to breastfeeding cows.
To announce the launch of "the world's first silent lactator to wear under clothing," its producer, Elvie, released a ridiculous video-advertisement that emphasizes the freedom it provides to mothers.
She introduces four real mothers dancing in a swan-filled field to a song where they hear the words, “Yes, I get it, but you can’t see the tail” and “As if you didn’t notice, it wasn’t just my boobs.”
The chorus goes like this: “Pump them, pump them out, I will feed them, pump them out, pump them out, I will touch your master.”
The advertisement, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, sparked great controversy on the Internet.
The film currently has 77,000 views and hundreds of comments. Users express extreme opinions, many of them argue that it is inappropriate to joke about the “horror” that takes place in the dairy industry.
“Using cows to advertise this product was a very bad idea.
“Like people, in order to give milk, they have to get pregnant and give birth to the body, with their babies being received to them a few days after birth,” one user wrote.
Elvie Breastfeeder can be worn unnoticed under breastfeeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another person commented: “This is, of course, traumatic for both the mother and the child.
Sure, let’s use cows to advertise dairy products for mothers who can stop their children.”
Someone else added, “This advertisement is completely detached from reality.”
Others use the clip as a weapon — one of the women said the song was “fun.”
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
If I were still breastfeeding, I'd buy one.
When I was eating, I felt like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I'm not digging into it at the bottom of it.
It’s a brilliant invention,” someone wrote.
Someone else commented: “It’s a fun ad aimed at mothers who pull food away (often at work or at the toilet) and feel like ‘raw’.
It is not intended to praise or criticize the dairy industry.”
At the end of the film, it turns out that the women danced with lactators discreetly attached to their breasts.
The campaign was inspired by the view that many breastfeeding women feel like cows.
However, the Elvie breastfeeder is completely quiet, there are no cables or tubes and it can be worn unnoticed under the bust to feed, giving women the freedom to move around, hold children in their arms, and even leave the house while pulling food.
Ana Balarin, partner and creative director at Mother, said: “Elvie’s dairy is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative premiere.
By bringing together feeding women and dairy cows, we wanted to show you all the challenges associated with deprivation of food, while presenting in a fun and consistent way the incredible sense of freedom it provides.
This isn't the first time Elvie's lactator has hit the headlines.
During the London Fashion Week during the show Marty Jakubowski appeared on the runway the mother of two children with the attached product.
Hundreds of children of immigrants have been secretly transferred to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained children of immigrants is growing rapidly, although the number of people crossing the border every month does not actually change. This is due in part to the fact that the harsh rhetoric and rules introduced by the administration of President Trump have made it difficult to put in place.
Most sponsors are usually undocumented immigrants who are afraid of being exposed to deportation if they apply for a child.
The risk rose in June when the federal authorities announced that fingerprints would be taken from potential sponsors and other adults residing in the joint farm, which would then be passed on to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, testified before Congress that his agency had already arrested dozens of people who had registered as sponsors for unaccompanied children.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested had not been previously listed.
“Nearly 80 percent of people who are sponsors or live with them in one household are living in the country illegally, and a large proportion of them are foreigners with a criminal past.
That’s why we’re constantly chasing them,” Albence said.
Shelter workers say that as part of efforts to speed up the regulation of the situation of children, officials have introduced new rules that require some of them to appear in court within a month of detention — and not after 60 days of the standard pop.
Much will be done through videoconferencing, not in person, to ask the immigration judge to legalize their status.
Those who do not qualify for dismissal will be deported immediately.
According to shelter workers and reports that have been published in recent months, the longer the children are in custody, the easier they can become uneasy or fall into depression, which in turn can lead to bursts of aggression or attempts to escape.
Defenders said these problems are even more serious in larger centres such as Tornillo, where due to its size it is easier to overlook the signals that something is wrong with the child.
They also added that moving children to a tent camp without providing them with adequate time for emotional preparation or saying goodbye to friends can intensify the trauma that many of them are already struggling with.
Syria calls on U.S., French and Turkish “occupation forces” to withdraw immediately
During a speech before the UN General Assembly, Syria’s foreign minister, Walid al-Moualem, also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the country’s eight-year war.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces are staying on Syrian soil illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and “we will deal with them appropriately.”
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the Assembly.
Moualem says the “war on terrorism is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died and millions have been forced to leave their homes since 2011.
He said Damascus would continue to “lead its sacred battle, until the cleansing of the territory of Syria” both from terrorist groups and from “all foreigners illegally residing in it”.
There are currently about 2,000 U.S. troops stationed in Syria, mainly training Kurdish and Syrian forces opposing President Bashar al-Assad and advising them.
In addition, there are more than 1,000 French soldiers in the country destroyed by the war.
As for the refugees, Moualem said the conditions were good enough for them to return, and accused “some Western countries” of “raising an irrational fear” that discourages them from returning.
“We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to help in these returns,” he said.
“They politicize things that should have a purely human dimension.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that until President Assad concludes a political agreement with the opposition to end the war, Syria will not receive any aid for reconstruction.
U.N. diplomats say the latest agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last major rebel bastion in Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey helped prevent a major attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement has a “clear time frame” and expressed hope that military action will be carried out in jihadists, including fighters from the Al-Qaeda-linked Lebanese People’s Defense Front, who will be “eliminated.”
The UN envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the ruling party and the opposition in order to draw up a draft of the post-war constitution of Syria and prepare for the elections.
Moualem outlined the terms of the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, saying the panel’s work should be limited to “verifying the records of the current constitution” and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win the election again
According to this logic, President Trump would be elected for a second term in 2020, unless — as many liberal observers hope — his presidency would sooner end with removal from office and scandal.
It would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic finale of the presidency so far.”
So far, there are no signs of fatigue in the audience.
Since 2014, CNN’s first-team views have more than doubled and reached 1.05 million viewers, and MSNBC’s nearly tripled to 1.6 million viewers.
According to Nielsen Fox News, it attracts an average of 2.4 million viewers in the hours of greatest viewing, which is an increase of 1.7 million four years ago, and broadcast on the MSNBC channel, the program “The Rachel Maddow Show” reportedly achieved the highest results among 3 million viewers.
“People fly like ducks into the fire — that’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Bear, the lead producer of ABC’s Designated Survivor, about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after the Capitol attack.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedian and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has a different theory.
She recalls how she was driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he was going to vote for Trump.
“Why?” she asked.
“Because it makes me laugh,” he replied.
“Chaos has entertainment value.”
Of course, Washington’s reports could, like nothing else on television, presuppose the future of the Roe v. Wade case, the admissibility of reunification of immigrant families, or the state of the world economy.
Exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Besides, it’s not just about being a well-informed citizen of Washington when you watch a panel of experts arguing about Bob Woodward’s use of secret informants while writing the book “Fear” or “Fear” or “The Story” by Paul Manafort’s shorts.
I’ll never look at Super Mario again.
“What he’s doing is partly reminiscent of the reality show in that it delivers new content every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, about the changing cast and daily turnovers of the show.
You can't afford to miss the episode because you're going to be late.
When I met Mike Fleisse this week, the weather on the north coast of Kauai Island, where he has his home, was beautiful, but he was sitting inside watching MSNBC and recording CNN at the same time.
He couldn’t get away from it until Brett Kavanaugh was standing right before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Supreme Court’s future was weighed.
“I remember how we used to do all these crazy programs and people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
“I thought they were joking, but it turns out they were right.”

The influx of money from outside to the congressional election campaign
It is no surprise that after the reorganization of the constituencies, as a result of which in the race for one position the two now-appointed congressmen will stand, the river of cash flows to the 17th constituency in Pennsylvania.
This newly formed suburban district of Pittsburgh is represented in the Congress of Democrats, Conor Lamb, who won his place in another district during last spring’s special election.
Lamb competes with another current congressman, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who now represents Pennsylvania’s former 12th District, which largely overlaps with the new 17th District.
The district maps were corrected after a January ruling by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that the old districts were unfairly designated, which gave Republicans an advantage and was inconsistent with the constitution.
The race in the new 17th district began with a campaign battle for funding between the party’s main funding bodies — the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamba’s name gained popularity in Pennsylvania after winning a haircut in the widely-commented election to the 18th constituency that took place in March.
For more than a decade the Republican has been in this position, and Donald Trump has won 20 points in this circle.
Politicians have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
The U.S. considered punishing Salvador for supporting China, but withdrew from the idea.
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, despite slight opposition from Washington.
In June 2017, President Donald Trump held a cordial meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela, and until his expulsion by the partners of the Trump Organization management team, he had a hotel in Panama.
U.S. State Department officials have decided to dismiss the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama because of “recent decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan,” according to a statement from the Department’s spokesperson this month.
However, the sanctions were to be imposed only on El Salvador, which is estimated to have received $140 million in aid from the United States in 2017, including to combat drugs and support development and the economy.
The proposed sanctions, which were to include restrictions on financial aid and the granting of visas to specific persons, would be very harsh for this Central American country, which is struggling with high unemployment and a high murder rate.
As international meetings progressed, North and Central American officials deferred a high-level conference on security and economic well-being to address the proposals made by the immigrants to a similar meeting from last year’s meeting, which was held in the United States.
In mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, thus concluding all considerations on sanctions against El Salvador.
Diplomats say that now at the conference, which is currently scheduled for mid-October, Vice President Mike Pence is to speak, which is to be a signal of an invitation to a meeting of administration representatives.
Three U.S. envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without any new harsh messages or punishments from Washington.
The White House spokesman, John Bolton, declined to comment on the details of the debate, which were presented by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who, on condition of anonymity, agreed to discuss internal treaties.
Their relations were confirmed by an external analyst from the administration’s environment, who also spoke anonymously.

Another element may be the report by the special prosecutor, Robert Mueller, on the possible impediment of justice by President Trump, for which there is currently concrete evidence available to the public.
According to reports, Robert Mueller’s investigation is also investigating whether Donald Trump’s campaign had anything to do with Russia’s attack on the US election.
If the composition of Congress changes, President Trump will be held accountable for his preparations for re-election, or maybe even be tried in front of the jury.
There are a lot of unknowns here, and I don’t want to suggest that Trump’s downfall — or those in positions equal to him in Europe — is inevitable.
We all have to make a choice on both sides of the Atlantic that will decide how long it can take.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a coup d'état against Hitler, if only the West would resist him and support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We did not succeed and we lost the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The lines of history revolve around such turning points, accelerating or slowing down the inevitable onset of democracy.
There are now a few such turning points in front of the Americans.
What do we do if Donald Trump fires Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man on whom the future of Robert Mueller’s investigation depends?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since we revealed in our paper that he proposed a covert recording of the president last year and speculated that he was not fit for the office.
According to Rosenstein, the report presented by The Times is inaccurate.
“How will we respond if the newly ordered FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh turns out to be incomplete or unfair, or if he is appointed to the Supreme Court judge despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?”
And above all, in the middle of the presidential term, will we elect to Congress those who will hold Donald Trump accountable?
If we do not pass these trials, there will be difficult times for democracy.
However, I believe that we will succeed — because of the lessons I received in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew, and she was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial residence.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to light shabby candles on that table marked with swastika.
With such a legacy, how could I not look optimistic into the future?”

Rangers player Graham Dorrans is optimistic about his match with Rapid Vienna
The Rangers are taking on Rapid Vienna on Thursday with the knowledge that the victory with the Austrians, achieved after an impressive resignation from Villareal this month in Spain, will significantly increase their chances of qualifying for the Group G of the European League.
Until the 2–2 draw from Villareal, a knee injury prevented assistant Graham Dorran from playing this season, but he believes the result will work on the Rangers as a trampoline for greater success.
“We did well because Villarreal is in good shape,” the 31-year-old said.
“We went to this game with the belief that we were going to achieve something — and we got the point.
Maybe in the end we could still press them, but in general, the remit is probably a fair result.
The Spaniards were probably better in the first half, but in the second half we were better.
When it comes to Thursday, it’s another important evening for Europe.
We hope we can score three points, but this game will be difficult because our opponent got a good result in his last match. However, I am sure that with the support of the fans we will go through and we will fight a positive result.
“Last year was definitely tough because of everything related to my injury and changes at the club itself, but now we’re all feeling good in our places.
The team is great, and the boys really like to play. The workouts are going well.
I hope that we can move forward, leave the last season behind and be successful.”
Fear of retirement savings spends women's sleep from the eyelids
Although the people who took part in the survey knew exactly how they wanted to take care of them, few talked about it with the family.
In a survey conducted by Nationwide, about half of the participants found that they had talked to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to the kids about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of nationwide life insurance.
Where to start?
Talk to your spouse and children: You will not prepare your family for self-care unless you express your will in advance.
Talk with your counselor and family about where and how you want to be taken care of, as this choice will be an important factor in determining costs.
Ask a financial advisor for help: He or she can help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Long-term care funds can come from a traditional care policy, a hybrid policy that allows you to withdraw cash to cover such expenses, or from your own property — as long as you own it.
Prepare legal documents: You will prevent this court battles.
Appoint a trusted health care officer who will oversee it and make sure that the right people act according to your will if communication becomes impossible.
Consider also the employment of an agent who will take care of the finances.
Choose a trusted person because they will make financial decisions for you and make sure that all the bills are paid if you are not able to do it yourself.
Don’t forget about the details: Imagine that your older parent suddenly needs medical help and is going to the hospital right now.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write down all the information to get it ready.
“It’s not just about the finances, it’s about who the doctors are,” Martin asks.
“What medications are you taking?
Who will take care of the dog?
It’s worth having that plan on hand.”
Man repeatedly shot from windmill in Ilfracombe
The man was shot several times by a windmill when he returned home from an evening party.
The 40-kilometer was located in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon County, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and arm.
Police described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST time, as "accidental action".
The victim did not see the attacker.
The reported injuries do not endanger a man's life. The police are asking to report witnesses of the incident.
Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia
According to official reports, at least 384 people have died as a result of the powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday. The number of victims is likely to increase.
Due to the broken communication, the rescuers were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala kaupate, which is located north of Palu, closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-degree earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated after the Palu disaster.
Here are some of the most important information about the city of Palu and Donggala on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of Central Celebes, a province located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island. It was estimated that 379,800 people lived in 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami occurred, the celebrations of the 40th anniversary of its founding took place in the city.
Donggala is a kaupaten (administrative unit of lower level than the province) extending along the north-west coast of the island over a length of more than 300 km.
It is estimated that 299,200 people lived there in 2017.
The main branches of the economy of Central Celebes are fishing and agriculture, which have developed especially in the coastal Donggala kaupate.
Another source of income of the province are nickel mines, but they are mainly located in Morowa, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
According to the Indonesian Agency for Disaster Relief, the earthquakes and tsunami have visited Palu and Donggala several times over the past 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami that struck Donggala killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, nine people died as a result of the tsunami in western Dongal.
Indonesia is on the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire, which is why earthquakes occur there quite regularly.
The biggest earthquakes and tsunami in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake that struck the west coast of Aceh province in northern Sumatra on 26 December triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, of which more than half in Aceh.
2005: In late March and early April, a series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: In the south of Java, Indonesia’s most populous island, a 6.8-degree earthquake hit the southern coast, causing a tsunami that killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-degree earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra.
As a result, more than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake struck one of the Mentawai islands off the coast of Sumatra, causing a tsunami wave of up to 10 meters high that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya province of Aceh, causing destruction and panic among people who still remembered the destructions that resulted from the devastating earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time, there was no tsunami, but the rolling buildings killed more than 100 people.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok, Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly on its northern side.
They have caused the destruction of thousands of homes and brought temporary troubles to thousands of tourists.
Sara Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice president candidate, Sary Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
According to a report released on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers, a 29-year-old man from Wasilla, Alaska, has been arrested on charges of domestic violence, obstructing filing and resisting arrest.
According to a police report, when a friend of the suspect tried to call the police to report a crime, he picked up her phone.
The KTUU station reports that Palin is in Mat-Su Investigative Arrest and has a $500 security deposit.
According to her information, he stood in court last Saturday, where he said in his defense speech that he was "certainly innocent".
Palin has three Class A offences, which means she could be sentenced to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a Class B offence, which is punishable by a $2,000 jail term and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time Palin has been charged.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Then his mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is currently pending before the Alaskan Veterans Claims Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of filing and possession of weapons in a non-violence state in connection with the incident.
His partner says he hit her in the face.
In 2016, a group of veterans criticized Sarah Palin, who linked her son’s aggressive behavior to the post-mortem stress disorder he acquired while serving in Iraq.
Hundreds of people killed in tsunami after earthquake in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of Friday's earthquake that hit the Indonesian island of Celebes.
The 7.5-degree earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and connectivity are not working and the number of victims is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred near the central part of the island of Celebes, which is located northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
There are videos on social media that show the moment of disaster.
When the tsunami struck the coast, on the beach in Palu, where the festival took place, there were hundreds of people.
Federal prosecutors are demanding the death penalty for a suspected terrorist attack in New York City.
Federal prosecutors in New York are demanding the death penalty for Sayfull Saipov suspected of carrying out a terrorist attack in New York, which killed eight people. This is a rare punishment — not executed in this state for a federal offense.
To carry out the attack, which took place in October on a bicycle path running along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, the thirty-year-old Saipov allegedly used a rented truck Home Depot, which he drove on his pedestrians and cyclists.
According to a statement made in the southern district of New York City about the intention to demand the death penalty to justify its need, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “deliberately” killed eight victims and “deliberately” caused you.
According to the court documents, both charges are subject to death penalty.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal jury filed an indictment against Saipov covering 22 items, including eight counts of murder in the course of an illegal activity — a procedure usually used by federal prosecutors — and a federal prosecutor’s office of indictment in criminal cases.
According to prosecutors, the organization of the attack required "solid planning and reflection." The way in which Saipov carried out it, they described it as "terrible, cruel and immoral".
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has brought damage, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hern<0xC3><0xA1>n Ferruchi, Hern<0xC3><0xA1>n Diego Mendoza and Alejandra”
Five of the victims were Argentine nationals who were staying in New York City as a tourist.
The last time the death penalty was imposed in the Southern District of New York was ten years ago.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of murdering two drug dealers, but was sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty as a result of the federal case was last executed in New York in 1953 on Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. The marriage was lost after two years earlier they were found guilty of conspiracy and espionage in favor of the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were lost in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, who comes from Uzbekistan, did not show any remorse within months of the attack.
Police say he told the detective he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov confessed to the authorities that the attack was inspired by ISIS videos he watched on his phone.
According to the police, he also demanded the hanging of the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
The indictment, which includes 22 charges, says he is innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal attorneys representing Saipov, said they were “disappointed for obvious reasons” by the prosecutor’s decision.
“We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty and to reject life without the possibility of early dismissal after admitting to guilt will only prolong the suffering that these events have caused to all interested persons,” he said.
Saipov’s team of defence officials had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
MEP Says Nigel Farage Should Take Responsibility for Brexit Negotiations <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
During today’s protest, which took place during the Tories conference, Nigel Farage vowed to “mobilize the army of the people.”
The former leader of the UK Independence Party (UKIP) said politicians must “feel hot” beating Eurosceptics when one of the parliamentarians Theresa May suggested he should take responsibility for negotiations with the European Union.
Peter Bone, a Conservative MP, told demonstrators in Birmingham that if Farage was Brexit secretary, “the United Kingdom would already be outside the Union.”
However, the addition of tories demanding to remain in the community to a separate protest against Brexit, which took place in the city, further underscored the burden of reconciling its deeply divided lines that are facing Theresa May.
The Prime Minister is struggling to implement her plan to compromise with the Chequers amid attacks by Brexit supporters, its opponents, and the European Union itself.
Its allies claim that despite opposition, it will seek to conclude an agreement with Brussels and will force Eurosceptics and Labour to make a choice between its proposal and "chaos".
Peter Bone told Leave Means Leave assembly in Solihull that he wants to “throw away the plan from the Chequers.”
He suggested that the representative should be Nigel Farage, who should be given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had done it, we would be out of the Union now,” he said.
Wellingborough MP added: “I support Brexit, but we have to throw the plan out of the Chequers.”
Presenting his opposition to the European Union, he said: “That is not why we fought in world wars to submit to someone now.
We want to establish our rights in our own country.”
Peter Bone rejected the suggestion that citizens had changed their minds since voting in 2016: “The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in the Union is completely untrue.”
Andrea Jenkyns from the Tories party, who told reporters: “I’m just saying, ‘Mr. Prime Minister, please listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not supported in general, the opposition will not vote for it, neither our party nor our activists, who are populating the streets and who have chosen us, nor do they support it.
Please drop the plan with the Chequers and start listening."
In a statement addressed to Prime Minister May, she added: “Prime Ministers maintain their positions when they keep their promises.”
Nigel Farage said the politicians participating in the demonstration must “feel hot” if they were to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s a matter of trust between us — the people — and the political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and we’re here today to tell them, ‘We won’t let you do that.’”
Addressing the disenchanted crowd, he added: “I want you to make politicians who are on the brink of Brexit betrayal feel hot.
“We are mobilizing the army of the people of this country that gave us a victory in the Brexit referendum, and we will not rest until we become an independent, independent, proud United Kingdom.”
During this time, opponents of Brexit marched through the city to the center, where a two-hour demonstration took place.
A handful of activists shot with “Torysi vs. Brexit” banners after forming the group this weekend.
The Labour activist, Baron Andrew Adonis, ridiculed the Conservatives for problems with the security of the party application at the beginning of the conference.
“These are the people who say they can organize the IT systems and the entire technology to support the Canada plus plus plan, the liquid border, free trade without borders with Ireland,” he added.
“This is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Elizabeth Warren Plans to ‘Seriously Consider’ Candidacy for President
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will “seriously consider running for president” after the November election.
According to The Boston Globe, a representative of the Democrats from Massachusetts spoke about her future during a meeting with voters that took place on Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Elizabeth Warren, who frequently criticizes President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November with Republican Rep. Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of Trump’s campaign in Massachusetts during the 2016 election.
It is now said that in the 2020 election, Warren can defeat Trump.
Saturday’s event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in the town hall formula since Donald Trump took office.
One of the participants asked if he was planning to run for president.
Elizabeth Warren responded that it was time for “women to go to Washington to fix our rotten government — and she also means a woman on the top.”
Arresting the perpetrator of a fatal shooting in which LSU team player, Wayde Sims, was killed
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on Saturday reported the arrest of a suspect in a Friday shooting in which LSU basketball player Wayde Sims was killed.
The Baton Rouge Police Department reported the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson during a conference that took place at 11:00 a.m.
On Friday, a video of the shooting with a request for help in identifying the man visible on it was published.
20-year-old Wayde Sims was killed in a shooting near Southern University campus on Friday morning.
“Wayde Sims was shot in the head with a gun, which resulted in his death,” Murphy J. Paul, the police chief, told 247sports.
Wayde defended his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was at the crime scene, had a gun with him, and shot Wayde.
After his arrest, during which he did not resist, he was taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
A 1.98 m junior, the Wayde Sims grew up in Baton Rouge, playing 32 games, starting 10 times in the last season, spending an average of 17.4 minutes on the parquet, scoring 5.6 points and scoring 2.9 points per game.
Russia’s Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is approaching the world title after the team’s command allowed him to win with Sebastian Vettel
Since Valtteri Bottas qualified against Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it has become clear that the Mercedes team’s command will have a big impact on the race result.
Bottas, who started from the first field, started very well and nearly defeated Hamilton, defending his position in the first two laps and forcing Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to go to the service point and allowed Hamilton to ride in the tail of the pellet, which should decide the race’s fate.
The Mercedes driver went into boxing in the next round and appeared behind Vettel, but after a round-to-round action, as a result of which the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inner part of the track, risking a goal-scoring push to the defensive side after a double-turned move.
Max Verstappen started from the end of the bet and at his 21st birthday at the end of the first round he was in seventh place.
He then drove for much of the race thanks to the fact that he did not change the tyres in order to make a quick finish and take Kimi Raikkonen's fourth position.
He finally went to the service point on the 44th round, but in the other eight rounds he was unable to accelerate. Fourth place was taken by Raikkonen.
“It was a tough day because Valtteri was doing a great job all weekend and he turned out to be a real gentleman when he was told to let me go.
The whole team did their best to take the first two places,” Hamilton said.
It was a really bad body language.
During a meeting held on Saturday, President Donald Trump clashed with Senator Diane Feinstein, who claimed she had not disclosed the contents of a letter from Christina Blasey Ford, in which she accuses Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to statements made by Christina Ford to the Senate Justice Commission. Instead, he stated that what happened in the senate, and what happened in the senate, showed that "the people are right."
“What could have happened is one thing, but this beautiful situation in the Senate, which we have been witnessing for a few days, when we see anger when we see people who are angry, greedy, malicious and lying,” he said.
“We see what has been published and revealed, and then they say to us, ‘Oh, I didn’t do it.’
I didn't do it.
You remember?
Dianna Feinstein, did you reveal that?
Do you remember her answer... did you reveal the contents of this document? — oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I did not reveal it.”
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Did we disclose...No, we did not disclose,” he added, interfering with the senator.
Dianna Feinstein received a letter from Christina Ford describing the charges against Kavanaugh in July, and its contents leaked in early September, and the senator denies that her office was the source of the leak.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s insinuation, I didn’t reveal her history,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me for discretion, and according to her request, I did not disclose these contents.”
Her statement, however, did not convince the president, who commented on it during Saturday’s meeting: “I’m telling you, it was really bad body language.
“Maybe she didn’t, but it was the worst body speech I’ve ever seen in my life.”
Continuing to defend a candidate for the Supreme Court judge, whose three women accused of sexual harassment, the president suggested that Democrats use insinuations for their own purposes.
“They’re determined to take power by all means.
You can see dullness, malice, they don’t care who they are hurting, who they have to destroy to take power and control,” the president said, according to reports from Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars — Belfast Giants 5:3
In the match against Dundee, Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants.
The Dundee Stars reassured their fifth loss in the Elite League with the Belfast Giants, winning a 5:3 draw on Saturday.
The giants quickly gained a two-way lead after shooting Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie matched the score, after which Dwyer again led the Giants to the lead.
Francois Bouchard again equalized the score, scoring a goal for Dundee, after which two goals scored by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen sealed her victory.
It was the third loss in the Elite League season for Adam Keefe's underdogs, who, despite their initial loss on Friday night, won with Dundee in Belfast 2–1.
Both teams met for the fourth time this season — the Giants won their first three games.
Dwyer's opening goal fell in the fourth minute (3:35) after assisting Kendall McFaull. Four minutes later Beauvillier doubled the score with assistance from David Rutherford.
After the intense opening at 13:10, Sullivan brought the host team back into the game, and Matt Marquardt then leveled the score at 15:16.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead ahead of the first break when, at the end of the first third, he scored his second goal that evening.
The host team was regrouped and Bouchard again matched the goal scored during the lead in the 27:37 minute.
At the end of the second third, Cownie and Charles Corcoran helped Nielsen secure the first lead in this match. The final victory of Dundee was sealed in the last half of the third by the same player who scored the fifth goal for his team.
The giants, who have lost four in their last five games, will play their next game on Friday at Milton Keynes.
Air Traffic Controller Dies, Helping Hundreds of People on Plane Escape from Earthquake
The Indonesian air traffic controller was yelled at by a hero after he died, helping to safely take off the plane with hundreds of people on board.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are believed to have been missing after a major earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Severe secondary shocks are still felt in the area, and many people have been trapped in the ruins in the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled, saving his life, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave the position at the shattered flight control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed there to make sure that the Batik Air aircraft (flight number 6321), which was on the runway, took off safely.
Then he jumped out of the tower when it seemed to him that he was about to collapse.
He died in the hospital.
According to Australian ABC News, Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the controller’s decision likely saved hundreds of people’s lives.
We arranged a helicopter from the city of Balikpapan to Borneo to move it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, Anthonius left this morning before the helicopter reached Pal.
“This message has broken our hearts,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach thousands, according to the national disaster relief agency, which reports that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“We believe that the harvest of death is still increasing because many bodies are still under the rubble and cannot be reached,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Tsunami waves of up to six metres have destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and civilian planes provide aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Ambulances are constantly bringing bodies.
There is a lack of drinking water.
“Small shops are being robbed.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help the survivors, but we don’t know what we’re going to do on the spot.
It’s a tragedy, and it can be even worse.”
On Sunday, Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu, where he addressed the army: “I ask all of you to work day and night to carry out all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?” — reports CNN.
This year, Indonesia was hit by an earthquake that killed more than 550 people on the island of Lombok.
A plane crash in Micronesia — Air Niugina reports that one person is missing after the plane crashed in a lagoon
Airlines operating the flight, which crashed in a lagoon in Micronesia in the Pacific, reported that one person was missing. Earlier, they claimed that all 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini reported that according to data on Saturday afternoon they could not count one man who traveled by feral plane.
They ensured that, together with local authorities, hospitals and investigators, they were trying to find him.
However, they did not immediately respond to requests for additional details concerning the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
After the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at the airport on the island of Chuuk, the other passengers and crew members were rescued by local boats.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said there were six more passengers in the hospital on Saturday, all in a stable condition.
It is not clear what caused the disaster, nor is the exact course of the disaster known.
U.S. carriers and navy say the plane landed on a lagoon near the starting lane.
According to some witnesses, he fell off his belt.
The American passenger, Bill Jaynes, said the plane was approaching very low.
“It helped us a lot,” he said.
Jaynes said he and other people had managed to crawl through the stretching water into the belt to exit the sinking emergency plane.
According to him, members of the crew panicked and shouted, and he himself suffered a harmless head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that the rescue operation was also assisted by sailors, who were working nearby to modernize the coast. With the help of an inflated boat, they managed to transport people to the shore before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 meters.
According to data from the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in the last two decades in plane crashes belonging to airlines registered in Papua New Guinea, but there is no Air Niugina.
Analyst reconstructed the events of the night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor’s office ended filing evidence in a retrial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice analyst, Paul Rowlett, testified for hours as a forensic expert in information analysis.
He described to judges how using cell phone records he recreated the route of the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, from the night she died.
According to the Clarion Ledger newspaper, Rowlett said that he had obtained location data from various cell phones that showed that Tellis was from Chambers on the feral evening, thus circumventing his earlier claims.
When the data confirmed that at a time when Quinton was supposed to be staying with his friend, Michael Sanford, his cell phone was at Jessica Chambers, the police decided to interrogate Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford testified that he was not in town that day.
When asked if Tellis was telling the truth, claiming that he was in a Sanford truck that night, he replied that he was lying because my truck was in Nashville at the time.
Another inaccuracy is Tellis' claim that he had known Chambers for about two weeks.
The cell phone records showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted her phone contact details, as well as texts and calls.
“He erased her from his life,” Hale said.
The final defense speech is scheduled to begin on Sunday.
The judge said that it is likely that the case will be handed over to the jury on the same day.
The High Breed: What is Hip-Hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to change the negative image of the genre, filling their music with a positive message.
According to The High Breed of Bristol, today’s hip-hop has gone from the original political content and social issues.
The members of the band want to go back to its roots and restore the popularity of conscious hip-hop.
Thanks to the work of artists such as Akala and Lowkey, the revival of artists such as The Fugees and Common has recently been observed in the UK.
Another black one?!
New York Nanny sues couple for dismissal after “racist” SMS
A New York nanny sues a couple for firing her from a racist background after receiving a mistakenly addressed text message in which the child’s mother complains that she is “another black person.”
The couple denies that they are racists, comparing the lawsuit to “blackmail.”
The mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, was clearly shocked when it turned out that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, who barely got her first day at work in 2016, was black.
“NEEEE, COLLEGE BLACK PERSON,” she wrote in a text message to her husband.
But instead of sending it to him, she mistakenly sent it to Mrs. Maurice twice.
According to reports in the New York Post, when Plasco-Flaxman became aware of the crime committed, the "depressed" sacked Gisella Maurice, claiming that the hearty nanny, who is an African-American, was doing her duty wrong, and not with Filipinos beyond.
Ms. Maurice was paid for her work day and then sent home by Uber.
She is now demanding compensation from the couple for a $ 350 daily allowance multiplied by six months, for which she was originally employed to live, although she did not sign the contract.
“I want to show them that they don’t do such things,” she told the Post newspaper on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple backed the accusations of racism, arguing that the termination of cooperation with Maurice was justified because after she was insulted, they feared they would not be able to trust her.
“My wife sent her something she wasn’t going to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,” Joel Plasco, the husband of the Post, told Reuters.
“Would you entrust your children to the person you have caused grief, even if it was by mistake?
Your new-born child?
Come on, come on."
Comparing the case to “blackmail,” Plasco said his wife had given birth just two months earlier and was in a “very difficult situation.”
“Are you going to blow something like that?
That’s not very nice,” the investment banker added.
Although the case has not yet ended in court, public opinion quickly issued a verdict on the couple on social media, criticizing her for her behavior and way of thinking.
The new letter reveals that publishers of books about Paddington feared that readers would not feel a connection to the talking mission
The author’s daughter, Michael Bond, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was warmly received, says of the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the place of the person who reads it for the first time, even before the book is published.
It’s very funny now that we already know what we know about Paddington’s great success.”
She claims that her father, who, before the little plush bear inspired him to write a children's book, worked as a cameraman for the BBC, was confident that his work would be rejected. He also adds that after his death last year, "the 60th anniversary of the publication will be announced."
About Paddington, whom she describes as “a very important member of our family,” she says her father was secretly proud of his success.
“He was a quiet man, he didn’t brag,” he added.
“However, because Paddington seemed very real to him, it was almost as if you had a child who achieved something — you feel proud of him, even though it’s not your merit.
I think Paddington's success has been viewed more or less that way.
Although he himself invented and created it, he always gave credit to Paddington himself.”
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye to her over the phone.
After landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors in vain tried to save her life.
“He called me regularly and said it was really bad that he probably wouldn’t get out of it,” says Tanya Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then he called to say that Natasha would die in two minutes, and I had to say goodbye to her.
I did it anyway.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that doctors gave her to maintain her heart function slowly stopped working and were excreted from the body.
She died some time earlier, and that was the end of it.
All I could do was sit back and wait for it to develop.
I couldn’t go out and scream or cry because I was among other people.
I really had to hold on.”
Finally, Tanya Ednan-Laperouse, who had already mourned the loss of her daughter, went on board with other passengers, unaware of the suffering she was going through.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
I had my head down, and my tears were flowing all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane I felt the all-encompassing compassion for Hope.
I felt that he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Postcards from women in mourning to help prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women, whose loved ones have committed suicide, try to distract others from the intention of taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys place on the Welsh Bridge postcards with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can get help with.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he was depressed, and he took his own life at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I feel every day,” he says.
Sharon Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, says her son was a well-proclaimed chef with a contagious smile.
“Everybody knew his smile.
They always said they could illuminate every room.”
Before his death, however, he quit his job because he was “in a really black place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother was 11 years old and it was he who found his brother when he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis says, "I'm still afraid of the domino effect."
Sharon Davis created cards to “tell people that there are people you can turn to and talk to, even if it’s just friends.
Don’t sit still — talk to someone.”
Kelly Humphreys, who has been friends with Sharon Davies for years, soon after her mother's death, lost Mark, her 15-year-old partner.
“He didn’t say he felt clumsy, sad or anything,” he says.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He was already in a complete hole at Christmas, and when the kids opened the presents, he even looked at them."
He says that his death was very painful for them, but they had to deal with it: “It breaks a hole in the family.
He's entertaining us.
But we have to live and fight.”

The future of Brett Kavanaugh depends on Italian as the FBI launches an investigation
“I thought that if we could really get what he asked for — a limited-time and limited-scale investigation — maybe we could achieve some unanimity,” Jeff Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee was “at stake.”
Why didn't Brett Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
All their reluctance comes from the moment.
Elections to Congress are already in a few weeks — November 6. If, according to forecasts, Republicans lose them, the chances of choosing a particular person to the highest court in the country will significantly decrease.
George W. Bush has already raised his headphones to call the senators and push them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him in the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, who was the president’s personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI makes a report?
In the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, the vote will take place.
It is unclear whether Brett Kavanaugh will get at least 50 senatorial votes, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the impasse and bring him to the Supreme Court.
Under Kim’s rule, North Korea’s number of refugees is falling.
According to South Korean lawmaker Kim Jong Un, since he took power seven years ago, the number of people fleeing North Korea to South Korea has fallen.
Quoting data from the South Korean Ministry of Unity, Park Byeong-seug said that last year there were 1,127 leaks, and in 2011 — 2,706.
According to him, the key factors that have affected this situation are more detailed checks on the border between North Korea and China and higher rates levied by smugglers.
Pyongyang did not make a public statement on the matter.
The vast majority of North Korean fugitives are finally proposing South Korean citizenship.
According to authorities in Seoul, since the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally.
The majority flees through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, making it easier to cross it than a tightly demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers fugitives to be illegal immigrants, not refugees, and often force them back into the country.
Relations between the North and the South, which are theoretically still at war, have clearly improved in recent months.
This month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang, where they held talks on negotiations on denuclearization, which had previously fallen to a dead end.
This happened after the historic meeting of the President of the United States, Donald Trump, with Kim Jong Un, which took place in Singapore in June. The result of this meeting is a general agreement on the pursuit of the Korean peninsula's purge of arms.
But on Saturday, North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, accused the United States of lack of progress on the issue.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no certainty as to our national security, and under these circumstances there is no way for us to unilaterally disarm ourselves as the first,” Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh a “hysterical” and claims he is not fit to work in the Supreme Court
The minority leader in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh a “hysterical” and said that he was by nature not fit to work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi spoke these words during an interview she gave on Saturday during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin.
“I think if a woman behaved in this way, she would be considered a ‘hysterical’,” Pelosi said of her reaction to the testimony Kavanaugh gave Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations of alleged sexual harassment of Dr. Christina Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Moments later, during his preliminary speech, Kavanaugh showed strong emotions — he almost screamed and lost his voice when discussing family issues and high school years.
He also vehemently defeated the Democrats from the committee, stating the accusations of a “gross and coordinated assault on the reputation” organized by liberals, angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said Kavanaugh’s testimony showed that he was not fit to work in the Supreme Court because it revealed his bias towards the Democrats.
“I think he disqualified himself by making these statements, as well as by the way he attacked the Clintons and Democrats,” she said.
Asked if she would seek to remove Kavanaugh from office if he received a nomination and if the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi hesitated.
“I’ll say this: if he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he should not only sit in the Supreme Court, but also serve in the court where he currently works,” she said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the District Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she fears Kavanaugh’s possible rulings on the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade trial because he is considered a conservative judge.
During the confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh bypassed the question of whether he would revoke some of the Supreme Court’s decisions.
"This is not the time to introduce a hysterical, prejudiced person to the court who will expect us to say 'but it's wonderful,'" Pelosi said.
And women have to control it.
It's a fair diatribe, months and years of raging rage, and she can't throw it out of herself without crying.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Gloria Stein told me 45 years later.
“That’s pretty common, isn’t it?”
She added: “I was helped tremendously by a woman who was a manager at a company. She said that she also cries when she’s angry, but she invents herself in such a way that when she gets upset and starts crying, she says to the person she’s grieving, she’s probably thinking, ‘I’m sorry.
I'm mad.
He's still doing his thing.
I thought it was brilliant.”
Tears are permissible as an outburst of anger in part because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my most obvious recollections of one of the first positions in a male-dominated office is that one time I began to cry with inexpressible anger. An old woman is a squirrel and a squirrel — a squirrel in a squirrel’s hand.
“Never let them see you cry,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you're sad, and they're happy to have you baked."
Patricia Schroeder of the Democratic Party, then a member of Congress from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught with a lover on a boat called Monkey Business and withdrew from the race, frustrated Patricia realized she could actually consider the idea of running for president on her own.
“It wasn’t a thoughtful decision,” she told me, laughing, 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the election and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone has described this situation as 'The Snow Queen and the Seven Crashers'."
Since the campaign has been going on for a long time, Schroeder has been lagging behind in fundraising and has promised herself that she will not enter the race unless she raises $2 million.
It was a battle doomed to loss.
She then discovered that some of her supporters, who gave men $1,000, had only 250 for her.
“Do they think I have any discounts?” she wondered.
During her speech, in which she announced that she would not run a formal campaign, she was so filled with emotions — gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it so hard for her to collect money and to make it into sex, not turn to voters.
“You might think I’ve been through a nervous breakdown,” he recalls from the press.
“You might think I’m sponsored by Kleenex.
I remember wondering what they'd write on my grave.
'She was crying?'
What Benefits the Economic War Between the U.S. and China May Bring to Beijing
The salvos that started the economic war between the US and China were daunting, and while the battle is still going on, the conflict between these countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
The first warning came this year by U.S. President Donald Trump, imposing tariffs on key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week after the introduction of new tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), which led to taxation of half of all goods flowing into the US from China.
Each time, Beijing has been reciprocating in nature, raising tariffs on U.S. goods worth $60 billion from five to ten percent.
China is determined to respond to every U.S. blow and it doesn’t look like the world’s second economy is going to recess soon.
Washington’s push to pull back means accepting the demands, but a public head-to-head in front of the United States would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, according to experts, if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressure from the U.S. trade war could in the long run strengthen China, reducing dependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision made in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for economic chaos in any of the countries is actually much more dangerous than New think, admitting to the security observers so far,” said Abigail Graczyk in a statement.
Syria's Foreign Minister Says It Is 'Ready' to Return Refugees
The government claims that Syria is ready for a voluntary return of refugees, and asks for help in rebuilding the country that has been ruined as a result of more than seven years of war.
In his speech before the UN General Assembly, Syria’s foreign minister, Walid al-Moualem, stated that conditions in the country are improving.
“The situation on our territory is now more stable and safer thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
In an effort to restore normalcy, the government is constantly rebuilding areas destroyed by terrorists.
All the conditions have already been met for refugees who have had to leave the country due to terrorism and the unilateral economic movements in their daily lives and livelihoods, to be able to return to it voluntarily.
According to UN estimates, more than 5.5 million people have left Syria since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people who still live there are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would gladly accept aid in rebuilding the destroyed country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept aid covered by the terms and conditions or offered by the countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the US team with a score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National in the suburbs of Paris.
On European soil, the United States has lost for the sixth time in a row and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the trophy when, under the leadership of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn, it gained the 14.5 points it needed to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who for most of the tournament did not go well, hit the ball from the base straight to the water at the 16th hole of PAR3, giving the match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shined through all rounds and became one of four players who, since 1979, when this tournament was first held in the current format, managed to score 5-0-0.
American Jordan Spieth was eliminated with a 5&4 score by Europe’s lowest-ranked player, Thorbjorn Olesena from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, who takes the highest position in the world rankings, lost two holes ahead of the last hole with Englishman Ian Poulter, for whom it may have been the last of the Ryder Cup tournament.
The European with the most wins in the Ryder Cup was Spain Sergio Garcia, who has already participated in eight such tournaments and scored 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t stop today.
It's been a tough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas that he believed in me and chose me.
I am very happy to have the cup back.
It’s a success for the whole team and I’m glad I was able to help,” Garcia said after winning the European team.
He handed the stick to his cousin, John Rahm, who on Sunday defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods with a score of 2&1.
“I feel incredible pride in winning with Tiger Woods. I grew up watching him play,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all matches in France and now has a score of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
This is an unprecedented statistic, as on one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 of the most important titles and only relegated to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had trouble finding a runner-up throughout the weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played at a really high level throughout the tournament.
After the disappointing performance of the American band, his captain, Jim Furyk, said: “I’m proud of the boys, they fought.
At some point this morning, we pressed some Europeans.
We're back.
Heads in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players played really well.
Together with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Commission, we will find a way to move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
I'm full of admiration for my opponents.
They played a lot better than us.”
Information about flowering — in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota plankton density decreases
A recent report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a general decline in plankton density in parts of Tampa Bay.
According to the FWC, pstrocat blossom was observed in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties, suggesting that its density is decreasing.
It stretches over a length of about 209 kilometres of coastline, from the north of Pinellas County to the south of Lee County.
The peaks can be found about 16 kilometers off the coast of Hillsborough County, but compared to the previous week in fewer places.
The flowering was also observed in Pasco County.
Last week, the average natural concentration of plankton on the coast and in the waters of the County of Pinellas, low to medium on the coast of Hillsborough, natural to high in the county of Manatee, natural to high in the creeks of the county of Manatee, natural to high in the creeks of Coltte, and high in the creeks of the county of Sara.
In Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier, cases of respiratory distress have still been reported.
Last week, however, they were not found in Northwest Florida.
