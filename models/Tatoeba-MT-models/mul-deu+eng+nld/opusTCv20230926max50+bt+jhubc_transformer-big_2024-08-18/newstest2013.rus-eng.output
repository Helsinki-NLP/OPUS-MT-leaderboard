Republican Strategy of Resistance to Obama's Re-election
The Republican leaders justified their policies by the need to fight forgery in the elections.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter a myth, claiming that cases of election falsification in the United States are rarer than cases of death from a lightning strike.
In addition, Republican lawyers counted only 300 cases of electoral falsifications in the United States in ten years.
One thing can be said with certainty: these new trends will have a negative impact on the turnout of voters.
In this sense, such actions partially discredit the system of American democracy.
Unlike Canada, U.S. states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
That is why most state governments have been enacting laws since 2009 that complicate the registration or voting process.
This phenomenon gained new scope after the November 2010 election, which brought Republicans 675 new seats in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills restricting the right to vote in 41 states were passed in 2011 alone.
The new election laws require the elector to present a photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws reduce the period of early voting, abolish the right to register an elector on the day of the declaration of will and deprive citizens of the right to vote.
Prior to the 2006 election, no U.S. state had required voters to present a photo ID.
Indiana became the first state to introduce such a requirement.
The U.S. Supreme Court confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of the law passed in Indiana.
The Republican authorities hastened to spread this practice to other states as well.
Over the past two years, they have initiated bills that require voters to present identity cards with a photo in 34 states.
It is important to note that unlike Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have such a universal identity card as a health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, i.e. 21 million people who have reached the age necessary to vote, do not have an identity card with a photo issued by the government body of their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have a similar document.
At the same time, the cost of obtaining the required identity card often exceeds one hundred dollars.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of people earning less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over the age of 65, and 20% of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 do not have the required photo ID.
But that's not all.
Students - voters who are believed to vote for candidates from Democrats, in several states are not allowed to use the identity card with the photo issued by their educational institution.
However, the same states allow members of fishing and hunting clubs, who vote mostly for Republicans, to use the certificates issued by these clubs to vote for them.
Until 2004, no state had required proof of U.S. citizenship for voting.
For the first time, such a requirement was introduced in Arizona.
As of 2011, more than ten states have passed laws requiring voters to prove they are U.S. citizens.
These measures, of course, are aimed at limiting the voting of Latin American immigrants.
It is estimated that two-thirds of Latin American voters vote in favor of the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican legislators initiated legislation in 2011 that repeals voter registration on the day of voting in eight states.
They also restricted the right of individuals or groups to provide assistance to those who wish to register.
This restriction did not pass without consequences.
For example, during the 2004 elections, a campaign to register voters helped to list about 10 million citizens.
At the same time, measures taken since 2009 have led to a 17 per cent drop in the number of new voters registered in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators in five other states passed laws aimed at reducing the period of early voting.
For example, during the 2008 Florida general election, 33% of voters who voted prematurely were African-American, although the latter accounted for only 13% of the state’s total voter turnout.
The same was true of the Latin American people.
With only 11% of voters, they accounted for 24% of citizens who voted prematurely.
Unlike whites, who make up 76% of the voters, among the early voters were only 46%.
Of course, Democratic legislators and their supporters are actively opposed to the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters.
Several bills were vetoed by Democratic governors.
The action of the most ambiguous laws was suspended under the intervention of the Attorney General of the United States.
This has allowed us to partially limit the negative effects.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have enacted laws that require a photo ID.
However, the new rules that came into effect will certainly make it difficult to exercise the right to vote in the 2012 elections.
Critics of the Democrats condemn the bias of the laws that have been passed, seeing in them an obvious focus on influencing the results of the 2012 elections in key states.
Brennan Center’s 2011 report shows that the states that passed these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes needed in the electoral college to win the presidential election.
It is too early to say with confidence that these legislative changes at the electoral system level will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential election.
There is only one thing that is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the turnout of voters.
In this sense, such actions partially discredit the system of American democracy.
Screening for prostate cancer: to pass a test or not?
In fact, a PSA test gives sometimes false results, false-negative, and sometimes false-positive, which lead to useless medical intervention.
Men, and so reluctantly undergoing dispensation, have something to doubt even more.
To pass the test or not?
We asked the opinion of two experts.
In studies conducted in the United States, numerous cases of infection were observed among groups of subjects, so the data obtained is difficult to interpret and it is difficult to develop any clear recommendations.
Another study, this time European, found different mortality rates in those patients who underwent screening and those who did not.
This study also showed, after a 12-year observation, that the likelihood of metastasis is 30-40% higher in those who did not undergo screening.
Therefore, I would recommend taking a test starting at age 50, or at age 40, if one of the direct relatives had prostate cancer.
Men of African-American descent are also at increased risk.
The key point is to make the right decision as soon as the cancer is detected.
Cancer can be both aggressive and varicose veins.
The patient needs to explain the degree of risk of his cancer disease, offering him possible options, without the mandatory treatment of prostate cancer, which is not a danger to life in the long term, and making a choice, in these cases, in favor of active care monitoring.
To date, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer will not undergo treatment, as their cancer is not aggressive and poses no threat to life.
We will offer them active surveillance, and if the disease begins to progress, we will start treatment.
Increasingly, we define precisely the criteria for making decisions about who should or should not undergo treatment.
Therefore, I would recommend that you take the test.
But it is also important to consult with your doctor to determine whether or not you need to pass this test.
In collaboration with the International Association of Urology, Mowember has created a tool to assess everything for and against passing the PSA test.

Preventing disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle-recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of scientific research, adherence to a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of disease.
It is believed that if all people were well fed and moved enough, 30% of cancer cases could be prevented.
“If no one smoked anymore, that number would have increased to at least 50%,” said Andre Bolle, the Canadian Cancer Association’s press secretary.
However, it is estimated that 10% of cancers are caused by heredity.
Several types of cancer remain completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Association, the fight against smoking remains a priority, despite a reduction in the number of smokers.
Smoking is associated with 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is a risk factor for many others.
It causes enormous damage to people’s health.
“Even today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec,” says Andre Bollere, the secretary of the press.
10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is halved.
Weighing
According to CAR data, overweight and obesity also contribute to the onset of the disease.
They increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and rectum, gastrointestinal tract, pancreas and uterus.
"Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer," the association said in a statement.
Dietary
The association also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In too large amounts, it increases the risk of developing colon cancer.
Also, sausage products should be avoided.
Conservation of meat by tapping, drying or brine can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
“The latter can harm the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer,” the association explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, many scientists have been researching the effects of vitamin supplements on the development of cancer.
At the moment, however, the results of these studies cannot be called unambiguous.
According to the SCC, studies of vitamin E give contradictory results.
If one of them showed a decrease in the risk of developing prostate cancer, the other gave the opposite result.
In assessing the effect on the development of vitamin D cancer, there is also no complete clarity.
However, Mr. Boljo stressed that it was important to discuss his concerns and family history with the doctor.
"The failure of the analysis does not lead to cancer."
Higgs boson in detail
Last summer's report that scientists may have been able to detect the Higgs boson caused real agitation - and not without reason.
It is believed that this boson explains the mass of all the particles in the universe, not much or little.
In addition, it is the last particle whose existence has been predicted within the framework of the Standard Model - our best, or at least "incomplete" description of nature and the behavior of matter - but which has previously failed to be detected in an experiential way.
But physicists are not yet fully convinced that this is the Higgs boson.
We know, without a shadow of a doubt, that we are dealing with a really new particle and that it is very similar to the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, the new data presented this week at a major physical congress in Kyoto seems to confirm this, although it is not yet sufficient for the full certainty of some data.
Let’s imagine what the Higgs boson is all about, because the chances of making a mistake seem minimal, and let’s see what that means.
There is, in this world, one law that is absolutely inevitable, which says that two things cannot be in the same place at the same time.
There is no way to circumvent this rule, don’t even try too hard, otherwise you will harm yourself.
But while the physics of elementary particles is a rather strange world, it turns out that there is also one law of a similar nature in it: the principle of Pauli's exclusion, which postulates that the two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time as the "parts" of the same time, not as the "parts" of the same time.
Based on this, physics divides the particles into two categories.
In one corner, we find decent citizens, called fermions, who reasonably obey the Pauli principle.
In another, there are bosons, an ugly band of anarchists who have no respect for anything – at least for this principle, which means that they can be quiet in the same place at the same time.
According to Berkeley's Particle Adventure Laboratory website (by the way), these bosons are divided into two groups: the mesons we will not talk about here, and the "particles of force" through which the bogies are distributed by the main forces of nature and to which the chromosomes are not.
These very bosons, it should be emphasized, not all such exotic beings as you might think.
In fact, if you can read this chronicle, it’s because of one incredibly banal boson: a photon, or “part of light,” which is the “courier” of electromagnetic force.
In fact, when a single particle having an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it "ruptures" the electromagnetic field in that particular place, roughly like a stone thrown into a pond.
From this "disruption" is born an electromagnetic wave (light, or infrared radiation, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon - and therefore one of the bosons "force transmitters".
A more stable field.
The same is true of the Higgs boson, with the only difference that in order for this boson to appear, another field, the Higgs field, must be "broken".
However, the Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; in order to excite it, it is necessary to achieve very and very high energies, as if it were a frozen pond, the surface of which could only be shaken by a very large stone.
That’s why you need a huge particle accelerator, like the one operated in CERN — the Large Hadron Collider, which is a ring with a diameter of 27 km! — to achieve such huge energies.
An analogy with the electromagnetic field is also useful for explaining the relationship between the Higgs boson and the mass.
In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, interact, while others do not: a sheet of paper, for example, will never itself be kept in the refrigerator.
Similarly, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that interact have mass, while others (like a photon, by the way) do not.
So, what can "bring" all this research, Ms. Plamondon asks?
In science, they are used to check the correctness of the Standard Model (SM), and this also allows physicists to pinpoint the difference between the results of observations and forecasts of SM.
In addition, some of them passionately yearn for such a discrepancy to be discovered, because the slightest discrepancy can open the door for “new physics” and close some of the Model’s holes.
The latter, it must be said, still has significant drawbacks, offering no explanation for gravity (oh!) or dark matter, which forms about 80% of the universe (oh-oh!).
But no such differences have been found in CERN so far.
Consequences
The benefits of these studies for the everyday life of the average person are more difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that it does not exist.
Look, in the early 1960s, pioneers of laser research in Bell’s labs couldn’t even guess what revolution their work would bring.
They predicted their applications in science, but nothing more.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (previous ones were pulsed) in 1962, said that the laser was originally considered to be a "grab".
Just imagine...
In addition, the application can be found for the instrumentation accompanying the study.
For example, the same Willard Boyle during his optical research in 1969 developed a small light sensor.
This sensor, although it was not its original purpose, now serves as the “eye” for all digital cameras in the world and earned the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
This, of course, does not mean that the work of the Great Adron Collider will necessarily change our lives, but it only shows, in fact, that everything can be.
Palliative care is the best way to die . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The Commission on Dignity in Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate is due to resume soon, and the bill is being prepared at this time.
However, there is still much more to be done in this crucial area.
The “debt” tried to take a closer look.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in Monterey.
Prostate cancer, which destroyed him from the inside, gave him a delay of two years.
“I was given five years, I lived seven,” he says, between life and death, lying in bed in the Victor Gadbua palliative care shelter in Beloya, where he arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, you can't prepare for it," he says.
The disease does its job: an incredible weakness, which does not allow to go to the toilet on its own and even to eat on its own.
Sitting at the table on which an appetizing lunch stands, he gives up and agrees to be helped to eat.
He wakes up, even manages to smile, talk to strangers who work around him, bring him medicine, take him to the bathroom.
Courage before the ordinary death.
“My biggest wish to be cured of diarrhea is humiliating,” he admits.
A few hours later, the staff found a cure for this disease.
“During life, we are taught that a man must urinate standing up,” said Pierre Broder, a psychologist at the Victor Gadbua shelter.
Regressing to the state of the child is an intolerable humiliation for some.
“It all depends on the ability of the human being to accept the decline,” he says.
Since, in the opinion of many people engaged in palliative care, important events occur at the height of this decline.
The patients who enter the Victor Gadbua palliative care facility are all cancer patients.
The forecasts will give them a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses does not provide any more help, called "medical".
Mrs. A., 89, is most afraid to die "in the consciousness of strangulation".
But the disease has allowed me to know my children.
“I have good kids,” she adds.
“I don’t want anything else in life,” she says before allowing me to put on a mask that eases her breathing.
She is still waiting for the next few days for her son’s last visit coming from Italy.
At the Victor-Hadbua shelter, a group of volunteers provide body care and nutrition assistance.
This is palliative care, which remains when nothing else can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, for every 11,700 inhabitants, there is one place in palliative care facilities.
This is very little, given that sooner or later we will all die.
Here life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christian Martel - one of the doctors of the shelter.
Whether it’s physical, emotional, or mental comfort.
We agree to give the dying person a mouth rinse of brandy or pepsi, as he will ask.
Diabetics are no longer required to control their sugar levels.
Death is a part of everyday life.
Last night we brought beer to Mr. H., who died tonight.
In the morning, his son drank this beer in the feet of the deceased.
“We help loved ones, as well as patients,” says Natalie Savar, director of patient care.
In the Victor-Gadbua shelter, no day is like the previous one.
Next to a 93-year-old man who enjoys his last meeting with his family in the yard, lying on his pillows during a toast in his honor, tragically dies a young 36-year-old man surrounded by parents, his wife and two young children and tries everything to make it happen.
“In the past six months, from three to five cocks, they have always been busy with cancer patients under the age of 45,” says Dr. Christian Martel.
53% of the patients admitted to the Victor Gadbua shelter come from home, and 47% from the hospital.
The problem of access to palliative care
It is estimated that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care that is provided to alleviate the suffering of patients entering the final stage of their lives, whether at home, in the hospital or in a shelter.
And some institutions, such as the Victor Gadbua shelter and the Society of Palliative Care at the home of the Greater Montreal, specialize more or less exclusively in caring for cancer patients.
It is this huge gap in Quebec’s health care system that causes many doctors – palliative care professionals – to fear the adoption of a law that legalizes euthanasia and assists in suicide.
Starting in October, a manifesto signed by palliative care luminaires, Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lipuant, is circulating and evidence of their disagreement with such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christian Martel, Quebec’s health care system is not effective enough to ensure the right to high-quality palliative care before the transition to euthanasia is allowed.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who spent 14 days in the ambulance, in terrible pain, and no one took the necessary measures to relieve them.
I'm afraid patients just want to die because they don't get adequate care.
At the same time, many oncologists try to save patients until the last day, despite pessimistic forecasts.
The hopes of survival for Ellen Richard were already minimal by the time she stopped exhausting chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was stopping treatment, she told me that she was sorry that I was stopping the fight.
She told me that my days were numbered!
There is no almighty care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who request death are grateful to the medical staff for not meeting their request after the palliative care team eases their pain.
However, it should be noted that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in the fight against pain.
According to Elsie Monroe, director of palliative care at the Greater Montreal Society of Palliative Care, patients are not susceptible to analgesia in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, in which the patient sleeps until his death, either from time to time, or permanently.
We can no longer pretend that we are not aware of this suffering.
More and more often, patients who fail to relieve pain will be able to have access to palliative sedation.
Patients who suffer from pain always say the same phrase: “I want to die.”
But it doesn’t necessarily mean “I want to be euthanized,” it means “I want to be easier.”
The creation of this report was made possible thanks to a journalistic grant from the Canadian Institute of Health Research.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Québec
The officials responsible for the construction of roads, construction contractors, fundraisers of political parties and experts on the Italian mafia day after day tell what they know about the colossal "system", the mafiosi of the construction industry, public servants, politicians.
The “industry” that was very expensive for Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
“I wonder how this system disintegrates after all the funds have been put into action,” jokes Jacques Duxeno, a deputy and former police chief of Montreal.
It was thanks to him that the scandal broke out in 2011 as a by-product of the investigation of official crimes related to road construction contracts in Quebec, which the then-Liberal Prime Minister, Jean Share, very reluctantly agreed to.
The Dusheno Report established a direct link between industry, the secret financing of political parties and corruption.
“Since the start of the investigation in 2010, he emphasizes, only one Department of Transportation would have saved a billion dollars on contracts” if some had restrained their instincts to take part.
The Charbonno Commission has “already shifted two mayors,” he adds, hoping that it will be able to “open the schemes behind individual individuals.”
Permanent Mission of the Anti-Corruption Unit established in 2011
The case was joined by the Standing Anti-Corruption Unit established in 2011, which included an extensive staff of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
And, in addition, the employees of the special unit "Molot", which after 2009 forced the "share cartel" of Montreal, to stop the excess of the cost of the contracts.
In recent weeks, a series of searches have been conducted, and some municipal officials, in particular Frank Zampino and Richar Marcotte, the mayor of a small town, have been charged with fraud and corruption.
Gil Vayankur, who recently resigned from the post of mayor of Laval, the third-largest city in Quebec.
He is suspected of receiving multiple bribes when placing public orders.
In addition, the official indictment was filed with several Montreal Communications Engineers and construction contractors of Italian origin, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter exploded a real bomb, telling the investigation about the "system" of obtaining state contracts.
For several years, Zambito gave 3% of the cost of contracts in Montreal to a Mafia-related broker who, in turn, transferred money to Mayor Gerald Trump’s party “United Montreal.”
In the 2000s, Zambito threw money to the right and left. He transferred more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to various parties in the province, mostly liberals who were in power at the time.
In addition, he admitted that he had illegally raised funds for the former Deputy Prime Minister of the Liberal Party, Natalie Normando.
Sewerage contracts in which the cost has exceeded
In Montreal, the “system” of corruption worked relentlessly.
Jill Surprenan, a former civil engineering engineer, described it in detail before the commission: in ten years he received from construction firms gifts, invitations to trips, for tournaments on golf, forklifts, forklifts, for restaurants, for hockey games and 7 bribes in total.
Other officials responsible for the construction of the roads admitted that they had received on the pavement, exceeding the accounts by 30-40% with the help of false supplements.
Then one mayor’s party organizer, Martan Dumont, accused Mr. Trump of deliberately closing his eyes on the existence of a parallel budget that filled the party’s cash registers with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Trump resigned in early November, plunged Montreal into a deep crisis.
Chantal Roulo was one of the first deputies in Montreal to raise the alarm.
The mayor of the district of Riviera de Prairie in the east of the island, it has been opposed since 2010 to the sale of a municipal plot, bought for $5 million and resold for... 1.6 million to developers in the middle of a construction boom.
<0xE2><0x80><0xA2> 70% of dirty money in election campaigns
She says that in the investigation, which will eventually begin, she "will pull over a thread that will allow us to understand the functioning of the system infesting ants in order to stop gangrene and identify the culprits."
This process is characterized as “painful, but positive.”
We are in the process of clearing the wound, but Montreal will need its own investigation team and an observer to avoid returning dubious practices.
How we clean up at home.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesne, for his part, remarks that "officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars", but he is particularly concerned about the role of "elective officials who knew about this scheme", but who did not participate in the machinations.
Given that the share of dirty money in the funding of the Quebec election campaign reaches 70%, he jokes: “I was told it was just a pale reflection of reality.”
The government of Quebec proposes limiting donations to parties to $100, but, according to him, this will not change the situation: "Until we strictly limit election spending, there will be dirty money in politics."
He calls for a complete restructuring of the system of granting public contracts and financing parties: "We cannot go down below; by bravely digging into the essence of things, we will be able to build a house on a more solid foundation, with better control and legality."
If this story casts a shadow on the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duceno calls on those who laugh to look into his own yard.
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season, you have achieved an extraordinary range in PSG.
How do you explain this growth?
This may be explained by individual consciousness, but it may also be a new dimension of PSG.
Great players have arrived.
I grow up with them every day.
The technical staff also brought in a lot.
These factors are forcing me to raise the level of my game on a daily basis.
During the game, it’s easier.
In football, everything happens very quickly.
But I'm not getting hot.
From the very beginning in the pre-training center at the NIF in Clarefonten and until I came to St. Stephen’s, I was always stepping forward.
Thus, you benefit from the competition established by Carlo Ancelotti...
To replenish this summer is not a novelty to play matches of a very high level.
They also know that every training is very important.
This leads to the fact that a player like me wants to be on the level and to be as high as possible.
In addition, Carlo Ancelotti is supporting me in my positioning.
He is assisted by substitutes like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Ancelotti is the owner of the situation?
Yeah, sure.
Ancelotti pays tribute to all the technical staff.
Today he has no equal in the First League and he is among the best coaches in Europe.
He has extensive experience and has won a lot of titles with high-class clubs.
He has worked with great players.
I think he will bring new titles to Paris.
In January, I had a hopeful conversation with him.
Then I left a whole series of injuries.
The trust that he gives me also explains my achievements.
What do you think of the first season of PSG?
In the First League, Lyon took the place of the leader.
But we're still ready.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we effectively qualified in one of the eight finals.
What is the club’s goal in this tournament?
We will try to move as far as we can.
From now on, everything can be.
We will be able to speak face-to-face with very good European teams.
We first want to finish first in our group, before Porto, to have the opportunity to take the match back in one eighth final.
Will PSG be able to become a top-class European club in the short term?
He already has a budget for that.
In order to become a major European club, Paris needs to win titles and consolidate its position in the long term.
That's not the case today.
Financially, PSG has the means to make this project a reality.
Not taking the title in the Premier League, like last season, would be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
This year, we are really looking forward to winning this championship title.
We were close to that last season.
In May, there was a disappointment because we had everything to get to the finish first.
It was a very successful season.
We finished it with 79 points.
As a rule, 79 points assumes the title of champion.
But another team, Montpellier, played an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think everything will be fine.
“Despite the fact that strong teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux have entered the fight for the title, I think we have the strength to win.
Don’t you think the media expects too much from PSG?
It’s normal that a lot is expected of us, given how much has been invested and what players we have.
We are fully prepared for this.
On the other hand, when we win 4-0 at home against Troy and still find us something to criticize, of course, it's a bit frustrating.
We wonder what people are expecting from us in the first place.
We will never be able to win every weekend with a 4-0 score.
We are not FC Barcelona.
We are trying to implement the game.
The team is formed over time.
We have proven in the Champions League that we can respond to modern challenges.
Take a look at Manchester United, which has not been able to make it to the same eighth final for two seasons, although they have also spent a lot of money!
Considering the amount invested, we represented you 15 points ahead already before the winter break.
It would be a disregard for our opponents and for the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not at the top last season, were “excited” by this new PSG.
This shows how exciting the First League is.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and tell ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we have won.
PSG seems to depend entirely on Zlatan Ibrahimovich’s feats.
Well, what if they say there's some kind of "Golden Dependency".
This only means that Ibrahimovic is very successful and that he scores many goals.
He came for this and he proves that he is a Star of the First League.
Everywhere he played, he showed himself to be a great player and a world-class star.
In the group, we respect him as a person and as a player.
He also respects the people around him.
What he has done is truly exclusive.
It also encourages others to improve their game.
Tiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also motivates everyone to move forward.
How did you survive Euro 2012 with the French national team?
It's disappointing.
I was very keen to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from wasting a bit of playing time.
I saw a lot of things there, and I came out stronger.
I’ve been able to play good qualifying games today.
This is what I have been hoping for since my baptism with the Sons.
We have learned lessons from what happened in Ukraine, and now we have to be exemplary.
What do you think of the first months of Didier Desham as the leader of the Blues?
They are effective for him.
He has good positions in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
He is a strict coach, he is close to the players and inspires to win.
As was Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to compare.
Blan has achieved his goal, he qualified us for the Euro.
I hope Didier Desham will take the Blues to Brazil.
A good deserved null (1-1), broken on October 16 in Spain - is this a foundation match?
This game gave us confidence in ourselves.
Everyone fought for all of them.
Before that shock in Spain, there have been no matches like this in my career.
Pay and sell without the help of banks - with Bitcoin
The complete opposite of the current exchange of money based on central banks, numbered transactions between the receiving parties c commissions for their processing.
In addition, as is often the case with these technologies, the political vision is obvious: the belief that the current currency system, consisting of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is simultaneously a virtual currency (but converted into dollars, euros...) and a protected BitTorrent-type exchange protocol that allows file sharing between participants of the same level.
About 200,000 operations have already been registered with 15,000 computers on the network.
Several thousand websites accept bitcoins to make donations or as a means of payment.
The bitcoin price, reaching a maximum of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to $2, five months later, before returning today to about ten dollars (the rates are listed on bitcoincharts.com).
There is nothing special compared to the world exchange of real money or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) in its report on virtual currency, published in October, was interested in this system.
He describes bitcoin as “the most successful virtual currency,” “competitive with the dollar or euro,” and “similar to conventional currencies.”
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies, such as “credits” used to promote in a video game, which are earned during the game or which can be purchased (and sometimes exchanged).
The social network Facebook has also developed a similar system.
But exchange operations are always controlled and processed by any central authority.
In Bitcoin, all nodes of the network are simultaneously accountants, auditors, currency issuers, buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Every transaction between two users actually takes place between two e-mail addresses, just like an e-mail.
Only for each new payment, the user can choose a different address, thus ensuring anonymity.
The set of information related to this transaction is signed electronically, using a dual-key encryption system.
The network can also verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is possible to check that the bitcoins used in the transaction actually exist in a public account book sent across the network.
The key step is to register a new transaction in this book.
It passes through the solution of a mathematical problem sent to computers, which, as a temporary central bank, is given the privilege of adding this new line.
This is the phase of hashing a file, i.e. converting a large file into a digital signature, short and unique.
Computers “take” a new transaction and add a number to it before “hashing” everything together.
The goal is to find a number that will give a unique digital signature (many zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, other nodes can easily verify that it is correct.
The transaction thus becomes inextricably linked to the chain of all other transactions; any modification will change the digital signature.
If a user wanted to pay twice with the same money in order to cheat very quickly (in less than ten minutes), only one of these two transactions would be confirmed by the network – and the other would remain unconfirmed, as they have different electronic signatures.
The computer that solves the problem receives 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, the reward is regularly split in half, probably by the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divided to one hundred million, leaving a further reserve.
The complexity of the task also increases with the increase in computing capacity.
The life of the network has already experienced ups and downs.
Sites that provide Bitcoin services were under attack, and bitcoins were stolen from the reserves.
“The defect used does not concern the protocol itself,” says Pierre Nuaz, who recently launched Paymium, a company that makes payments with real money using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reported the possibility of money laundering through this anonymous service.
However, cash also has this disadvantage as well.
Big players, such as Wikipedia, refuse to accept donations of this kind.
Others, such as the WordPress blogging platform, allow them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the account book and found that almost 80% of bitcoins are not in circulation.
The "Gigant Sale" was announced in November.
“Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged,” says Yon Holmkvist, who works at Coinabul, which is engaged in the conversion of bitcoins to gold.
Pierre Nuaz, another author of the manual on this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as an operating network.
Its system, Paytunia, is the equivalent of a credit card (in real money) or contactless payment over a mobile phone, but it uses Bitcoin to check transactions, which makes it cheaper.
The owner has better control of his personal data and can thus be anonymous.
The system is simple to implement for entrepreneurs who do not need to install new devices or software.
All it takes is to provide an address that can be "photographed and recognized" by phone, Pierre Nuaz clarifies, confirming that he already has thousands of users.
There is a general tendency to revise hierarchical systems in favor of more horizontal ones.
“Before Bitcoin is confirmed, it will take some time, but 2013 could be a turning point,” he predicts.
In its report, the ECB proposes, by the way, to reconsider the various risks that are considered to be elevated today, in the event of the success of this system.
We're out of Afghanistan.
What's next?
French troops have left their zone of responsibility in Afghanistan (Capes and Surabaya).
NATO and the U.S. should follow them at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain control of its territory, and for Afghans to choose their future, not just on us.
We were mostly affected by Afghan peasants, whom we regarded as terrorists.
And we ourselves, with 88 soldiers killed, and wounded and mutilated.
The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former commanders hiding in Pakistan, but also often of peasants who deny the presence of a foreign army, as it was with the USSR.
They want to protect their traditions, old and archaic, even if they are joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
They are tolerated, sometimes helped by local rebels, but they will no longer be as long as the West behaves more delicately.
The departure of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I observed from the height of the hills planted with almond trees thanks to French loans, was in order.
Convoys of trucks and armored vehicles accompanied by helicopters reached Kabul without being attacked.
From the end of 2014, there will be no Taliban invasion of Kabul.
Circumstances have changed since their insurmountable progression from 1994 to 1996.
At the time, Kabul was empty, the country was in fire and blood because of fighting between different groups.
Taking them under the control of the country was then perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghan women have paid for the ecstasy of these peasants, in which they were surpassed by Al Qaeda, but their situation has not improved even today.
The former Mujahideen, the Afghan government and the current Taliban are united in their desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main characters of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become partisans capturing state lands to resell them under construction to repatriates who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, using huge U.S. subcontracts.
They are discredited; most of them, by the way, did not even fight themselves.
People, as I've heard in rural areas, want a government that wouldn't consist of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have achieved American generosity: the flow of capital is significant.
Young people are tired of the war and its ideology.
They lived in the modern world during exile in Iran or Pakistan, they appreciated its advantages.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, one fifth of the total population.
The public schools in the cities are filled with both boys and girls.
It is necessary to secure the jobs of these young people, who do not want to return to the darkness of the old parties or to the corruption of some leaders.
Everyone, including armed militants, likes mobile phones, television, and Turkish soap operas that represent the modern world and that look everywhere.
There is an army at the moment.
Will the authorities that will command it be considered legitimate?
The old commanders who waged the anti-Soviet struggle are already taking measures to restore provincial wives who would not be subject to the central authority.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with strong local differences, must be decentralized to some extent, following the pattern of Western countries, but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralized state with a strong presidential power, eliminating the post of prime minister of the year that has existed since the 19th Constituent Assembly.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, especially before the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country, starting in the 1950s, and even earlier, depends on foreign aid.
The industry has not been put on its feet, no dam is functioning, no irrigation system has been repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except vegetables and fruits.
Priority is given to a private initiative.
In a country destroyed by the Thirty Years' War, state control of infrastructure would be necessary.
There have been rumors that Afghanistan has a huge amount of mineral wealth.
This only intensified the feeling that Western countries were present there, only to be taken over.
Without energy to recycle iron ore ore or copper in place, without means of transport to export them through the mountains, there is no extraction of useful minerals.
The Chinese have almost left the Mes Ainak copper mine, leaving international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) to excavate the huge Buddhist complex and remain the province’s largest employers.
It is also necessary that, one day, Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports depend to a large extent, restore normal relations.
The withdrawal of the French combat units ended on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the preservation of traditional assistance: a nursery for girls, for boys, a French language faculty at the university, a French institute, a co-operation in military, legal, medical and sub-agricultural.
Since 2009, in the pursuit of "conquering the hearts and minds" and fulfilling the impossible task of combining assistance with offensive operations, the service "military-civil activity" under the Ministry of Defense (Cimic) has been abolished by the Ministry of Defence.
These works, with the intense attraction of local labor, were able to help withstand the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, forest restoration, fruit trees, soil protection, and an increase in the area of paved lands.
What will we leave in memory of ourselves by spending two billion euros on military spending?
A much more modest budget would contribute to improving the living conditions of the local population, very harsh in these valleys, often located at an altitude of more than 2,000 meters above sea level.
The Embassy received dozens of written requests for the implementation of small agricultural works originating from local communities in the province of Capisa.
To get rid of the revolts led by foreign groups, what the farmers want, as they told me, we need to give them a little non-military support that would be well-controlled and dealt with directly.
Difficult Births of the Constitution of Egypt
This is a risky new step by President Mohammed Mursi.
While Egypt is divided more than ever on the issue of a constitutional declaration that temporarily gives it extraordinary powers, it has decided to play va-bank.
Surprisingly, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on the final text the next day.
Exactly a week ago, the Head of State gave the Assembly two additional months to complete the work.
It is almost two years since Egypt relies on a preliminary text, which has been amended several times, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal contradictions.
This new initiative has only intensified the division of the country.
In the opinion of his opponents, the President persists in his “autocratic madness”, continuing to “break this word” and “deprive the right.”
In the camp, his followers are convinced that this is a way to end the institutional and political crisis by accelerating the transition process.
The referendum must be held within fifteen days.
A very short period of time, which causes the Brothers to abandon their intention to explain to the Egyptians the text, article by article.
For the president, it is also a way to restore public and democratic legitimacy, while discontent is raging across the country.
Mohammad Morsi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote positively, as he said in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Especially since the call for an accelerated vote resembles an ultimatum to the Egyptian people: “Either you vote for my text, or I leave me extraordinary powers,” which are supposed to be completed after the adoption of the Constitution.
In this strange atmosphere, 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, mostly Islamists, voted for the text yesterday.
Most liberals have not responded to the challenge.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they knocked on the door, feeling unable to express their opinion.
Representatives of human rights defenders, religious minorities or civil society did the same.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, 11 people, spare participants, were hastily added yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
It is not surprising that in most cases the articles were voted unanimously.
The commentators, by the way, were pleased with the fact that one of the few differences of the day arose around... time for prayer, as some members of the committee considered that the clocks of the Constituent Assembly were incorrectly set.
The text, on which the vote was held yesterday, consists of 234 articles.
The object of general attention, article 2 ultimately remained an identical article from the 1971 Constitution, stating that “the principles of sharia are the main source of law.”
Salafist parties, for which the implementation of Islamic law is one of the main demands, hoped to replace the "principles" with the "rules" that would allow for their more stringent application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is a testament to their goodwill and respect for other members of Egyptian society.
“Hypocrisy,” replied the liberals, who see only a pier in this.
Because, in their opinion, the Islamization of the Constitution takes place through other articles.
They refer in particular to article 220, which gives the University of Al-Azhar an advisory role, in particular in verifying compliance with Sharia law.
According to Egypt expert Sophie Pomier, this is alarming, because "people who are destined to make decisions are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy."
We can observe the birth of theocracy.”
Many liberals, moreover, are agitated by the fact that the next rector of this university seems to be far less moderate than the current one.
“At the moment, there is no specific religious intervention.
With this constitution, we remain within the framework of civil law.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not ultimatums, but people with university education, some of whom were trained in the French system,” says Alexis Bloe, who is preparing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges that “around article 220 there may be ambiguity, since the terms used in it are borrowed from religious vocabulary.
This applies in particular to the "fiqh" [Islamic jurisprudence, cf. ed.].
And in the future, the question may arise, how competent the civil judges are to make decisions about it.”
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is subject to criticism, as it gives broad powers to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim brothers claim that they have been significantly reduced compared to what they were under the old regime.
Another point of contention: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, consideration of the defense budget will take place not in the Parliament, but in the National Defense Council.
The trial of civilians in military courts will also not be banned, despite requests from human rights associations.
The latter also expressed concern about the text, which they deem detrimental to freedom.
Responsibilities for blasphemy have been maintained, and from now on, insults have been banned, which can have serious consequences for freedom of speech, and especially for freedom of the press.
In addition, none of the articles anymore speaks of protecting women, emphasizes Heba Moraef, from Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture in article 36.
A word that did not appear in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president was scheduled to speak on television last night, the demonstrations are scheduled to take place at noon today.
Supporters of the head of state, in turn, will go out on the streets on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for holy places, the Pup of the Earth and the sea from the nest
The Promised Land combines the grandeur of biblical truths, modern comfort and primordial nature.
The AIF has identified five of the most important reasons to visit Israel.
Let's worship the holy places
It is worth a visit to the Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that everyone who enters this “bubble” is reduced to God’s grace.
And Galilee is the place of Jesus’ miracles: turning water into wine at the wedding, walking on water, calming storms and filling nets.
Here Jesus appeared before the disciples and after the resurrection.
The most holy place in Jerusalem.
Believers here pass the Way of Suffering or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (in Latin - Via Dolorosa).
It begins at the fortress of Antony - Pretoria - where the court was, and on the streets of the Old City leads to the Temple of the Lord's tomb on Mount Golgotha - to the place of the Crucifixion, the Stone of anointing and the burial place of Jesus.
Here is the symbolic Christian Pup of the Earth, symbolizing the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem was built in the place where, according to Christian legend, a tree grew, from which they made a cross for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem there is also the holiest place for the Jews - the Wall of Cry, which remains from the temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
Traditionally, people of different denominations leave here notes with wishes, which are then fulfilled.
Make a trip on the vertical.
The ruins of the fortress of Massad remained a secret refuge from enemies, which Herod the Great built in 25 BC for his family.
They are located on steep cliffs in the mountains at an altitude of 450 m above sea level.
And only those who are passionate about mountaineering can reach them by their walk.
The rest to this historic summit is transported by a lift on a cable car.
And in the north of the country at an altitude of 1600-2040 m is the famous ski resort Hermon, on which in the winter months - a huge influx of tourists.
To him from the foot of the mountain is a bus-shattle.
The total length of the ski slopes is 45 km.
According to ancient tradition, on the top of the mountain were supposedly pagan gods.
Visiting Unique Museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You don’t go on a trip at all.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, are worth a visit.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, located near the Knesset (parliament).
It contains the oldest Kumaran manuscripts, or scrolls of the Dead Sea, found in the caves of the Jewish Desert, and about 500,000 archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
It is also worth visiting the Museum of Art in Tel Aviv.
In his exhibition are widely presented the paintings of the Impressionists and Expressionists Mona, Pissarro, Renoir, Cezanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagal, Picasso.
In Akko you can visit the Al Basha Ban Museum, which represents several halls of ancient Turkish baths with a lot of visitors and bathers of the time.
In Caesarea, it is worth visiting the unique part of the Rally Museum, where you can admire the sculptures of Dali and Roden.
There are no tour guides and souvenir shops.
Entrance is free and donations are not accepted.
The Fifth – the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv – tells about one of the most dramatic pages in history.
The most tragic section - a children's memorial - is built in memory of 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You go into it, and you find yourself in absolute darkness.
The stars are shining.
And the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died are heard.
Ukraine is mentioned here as well.
Rehabilitation
The three main resort areas of Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean, Red and Dead Sea.
Each of them has swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanariums.
Interestingly, even in the winter months, the Red Sea swims, as the water temperature there does not drop below 21 degrees of heat, and the air is heated to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer, and there are swimming all year round.
By the way, this is the most unusual sea in the world is at the lowest point of the planet - 417 meters below the ocean level.
The azure water in it is a salmon, easily holding on to the floating even unable to swim at all.
The surrounding landscapes are unrealistic.
They come here to undergo a course of treatment with the use of salt water - rapes, and healing mud, and to cure health with dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes mellitus to bring in order to get rid of swollen nerves.
Touching the Secrets of Antiquity
They are preserved by the ancient part of Tel Aviv - the town of Jaffa on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea.
Through it passed the famous Sea Route, connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it was here that Noah built his ark, and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom they lived a long and happy life.
Tourists love to wander through the narrow streets named after the signs of the Zodiac.
They say if you touch the walls on the street of your "your" sign, Fortune will be favorable.
In Jaffa you can meet newlyweds coming from all over Israel and even other countries at a photo shoot.
And in Caesarea - the city of King Herod - you can wander around the Roman theater, "take" the fortress of crusaders.
During the Roman period, Caesaria was the capital of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Tourist on the note
When traveling to Israel, do not worry about your imperfect English: in the country about 30% of the population know Russian.
It is better to take money on a trip not in euros, but in dollars, which are easy to exchange for shekels (now $1 - 3.8 shekels).
Urban transport is mostly buses, but in Jerusalem there is a high-speed tram, and in Haifa - the only metro line in the country, consisting of six stations and connecting the Lower City with the Upper.
Actually, it's an underground funicular.
The ride in all types of urban transport costs 6 shekels, which can be driven with transfers within 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated on the Sabbath.
From the evening of Friday until sunset on Saturday, the market, shops, public transport stop.
And on Sunday morning, the work week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels - only kosher food, excluding pork, seafood, fish without scallops and dishes that combine milk with meat.
There are a wide selection of lamb and beef dishes, soups and desserts prepared on coconut milk, traditional Jewish pasta humus, various sauces, balls from hammered grout - fallal, fruit and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
But there are a lot of fed cats, who "walk on their own."
In the evening you can see them sleeping even on the roofs of parked cars.
Butterflies love crowded places and don’t give up snacks.
Renting a car, depending on the brand, will cost from $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) to 188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Plus insurance - $15 per day.
And renting a bike will cost 15 shekels a day.
Tickets in museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
Numerical language
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most of the citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine came to travel and rest.
From January to October 2012, 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists visited the Promised Land, which is 51% more than in 2010, before the cancellation of visas on February 9, 2011.
"Great and powerful" will lead to Moscow: migrants will dig up money in the language
While MPs and human rights defenders argue that it will give a law on mandatory language testing, there have already been scammers in the country who trade “fake” certificates.
Every year, 13 million guest workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make money to support the families who remain in their homeland.
Since December 1, a law has entered into force, according to which every working migrant will be required to pass an exam for knowledge of the Russian language.
For the time being, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the fields of service, housing, communal housing, housing, and retail.
However, over time, - promised in the FMS, - tests will become mandatory for all visitors.
At the same time, you will have to surrender not only the language, but also the Russian history, and the foundations of the legislation.
Language knowledge will have to be confirmed both for obtaining and for prolonging a work permit.
The exception applies only to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
Do not fall under the law and people who managed to obtain certificates and diplomas on education until the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Benefits, Determination and Protection of Rights
The network of examination points will work under the aegis of the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, the University of Friendship of Peoples, MSU, SPbGU and other Russian universities.
Migrants will be able to take tests in all cities; already in Russia more than 160 such centers have opened.
The initiative to introduce the testing was supported by both the State Duma and the FMS.
But human rights defenders, before the law came into force, have often managed to ask the press the question: what does this actually give?
What will change the obligation to know the language for Russians and for the visitors themselves?
First of all, according to the representatives of the migration service, this will reduce the number of people suffering from "labour slavery".
Very many are now talking about the protection of the rights of working migrants, explains the head of the FMS representation of Russia in Tajikistan Viktor Sebelev.
The protection of their rights must begin before their departure.
Only the system of organized recruitment will allow 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers.
Problems arise in migrants without a profession, education, not knowing the language, not having a medical certificate.
Without understanding the language, - Sebelev is sure, - the future migrant is doomed to face unfamiliar people, who under the kind of help will take him a "travel" to a terrible narrow barracks, where he and dozens of such hours will be spent months without food and documents.
We receive a lot of complaints from our migrants.
“They are promised one thing at home, and when they arrive, they are deceived, they are taken out of passports, they are not paying the promised salary,” Tolyb Sharipov, the head of the Department of Labour Migration of Tajikistan, confirmed.
Don't be shy, resident!
However, so far, many citizens of Central Asian republics, who are coming to Russia to earn money, admit that not only do they not know the language of the country they aspire to, but also write on their own hardly.
Of course, it is not so much their fault as trouble: few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to get even an elaborate primary education.
After all, their families have nothing to even feed the children, not to mention that they are decently dressed, dressed and equipped for school.
Growing up to adolescence, such guys go to earnings at the first opportunity.
It is difficult, if poor with knowledge of the language, to admit.
"You feel humiliated and incomplete."
However, with regard to the language law, human rights defenders point to one important point.
Testing will be carried out only for those migrants who have legal status.
If there is no status, there will be no exam or subsequent official work.
Meanwhile, the majority of guest workers are still living in Russia illegally.
“Welcome, or the entrance is forbidden.”
Many of the arrivals claim that getting official status in our country is not so easy.
The reason is in bureaucratic premises and the same language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But a false registration can be made quickly and only for a thousand and a half.
The employees of the Russian police know that we mainly have fake documents, there is no registration, hence the cases of extortion.
"A hundred, two for cigarettes, tea," Tajikistan citizen Umed Khuskadamov told reporters.
"Come on, don't paint, buy a painting"
On the first day of the entry into force of the Law on Language, it was found that not only migrant registration documents are fake.
Several “lip” certificates about passing language tests have already been taken by FMS employees.
The fake papers are printed on a regular color printer.
Of course, they got new owners not in vain: each of the migrants, who hoped to thus facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is two and a half times more expensive than the formal testing procedure: it will cost a labor migrant of 3,000.
The main task in the near future is to protect the system from corruption, so that “shorts” could not be simply bought, the representatives of the government and human rights defenders agree.
While the authorities can promise guest workers who have not been able to successfully pass the test since the first time, time to study the basic language course.
In addition, visitors who do not know Russian will be offered work in areas that do not involve active communication with people.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs does not take into circulation the illegal market of weapons
The proportion of crimes involving the use of legal weapons is extremely small
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia proposes to tighten the law against the owners of civilian weapons.
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: Pushing shots at weddings when there were no victims, and the massacre organized by Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, which killed seven people.
Police want to ban the wearing of trauma in public places and increase the age from which you can obtain a gun license - from 18 to 21 years.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption Irina Yarovaya and promised that amendments to the Weapons Act will be made in the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is satisfied that the Russian authorities are trying to combat the problem by “turning the hooks”.
There was an open letter on the network, the authors of which - representatives of various public shooting organizations - demanded to give up "useless tightening".
The percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons is minimal, said Vasily Lesnikov, a criminal lawyer, to the Russian service of the BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, in the six months of 2012, 142 crimes were committed with the use of firearms registered in the internal affairs bodies, while in the same period, 1168 thousand crimes were recorded.
The authors of the open letter are confident that the tightening of the legislation in the field of civil weapons does not allow the criminal to go to the "black" market.
Now, according to them, in Moscow you can find any weapons at a low price.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Internal Affairs claims to be in control of the situation with the proliferation of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The “black” arms market is replenished through several channels.
The main channels are five, says retired Colonel Viktor Baranets, who worked for ten years in the structure of the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of the site accepting orders for weapons.
The first is an "army or military footprint", i.e. a weapon that was stolen during combat operations in the Caucasus.
“Weapons were carried by both Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves,” Baranets said.
The next type of "black weapon" - stolen by criminals from representatives of power structures.
Baranets explains that these include those taken from police warehouses, and those stolen directly from law enforcement officials.
Illegal “strums” go on sale from military warehouses.
There were frequent explosions in many military warehouses.
"There are proven versions that some of the fires were made specifically - to cover the deficiency," the former military official said.
According to Baranza, weapons manufacturers are importing their lepta.
“Private weapons factories are now producing, which do not withstand competition in the international market and throw weapons from under the floor into the black market, including Moscow,” the expert said.
Another source of the “black” market is smuggling.
Particularly much is happening with guns and machine guns from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
“There is a production, sometimes bushy, and a mafia was formed that organized the flow,” explains the former military.
Where'd the guns come from?
Experts have calculated the approximate share of each of the sources of illegal arms supplies to the "black" market.
A report on this was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and State-Management Design.
The specialists analyzed the reports of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Rosstat, the criminological literature and the open data of the portals on the subject of weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, researchers write, come from the army and the military departments.
Half of all weapons on the black market were found there “due to officials whose work is related to weapons,” the report said.
According to the researchers, 17% of the cases of weapons come from places of armed conflict, in 14% of cases there are thefts at the stage of the production of weapons, 5% is for "black archaeology".
The salesman-consultant of one of the weapons stores, who asked not to name his name, assures that the weapons found by black miners, for a long time no one buys - too old.
Most often, as he says, after the new party, the sellers go to the military warehouse.
Through a flagship, a person buys a unit, such as a TT gun.
He's got it written out, handed over to him through the locksmith.
"He takes it to the city and here he sells for 900 euros for a thing with two shops," he says.
“In fact, the police are aware of all the cases, so periodically when a plan for the disclosure of crimes burns, they make a control purchase from illegal arms dealers,” the consultant adds.
"Like in a luxury store"
The seller and the buyer often find each other through acquaintances.
I looked at the sites, the blogs, until I got a response from a friend who suggested I come to the Begovaya platform, where there will be a person who will take me to the corner, where we will trade.
The price of the gun was only there.
Viktor Baranets, military observer
To get the gun, I need a friend who has a way out, - says the sales consultant. - I have such a friend, but I'm not sure about it.
There are sellers in the markets, but it is also necessary to come there, conditionally, "from Ivan Ivanovich, who asked to convey that his daughter's tooth fell out."
I'm even getting a couple of cassettes through a person I'm sure of.
He also delivers them only to me because he knows I won't give them up.
Newcomers are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military man Viktor Baranets tried himself as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he prepared to publish an article about it.
The plans, he said, have not changed.
He was given an album with photographs where there was "anything".
“I felt like I was in a luxury store,” the military recalled.
The buyer, according to Baranza, is not offered a cat in a bag - everything can be tried.
I, a potential customer, do not just buy - we go with the seller to the woods, we set a target there.
“They give me the opportunity to shoot, and when I make sure that the weapons are beating well, we start negotiating,” the expert said.
Shop on the sofa
The search engines on the Internet go to sites and groups in Vkontakte, where they offer to buy weapons "for different purposes".
No documents or personal appointments are required for this.
"It is enough to have a certain amount of money", - write in the advertising cap on the website "Buy a combat gun or machine gun".
It is where users leave their requests and ask questions.
Will it be sold to minors?
"Without a license of course", - asks the user "Ivan" (orphography saved).
"I buy TT.Moscow" - laconic formulates the request "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service has now disseminated a huge network of supportive sites and who want to buy combat weapons with a shovel.
People go like a hungry fish to feed, and then they mine coal in Siberia
Military observer and ex-military Viktor Baranets
I have heard of such schemes: usually the site is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People are taking orders.
The buyer makes the payment through the ATM.
"In response, they send a photo and instructions where the weapons are hidden," - says the press secretary of the public organization "Right to arms" Dmitry Kislov.
Viktor Baranets claims that by leaving the application on the website, you can stay without weapons and get behind the grid.
The Federal Security Service has now disseminated a huge network of supportive sites and who want to buy combat weapons with a shovel.
“People go like a hungry fish to feed, and then they produce coal in Siberia,” he says.
Makarov for $100
When buying illegal firearms, experts estimate, you can deposit in the amount of 100 to 900 dollars.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the organization "Right to arms", Makarov's gun can be purchased for 100-300 dollars.
We'll have to wait a month and a half.
It is dispatched from the warehouses of long-term storage by the management of these warehouses of the middle unit.
According to the official statistics of the Ministry, compared to January - October 2011, the number of such crimes in Russia as a whole decreased by 7% and amounted to 22.9 thousand, and the number of detected facts of theft and extortion of 8% on weapons, ammunition, explosives and stuff.
Fastfood workers and supermarkets are beaten in the U.S.
Through work at the cash register, McDonald’s passes up to a quarter of all American teenagers
In recent days, there has been a wave of low-wage protests across America in Walmart’s department stores and restaurants of popular fast food chains such as McDonald’s, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy’s and Kentucky Free Chicken.
Until no one is able to predict whether this wave will turn into a ninth wave or it is destined to exhale in the early stages.
The campaign is supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing public organizations.
In addition to raising the modest salaries that ordinary Walmart employees and fast food systems receive, the protest organizers aim to create trade unions in them.
So far, this sector of the economy is almost not covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The campaign began last week, after Thanksgiving, on the so-called “Black Friday,” when an orgy of cheap sales crashed into America, capturing millions of people and sometimes accompanied by gossip.
On this day, some employees of Walmart Corporation, which employs 2.2 million people around the world, left their jobs and pitched together with trade unions and left-wing activists at the corporation’s store, whose product is designed for people of modest and medium-sized wealth.
Walmart sells everything in the world, from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products in its stores are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in major supermarkets.
That’s why many low-wage Walmart employees only work on their own.
The availability and assortment of products have made Walmart one of the largest corporations in America.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell custom goods in part because it pays little to its employees.
The latter also complain of difficult working conditions, such as a lack of forklifts or manual scanners.
Participants in the Black Friday shares demanded to raise salaries and bet that the cost of medical insurance provided by the corporation jumped from $30 to $100 a month.
To a typical Walmart employee who earns $9.5 an hour, this expense is not on his pocket, they said.
Scientists at the University of California at Berkeley prove that if Walmart raises its average hourly salary to $12 billion, it will cost the corporation $3.2 billion.
That’s about 1.1% more than she spends on her salary now.
If Walmart fully postpones the increase in wages on the shoulders of buyers, every visit to the store will cost them only 46 cents more.
In a year, they will spend about $12.39 more than they do now.
Supporters of Walmart noted that the protests took place in only nine states and did not cause any damage to the corporation.
Black Friday continued in its stores from 8 p.m. on Thursday to midnight the next day, and during that time Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, its cash registers have produced nearly 100 million transactions in the “Black Friday” network.
In an interview with the Huffington Post, Dan Fogelman, a spokesperson for Walmart, claimed that the jobs had left a total of “less than five” Walmart employees, and that the protest was simply “another piarov trick” organized by Walmart.
"Free cash register!"
The protests continued this week in New York City, where their object was not Walmart department stores (they are not complaining in this progressive city, and therefore they are not here yet), but McDonald’s and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald’s says he sells billions of servings, and after that he doesn’t even give you hospitals and pays you for honest work!
Jumaine Williams, Member of the City Council of New York
At the moment, the minimum wage, according to federal and New York legislation, is $7.25 per hour.
Fast-food restaurants are increasing over time, but few, and on average their regular employees get $8.90 an hour in New York.
Fewer of them in this expensive city no one earns.
How can there be such money in New York, it is incomprehensible to me.
Once through McDonald’s, almost a quarter of American teenagers who worked behind their shelves after school were living with their parents.
Few people have seen the main source of food in it or planned to stay there for a long time.
Right now, I’m constantly running into interviews with McDonald’s employees who complain that they have to live on this salary and sometimes even feed children on it.
On the other hand, there is a comment on the Wall Street Journal forum, the author of which remarks that it is irresponsible to raise children if you do not know what you are going to feed them on.
Participants in the protests, which began at 6.30 a.m. on Thursday at McDonald’s on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and chefs of the fast food system start paying at least $15 an hour for work, i.e. more than doubled their wages.
They also called for the establishment of trade unions in the area of fast food.
The U.S. law prohibits the administration from preventing and punishing trade union activists with bribes and dismissals.
On the other hand, the administration rarely makes life easier for them.
But it is also difficult for the trade union to cover fast food for objective reasons.
One of the main ones is the extraordinary fluidity of the personnel.
Disagreements
Noise protests took place on that day and at a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the action came in the middle of the day a rally at McDonald’s near Times Square, which featured several local Democrat politicians, in particular, a member of the city council Jumaine Williams, who told him that don’t give a bounty to him!
The demonstrators were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, such as Bill De Blasio, the city’s mayoral candidate, who said that “we need to join the fast-food workers in a friendly way so that they get a fair pay and economic well-being!”
As described by the New York Times, it was the largest action of its kind in the history of the American fast food industry.
But only a few hundred people participated in it, while not all of them were workers of the fast-paced society, which employs tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is not yet clear whether this spark will generate a flame of mass movement.
“When you cheat, your brain gets average.”
Popular among fans of modern technology, the theme of augmented reality has recently been perceived mainly through the prism of special glasses.
Initially in the summer at its annual conference, the current model was shown by Google, and then in November it became known that Microsoft applied for the corresponding patent.
However, from a conversation with the head of the group of interactive 3D technologies at the Cambridge lab Microsoft Sharam Izadi, it follows that for the scientists of this company the points are a stage passed.
They manipulate the perspective of manipulating virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, creating virtual open spaces.
- Tell me, please, in general, what is your research team doing?
“We are engaged in human interaction with machines, but at the same time we are trying to push the boundaries of that interaction.
While humanity in the masses stuck at the stage of working with pixels on a flat screen, sometimes the snails in them with a finger.
We want to look five to ten years ahead and predict the fundamental changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox headset and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox is sold today without Kinect, because everyone is interested in gesture control.
- What else awaits us?
“Despite the fact that Kinect has moved the interaction to a physical level, a lot is still happening on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information has improved (the system receives more data), and the conclusion is not yet very much.
We are trying to change that, working on truly three-dimensional display systems based on various technologies, including projective ones.
We need to release the computer world into ours, the physical, to make it more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also the space around him.
Then we will be able to complement the real world with virtual objects in a much more convenient form.
And first of all - to hell with these stupid virtual reality helmets!
What do you think about voice control?
It's a popular thing, but don't they overestimate it?
- It can definitely not be called a panacea - there is a question of privacy, because you do not always want to inform others about your actions and intentions.
In fact, all kinds of interactions with computers are good, but each one is in its own niche.
For example, for the management of devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not about greasy ones, but about such expensive ones, short ones.
At the same time, the gestures were taken not by the camera of the device, but by a wristband, which recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
While it is large, it can theoretically be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But in general, the future behind a mixed type of management, for example, gesture <0x2B> voice.
- How's that?
- For example, how would you ask me to hand you this gas bank?
You will tell and show at the same time.
- I usually just talk.
- Oh, it's gonna be very hard to recognize.
- So you want to make users adapt to what the machine can or can't at the moment?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual rapprochement.
I think in the near future we will mainly have to work on developing new types of sensors that will allow us to more accurately define human reactions.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, they give a good resolution in depth, this is very important.
- Speaking of your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your claims to modern cameras?
Lack of permission, depth, or something else?
- In principle, the current generation is something that can be repulsed in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at a speed of 1000 c/s.
But it is not in megapixels themselves, but as a matrix and depth.
From the last point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us - this adds work to the algorithm designers.
That is, we must remember not only about the permission on the X and Y axes, but also Z.
Also very important is the speed, the number of frames per second.
The human movement is quite dynamic, and the current 30 bps is clearly small, especially for gestures.
Stephen Bettishes from our Redmond lab made a touch sensor with adjustable processing delays - from 1 to 100 ms, with modern serial sensors closer to the second (60-100) indicator.
Not everyone understands how this affects the interaction between humans and machines.
In my work, I would very much like the equivalent of such a device, but not requiring touches, so that the frames per second were more.
Do you need to increase the number of cameras?
Kinect now has three cameras, one of which is actually an infrared emitter, and the other is a receiver of the reflected signal.
And now the third camera is, in fact, the usual sensor of the visible range.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially more cameras could solve the problem...
Or worsen it by increasing the required amount of calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible Kinect analogue, play with the curvature of the cameras and see how this will help in the three-dimensional definition of the position.
As far as I can remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present its glasses to the public.
Don’t you think that from the point of view of everyday use of augmented reality glasses technology is one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, all the time to walk, holding the smartphone in the raised hands, not very convenient, but here's what I think: the coolest option would be the "transient" augmented reality, when on the basis of a cloud platform you could switch from glasses to smartphone, projection.
Eyewear is a very personal device, it is their strength (private things only you see), and at the same time weakness - augmented reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also a simple mortal.
There is one problem that critics often point to: there is no tactile feedback!
Your hands don't feel anything!
What are your team’s responses to this challenge?
In my lectures, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in human-machine interaction.
I think the eighth can be quite a tactile sensation addition.
Meanwhile, one of the interesting tricks is the use of a second hand as a kind of pad for the image.
It's great for recording clicks!
But there are also technologies that are really aimed at giving these "images in the air" sensibility - for example, the interference of several directed ultrasonic rays at a certain point, where the finger is located, gives you a feeling, but for now, it's very weak.
There are also bracelets on the wrists, which affect the nerve endings in the fingers - also a promising direction.
- And you tried to trick the brain?
To make him think that he feels the way he should feel at the moment he sees something?
That's a good idea, we haven't tried it yet.
Here lies another task that you have to fight for a long time - how to force a person physically in a very limited space, to believe that he is going on the open, almost infinite - also work on the shapes of the shawls and the concepts of the runway (not at all, as in the club),
While cheating the brain turns out to be average, it’s still working for many years to come.
This is what makes the work on virtual reality so attractive to the explorer - many things in an absolutely conceivable state.
Tasting instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
“Rosbalt” continues the project “St. Petersburg Avantgarde”, dedicated to the citizens who are ahead, in the avant-garde of culture and art.
This top-list has already reached the bright figures of the art scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements go beyond the city, often finding recognition in Europe, bypassing the all-Russian fame.
The new hero of "Rosbalta" is the epic artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller - a bearded man dressed in all the red, which is found at the Russian Museum, then at the Summer Garden, then on fashionable tulips and vernissages.
Kirill Miller’s paintings always gather crowds of viewers wherever they are on display.
Kirill Miller is one of the purely St. Petersburg socio-philosophical fairy tales, creators of new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a bright man of the St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 80s - early 90s.
In addition, he is a man of the city, with his appearance in the streets causing a smile of the citizens, raising everyone’s mood.
Recently, he took a charm and became a St. Petersburg charmer, as he matured for this complex role with all his bohemian existence, philosophy and image.
Kirill, why are you still walking around the city in all red, not in yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose the red color as a model, engaged in the look and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the artist, the image maker and society.
Although in society everything that is little or no gray, causes aggression and excitement of bad property.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole history of my provocative actions is an invitation to discussion.
- When did you realize you had to be an artist?
- At the exhibition in DK Nevsky, where my works were exhibited.
I realized it was my way.
Then the wave of old free informal artists passed, and the new, free types of me were incomprehensible.
I became friends with the artists of the new wave, with the post-gaseousness that led to the Pushkin-10, and there was no more wave.
It throws me into theater, clothes, music, into all genres except words.
- And it all came together in your Art Clinic... - It was important for me to be in the center of St. Petersburg's culture, where all the best creative forces must gather.
In 1995, I occupied the territory of Pushkin 10, and there was a musical and artistic club, a bohemian club, the home of the St. Petersburg bohemian.
Many were born there: NOMs, Tekila-Jaz, I remember how Schnur was led with the project "Ear of Van Gogh".
Corr and his friends sang light songs under the plywood, they were in a tightening t-shirt, among them was the now-fashionable composer Igor Vdovin.
When the band played live, it became "Leningrad".
Trautenberg was the leader of many programs to the Hali-Galivian times.
We gave them Traktenberg, and his great career went on, and his basic education and education he got from us.
Gallery "D 137", club "Griboedov" are echoes of the Art Clinic.
That's where our workers and all the rest of us went.
I'm a hero of the last century, when culture meant something.
In 2000, the poll was in the press, the award was "People of Our City".
In the nomination "Artist of the Year" was named me, my climax was over.
In the new times it is uncomfortable to work under the old rules, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In our years it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are divided, you can be popular, but not very cultural.
- Your work is a recognizable way.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they have a brightly expressed relevance and sharpness.
I'm going to have a program show, "The Russian Museum in Clowns."
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be social, now being like this is painful and scary.
But in the clowns everything fades, the tragedy is removed.
I love groceries, I have grocery ideas.
For example, the salvation of the world through totalitarian transformation in fairy-tale order.
Now they meet on clothes, focusing on the external mechanics, not on the internal person.
Or maybe you can't give him a hand and rinse it in the rose.
And the deception will be removed by dressing.
And recently we saw you as a city charmer, and the cultural city must have such a hero.
Who, like me, they are.
- Well, maybe commercial art can be beautiful, too?
Now the commercial art must be neat, tactical, sweet.
Disintegration of cultures.
Previously, people were in a room, bohemian loved one, prosthodontists loved another.
Now it’s all broken down into micro-communities, now it’s hard to like everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar paper to be liked by everyone.
Now you have to think about who you'll like.
Now, each cult hero has 100 fans.
- And on Stas Mikhailov comes for a few thousand!
- He's got a bunch of chips coming up, and that's where the sex-social sphere works.
And on the cultural ground 300 people will come, and 10 thousand will not come, and in the end, less management, money, everything will be shattered.
I have fans, the main thing is not to deceive them, not to spoil what they have earned.
When I was a teenager, I wrote such paintings that one collector had them hanging on a wall next to Falk and Larion.
I started with the paintings that usually end.
They often confuse concepts.
They say: spiritual culture, culture of consumption.
There is no culture in consumption, it is from another opera.
I am a man of culture of yesterday, grew up on the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused money to draw paintings.
I'm in favor of this culture.
- Kirill, what's wrong with St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There's a notion: an official of culture.
But not all of them can engage in culture.
With the right kings it was not so, the kings may not have understood much in culture, but they understood that it was necessary to keep the right experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow right now.
We have people in St. Petersburg who could be experts, but they are advanced, because they need higher experts who will properly assess these experts and give them the way.
The taste is blossoming now.
The same Erarta, but they are distinguished by the fact that they honestly say that not all modern art we accept, there are artists who should look for other museums.
- What's wrong with you, St. Petersburg?
- St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is ground.
And on our stones art is hard to grow.
We need cultural ground, and we have more writers now than readers, that’s wrong.
There are a lot of curious people in Europe who go to exhibitions, concerts.
We have this thin layer.
We need to make fashion art as it was at the beginning of the last century.
Project implemented on the funds of the St. Petersburg grant
Born in Space <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The land is in danger.
Global warming or a collision with an asteroid-killer.
Caravans of spaceships with the landers on board are sent in search of a spare planet.
In order to preserve humanity, the main question arises, how to continue their race in conditions of weightlessness or on the same reserve planet?
I think the choice is small.
In fact, there are only two real planets that can be mastered at least hypothetically.
“It’s Venus and Mars,” said Vladimir Surdin, senior scientist at the State Astronomical Institute named after P.K. Sternberg (GAIS).
But if conditions on Mars are more suitable for life, then on the surface of Venus - the temperature is 500 degrees.
You can only live at high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
Approaching the issues of reproduction in space began with flora.
More than half a century ago, experiments were carried out on plants.
The four generations of pea grown in orbit were no different from their terrestrial varieties.
Then - the removal of insects, tiny fruit fly-drozophiles in orbit.
In 1979, the egg was sent to space to test how the embryo develops in a weightless environment.
We get a perfectly normal puppy on the way out.
But then the problem begins.
“The problem is that this chicken has to find resistance, it has to stand on its feet and start moving,” explains the head of the laboratory of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems (IMBP) of RAN Vladimir Sychev.
Without finding the support, the puppies were rudely barking.
And after 10 hours, the newborns had a complete atrophy of the instincts.
The birds did not respond to the light and sound.
And the trouble was that after four days they just died.
"And twice we smuggled the chicks, then refused, because it is simply impossible to work with them there," - states the failure of the experiment with the chicks in space Vladimir Sychev.
With animals, the last time a biological "minikoch" flew into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, on the biosatellite "Bion" there will be only same-sex persons.
There was an experiment with rats that were sent into space already with fruit.
In principle, nothing supernatural was found there.
“It was just on biosatellites, but again it is a single experiment, and such studies should be carried out,” said Vladimir Sychev.
After the landing, the space rats showed offspring.
But to approach the problem of reproduction directly in space is not yet successful.
Difficult task.
Animals, loss, habitual habitat, simply can not realize their sexual instincts.
In contrast to animals, human beings, in principle, can.
Homo sapiens possesses abstract thinking, and is able to create a similar emotional background.
For ethical reasons, such experiments are not carried out.
Women have been flying into space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was with Tereshkova.
And the most precious thing that humanity has is the female organism.
Our Chaika flew, and no one on Earth could say whether it would survive after flying into space.
Will she be able to have a baby after that flight?
"After all, no one answered this question," said Vaktang Vachnadze, a veteran of the rocket and space industry.
In June 1964, just a year after the flight into space, the first woman astronaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a daughter.
The father of the child Andrian Nikolaev was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman astronaut Svetlana Savitzka, who twice visited orbit and even worked in outer space, gave birth to a son.
However, the risk remains.
We have little, there are units of astronauts, who after long flights everything was worth it, and a healthy generation is growing.
"And if more, it is dangerous even in orbital flights," concludes the pilot-cosmonaut, Hero of the Soviet Union, Hero of Russia Valery Polyakov.
And yet, humanity needs to look for some new ways in biotechnology, protection from radiation, creation of artificial gravity.
The CPC Hydro Laboratory is a mandatory stage of flight preparation.
Here, under the conditions of zero float, the astronauts are mastering the skills of working in outer space.
Water mimics weightlessness.
If for adults, let and comfortable, but still a foreign environment, then for breastfeeding children - the birth element.
The little Ichthyandras seem to confirm that life on land has come out of the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is about 9 months in the mother's infertility fluid, it is easier for him to get used to the guide.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment of the first bath, it is only 2 weeks.
“It’s very little to forget about,” said Marina Aksenova, an instructor in breastfeeding.
In a word, if for a born child, weightlessness is a more natural state, then for a woman - it is necessary gravity, the force of gravity.
Very quickly in weightlessness the muscles of the abdomen, pelvis, the ability to push the fetus decreases.
All right, let's drop this, relying on stimulants for sexual activity.
You can, of course, go to a special cell for childbirth, she will push it out.
"And then what?" - asks non-trivial questions Valery Polyakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling the attraction of the earth, the body will not form the skeleton and the muscular system.
A newborn in orbit is impossible, as an adult, to dress in a special loading suit for training.
He will simply be deprived of what he will need in life.
"And this experiment, which we will go with you, allowing the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead to the fact that we will bring to Earth a disabled, completely disadapted person," - predicts Igor Pestov, head of the Committee on Bioethics of IMBP RAN.
The birth of children in space is a matter of theory.
However, after a while it will be a reality when the Earthlings on their ships go to a distant planet that will be home to their offspring born in space.
Head of the Chief Control and Audit Department: Check of the welding system failed due to politicians.
In the public procurement industry, the Czech Republic has good supervisory bodies and, despite the availability of quality legislation, is lagging behind in its application.
This is a statement by Miroslav Kal, Vice President of the Supreme Control and Audit Department, from an interview for the website Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which, in my opinion, we lack," Kala commented on the current situation.
Such findings are provided by the joint inspection of the Czech and German supervisory authorities.
As an example of improper practice leads to Peter Nechas’ approach to the so-called welding system.
The Prime Minister recently stated that the GDP (Civil Democratic Party) will not bother entrepreneurs with checks - is this outlawed or allowed?
“The law should be established in some way, and if it prohibits anything, then the Prime Minister cannot resist the work of the institutions that have the responsibility to verify and enforce the obligations,” Kala said.
At the meeting of the Audit Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you discussed a joint project between the Czech and German parties, within which the legislation on public procurement of the two countries was compared.
What was it specifically about?
This is a parallel check that we started, probably, two years ago.
Simply put, the fact that European legislation states how public procurement should be conducted is followed by national legislation, and then also the application in practice.
All the information has been collected and, even with an unfinished inspection, interesting differences have been found - in simpler terms, the legislation we have may be "accurate and errorless", but in practice, we are subtracting Germany by some parameters.
It follows that it is not enough to create more and more precise rules, it is necessary to focus on the application of the law itself.
And how can this project help you, what does it mean to you?
It is this joint control that can contribute to efforts to stop the clarification of laws, reduce and improve restrictions, because this does not lead to a positive outcome.
Economics means getting the right thing at a reasonable (but not always low) price to avoid enrichment and possibly criminal behavior.
But it is not the fact that we will achieve this by reducing the limit of orders.
Perhaps this system will be filled with “papers” so that those who want to find loopholes in this system will find them much easier than if the restriction had not been lowered.
You are talking about domestic problems of practical application of the legislation on public procurement.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an organization like our CRU (Control and Audit Management) or does it work differently?
As far as the institutions are concerned, there is the Bundesrechnungshof, which is organized according to our principle, and there is also a college that works a little differently, but basically both institutions function in a similar way.
In addition, the powers are to a certain extent similar, but since Germany has a federal structure, there are audit units there and at the level of the federal lands - in this their system is somewhat different from ours.
The BRH can only manage federal money, we have state funds.
Public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled at the level of the Federal Chambers of Accounts.
As for the local legislation, there is easier than we have?
In general, I would not like to compare without specific data, but in some respects Germany can be taken as a sample, but one cannot say for sure that it is better in everything.
Is it because they are better at controlling?
Definitely not, but I will repeat, I do not like such comparisons.
But it must be said that even sample countries are facing many problems.
Otherwise, they wouldn't get any benefit from collaborating with our office, would they?
Speaking of domestic legislation, how did the amendments to the Law on Public Procurement affect your establishment, and how do they affect it in some way?
Given that the legal force of these amendments is quite short, it has not yet been manifested in our control work.
Since we are in control of the fact, some delays must be taken into account.
We take this into account only in the process of preparing future audits - we started using our new tool "discovering the risk of non-economy", through which we chased almost 14,000 public contracts. We analyzed them. There, of course, these changes will manifest themselves and will occur. because the restrictions change without changing conditions
Do you think the adoption of this law will benefit or add to the burden on the bureaucracy system?
I think this law is definitely a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be confirmed.
The problem that may arise is that the rules are “hardened” and will not be enforced.
When operating the previous rules, controlled enterprises are linked to the supplier (e.g., regional operational programs - with the regional council) in that any non-compliance with the law on public procurement is a violation of budgetary discipline.
Should the law be tightened in this way?
I don't think so.
The system should exclude those who want to seize and abuse, but not punish those who make a formal mistake that does not affect the decision.
Such a system will only create even more pressure on the bureaucracy.
So how do we get out of this situation?
Let’s face it, this path won’t lead anywhere.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the GDP will not bother entrepreneurs by checking the so-called welding system. What does this mean?
"Swarz-system" banned or allowed?
The law should be established in any way, and if it prohibits anything, the Prime Minister cannot resist the work of the bodies which have the responsibility to verify and enforce the obligations.
You can say, “We’ll change this law and let it go,” but you can’t say that we’re going to pretend that nothing is happening.
The law on public procurement contains quite strict rules, how and what should be formally carried out, and that is correct. This will protect public procurement.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic when the candidate with the best offer is disqualified only because of formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which, in my opinion, we lack.
The roads are slippery, but mostly passable.
In some parts of the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and snowy.
Mostly they are passable, but somewhere with more caution.
Karlovy Vary
This morning in the Karlovy Vary region, the roads were passable, but some were frozen and snowy.
The temperature dropped from five to ten degrees below zero, but during the day it should warm a little.
The snowfall in the region has stopped, only in the lowlands is a small layer.
However, on the ridges of the Ore Mountains lies about 30 centimeters of snow.
From the information obtained from regional road workers, it became known that the places were lower visibility due to the fog.
The R6 motorway and first-class roads in the region are currently unrestricted.
However, attention is needed, for example, on bridges where the surface can be frozen and slippery.
Also, all roads belonging to the second and third classes, including mountain trails, are passable.
But in some parts of them there are still remains of frozen and scattered snow.
Particular attention should be paid to the roads located on the elevations.
Pardubice and Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lovegrad region
The management of roads and highways of the Czech Republic informs on its web pages that some roads of the eastern Czech Republic are threatened with freezing, and on the mountain roads and roads located on the elevations, there may be an impregnated layer of snow.
Regional road workers warn drivers of a holodeck, which can be formed especially at the heights of the Pardubice region.
The ice can be around Lanskroun, Usti-nad-Orlice, Poli<0xC4><0x8D>ki, Svitavi or Visoke-Mito especially on second and third-class roads.
Roads I/43 and I/34, located in Svitava, are treated with chemicals.
Especially snow lies on the roads of Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e and the Orlitz Mountains.
The snow layer is located on the roads located at the elevations in the areas of Rihnova-nad-Knezhnou and Trutnova.
In the East of the Czech Republic today variable clouds without precipitation.
The temperature usually varies within the range of minus three to plus one degree Celsius, a slight wind.
Pilsen Region
The roads in the Pilsen region are passable this morning, but places need to be careful and adapt to the weather.
In the morning freezing, the temperature ranges from three to nine degrees below zero.
After snowfall and subsequent cooling in some places can be slippery.
In places, drivers may face fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
The information was provided by regional road workers.
The D5 road is now almost unrestricted, however, road operators recommend being careful between 80 and 131 kilometers.
Most first-class roads have a dry and freezing surface.
In the south of Plze<0xC5><0x88> and Tahove there may be frozen areas.
The roads of the second and third classes are wet, and also in this case there is a warning due to the possibility of the appearance of sliding areas.
Drivers should be careful, especially on the less-used roads in the Shumawa area.
Olomouc Region
Drivers aiming for the heights of the Olomouc region should take into account snowfall on the road today.
It remained after the use of chemicals in the Chervenogorsk seat and on the road in the direction of Videlsk<0xC3><0xBD> Kr<0xC5><0xA1>i<0xC5><0xBE>.
At night, the snowfall forced road workers to take to the street, according to information from the road management, about three centimeters of snow fell in Schumperk.
In other parts of the road, roads are usually unrestricted.
"On the heights of Schumperk are the remains of snow.
Drivers heading towards Esenik should bear in mind the presence of snowflakes in the Chervenogorsk saddle," the manager of the Shumperk road management told CAN (Czech News Agency) today.
At night, their colleagues from Esenik went to clear roads, and they assured that the roads at the altitudes after treatment with chemicals remained naked and wet.
In Olomouc, the roads are unrestricted, but in Sternberg, drivers should be careful in forest areas where humidity is still maintained.
Ustetsky Krai, Liberec Krai
This morning, road workers from northern Bohemia report that there are some places that are hard to pass.
According to information from the police database, in addition to several places with ice or snowfall, a mountain road is closed on a section from Telnica at the Clinic in the Ustetsk region.
Also, the temperature remains negative in the lows, so on the roads there is still snow and ice. In the lowlands, especially to the south-east of the Czech Central Region, on the contrary, there are no problems, the roads are mostly dry.
Complications on the roads have not yet been reported.
Road workers report the appearance of the holiday in the vicinity of Shteti.
According to meteorologists, ideal conditions were created for its formation at night - the whole day was raining and snowing, at night the sky cleared and frost began.
Unfavourable conditions are reported on the main highway and on the route I/13 on the border of the Ustetsky and Liberec region.
Because of the branches of the trees that touched the road itself, they were forced to close the road in Telnice on Kninica.
Simon Ornest: At concerts, we want to build up positive energy
What do you think about the end of the world in less than a month?
This is just one of the many disturbing news that we humans get so easily.
“Together with The Tap Tap, we are constantly joking about it and saying that we are the only group in the world that can gather enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
Moreover, in December you are going to give absolutely unique three concerts against the end of the world.
Would you be able to tell your readers about this in more detail?
We are talking about a nationwide fundraising event, which we have been planning for two years now.
We have decided to take advantage of the marketing potential that the Maya calendar has, the end of which is announced on December 21 at 11:10.
On the day before this event, on December 20 at 21:00, three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava will start in parallel.
They will end, roughly speaking, at the time when the Mayan calendar will end on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific Ocean, whose time zone is 12 hours earlier than ours.
Who came up with this idea?
At first it was my idea, then we all came up with our artist Gonza Augusta.
In addition to accumulating enough positive energy and preventing the end of the world, we also want to think together with the public about what kind of world we will one day pass on to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the May calendar, we have created a unique collection of items from shoes, T-shirts, bags and original keys against the end of the world. These things can be purchased on the website www.e-tap.cz and at the same time give us support.
The Tap Tap, along with other musicians, also performed the anthem against the end of the world, called "The End of the World Cancels".
Will the already-loved YouTube listeners sound a hymn at these beneficial concerts?
Of course, in the end, if in the end everything works out and the end of the world does not come.
It will be played by all the performers at all concerts at the same time.
The anthems will also be heard live on Czech television.
Words to this song wrote and played the role of Jesus in the clip of Thomas Ganak, also participates in the performance of Xindl X...
How did you start collaborating with them?
We also collaborate with other people of Czech cultural life, as we conduct many charities and concerts.
We are actively trying to connect them to these projects.
It turns out that many people like to work with us, they are interested.
What are the benefits of a concert against the end of the world?
To buy equipment for the barrier-free educational center STUDEO, for the sixth year we are working with the civilian association Tap at the Institute of Edli<0xC4><0x8D>ki.
Teachers regularly visit the students of the Edli<0xC4><0x8D>ki Institute and have fun and interesting events with them.
The students themselves do not have the means to go to the teachers, and we are trying to give them that opportunity.
As part of the project for the additional construction of the Edli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute, a separate building will be created in the future, to which we will move with this project.
At each concert there will be several musical groups and performers.
What were the selection criteria?
We have tried to create a program that is of interest to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague will perform Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bart, The Tap Tap, Marian Bango and Irji Suhi.
All details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any such “great events” in the future?
In May we will perform for the first time at the festival "Prague Spring" and here, of course, we will prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would be happy to have a performance at the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, if we are in the United States, would very much like to perform in Washington and Chicago.
With regard to the foreign country, you have serious plans, you have already spoken in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you deal with the road from the point of view of organization and logistics??
It's not as scary as it seems at first sight.
We have five participants on electric wheelchairs, their wheelchairs have to travel in the luggage compartment, plus a whole lot of cargo and toolboxes.
The Czech Airlines <0xC4><0x8C>SA and British Airways have always been excellently prepared for us, which surprised me how many times we have been able to do so.
Even in Moscow, where we recently returned, everything went smoothly.
Thanks to travel abroad, you can compare different countries in terms of accessibility, public attitudes to the disabled and so on.
What did you face at the moment?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries where everything works better than we do, in Russia we have witnessed that in the East we are still at the basic level.
Compared to Prague, there are a lot of barriers in Moscow, and there is still in the wild the independent movement of a person on an electric wheelchair in the city center.
Also, there are no such banal things as giving way to a disabled person in the elevator.
Fortunately, there are already social organizations that are trying to draw people’s attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
What, on the contrary, should we constantly achieve advanced countries?
There are a lot of things that are far behind.
But it is important to clarify that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on the efforts of the people to whom it relates.
In London and Madrid it is quite normal that people with a severe form of disability move on their own in the streets, can go to the toilet, to the museum, wherever...
It is not very common that a large number of people with disabilities take an active part in public life, in this we are a little ahead of them with The Tap Tap!
Respect for the public or barrier-freeness is one thing, but the moment when famous athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers will appear among us, then everything will really start to change.
So far, these are single cases - people with strong will.
The Tap Tap is now very popular, but let’s go back two years ago, what made you organize it in 1998?
I entered the Edli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute as an educator, there were a lot of young people around me who wanted to do something.
And because I myself am a musician and I play in saxophone, I organized an interesting musical circle with my colleague.
Well, over time, as our leader Ladya Angelovich says, it got a little out of control (laughs).
Has popularity only come in the last few years, or am I confusing something?
It’s true, it helped us that we started to join the famous singers and actively work on the group’s propaganda.
We have come to the conclusion that work that no one can appreciate is essentially as if it does not exist.
Thanks to the funds of the European Union, we can afford qualified teachers, equipment and so on.
Did you have a goal to unfold The Tap Tap so well?
From the beginning, I felt their potential in the ability to do something extraordinary.
The show business is full of things imitating each other.
This is logical, everything new is taken with caution, and it lasts a long time.
There are very few rare things, but I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of the person who sees us, of course, is regret, it is natural...
But this grief is completely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not some kind of suffering and all the abandoned personalities that we should be sorry for.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, of course, only if they have the necessary resources.
I’m saying that if people with disabilities do something, it’s a shift not only for them, but for society as a whole.
Has success ensured that you are a strict leader, as many consider you?
If we want to do the work qualitatively, we have to be uncompromising in many things and maintain a certain discipline.
But I think that's okay.
Some people come to us with a romantic performance and fly in the clouds, and when they learn that twice a week they have to go to rehearsals, attend preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the road, very quickly lose enthusiasm.
But this is what happens in any group that wants to work and achieve something.
Currently, there are 20 members of the band The Tap Tap.
How many were there in the beginning of 1998?
There's only one Lada Angelovich.
We are an open group, people come and go, it is impossible to prevent.
For those who have the will and willpower, our doors are always open.
It will take place a day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21.00.
The concert will take place in Prague at the Incheba Stadium, in Brno - in the club of Fléda and Ostrava - in the center of Plynojem with the participation of 12 bands and other musicians of the Czech Republic.
At the end of the concert, all three cities are connected by a cable car at the time of the performance of the band's song The Tap Tap "The End of the World is Cancelled".
The aim of this project is to raise funds in the amount of 25 million kroner for the purchase of multifunctional barrier-free equipment for the educational center STUDEO at the Institute of Edli<0xC4><0x8D>ka in Prague.
Ticket for the concert costs 400 kroner, for children under 12 years of age admission is free. Tickets can be purchased in advance at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the Space.
Last week, at the meeting of the ministers of the European Space Agency, Poland was accepted as the second country of the former Eastern Bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of the ESA on 12 September 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with ECA in 1994 and during the following years took an active part in a number of ECA projects.
But Poland’s journey to space began much earlier.
Even before the Second World War, Polish enthusiasts were engaged in spaceflights, but this was not always met with understanding.
I recall, for example, the lecture of A. Sternfeld, who on December 6, 1933, presented at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory an idea from his groundbreaking work “Introduction to Space”.
The ideas of the young engineer (1905) left the audience indifferent, after several years Sternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomsky was interested in his work.
In 1934, in France, Sternfeld won the Robert Esso Peltry and André Louis Hirsch Prize for "Introduction to Space."
Dr. Yan Gadomsky (1899-1966), mentioned above, later became a great propagandist of astronomy and space science.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and wrote a number of books devoted to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomsky became a world-famous propagandist of space science, and his contribution was appreciated by the fact that one of the craters on the reverse side of the Moon was named in his honor.
As early as 1925, a railway trench was built in Poland, equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of this idea remained unknown, as well as the details of the project.
It is not even clear whether a rocket had to be used for accelerating or braking the truck.
The information about this drill is only known from the press of that era.
Since 1933, Polish artillery has begun to think about missiles.
The study was carried out by the Armament Technology Section in cooperation with Professors Mechislav Wolfke and Gustav Mokzicki.
From the surviving materials it can be seen that the studies have reached the stage of practical testing.
But with the arrival of the German troops, the work was interrupted.
In 1937, the idea of a photoelectric fighter rocket, proposed by the engineer Rogozinsky, appeared in the specialized press, and the following year the work "Air torpedo and aeronautical missile-bomb" by Lelyva-Khivoblotsky.
Both projects were designed for military use of rocket engines.
Before the war, all the projects for the military use of missile technology were carried out by the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy), which coordinated all the work.
The Committee was established in 1937, but after two years of work the work was completed due to the beginning of the war.
The next scientific work on space science appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Society of Astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time about society is mentioned in the November 1954 issue of the magazine "Problems", which publishes four volume articles on astronautics.
In one of them, Professor M. Subotovich proposed to organize a society that would be engaged in space science.
At the time, artificial satellite projects were already gaining momentum, and it was clear that space research was a promising industry.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (POA) has been trying to join the International Federation of Astronautics (founded in 1951), and already in the autumn of the POA became its actual member.
And the following year, the first chairman of the POA Kazimez Zarankevich (1902 - 1959) became the deputy chairman of the International Federation of Astronautics.
He remained in that position until his own death, which occurred in 1959.
Since 1956, POA has made a significant contribution to the development of the highly successful RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first RM-1 was completed in 1957, and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
The rocket, capable of exceeding a distance of 1800 m, was about 80 cm long, and its weight was less than 5 kg.
Subsequently, an improved version of the RM-1A was built, and in the summer of 1959 tests of the two-stage missile RM-2 were carried out in the Bled desert.
The rocket was about 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
The next version of the missile was already able to do real scientific work - the missile RM-34 could exceed 14.5 km, and its task was to observe high winds.
In 1962, however, further development was halted.
The successor to the first RM was the Meteor-1 rocket, developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage, its total length was 510 cm, and its initial weight - 32.5 kg.
Three types (designated as Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, which differed in the size of the camera for scientific equipment.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a volume of 0.4 liters, Meteor-1B - 0.34 liters, and Meteor-1C - 0.62 liters.
The maximum flight distance for all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Aviation Institute, and its first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket with a starting weight of 380 kg was able to take a payload of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
Later versions of Meteor-2N and Meteor-3 were built.
It is also worth mentioning the accession of Poland to KOSPAR (Space Research Committee) in 1960 and the establishment of the national KOSPAR committee two years later.
In addition, within the framework of the Intercosmos program, Poland participated in space exploration on Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslav Hermashevsky became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remek.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution to the problem.
Last week, the Constitutional Court annulled the law on public works.
The decision sparked a lively debate in society.
It will certainly be interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective.
The liberal-oriented economic systems in the EU, as well as in the globalized world, are based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition.
In essence, this means that the individual economic units, the national economic systems, are in constant conflict with each other.
This is due to the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital along with unbridled financial speculation.
As a result of a significant difference in the cost of labor (labour) there is price tension.
It is necessary to understand the situation when a manufacturer, through the delivery of a cheap commodity, tries to withstand economic competition by “breaking” the value of a competitor in order to take away most of the market and thus increase its own income.
On a massive scale, this means for most entrepreneurs either the transfer of production abroad, or cheap purchases abroad, or the disappearance. As a result, unemployment increases in those countries where the value of the labour force, compared to others, is high.
Since private capital bears no social responsibility, including for the unemployment it produces, the inevitable expenditures of the state on social needs increase.
In general, the situation intensifies the unwillingness of employers to pay taxes and thereby compensate the social economic and social damage they inflict in pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well known that it is not necessary to provide specific statistics.
Unceremonious methods of private capital create at the level of economies of individual states a situation where governments of countries are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially reduce the social level of their population in order to attract foreign capital.
In other words, governments give their own populations to private capital at random, despite social decline.
This is reflected, first of all, in the changes in the current legislation.
The objective is to force its people economically to submit to the dictatorship of private capital, especially in the field of wages.
It acts as a system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment and at the same time serves as a tool for cutting workers ' rights in the field of labour legislation.
As a result, the level of poverty increases, and at the same time the difference between the poor and the rich.
In Germany, there has been a public distribution of food to the poor for several years, who are unable to feed themselves with their own labor.
The number of these people is already approaching a million.
In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, there are always cases when employed people receive such a salary that the state must pay them extra to obtain a subsistence minimum.
Such a scandal has become known to the public in the case of additional workers of the Bundestag.
Economic measures in almost all the southern states of the EU undoubtedly lead to the same state in which people under the pressure of a catastrophic decline in social status are forced to either emigrate to the country or to immigrate to the country as it was in the 19th century.
I wonder where he's going to go?
If capital comes from other EU countries, poverty will move from one country to another, or it won’t come at all, because Chinese, Hindus, Brazilians, Turks, Moroccans, Egyptians, Africans are still working for a share of European wages.
This applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media to the point of nausea claim that the state cannot participate in the capital of its own economy, that the managed economy leads to an economic catastrophe.
Private capital insists that the state should not interfere with the economics of the managerial activities.
Next, the question must be answered whether private capital, now practically governing politics and thus the whole state, is acting for its own selfish purposes?
The unequivocal answer is yes.
Evidence is the existence of virtually omnipotent and omnipresent lobbying in all States.
As a result, we have a hopeless situation, manifested in corruption, in the provision of mutual benefits, in legislation, where almost everything deserves punishment, but is not a crime.
In Germany, the situation is such that state ministries, due to a lack of financial resources, commission the development of bills to private law firms, which are closely related to the industry.
These bills are then approved by the Bundestag.
All power comes not from the people, as the constitution of the Western type says, but from financially powerful groups that prefer their own interests.
It is clear that liberal-oriented democracy is now rapidly finding itself in a situation as described by Appian in his work "Crisis of the Roman Empire in the days of Caesar and Pompey": "The state has long been disintegrated, and the authorities are engaged in violence.
Withholdings, unlawful obtaining graces by means of stones and swords.
It is a matter of fact that, in this situation, corruption and corruption have flourished without any prohibitions, and the people went to the elections with a pre-sold vote""...the decent people did not vote for the position of ruler at all, and in the end, one day the state was left without a consul for eight months.
As in ancient times, in modern society, one’s own reckless interests predominate without taking into account public interests.
Private capital is no longer in its essence intended for use for public purposes.
The present result is no different from the past: the unprecedented decline of the elite without any effort to carry out reforms of a deeper nature.
So the cause of the rise of fascist and communist regimes must be sought in the reckless liberalization of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
To date, the absence of these regimes and the existence of liberal democracy can be seen as a certain pause, after which the next round is expected.
First of all, it is tragic that the current elite completely ignores the consequences of the hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, the humanitarian and social disasters that we are already witnessing, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from old and new history.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution, or at least not forever.
Under pressure from competition at both international and national and European levels, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore of a systemic nature.
The solution is targeted political and social reforms that will strengthen the participation of the state in the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in the governance of the state and weaken the monopoly of private capital in the society in favor of the state.
Israel: The Chaos Laboratory.
"Nothing will come out of violence, and it can never come out" - Sting, the song "Brittle", where the main verse of the refrain is the words: "We do not forget how fragile we are."
“If my sons didn’t want wars, there wouldn’t be wars,” said Goethe Schnapper, the wife of Mayer Amchel Rothschild.
The latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, has triggered a lot of responses.
Some argue for Israel, arguing that it has the right to self-defense, while the Palestinians act as terrorists, while others support the Palestinians, arguing that this is the racism of the Israeli state, the genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs, and the Israeli state.
I do not want to think about who, in these periodically recurring murders, is a criminal, and who is the victim, after all, today's citizens of Israel, including the self-governing territories, were born at the moment of the current political situation, and have not witnessed the onset of violence.
My goal is to offer readers to look behind the curtain, to look at those who have served first of all the 95 years of tension (since the signing of the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small piece of land in the Middle East.
Some of my arguments are backed by historical facts, some of which are based on my own understanding of who or what group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is, above all, the history of the struggle for power.
In every epoch we can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so clear is whether these people always took their steps completely independently, or behind their throne was someone who directed their actions to pre-determined goals.
We must admit that we live in a time when the world’s wealth is concentrated in the hands of several persons, and that this concentration of money and the power resulting from it could not have taken place in the lifetime of a generation.
Among the astronomically rich families there is one that could be regarded as the head of the spine (I don’t know if anyone is standing above them, but that’s not excluded) – Rothschild.
There is not much written about them.
Yeah, sure.
The first news agency (Reuters) they bought as early as the 1990s to stop rumors linking their name to criminal acts in the higher realms in which they were, and which always led to the strengthening of their power, the increase of wealth, or at the same time.
They have large packages of shares in almost all the central banks of the world, and against countries in whose central banks they do not have their share, they are leading or preparing for war (before the invasion of Afghanistan, there were only seven countries in the Soviet Union, after the invasion of Iraq, there were five countries in the Soviet Union, after the overthrow of Qa’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’a’
Anyone who tried to resist this family has died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to retain the status of a central bank behind the Rothschild Bank of America, during the Civil War he began to issue his own (understand - government) money and was killed in the theater in 1865.
John F. Kennedy began issuing his own money and wanted to cancel the Fed (Federal Reserve System), he was killed in 1963. MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after wanting to sue the Fed for unleashing the Great Economic Crisis in 1929.
Their thirst for world power in the period from 1859 to 1871 led to the development of a plan of three world wars, created by the great 33rd-level Freemason Albert Pick.
The task of the first war was the destruction of the monarchical states in Europe, the second had to destroy the colonial domination, especially the United Kingdom, and the third had to lead to the reduction of the world population to about 0.5-1 billion people (such a number of slaves will be).
The method by which a group of the richest families led by the Rothschilds works is the challenge of the crisis and the subsequent proposal of solutions (order ab chao - order from chaos).
But these decisions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the Fed’s foundation, which was supposed to prevent the recurrence of the crisis caused by them in 1907).
Thus, after they were able to unleash the First World War through the assassination of the Habsburg heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed tsarist Russia, beginning the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended with a sudden, militaryly and economically unfounded capitulation of Germany (there was no longer any need for war to destroy tsarist Russia) and, as a result, the Central European Power, Austria-Witness, was split.
In order to facilitate the launching of the Second World War, the mechanics and politicians created a hidden conflict situation, imposed huge military reparations on Germany, rather than created a prerequisite for the radicalization of the impoverished masses, and then left only to throw the Germans far enough.
In the late 19th century, the Rothschilds provoked the foundation of the Zionist movement, one branch of which sought to create a Jewish state, preferably in the area of historical Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The above-mentioned declaration of Balfour created a prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, the first clashes began with the local Arab population.
The terrorist attacks took place on both sides.
With the outbreak of World War II, it is difficult to assess whether Hitler had broken out of the chains in which he was originally held by the bankers, or whatever he had done was planned, in any case the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the prerequisites for the recognition of the state.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, just as Germany was provoked by military reparations for World War II, the State of Israel was proclaimed to create the focal point of the Third War.
If international bankers succeed in unleashing it, the Jewish people, as in World War II, will become a victim of fighting on the front line, now together with the Arab or, more simply, the Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of strife and chaos not only within the country, but also internationally (to take only a sharp division of people into Israel’s supporters and opponents).
Who is to blame, and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where the offense generates an insult in an endless chain of violence, if it all began with the greed of individuals and their aspirations for world power?
Here it is necessary to distinguish the ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because, as we do, international bankers appoint people to vote in elections exclusively of their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel is not a member of the <0xC5><0x9E>i<0xC5><0x9F>y<0xC5><0x9F>i, the <0xC5><0x9E>i<0xC5><0x9F>y<0xC5><0x9F>i is a typical example of a fascist, loyal to international bankers, doing everything to start a war with Iran, which, thanks to the membership of Iran in the Shanghai Organization of Cooperation (China, India, Russia), will be a member of the <0xC5><0x9E>i<0xC5><0x9F>y<0xC5><0x9F>y<0xC5><0x9F>i.
In the light of what David Rockefeller said in 1994: “All we need is a common crisis, and people will accept a new world order.”
The new world order in their representation is the world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves as a handful of financial aristocracy enjoying comfort.
A world where every organism born at birth is implanted with a chip, with which it becomes a being under total control.
And he causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to have a mark on his right hand or on his forehead, so that the person who is not marked with the name of the beast or the number of his name may not be able to buy or to sell.
This is what wisdom is about: everyone who has intelligence can calculate the number of the beast.
For it corresponds to the name of a man, and the number is six hundred and sixty-six.
"Operation Argo": When It's Worse, Call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of Islamist demonstrators seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the overthrown Shah Mohammed Reza Pehlevi, who fled after the revolution in the United States, who had been the patron of his regime for decades.
For the U.S. administration, the positive outcome of the situation was not expected - it could not afford to throw the chess overboard, because it could fundamentally undermine the trust of the allies in other countries.
However, to achieve the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was not able.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later reinforced by an unsuccessful attempt to free the hostages by force.
The detainees were finally released 444 days later, after negotiations with the government of Algeria.
Their fate has caused a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiments at home.
The defeat in Iran greatly contributed to Jimmy Carter's defeat in the 1980 presidential election, which ended with the election of Ronald Reagan.
The film, directed by actor Ben Affleck, "Operation Argo" describes one of the episodes of the story that brought America small victories.
Shortly before the occupation of the embassy, six workers managed to escape.
After a difficult period, they completed their journey to the Embassy of Canada residence.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, helped by an extravagant cover-up legend, according to which they went on Canadian passports as members of the filming team, looking in the country for a place to shoot science fiction.
Combination of genres
The plan, which was invented by evacuation expert Tony Mendes, required cooperation from Hollywood.
In order for the legend to be reliable, specialized magazines wrote about the project of the film, held press conferences, the fictional production company had a real office.
The details of the operation have long been kept secret, a film based on the memoirs of Tony Mendes.
The film Affleck is a special combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a real political thriller, the so-called "film-cinopus", a story of a successful plot, affairs - an example can be a number of films about Oshen's friends.
The film is constantly changing moods - on the one hand, documentary scenes from Tehran (the titles show iconic historical photographs of events and how the same situations were demonstrated in the film - there are no big differences in this).
On the other hand, lightened Hollywood passages intersecting with irony and moderate exaggeration.
And then scenes from CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in costumes discuss the situation at the negotiating tables, on the staircases of institutions, by phone ...
Ben Affleck has been able to re-start his career.
He became a well-respected director, and his play ceased to be a subject of laughter.
"Operation Argo" is his third feature film, after the dark detective Farewell, Baby, Farewell (2007) and the thriller "City" (2010).
At the same time, it is Affleck’s first film not filmed in the director’s hometown of Boston.
The feeling of the atmosphere of the place refers to the qualities that have elevated the director’s earlier films above the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck shows it in Argo, where Tehran "plays" Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place in the streets, while reconstructing real events - the introductory scenes of the fall of the embassy impress with their clarity, which also conveys the emotions of confusion and unforeseenness that arise when the story suddenly changes somewhere.
A similar effect is achieved by Affleck and his colleagues in fictional scenes (a fake headquarters in the Tehran bazaar).
There are too many processes in too many places.
The director had to deal with the fact that the narrative does not imply many exciting scenes of cinematic significance.
He works quite successfully with this few, sometimes he comes up with something - there it all comes out not so elegant (a scene in which a phone call in America prevents an impending crisis at the airport of Tehran, and a chase on the take-off runway).
The disadvantage of Argo is the dispersion associated with the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman as Hollywood colleagues are indeed very charming, but their characters would have deserved more space, and they are by no means the only ones in the film.
Affleck’s film lacks a bit of drama, it’s a film that can be watched with moderate interest, evaluating the production and retro style that recreates the thrillers of the seventies.
But it's hard to catch.
However, this is enough to remind us of one, still in a certain sense, of living history, as well as of the exaggeration of the notions of the omnipotent and omniscient special services.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circuses
The website www.bankovnipoplatky.com, an annual survey of the most absurd bank fees, has now decided to announce a contest for "the most absurd decision or project from the EU workshop".
“We were moved to this last event, in which the EU plans to adopt a 40 percent quota for women in the administration of large European companies,” said Patrick Nager, the organizer of the survey.
Among the absurdities already put forward for nomination is the recent decision of the European Court of Justice to unite the rate of insurance contributions for men and women.
So far, women have had life insurance benefits because for insurance companies, they are objectively less at risk.
“Further incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be put forward by the end of this year.
The vote itself will take place until the end of February 2013,” Nager said.
The EU’s controversial provisions include, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents to fuel, which as a result harms the nature, as well as the prohibition on the use of reliable mercury graders only because they contain a relatively small number of dangerous substances in this year’s harvest.
Also criticised was the factual ban on the use of the term "butterfly oil" or the withdrawal from the sale of classic lamps.
High-quality bananas should be 14 centimeters long.
The pan-European apparatus often makes a decision under the pressure of some trade or industrial lobby, whose positions in Brussels are usually defended by any state or group of states (so the Czech Republic now even under threat of veto defends the demands of its banks).
The interests of the lobby are as follows: for example, bananas of the highest quality in the European Union had to reach a length of 14 cm and did not dare to show "anomalous curvature".
At the same time, the European Commission justified itself by only harmonizing the existing disparate national rules that complicated trade.
Despite the resistance of some countries, the EU has nevertheless softened the standards on fruits and vegetables, citing that the existing directives will lead to the waste of products.
The winner of the poll may also be the EU’s ruling last year, according to which balloons sold must be provided with a warning that children under the age of eight cannot inflate them without the supervision of adults.
The EU has turned to US studies, according to which playing balloons are a potential cause of death of children through strangulation.
Such a restriction now applies to children up to 14 years of age who are prohibited from blowing in fair duels.
Funny ideas are born at home.
It is quite absurd, too, to rule the European officials themselves: everyone who holds an official position in the EU cannot, given the delicateness of the topic for Greece, use the name Ma<0xC5><0x82>odokia Macedonia, and should instead say "BYURM" (Revsha J).
The portal Bankovn<0xC3><0xAD>poplatky.com, in cooperation with the liberal economists' union "The principle of non-interference" (Laissez Faire), proposed for the vote, in addition to several of the above absurd rules of the state, for example, the EU rule on the volume of food supplies.
The EU has set the maximum amount of food stocks that may be in the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of its accession to the European Union.
Subsequently, the Czech Republic exceeded, for example, the established volumes of canned mushrooms, for which it was threatened with a large fine.
The organizers of the survey were also interested in the idea of paying some countries for not having a sea, and the idea of granting grants for a grant application.
But these ideas arose in Prague, not in Brussels.
“We’re in a bad situation because we don’t have the sea.
We will ask the European Union for compensation," said the then Minister of Agriculture, Yaroslav Palas (CJDP), in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he pointed out that the country had a high grain yield, and as a result of so-called intervention procurement, the state had full stockpiles of stocks that had to be exported.
Because the Czech Republic is far from ports, the EU, according to the Palace, had to pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
As a result, the European Commission went to the Czech Republic, organising a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
Subsidies to receive the subsidy were offered to the villages by the Ministry of Regional Development, led by Minister Pavel German (US-DEU), in particular, such subsidies had to go to prepare an application for the subsidy from Brussels.
EU: Bizarre orders are an exception
While the decisions in the Member States are easily subject to criticism, the EU’s efforts to regulate, as well as to make the European Union more effective, are, in the opinion of many experts, more deserving of recognition.
A serious problem, according to experts, is the drawing of EU grants for projects that do not even have a hint of something to do with the deepening of European integration, but which the Member States have achieved in the discussion of the budget.
It causes emotions among Czechs and the fact that, as in other countries of the European Union, the Czech Republic must fight in Brussels for the right to specific identification of its traditional products, and it does not always win in this competition.
Although the Czechs after six years of fighting with the Germans and the Austrians retained the name "Olomouc cheeses", however "Tuzemsky rum", whose traditions in our country go back to the 19th century, our producers had to rename to "Tuzemak".
Rum can only be called products from cane distillate, and not from sugar beet.
In the official list of registered EU products, along with the world-famous "feta" and "gorgondzola" cheeses, marzipan from the German Lubeck or Parma ham, have already been found, for example, Karlovar suharas, pogor<0xC5><0xBE>elic and tr<0xC5><0xA1>ebonskij karme and kh<0xC5><0xBE>at.
Also, the EU trademark can be proud of Pardubice Spice and Gorzhice pipes.
"People want me to protect the republic, but I'm an amateur," Okamura said.
Senator, how does a man come to his head to run for president?
I don’t want to be a senator or president.
If everything in our country would work without problems, I wouldn’t be balloting anywhere.
But I can no longer see the country unraveling over the last 20 years, how thieves are evading here, people are raising taxes and their retirement age.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don’t like, I try to figure out how to change it.
And since I’m forty years old and I’m an independent person who doesn’t belong to any party, I have no choice but to influence things other than to run for senator or president.
You were in the Senate, but you soon went to the Presidential Palace.
Do you not turn your back on the people who have chosen you?
I’ve always said that I’ll be involved in the fight for the presidential lock, depending on the outcome of the Senate election.
I later made it clear that if I was elected senator, I would run for president.
My goal is not a position, a position is a tool with which I can implement my views.
That is why I need the greatest influence and the broadest powers.
But the difficulty is not only that we as a nation have a bar or a TV, but we are ready to crush anyone who tries to change something.
In addition to this, the media, which blacken a person, and which confuse freedom of speech with freedom of lies.
For example, they said about me that I was giving bribes to journalists, or that I was an advisor to Irji Paroubek.
Let's move on to your views.
You have begun the struggle for the presidential castle with theses on the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and on reverse property declarations of more than twenty million.
In order to do this, the law needs to be changed.
You as president do not have such powers, and only an entire Senate can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When I, as a citizen, lobbyed for excursions to become free entrepreneurship, it was able to move forward.
The problem is politicism – when someone comes up with a good offer on the left or right, they are deliberately made obstacles, and it restrains citizens.
As an independent non-partisan, I have much greater potential to get support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that I can take from every party what is best for our country, and apply it, without a party’s shelves, regardless of the dogmas.
Do you consider yourself a person who is more related to the right or the left?
From the Czech point of view, it seems to me that people refer to me more to the left.
It doesn’t matter to me at all – a little to the left or a little to the right.
It is important to me that we move forward.
It’s not about someone being on the right, it’s about someone being on the left, I want to bring people together.
I will always support any good decision for society, whether it is proposed by the CCP or the GDP, and I will also be against a bad idea.
You're angry when someone says you're a populist.
But don't you prove it by what you said?
When you create a business plan for a company, you also have some ideal goals and views.
And that's what you're trying to get closer to.
You can call it populism, but all the proposals I’m talking about are already working in the world, or are being talked about by prominent experts.
But without the support of the parliament, you will only have slogans.
In politics, you won’t last long.
Or do you think that when you go out to people and talk to them, you will be able to realize criminal and material responsibility?
I don't have a choice.
Just to convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to lure them to their side so that we can achieve ours.
If I had been elected president, it would not have been a problem to organize a live television broadcast in which I would appeal to the presidents of parliamentary parties to legalize material and criminal responsibility for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
And if they refuse, they will have to tell you why they don't want it.
If there is a strong person who will voice abuse, then it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take the direct election of the president - it was a merit of pressure from the public.
I'm telling you, I'm an amateur, not a genius, not an intellectual.
I try to find allies to defend my beliefs and views.
I am just a beginner in politics, and I will try to get the support of the majority for my program.
I’m trying to move things on my own; if that doesn’t work out, in six years, I’ll finish it and go back to the private sector.
It’s as if Okamura had to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know I’m not going to do anything alone, so I bypassed a number of famous people with a proposal to run for Senate.
I went to Radim Janchure, he refused due to a large amount of work.
I also at least supported the leading investigative journalist, Yana Lorentsov, who uncovered the fraud with light fuel oil products.
I’ve applied because people are really dissatisfied, but now I feel like I’m on the weights.
Sixty percent of the people did not go to the election, and the majority of those who went elected representatives of the establishment.
There are only two of us in the Senate.
People have elected the Senate in such a way that changes will be difficult to implement.
Despite this, I will fight for my views, for example, for direct elections of mayors and governors.
Do you think about the foundation of your own party?
I haven’t thought about it yet, because I don’t have the time to check the cleanliness of every potential supporter’s past, and I don’t have the money for it.
There is no money for the presidential campaign, on my transparent account only twenty thousand kroner.
You don't have the money?
You talk about property declarations, but what about your own dealings with it?
Personal property is estimated to be approximately 60 million euros.
I have a plot in Prague worth about 25 million, an apartment for 10 million, another apartment for 8 million, a collection of works of art for about 10 million, Aston Martin for 3.5 million and Skoda Superb for a million, and a neon.
By the way, Aston Martin came to me because it was my boyish dream – I always liked James Bond, who rode a car, was gallant with women, and at the same time fought against dishonesty and lawlessness.
You drive to Aston Martin, you own $60 million in assets, and you don't have the money to campaign?
You say you want to change the republic, but you don’t want to invest your own money in it.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to go into debt?
I've already invested $2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don’t have sponsors, indicates that my program is not so interesting.
And I don't have to pay for the election campaign out of my pocket.
The cost of the campaign will actually be covered by the senator's salary.
But I wouldn't live for that money, for example, I wouldn't be able to pay my son for an English school that costs $30,000 a month.
If I just wanted to make money, I wouldn't go anywhere.
So, you'll continue to do entrepreneurship so that you can live?
Didn't you say you'd cut that activity?
But it doesn’t depend on the amount of salary.
As I promised, I have reduced my activity in part.
For example, the managing director of the travel agency will be my deputy in the spring.
People would like me to be a silversmith who will keep the republic.
But I also need to live for something.
How much as an entrepreneur are you used to earn each month?
From two hundred to four hundred thousand, which I get further.
If I had been president, I would have finished my business.
You will find the full interview in the Saturday edition of the newspaper "Lavo".
MVRDV architects prove that the real adventures are not only in the imagination - on the example of Spijkenisse and its newly built Book Mountain - 2 photos
“This building seems fun to me, it looks futuristic, finally we can see something interesting again,” says Lisette Verhaig, passing along the road.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT specialist at a nearby large enterprise, says, “No, this building is really beautiful.”
But I ask myself, why do we have another library today?
Everyone has the Internet, iPad and e-books.
Now no one goes to such old-fashioned libraries voluntarily, right?
Spijkenisse, an unattractive sleeping town near Rotterdam, holds an unusual record.
Its population of 80,000 people has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
To combat this annoying circumstance a few years ago, it was decided to contribute to the general education and build seven imaginary bridges, which are depicted on euro banknotes, in the form of painted miniatures made of iron concrete.
The success of this educational initiative was modest.
And then the fathers of the city realized that they had only one chance to overcome the statistics: to build a library here!
Vinnie Maas of the Rotterdam architectural bureau MVRDV, a master of bold column diagrams and author of clever, sometimes even cynical structures, dealt with the task with his usual indistinctness and appeared at a competitive audition of books in 2003.
And while the jury members were puzzled and squeezed with their shoulders, the daring Maas made from his original gift a pyramid of size and ended his speech in defense of his project with the following words: "Dear citizens!"
Here's my suggestion: The Book Mountain in Spijkenisse, the so-called Buchenberg!
Nine years later, this mountain, worth 30 million euros, has grown.
It is part of the revitalization project, which also includes an underground garage, supermarket, post office and several adjacent residential houses and townhouses for a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, Book Mountain was awarded the second prize of the competition "Best Library of the Netherlands 2012".
The project also participates in the national Dutch competition for wooden structures in 2012.
Thus, the faceless suburb, which had previously been able to offer nothing but a postmodernist pedestrian zone and an amazingly unpretentious town hall, whose white facades suggest a dairy farm, became richer in one modern work of architecture.
But most importantly, in Spijkenisse, the first in the history of this town was a public building of cultural purpose.
A long way to the book
First impression: the book Eldorado under the cheese cap.
There is only one lift in the center of the mountain range, because real fans of architecture and reading will prefer to explore this area on foot.
Glassed on all sides of the room - light and easily visible, floors made of burnt brick and elegant street lights infallibly create the feeling of a public urban square.
The urban environment is perfectly restored.
The look is involuntarily looking for couches, dogs and playing football for boys and girls.
And everywhere - books, books, books.
“Usually the book shelves stand along the facades, and in the middle there is a large dark room, usually uncomfortable and faceless,” says Vinnie Maas.
We put the classic configuration of the space from the foot to the head and pulled out the reading area from the inside out.
The interior of the book mountain is used skillfully: the center has offices, an internet library, a chess club, an environmental center and technical facilities.
Especially happy are black book shelves, which serve as wall decorations, parapets, stair railings.
Their appearance, texture and smell are unusual.
Even intrigued architects and engineers-builders get lost in guessing what kind of unknown material it is.
“We tried to work with secondary materials,” explains Jop Trawborst, project manager representing the Spijkenisse community, in line with the standards.
And one time at a single farm in Friesland, we encountered a suitable by-product of agriculture.
For many years, in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands, artificial fiber material of millimetre thickness has been used as a root padding.
It is cheap and saves time.
Thin textile serves one or two seasons, after which it can be thrown away.
For the library, this canvas - for the first time in such volumes - was pressed into a panel four centimeters thick.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, the so-called landbauplastic (KLP) turns into a dark, uniform, durable material, smelling a little like a new car and a little sneakers.
There are 105 steps to the top.
Anyone who crosses the nearly 500-metre-long path will be rewarded in a literary cafe not only with fantastic views of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and wooden chips in pots.
They care about the atmosphere, and above all about the correct humidity of the air on the literary mountain.
Expenses for a new soul
“It’s hard to believe, but this building, despite the many glass surfaces, is an environmentally-exemplary project,” Trouborst says.
For its heating and cooling, the heat of the earth is used.
Although the Book Mountain stands under a glass cap, even on clear days the sun only comes in for a short time.
Wide adhesive wood farms, located perpendicular to the glass fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade, give shade and take on most of the sun's rays.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
The rest of the protection is provided by fully automatic roller blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the above-mentioned skeptic in the field of IT, has already visited the new library.
Lizette Verhaig was already here.
As well as the traditional Chinese medicine teacher Cynthia Bogard, who called Buchenberg "the soul of Spikenenisse, which was long gone."
Reason: A few weeks before the opening, each resident received an invitation to donate one book from their own congregation.
These books were supposed to occupy vacant shelves in a library that was not yet fully equipped – at that time there were 70,000 books in it.
The idea worked.
The shelves are set up.
“There’s nothing worse than a half-empty library,” says architect Vinnie Maas.
“I think that thanks to our invitation, every resident is now somehow connected to this new home.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it's just for decoration.
Thus, MVRDV managed to solve the royal task, which on the professional jargon is called creating identity.
Speikenisse wrote his own literary history.
And let them be very young and uneducated.
This is just the starting point for identity building.
Sabo: "Germans must play a more important role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the recognition of Palestine.
According to Stefan Sabo, an expert on U.S.-Europe relations, doing so, Berlin is balancing on a narrow diplomatic path.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany first made it clear that it would vote against the Palestinians’ request for observer status at the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained on the vote.
- Why?
Stefan Sabo: Germany does not support the actions of the Israelis in Gaza.
At present, Germany needs to be cautious about its special relations with Israel.
But at the same time, I believe that it also does not support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence, while not being too critical of Israel’s position.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained in a vote on the introduction of a no-fly zone.
In the end, NATO made this offer.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on complex international issues?
Yes, it is.
The fact is that it is in the process of transforming its foreign policy, namely, it is moving from the policy, which, so to speak, was run by the United States, to the German foreign policy itself.
In addition, the situation is compounded by the fact that Europeans do not have a coherent single policy.
Thus, the Germans are again between the two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I believe that so far they are only taking on their role, but are on the way to a “more normal” foreign policy.
This is the kind of foreign policy that France and the United Kingdom have.
What exactly does “normal” foreign policy mean from the German point of view?
This is the willingness to take a position in their national interests that does not depend on the position of the United States or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy depends on economic policy, that is, on exports and relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany’s economic interests are significantly different from those of other large states, and therefore Germany must defend its own interests.
Did these economic interests affect the position in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
First, Germany has large sales markets in the Middle East, in particular in the Persian Gulf states.
It therefore needs to be careful not to offend the public and elites in the Arab countries.
In any case, it plays a role.
But I wouldn’t give too much importance to it, it’s not a completely unilateral connection.
But in any case, it plays an important role in the calculations of the Germans.
Has Germany harmed its relations with the United States by abstaining in making important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I am sure that in Europe and even in the United States there is a predominant understanding of the German position.
So I don’t think it was as dramatic a supremacy as in the Libyan issue.
It is possible that Germany will gain some respect in this way.
After all, this signals that she should be taken seriously as a player in the international arena and that her interests should be taken into account.
There are different views on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
The U.S., on the other hand, has clearly voiced its veto.
Is there a difference of opinion between the United States and many European countries?
Because of American domestic policy, such differences have always existed.
I believe that the Obama administration, deep down, has a sufficient understanding of the European position.
But in the context of the local political situation, the government, of course, cannot openly take such a position.
I believe that significant differences of opinion are not at all as significant as it always seems.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is not at all excited about Netanyahu’s policies.
Is it easy for Germany to combine its close ties with Israel and the United States on the one hand and the position of the most important partner in the EU on the other?
I think that’s what makes the situation so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there were a unified, non-contradictory European policy, but that is not the case now.
Therefore, they cannot act within a broader approach and are forced to act instead, relying only on their own vision of the situation.
That’s what they do with the euro.
I think that in the future Germany will take a leading role in the elaboration of a common European position.
It is clear that this is not easy for Germany, at least because of relations with Israel.
This topic has always been skewed.
But I think it is clear to the Germans that they should play a more independent role.
If Germany sees itself as an important international player, will it not really take on the leading role?
Or is the leading role still difficult to give to Germany?
Germany is not yet used to this, it is still always unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult to play a significant role.
Consider, for example, the euro crisis – every time Germany takes on an important role, there are various anti-German sentiments.
The Germans can't just handle it.
In fact, it’s an old problem: you don’t want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It should take into account a wide variety of neighbors and opinions, and this is not easy.
So, the U.S. influence in European politics is constantly weakening, but at the moment the EU is not filling this vacuum, who then remains?
The Germans will just have to play a bigger role.
Even if you don’t like it, it’s unpleasant or intensifies dislike for you – that’s life!

Trademark Protection in China: When Puma and Armani will suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, also Polo Ralph Lauren.
What is Armani Polo?
This is a completely officially registered name in China, which has nothing to do with the companies from which it is formed.
However, it will be protected until the owners of the original names have filed a lawsuit.
It is unclear whether they will be able to defend their rights.
“It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China,” said Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer for Taylor Wessing, a company specializing in trademark infringement in the Far East.
There's a new case like this on my desk every week.
Imitators only need to add a couple of letters to get the right to register their trademarks.
Gucci is Lu-Gucci, Prada-Kny can be registered instead of Prada.
In the same way, German companies, for example the manufacturer of sports goods Puma, are legally copied.
Pattloh opens a folder with records of the trade mark registration office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, the Chinese company registered there the trademark Zegna DF Puma, an artificial name that also used the name of the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
The fact that the Chinese are world champions in copying and infringing intellectual property rights is known.
In large cities there are multi-storey department stores selling almost exclusively counterfeits.
However, Pattloch's case is not so. On behalf of his trustees, he opposes that Chinese enterprises are fully formally granted from the trademark registration office the right to use the name, which is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it Ban Minpai, a passenger brand.
This word is associated with "ban daquan".
That's what they call women who hunt for rich men.
The Chinese government does not admit guilt.
“This is detrimental to business, we have to fight it,” Pattloh said.
“The brand fades, the unique position is lost, the image is very badly damaged.”
The financial losses and procedural costs in the affected industries are estimated in the millions, especially in the case of expensive copied products.
According to market research firm CLSA, China, with sales of 15 billion euros per year, is the third largest and fastest-growing market for luxury goods sales.
However, to achieve the removal of dubious records in the register of trademarks is difficult, and it is expensive.
The process can take up to nine years, with an unclear outcome.
Pattloch talks about cases in which the court rejected the lawsuits, as after a long time the protested name became a "reality of the market".
If the plaintiff is unsuccessful, he will even have to pay the plagiarism as it has damaged his trademark in China, Pattloch says.
Sometimes the law of the jungle rules here.
There are also famous works on graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a litigation with construction machinery manufacturer Sany, a company that had recently acquired the concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
Therefore, the Chinese still have the right to use an emblem similar to a Mercedes star.
Volvo's purchaser Geely originally used a blue-white logo resembling BMW; the process was successful, Geely had to change it.
The manufacturer of fashion goods Lacoste lost in China to imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, where the famous crocodile looked the other way.
The Chinese authorities are not to blame.
The CTMO Trademark Registration Office in Beijing confirms that in 2010, due to the lack of staff and equipment there, there were difficulties.
But last year there was a “return from the emergency in the work process to normal”.
Thus, the number of unprocessed objection cases decreased by 22 per cent.
Nearly 57,000 such cases were closed, 75 per cent more than last year.
However, 81,500 claims are still pending in the department.
Fighting this is expensive.
As is often the case in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark protection applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
This is a record and means that China has led the list of new registrations worldwide for the tenth time in a row, the ministry said.
The same applies to the total number of valid trademarks, only 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan of fees were paid.
Simply put, this means that each registration costs an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
To protest it is worth many times more, as the case of the German family enterprise Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the group has been fighting against the Chinese plagiarism.
The Germans were able to achieve the fact that the illegal production of their fake car parts was eliminated.
However, the imitator secured Chinese trademark rights to Freudenberg.
This was an omission of its own, as surnames in Germany are not protected, says Hannah Wentzler, chairman of the board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
And the CTMO trademark registration office rejected the Munich-based claim.
True, in both subsequent instances Freudenberg won, but the opposing side continues the fight to this day.
You have to be a chef
The matter is now before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler hopes to bring the case to a good conclusion and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says: “The process is extremely expensive and takes us a lot of time, money and nerves.”
Domestic costs are hardly accountable, the firm’s archive had to review even acts centuries ago in order to bring evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg unsuccessfully offered the opposite side a “big six-digit sum in euros” for a settlement.
“It is clear from this how expensive it is for us,” says Wentzler.
The dangers of the Far East threaten to spread even to Europe.
That is, if the imitators register unprotected trademarks there.
For example, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather goods.
The company has long ceased production in these areas, but has nevertheless been able to prevent registration.
“You have to be careful,” Wentzler said.
Both he and Pattloch’s lawyer advise German companies to be very careful with China.
It is not enough to rely on international regulations on the protection of trademarks, rather foreigners should “all that is somehow worth protecting, registering in China as well,” says Wentzler.
Otherwise, it can cost a lot more than registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg loses in the final act of his trademark drama, he will have to pay the opposite side the license fees for his own name, explains Wentzler.
Otherwise we will be kicked out of the market in the disputed segment.
World AIDS Day: sniffing, singing, helping
In Heidelberg, the Imbongi choir rehearses - and in Swaziland, AIDS orphans are happy about it.
The history of relationships that have exceeded the distance of more than 8733 kilometers.
First, there is a submersion: cowboy boots, basketball sneakers, women's boats and men's taps pick a tick on the parquet floor and quickly find it.
One-two-three-four.
It is only then that the voices of the singers - alt, bass, tenor and soprano - slowly grow - they come in, charm and follow each other.
And Fite Hopf, a 29-year-old conductor, barely jumps out of his knitted shoes when he carries them with flexible and expressive gestures.
On Monday evening, in the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the Imbonga choir rehearses a new song.
Fifty participants from 23 to 69 years of age, from specialists in human genetics to the yard, came to the rehearsal.
"Om"Obani" - a difficult thing, every voice of the chorus has its own text, in addition to in a completely foreign language: Zulu, which is spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some parts of S.
Help for Self-Help
According to an estimate by Unaids, the United Nations Programme to Combat AIDS, there are about 34 million HIV-infected people in the world.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
There are 245,000 AIDS orphans in Swaziland.
More than 40 percent of the population is HIV-positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitzeni, Voices for Africa found bosses in Germany.
70 of them attend a school that is preparing for further education.
For 15 or 20 euros per month you can take over the management.
It guarantees the child money for school, school uniform and a daily hot lunch at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi in the Zulu language means narrator or applause.
In this room, they do not speak fluently in bantu, but they can sing.
For almost a decade, the choir has been learning songs in this foreign soft language and from time to time even takes them back to where they first appeared: to South Africa.
After all, at a distance of 8733 kilometers from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is the village of Esitzeni, which depends on the votes of the German choir.
Infected 40 per cent
There are about 2,000 people living there, some still in simple huts made of clay and straw, among the inhabitants many children.
More than 300 of them were left without parents who died from the IQ virus.
The miniature Eszitzheny reflects the disease of Swaziland as a whole: the highest level of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
Circumcision of the extremity in men, which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half, is almost not accepted among the population.
More than forty percent of Swaziland's population carry the virus of immunodeficiency, death in the middle of the fourth decade is not uncommon.
The choir opened this village in a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, but previously the participants of Imbogni saw many children in the streets, who lacked not only parental care, but simply everything: food, clothing, education.
Without schooling, a person in a poor country has no chance at all.
At first it was a private obligation of individual participants - for a few euros a year to send the child to school and give him the opportunity to get hot food once a day.
But already a year later, the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa", which has since been almost professionally caring for AIDS orphans in Esitzen.
Facts about Sexually Transmitted Infections
What are the most important diseases that are transmitted by sex?
Bacterial IPPs include syphilis, chlamydia and tripper (gonorrhea).
Frequent viral IPPs are HIV, human papillomavirus, genital herpes, and hepatitis.
Pediculosis of the lobe and itching belong to parasitic IPP.
What are the main affected groups?
Syphilis and gonorrhea occur mainly in men who have sex with men.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, at least four out of every five cases of syphilis registered in Germany are transmitted as a result of sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, the most common sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydia, trichomoniasis, candidiasis (fungus), gonorrhea, and the human papilloma virus.
The prevalence of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low, but about 20 percent of new HIV infections are in this group.
Among young people, chlamydia infections are much more common than among other population groups.
According to European data, three-quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
Among young people, we also often have a human papillomavirus.
How does the number of infections change?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to obligatory registration.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the incidence of syphilis has more than doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been decreasing since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
That’s about one-tenth less than the previous year.
What are the symptoms that indicate a venereal disease?
In infectious diseases, ulcers in the genital area, complaints of urination, discharge, pain in the lower abdomen, as well as bubbles or dentures can occur.
However, they are often not accompanied by pain and other symptoms and remain unnoticed.
How can we protect ourselves?
Condoms are able to reduce the risk of infection, but do not provide 100% protection.
After all, in part, the pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also spread through contact infection and with close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular check-ups, especially with frequent change of sexual partners.
With early diagnosis, most IPPs can be cured and distant consequences can be avoided.
The principality, donations and last but not least the fees for the performances of the choir all over Germany allow something to be collected.
“We have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitzen,” says Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village itself, money from Germany is distributed by Zodva Dlamini, a conscious and active woman.
She also ensures that orphans are well-organized, for example, by one of her grandmothers.
Gogos, as the Zulus old women are called, is the backbone of the village.
Some of them took up to 14 orphans, gave them a roof over their heads, and made sure that the children in shape showed up every day in time for lessons.
Those who do not have relatives go to the shelter of Hannisil, a single woman receiving a salary from the association, as well as two cooks who prepare for more than 200 hungry children each day.
In addition, Voices for Africa organized a sewing school, built two chicken coops and, together with the American health organization PSI, organized the delivery of HIV analysis for many villagers.
It is difficult to imagine, but the disease, which is so obvious in the whole country, prefers to be deeply silent.
The King with 14 wives
“AIDS is an absolute taboo,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it’s related to sexuality.”
It is quite unusual for a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his love of excesses.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
In particular, such a state-sanctioned lifestyle is also to blame for the fact that the IQ virus has spread so rapidly in recent years.
But it also lies on the roaming workers, who spread the virus across the country.
Free condoms are literally on every corner, says Annette Lennartz, “but they’re hardly used.
Another culture is flesh to flesh.”
To support a bit of cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir makes a trip to South Africa every two or three years and sings songs full of sadness, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-awareness that many on the southern edge of the black continent have known since the time of apartheid.
A bus full of whites who sing songs in black language - such recognition not only brings good mood and joy, but even, incidentally, caused tears in the eyes of harsh border guards.
The trip always leads to Esitzheni, where singers visit underwear children.
Despite the fact that a small village can hardly be found on the map, in the valley of the Etsulveni River it is more than known.
“Go to Esitzheny, there is light,” the people there say.
And after the 8733-kilometre flight back to Heidelberg, when the sinking singers return to the rehearsal hall on Bergheimer Street, you can see that this light is burning here too.
Next articleNASA Opens Ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice cover can have a thickness of up to 20 meters.
The U.S. space agency NASA has confirmed the presence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is located closest to the Sun, there is also frozen water, according to three studies published on Thursday in the special journal Science.
The Messenger probe has found evidence that the region of the planet that is constantly in the shadows is covered with ice.
Its thickness should be at least 30 centimeters, and possibly even up to 20 meters.
Supposedly, water comes from a comet, or perhaps an asteroid, that collided with Mercury.
No one associates the discovery of ice with the existence of life on the planet, said probe scientist Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
However, these discoveries could help explain how water and other building blocks of life got into other places in the solar system.
Invisibly for the inhabitants of Earth, probes, telescopes and small robots, such as the Phoenix, explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to Earth: small windows in the infinite realms.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
Eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres, by the 2006 International Astronomical Union’s new definition, is not a “planet.”

Depending on the color transfer, the images of spiral galaxies are transformed into real works of art.
A picture published by the European Southern Observatory shows a few thousand light-years away Trifida nebula in the constellation of Sagittarius.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (three-legged, three-part), as the dark stripes of dust are divided into three parts of the heated heart of the cradle of stars.
In the constellation of Snake, astronomers have photographed a precursor of a cosmic collision: 400 million light-years from Earth, the nuclei of the two merging galaxies face each other and inevitably collide.

A photograph of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a fragment of the Iris nebula in the constellation of Cephei.
A nebula, 1,400 light-years away, consists of dust particles that are ten to one hundred times smaller in size than ordinary household dust.
This image was made from optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes 430 million light-years away from Earth.
This group of galaxies called Arp 273 was photographed by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope.
Scientists call the large spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
In this stellar nebula is the brightest group of new stars in our Milky Way.
The star cradle is constantly creating new stars.
This stellar cloud, connected to the Rosetta Nebula, also constantly creates new stars — at a distance of 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this brightly glowing galaxy with a small black hole there is no dust yet, only gas.
Researchers suggest that it arose shortly before the Big Bang, when there was mostly hydrogen in the universe.
Our Views of the Universe: The Most Important Telescopes
Probably, the telescope was invented in 1608 by Hans Lippersheim - even before Galileo Galilei began observing the stars a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have become more and more - and their view of space is becoming deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror depicted here had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, the U.S., a large binocular telescope is installed.
It allows you to look into space using two mirrors, each 8.4 meters in diameter.
The Gran Telescopio Canarias has a gigantic inner device - the diameter of a single mirror is 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the "Big South African Telescope" in South Africa is segmented - in order to reduce the cost.
However, in diameter it reaches about eleven meters in length.
The lack of inexpensive design: the telescope is tightly fastened at a vertical angle - this limits its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberley telescope in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle.
Its feature: high light-gathering ability.
It reaches - despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror - the parameters of the world's largest telescopes.
With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, researchers listen to extraterrestrial signals in space.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
By participating in the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) project, any computer owner can help by providing their computing power.
View of the European Astronomical Service (ESO) Observatory in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the "Very large telescope" - fully consistent with its name.
Its four mirrors allow even the average infrared spectrum to illuminate in the visual tube.
The ESO Observatory in Chile is also planning to install a European Very Large Telescope.
Its main mirror should extend for as much as 42 meters - and will be composed of almost 1000 mirror elements.
However, photos should not be expected before 2018.
Until 2007, the two Kek telescopes on Hawaii’s Mauna Kea volcano were considered the largest in the world.
They have two mirrors with a diameter of ten meters.
The Kek telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which, along with them, also looks into the sky using the Subaru and IRTTF telescopes.
In addition, a new giant telescope will appear on Mauna Kea - with a mirror with a diameter of thirty meters.
You can see them in the illustrations here.
However, the most important species from space is supplied by the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has produced paintings of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for planets outside the solar system – primarily those on which life is possible.
On February 2, 2011, NASA reported that 1,235 candidate planets had been discovered since the mission began.
The photo shows the latest preparations of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be launched into space not earlier than 2018 aboard the Ariane 5 rocket.
The main mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope is to look for the Big Bang in the light of the first stars and galaxies.
Scientists suggest that there is ice at the southern pole of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable data on this, as the Messenger orbits closer to the planet's north pole.
Radar measurements for decades have indicated that there is ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger probe launched in 2004 – the first to revolve around Mercury – scientists are now convinced of this.
Drink oil every day – and live up to 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many of the inhabitants reach biblically decent age.

A search for a solution in a country where 97-year-olds seem still relatively young.
A trip through the Talysh Mountains can be called wild and romantic.
A microbus with a thunderstorm rolls along a winding road past densely forested hills, stormy rivers and simple peasant houses.
Everything around is so green and bright that you can think of yourself as being in Schwarzwald.
But this is the southernmost region of Azerbaijan, the Iranian border is just a few kilometers from here.
Talyshi live here - one of the Caucasian peoples of which little is known, except that they speak well in Persian and Azerbaijani and are distinguished by longevity.
The final point is Lerick.
The small town is surrounded by too heavy-duty architecture of Soviet times, which does not harmonize at all with the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here, the road from the Azerbaijani capital Baku is too tiring.
At 323 kilometers, it takes eight hours, since the road has only one lane.
The legendary wealth that the country owes to the oil of the Caspian Sea, here, to the province, until it has reached.
However, Pilate Fatulaeva (48) is convinced that there is something to interest tourists in Lerik.
"In May, Baku was famous for the Eurovision Song Contest - and next year we will have the festival of the oldest people in the world," - says Fatulaeva.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here is a biography of about eight dozen talents from these places, which are more than 100 years old. Fatulaeva points to a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he's 120 years old here.
At the age of 136, he had another child.
But the controversial star of the museum is the shaban Shirali Muslim, who is said to be 168 years old.
There is no proof of birth, however.
And given that the oldest person, whose age is confirmed by documents, is 122 years old, the age of Muslumov seems extremely doubtful.
"He was born in this area in 1805, died in 1973," Fatulaeva explains.
The man was married three times, and he had 23 children, at the age of 136, he allegedly had a daughter.
So did Chaban Muslumov add a couple of decades to his age?
After all, even Rembrandt Schultz, an age researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has heard of long-term residents in Central Asia.
“Extremely many older people can also be found in some areas of China, in Japan, or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan,” Sholts says, “there are also an extremely large number of very old people in Sardinia.”
However, due to the absence of documents, scientific confirmation of age is not possible, as there were no civil status registers.
A glass of boiled oil every day
However, there is a fact that people in the Lerika area are surprisingly often reaching the biblical age.
There are now 20 people over 100 years old.
Why are there so many people in the South?
Azerbaijani tour guide Farid Mugimzade explains this with special genes of talents.
The director of the Fatulaev Museum, on the contrary, believes that it is about food.
Talys love meat, bread and most dairy products, many of them drink a glass of boiled oil every day. However, it is unlikely that such a high-calorie diet can be healthy from a dietary point of view.
Or is it an primitive way of life that keeps people young? In Chengemira, a small village near the town of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzoeva.
At 97 years old, she is still relatively young for these latitudes.
Mirzaeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical for the entire Caucasus region.
She's sitting on the floor with a barrel of oil, which she's rolling around without getting tired.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzaeva’s sons and daughter, who have long had their grandchildren.
There will also be two children in the vicinity.
In the kitchen, guests are prepared tea, which is served in typical pudding glasses of armuda.
Mirzaeva has perfectly smooth and strong white teeth, under the headplate she hides long dark red hairs, which her son proudly reveals to us.
I have always had my hair milk, so they never fell out and kept the color.
"And I've never used shampoo," Mirzaeva says.
Monthly Retirement Is Enough for Life
She always ate only what grew in her own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, peanuts.
I’ve never bought anything in my life at a store.
Then she talks about her husband, who served in the army.
The worst was after the Second World War.
But it got better when the "loving father" Heydar Aliyev got to the wheel.
Propaganda is not often heard in the speech of an old woman.
However, the cult created around the figure of the father of the nation, who ruled the country as a dictator, in Azerbaijan knows practically no borders.
He was in power until 2003, and then his son Ilham took over.
Nevertheless, there is no poverty among the Azerbaijani elderly.
230 manats (about the same amount in euros) Mirzayeva receives monthly as a pension, for local conditions it is an amount that can live well.
And, perhaps, Mirzaeva’s long-awaited son is also right: “Old people in our culture have deep respect.”
They live in a large family, loved, surrounded by care and happy.
There is no reason to stay alive as long as possible.
The word “human rights” does not exist in the Constitution.
The revolution returned to Cairo.
Rival demonstrations in Cairo are evidence of a deep split in the country.
The future Sharia-based constitution has been met with fierce resistance.
The Egyptian president did not go to Pafos.
We need to create a transition.
“And his success lies in my responsibility to the people and to God,” he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, but primarily to Christian Copts, liberals, educated Muslims, and non-religious Egyptians.
After all, all of them, still hopelessly divided in the lost opposition, are afraid.
The fear of a religious state on the Nile at the mercy of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohammad Mursi, almost apologizing, said he had temporarily cut off the jurisdiction of the Constitutional Court and expanded his jurisdiction “to save the revolution.”
However, what the 61-year-old engineer actually wants to save, having a doctorate from the American University of Southern California, is not quite clear to the Egyptians and the whole world.
Will the judiciary be deprived of power?
In fact, 234 articles were dragged in a nightly 15-hour obstacle jump to an Islamist-minded constitutional assembly of 100 participants, and this is partly worrying.
As in previous constitutions, the bill says that the trial is based on “principles of Islamic law.”
But what do “principles” mean?
This has been and remains a matter of interpretation, and it may be feared that Islamists will use the floating wording and the legal loft that arises in connection with it for a more rigorous interpretation of the Sharia.
At least one new article suggests this: in all cases concerning the Sharia, the Al-Ashhar University, the most important Islamic institution of the country, should be invited to the council, which enjoys great authority in all Sunni Islam.
This should not, but may mean that the clergy supervises the legislation, that de facto would have the effect of restricting the judiciary.
In the draft constitution, much is the subject of interpretation.
Another problem: the suffrage of civilians to the military court must be preserved.
These courts during Mubarak’s rule served to suppress the opposition.
After the overthrow of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were in military detention.
Also, as stated in the draft, the state should protect “the true essence of the Egyptian family” and “maintain its morals and values.”
Legally, this has been formulated so vaguely that public institutions will be able to control even the content of cinema and literature with the help of this article.
In open text, this means nothing but censorship.
No article at all establishes direct equality between men and women.
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).
But what an insult is and how it should be punished remains unclear.
It is also questionable the wording that "harassment of people" is prohibited.
Will cartoons for the president or jokes about law be enough?
The question of interpretation, as well as much in this draft, which Mursi proposes for signature and which, he said, “very soon” will be presented to the Egyptians in a referendum.
“The Revolution is Back”
For several weeks, an opposition to the supremacy of Islamists has been forming.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in an unusual unanimity on Friday evening in Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to destroy the document before it could come into force.
“The revolution is back, and we will win,” said Hamdin Sabbachi, who took third place in the presidential election.
Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohammad El-Baradei, said the draft constitution was "in the landfill of history".
Through the Twitter news service, he accused Mursi’s supporters of wanting to lead an “anti-democracy” campaign.
"If he announces a referendum, we will go to his palace and take it down," opposition leader Yasser Said said.
“We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet avenged,” the Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Khaled Ali as saying.
Many judges also said they did not want to watch the referendum, which would have made it invalid.
"The Qur'an is our Constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, in turn, called for the opposite demonstration, but, with caution, not in Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other bank of the Nile in front of Cairo University.
It was attended by a large number of women under the cover and adherents of the Salafis, who shouted: "The people demand the application of God's law."
They demanded from Mursi, “Clean the country!” and assured, “The Qur’an is our constitution.”
The struggle for power over the symbolic square, where everything began, provoked the state of almost civil war.
Mursi’s followers obviously didn’t want to take that risk.
The Muslim Brotherhood said that both opponents and supporters of the draft constitution spoke out loud and clearly.
Now is the time to let the people decide at the polling station in which direction the country should go.
For most of the Islamists, this is considered a settled matter.
“The concept of ‘human rights’ is never mentioned.”
Hafiz Abu Saeed was angry at this forced constitutional process, which was supposed to last until February with the participation of all the public forces.
A 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EHRO) defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or brought to trial under Mubarak.
Not because he shared their worldview, but because his human rights are incomprehensible to him.
For this he was beaten, convicted, arrested.
And now the words "human rights" are never found in the new constitution, he regrets in a conversation with "Welt am Sonntag".
The expansion of Mursi's influence over all three branches of power in the state disappointed the lawyer.
These measures represent a clear blow to the democratic rules of the game and will lead the Egyptians to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening the civilian state, the president de facto canceled it," Saeda said.
Without civil society organizations, democracy can’t work.
Saeda feels that everyone has left him, even the international community, which looks at the ideological struggle of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
There may be a payment for this.
A demonstrator in Tahrir Square warns: “You create a monster that you can’t control.”
Norwegian rayfish: the world's most stinky fish?
With a population of 5 million, Norway has one of the highest standards of living not only in Europe, but also in the world.
Is it possible that the secret of this country’s success is somehow related to the local addiction to one extremely vicious fish dish?
Take a few ripened pieces of cheese.
Place them in a pile of dirty and sweaty sports clothes.
Leave them there for a week.
You will get the scent of raccoon - one of the most famous Norwegian delicacies.
I'm in a small town called Fagernes, three hours' drive from Oslo.
Around the snow-covered picturesque sights. It is very beautiful, but in the air pours an indestructible characteristic smell.
Rakfish is a forel, sprinkled with salt and roasted in water for up to a year, depending on what kind of shower you need to achieve.
As the twilight thickens and cools, the crowds of Norwegians gather for a festival in Fagernes, dedicated to this very, let’s say, exciting dish.
"They eat raw and drink a can of aquavit, a local mint of vodka," explains Howard Halvarsen, a local firefighter in the profession and co-chairmanship of the "Racfisk General", who leads the festival.
Everywhere around us, people eat small cubes of fish and drink it with countless portions of liquor.
“Someone prefers aquavit rather than racfish,” says Howard.
This drink is able to break the smell.
I'll try a couple of pieces.
If you can carry a piece under your nose, then everything is not so bad - it is little different from the portion of sushi that you have been carrying in the bus for a long time.
Rakfisk is a Norwegian product from completely different times, times of poverty, when, even before the appearance of the refrigerators, fish were soaked in autumn in hermetically sealed barrels with salt water.
Then in the deep winter, when the fish had already well and thoroughly fertilized, it was extracted and, muted by the perception of alcohol, consumed in food.
In memory of the last generation, the fact that thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and emigrate, mainly to the United States.
Now the population is growing rapidly – more than 13% of immigrants are involved in jobs, high salaries and a developed social security system.
Residents of Sweden (an old rival, and not so long ago and a much more prosperous neighbor) come here to work.
Rakfisk is perceived as an important symbol, an indispensable, albeit somewhat evil element of Norway’s past.
This is one of the most expensive local dishes.
On the other hand, here everything is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich will cost you <0xC2><0xA3>9 ($14).
Norway rarely appears in the world’s news, and most of the country’s residents seem to do so.
People here are still reluctant to mention the name of Anders Breivik, a racist and right-wing extremist who shot and killed 77 men, women and children last year.
Without mentioning his name, the attack is called "the 22nd of July".
It is very difficult for Norwegians to believe that in their peaceful country one of their fellow citizens was capable of such atrocities and murders.
At the heart of today’s well-being is Norway’s growth (since the early 1970s) one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world.
“However, oil is not the only reason for our prosperity,” says Anna, our waitress, who wears trays with a hard-wearing raccoon, a woman with long light hair and strikingly blue eyes, the embodiment of Nordic well-being.
We are a people, as you call it, reasonable.
Like most Norwegians, she speaks very well in English.
We don't like to show off, we don't brag.
Norway is very careful about its oil – most of the oil and gas industry’s revenues are invested in a special fund created for the benefit of future generations.
In the years leading up to the global financial crisis, when everyone was squandered with money they didn’t have, Norway carefully counted all the costs.
“As long as you can go skiing in the winter and go hiking in the summer, that’s enough for happiness,” says Anna.
"And there's a rakfish," she adds with carefree laughter.
I'm standing in the snow in a queue for some food - the raksha is enough for me.
Here's a hamburger with salmon - it's definitely exotic, delicious juicy meat.
But in the evening we have even more of the same fish with an unforgettable smell.
In my hotel there is a special dinner dedicated to raccoon, during which the visitors determine by voting the best or perhaps the most fragrant fish.
There is a direct telecast, in which they show the leader in a butterfly tie, surrounded by plates with racfish.
It's like the Eurovision Song Contest.
"So, Thor-Jurgen, what did you rate the best fish out there in the mountains?"
"Yes, Howard, here's our assessment."
Everyone laughs and applauds.
Someone falls off a chair, maybe by crossing an aquavit.
Or maybe just sniffing out the smell of this fish.
Mexican President Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto has a difficult career ahead of him.
As Mexico’s newly elected president, Enrique Penya Nieto, prepares to take office, BBC correspondent Will Grant invites us to take a look at the difficulties he faces and the mixed expectations of his country’s population.
The traffic in Mexico City is now in a particularly bad state.
This city is overcrowded with transport and at the best time, and since Monday steel fences were built, intersecting several key highways to the capital and causing chaos on the roads.
However, this was not done to prevent people from getting to work from the suburbs, but to prevent protesters from entering the parliament building.
On Sunday, the new head of Mexico, Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto, will wear a presidential tie and take the reins of the country's government.
He has a difficult task ahead of him.
Mexico has achieved good economic performance under the Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n administration, which now holds its powers, but the country has sunk in a war on drugs, which has already killed about 60,000 people in six years.
“My government declares to the people of Mexico its readiness to fight violence,” Mr. Penya Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama in the White House’s oval office earlier this week.
I am going to propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before such statements, alongside the President of the United States, Mr. Penia Nieto ' s political career developed as governor of his home state of Mexico.
In his homeland, in a densely populated and vast state surrounding the country’s capital, opinions on the new leader were divided.
Straight-lined man
In the idyllic town of Vale de Bravo, for example, it is remembered with warmth.
Residents are credited with revitalizing tourism, developing the resort sector and creating an infrastructure.
The city can be reached by one of the new highways built by Mr. Penya Nieto, which are distinctly different from the roads with wells and wells that were previously in this place.
The plaques with its name hang on the modern building of the sports center and on the impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
“We are linking with him hopes for real and serious change,” says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a state congressman from the Penya Nieto-led Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).
We expect real and decisive changes that are so urgently needed for our country, especially in the areas of security and economic development.
After 81 years in power, the PRI party was expelled in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that after his 12-year absence from the presidential palace of Los Pinos, the party puts great hopes on Enrique Penya Nieto.
In addition, he denies the accusations of insubstantiality that the new president has been put forward by the opposition.
He is very direct and very committed to the realization of his vision of the future of the country.
He is an excellent statesman, and, above all, a man who knows how to listen.
But in another part of the state, many people had a different idea about the former governor.
The municipality of Nesaualcoiotl, also known as Ciudad Nesa, is the most striking contrast to the powered streets of Vale de Bravo.
Hidden under the highway stalls, it is in many ways a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the municipality also bear the harsh nature of this metropolis.
Troops had been drawn earlier this year to pacify the drug-trafficking gangs in these areas; violence against women was particularly acute here.
In the desert near an extensive landfill only in the last two years, dozens of bodies of women killed have been discovered.
More than a thousand women were killed in the state of Mexico during the governorship of Mr. Penia Nieto - this far exceeds a similar figure in the sadly violent city of Ciudad Huares, whose name has become notorious when it comes to the murder of women.
According to the opponents of Mr. Penya Nieto, it can best be said that during his tenure as governor he was unable to cope with the problem of killing women.
In the worst case, his administration is accused of completely ignoring the problem.
A resident of a concrete house, similar to most houses in this crowded area, Irina Buendiya hardly holds her tears, showing me pictures of her late daughter Mariana Luna.
According to Mariana's official version, she committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes that her co-worker killed her.
“When I got to her house, it looked like her body had been washed before,” recalls Ms. Buendia.
There were signs that she was beaten, and the body was already rotted.
Mariana’s mother recounts this story, and the portrait of her daughter looks at us from the wall, where it hangs next to the crucifixion, on which only one word is drawn: justice.
That, according to them, was the reason for this family being denied.
“The officials of the state treated me like an old whistleblower, a dissatisfied peacekeeper.
They want people to just believe everything they say and keep quiet.
But that’s wrong, it can’t be, especially when there are so many violations and shortcomings around,” she says.
Wearing a presidential tie on Saturday, President Penya Nieto will take on a difficult responsibility along with her.
Over the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been affected by violence-related crimes, and the new president has promised to make the solution of this problem a priority during his reign.
"I hope he will be exactly the same president as the governor," said Olvera, a congressman from Vale de Bravo of the PRI party.
However, this is what the families of victims in Ciudad Nes are most afraid of.
Bradley Manning has not complained of ill-treatment, the indictment says.
Prosecutors are trying to disprove Bradley Manning's statements about poor conditions of detention.
During the hearing, increased attention was paid to Manning’s stay in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defence requires closing the case on the grounds that Manning's detention conditions were cruel.
The U.S. military is accused of kidnapping several thousand secret documents.
On Friday, the indictment tried to prove that the plaintiff Bradley Manning, accused of the largest leak of classified material in U.S. history, did not take advantage of many opportunities to file a complaint about the ill-treatment that, according to him, he had to suffer.
During a cross-examination at a pre-trial hearing in Fort Meade, Maryland, military prosecutor Major Ashden Feyne stated that records of weekly visits to Manning by the representatives of the administration are a summary of the detention of the prison for nine months, not his detention in Quentin.
A cross-examination of Manning's application for protection on the grounds that the conditions of his detention were harsh and in itself sufficient punishment was carried out the day after Manning stated that while in custody, he intended to commit suicide.
A military intelligence analyst, who was arrested in June 2010, is accused of kidnapping several thousand secret documents while serving in Iraq.
These materials were subsequently published on the Internet on the WikiLeaks website.
WikiLeaks has not confirmed that the source of the information was Manning.
During Friday's hearing, Attorney Feyne and Manning reviewed the reports, which were completed after Manning's visits by administration officials during his time in the Quantico prison, where he was under strict detention from July 2010 to April 2011.
During the visits, prison officials asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When prosecutor Feyn asked about the reports on Friday, Manning admitted that he considered the administration’s handling of the prison as “excellent” and the general conditions of detention as “very professionally organized.”
The reviewed reports do not contain complaints of ill-treatment, despite Manning being asked directly about the terms of his detention, Feyn says.
Manning replied that he had expressed concern orally about these problems and that his visiting administration representatives had discussed these problems with him and stated that they would deal with them, but did not record it in writing.
“They recorded ‘problems are missing’ (after discussing my complaints), but that doesn’t mean I didn’t raise the issue in a conversation,” Manning said.
The military judge, Colonel Denise Linde, also asked Manning why he had not complained to him of ill-treatment in January 2011 during a meeting of the commission that considered the suicide intentions that he had expressed in writing a few months before.
Manning replied that during that meeting he wanted to get the “injury warning” regime removed from him and to ease the conditions of detention.
Representatives of the military leadership explained that the restricted detention regime - at a level lower than the surveillance regime for the purpose of preventing suicide - was introduced to protect the prisoner, as well as for the safety of others.
"I wanted to let the administration know that I'm okay with them canceling the trauma prevention regime... so that my standard of living improves, from my point of view," Manning said.
On Thursday, Manning testified about his arrest in Iraq and transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for almost two months before being taken to prison at a naval base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He reported that he had thoughts of suicide in Kuwait, and that one day he lost consciousness due to severe heat.
He explained that it is psychologically very difficult when you are not told how your fate is decided and what is going on in the outside world.
“My world has shrunk to the Camp-Arifjan base, to the size of my prison,” Manning said on Thursday.
“I thought I was going to die in this cage.”
While in Quantico, Manning, he said, spent most of his time in a small chamber—at least 21 hours, and often more than 23 hours a day—in complete solitude.
Manning reports that he was allowed to leave only mattresses, blankets, slippers, several items of clothing and glasses.
He says he tried to move because sleeping or even just lying down in the daytime was prohibited by the rules.
According to Manning, during his sleep, his eyes were constantly exposed to the light penetrating outside the camera.
If the guards did not see his face when he turned in bed at night, he said, he was woken up and forced to turn on his back.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal objection to the misappropriation of Manning in January 2011.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to a military prison in Fort Levenworth, Kansas.
In addition, on Friday, the judge questioned Manning about the statement he made while giving testimony on Thursday, that after one night he was forced to sleep naked in his cell in Quantico, he was forced to stand naked in front of guards and other prisoners.
Manning said he did not have the opportunity to cover the blanket during the check.
Responding to the judge's questions on Friday, Manning said he understood from a guard's order that he should throw a blanket that could have been covered, but admitted that no one had directly ordered him to throw it.
On Thursday, Manning said he was forced to sleep naked the night before because of his attempt to show the officer that he posed no danger to himself.
Manning said he told the officer that he could use a rubber sock or slippers to hurt himself, but did not.
That night, according to Manning, his underwear, slippers and glasses were taken from the camera.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account what he had to live through during his imprisonment, and will significantly shorten his sentence in case Manning is found guilty by a military court that is due to begin hearing his case early next year.
The defense said it plans to propose to Manning to plead guilty to less serious crimes, and to challenge other charges as excessive.
The resumption of hearings is scheduled for this weekend, and the prosecution is expected to insist that conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon claims Manning was held in Quantico in accordance with rules regulating the detention of those arrested with the strictest regime possible.
The charges brought against Manning included aiding the enemy, illegally facilitating the disclosure of data on the Internet, the transfer of information relating to national defense, and the hijacking of state property or documents.
If he is convicted under all the provisions of the indictment, he may face life imprisonment.
My crisis of national self-determination is the story of an American of Mexican descent.
According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities to realize themselves.
Mexicans tend to blame those who have left because they remind the people of the country of difficult times.
Ruben Navarette believes that Mexicans of American descent are torn between two cultures.
During a recent trip to Mexico, I walked through the arrival corridor, approached the border control zone and froze on the spot.
The signs indicated two lines: one for Mexicanos (Mexicans), the other for Extranjeros (foreigners).
I stood in front of them for a few seconds, not knowing where to go.
I grew up in Central California, and I’ve been called a Mexican all my life.
It’s just a conditional name, just like my friends in Boston call themselves Irish, and friends in New York consider themselves Italian.
Later, I stopped at the complex construction of "American of Mexican origin."
But here I was in Mexico.
Here, in my grandfather’s homeland, there was no need for conditional names or complex constructions.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to be able to ask questions or answer them.
But my vocabulary is poorer than that of speakers, and I can’t get rid of the American accent.
So I got my American passport and became in line for Extranjeros.
I recalled this story a few days ago when the re-elected President of Mexico, Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto, visited the White House and met with President Obama.
On the agenda of the meetings of the presidents of these countries were issues: immigration, drugs and trade.
President Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto was keen to talk about the rise of the Mexican economy, thanks to which Mexicans can now, with the same success, stay in Mexico instead of moving to the United States.
He wants to conclude a partnership agreement with the United States and Canada and create a North American trade bloc like the European Union.
In addition, President Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto promised to continue the war against drug cartels in Mexico, but no concrete proposals were made.
For Mexico, relations with the United States are a difficult and old-fashioned issue.
Most Americans never thought that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and, under the guise of a rifle, forced its leaders to give up half of their territory.
But Mexicans think for centuries, not minutes, and they see memories of those events in everything.
Therefore, it is only necessary for any U.S. statesman to speak at least a word of criticism towards Mexico, in the press and among the elites of Mexican society immediately spread complaints that Americans are infringing on the sovereignty of their neighbors.
And the descendants of Montesume are filled with militancy.
At the same time, the most difficult are the relations of Mexico with more than 35 million Americans of Mexican descent living in the United States.
Do you want to talk about abuse?
That's enough.
There are winners and losers in Mexico, people who find opportunities for themselves in this country, and those for whom there are no opportunities.
In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver, or San Antonio, so many people of Mexican descent have only one reason: at some point in their family history, anyone - father or grandfather - had no right to realize themselves in Mexico and was forced to do so.
Most of the time, they were Mexicans of a certain type – sluggish, low-educated, from poor peasant families.
We are their descendants, and we remember it.
In Mexico, they see it differently.
Today, our life is an embodiment of the American dream, we studied in good schools and did good jobs, but we must not forget that even this dream is American, not Mexican.
Our national self-determination is confusing and unclear, but we know which country to consider as our own.
The United States of America.
In addition, we know that most of the representatives of the Mexican elite and the ruling class do not like us.
We answer them the same.
They see us as a reminder of humiliating defeats and treat us as second-class people, as unreal Mexicans.
We don’t speak Spanish well enough, and our ties with Mexico aren’t strong enough.
Our very existence for them is due to failures.
If our ancestors had succeeded in Mexico, they would not have left.
We wouldn’t be behind a silk curtain now, finding a full life in the United States, but losing our spiritual ties.
My wife was born in Guadalajara and legally moved to the United States as a child, and it reminds me that there are certain frictions between real Mexicans and Americans of Mexican descent - Mexicans understand their national identity more clearly.
She is a U.S. citizen and believes she belongs to both of these countries.
At the same time, many of my familiar Americans of Mexican descent do not feel belonging to any of them.
We listen to the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but we also love Bruce Springsteen.
When you get the best of both worlds, you inevitably lose your roots.
In Mexico, we are Americans.
In the United States, we are called Mexicans.
Now, as I found out during my trip, as if our relationship hadn’t already been confusing enough, some Mexican leaders and intelligence representatives want to restore their relationship with the diaspora.
They want Mexican-Americans to work as Mexican ambassadors and represent their interests in the United States.
We could tell our American friends about what a beautiful country it is and how great it is to visit it, and we could convince political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yeah, sure.
Nothing's gonna work out.
Too many insults in the past.
And given the gap between rich and poor, the spread of corruption and drug trafficking, many of us don’t think this country is so beautiful.
I'm sorry, but deal with it yourself, amigos.
And that's fair.
If some Mexicans still can’t forgive the United States for what they did to Mexico a century and a half ago, they will have to accept the fact that some Americans of Mexican descent are still offended by the way they were born in Mexico just recently.
Oh, yeah.
Maybe we have more in common than I thought.
The Old Battles in the New Middle East
The ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas could be a fragile foundation for the future of the world.
Is a long-term peace between the Arabs and the Israelis in the Middle East possible?
Another round of bloodshed pushes to the conclusion that such hopes are futile.
There are common, meaningless disputes about who first started; many of the buildings have been turned into ruins; more than 140 Palestinians have been killed, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been displaced by Israelis; for the first time during the conflict, Israelis have been displaced from the territory.
However, despite the hopeless bonding of Israelis and Palestinians in their eternal conflict, changes have come to the Middle East.
This may be treated differently, but the events of the "Arab Spring" surrounded in a rebellious storm many established realities, and the Palestinians with the Israelis were unable to stay away from the whirlwind, which shocked the region.
Perhaps as a result, their struggle will become even more bloodthirsty than before.
However, there are reasons to hope for a way out of this deadly pitfall.
War without winners
At first glance, the situation does not give reason for optimism.
Even if the ceasefire, which was signed on November 21, will be implemented, the clashes that occurred this week only strengthened the positions of the security forces on both sides.
The leaders of the Islamist movement Hamas, which came to power in the Gaza Strip in 2007, say they have forced Israel to step down despite the losses they have suffered.
Despite the fact that some of the group’s leaders have been destroyed and 1.7 million residents are blocked in one of the most populous and troubled corners of our planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining popularity on the West Bank of the Jordan River – another Palestinian territory currently controlled by the more moderate Fatah movement.
Moreover, Hamas leaders may well come to the conclusion that time is working on them.
As the influence of Islamist movements in the Arab world grows, Hamas has new influential and wealthy friends.
Turkey, which was once Israel’s closest ally among Muslim countries, supported Hamas, followed by Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamically developing states in the Persian Gulf.
Hamas supporters claim the establishment of an Islamist crescent around Israel – from Lebanon in the north, which is ruled by Hezbollah’s militarized group, to Syria, where more and more pro-Islamist rebels are smashing the regime.
The most significant change in the balance of power in the region occurred on the southern borders of Israel, in the most populous and important Arab country, in Egypt, where under President Mohammed Mursi the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood movement was strengthened.
Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years and was overthrown in 2011, was a secular dictator who did not pay much attention to Hamas’s support.
The Muslim Brotherhood, on the contrary, is an organization much like Hamas, and their leaders are more prone to populism.
In future diplomatic arrangements, Hamas could become a significant player, whose voice will not be able to silence even Israel and America.
At the same time, supporters of the “hard” line in Israel will come to the opposite conclusion.
In a military sense, Hamas was defeated.
The Israeli anti-missile system Iron Dome justified the cost of its creation and successfully destroyed many of the rockets launched by Hamas.
The citizens of Israel can sleep calmly, at least for some time.
In terms of diplomacy, the United States remained true to its unchanging position; many European countries also blamed the start of the last round of violence against Hamas.
Another important factor is Israel’s economic prosperity, particularly under the Benjamin Netanyahu government, which largely ignored the peace process.
Despite the fact that since 2004, some 30 Israelis have been killed by rockets fired from the Gaza Strip, Israel has managed to minimize the problem of terrorists-killers, partly because of the wall that enters the territory of the West Bank of the Jordan River.
The position of Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party — as part of preparations for the January 22 elections — has united with even more aggressive conservatives under the leadership of Avigdor Lieberman, is very convenient.
What's the point of impoverishing the Palestinians and giving them their own state?
If we give them all the power in the West Bank, won’t they start launching rockets from there toward Israel, as their fellow Gazans do?
It is better to keep them behind the wall and tightly suppress any attempts to raise their heads.
It is possible that supporters of the “hard” line will win; however, their calculations can be refuted in the Arab Spring.
While the Islamists who come to power in Egypt and other countries do not have the warmest feelings towards Israel, their priority will be internal problems.
The defense part of Israel’s budget is more than all its Arab neighbours combined.
Unleashing a war with a regional superpower is unlikely to help Arab governments strengthen their own economy.
The pragmatism of Egypt’s president, Mursi, who worked together with Barack Obama on a ceasefire, is a good sign and may mark the beginning of change.
Israel, to a lesser extent, must take into account the long-term consequences of its policies.
As democratic changes take place in Arab countries, the Palestinians’ deprivation of the right to self-determination is a slow-acting bomb that will sooner or later explode in Israeli-occupied territories, similar to a bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression is already undermining the foundations of democratic order in the Jewish state, and the demographic aspect – the growth of the Arab population – only exacerbates these problems.
The bloody operations, which are carried out every few years in the Gaza Strip to suppress the Hamas movement, have to be paid for by the growing discontent of the international community.
Both sides need an external impetus.
There remains the only solution to which sound-minded representatives from both sides are constantly calling for, as well as much of the rest of the world and our newspaper: the formation of two States and the concession of territories to Israel in exchange for security.
There is still hope, not too impressive in the short term, that the ceasefire will allow other countries to influence the sides of the conflict more effectively.
Egypt, which has long been the time to decide to cut off arms supplies to the Gaza Strip, as well as Turkey and Qatar have a more advantageous position than ever before to convince Hamas to recognize the borders of the Jewish State, the use of the territories and the Jerusalem exchanges since 1967.
Other Arab countries should also make efforts to reconcile the Hamas and Fatah movements.
This would do more for the creation of a Palestinian state than an upcoming vote at the UN, which could result in the recognition of the virtual statehood of Palestine.
His role in putting Israel at the negotiating table must also be played by President Obama.
During his first term, he never presented his own plan for a peaceful settlement.
After returning to the White House, he still demonstrates a reluctance to connect to the solution of the problem.
This is a disastrously short-sighted position.
The United States is vitally interested in stability in the Middle East.
This is only possible in the case of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia, the law on unified packaging for cigarettes came into force.
The warnings about the harm of smoking and the images of the parts of the body affected by the disease are contrasted on the undiluted green boxes, the same for all brands of cigarettes.
The first in world practice Australian law on the same type of packaging of cigarettes and tobacco products came into force, replacing the logos and colored design of different brands with a single box of unicorns of olive-colored skeletons whose skeletons are healthy with pictures of children affected by the disease.
In addition to the various pictures and inscriptions warning of the harm of smoking, the only difference between packs, entered in a mandatory order from this Saturday - the names of the stamps, which are printed in the same small font.
These are the harshest conditions in the world for the design of tobacco packaging.
The federal government of Australia claims that the purpose of the measure is to keep young people from smoking, while depriving this detrimental habit of fashion.
Based on the results of studies that showed that people who did not start smoking before the age of 26, in 99 of 100 cases never become smokers.
“It’s obvious that even at a young age, children understand the meaning that tobacco companies are trying to convey by designing the packaging,” said Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, referring to studies that showed that, for example, the crown in the children’s logo will be the same.
Australia is one of the countries with the lowest share of smokers in the world, so these changes will not have a significant impact on the profits of transnational corporations, but other countries are already considering taking such measures.
Representatives of the tobacco industry strongly opposed the adoption of this law.
Tobacco companies claim that this will only increase the share of the black market in which cheap and affordable cigarettes will be sold.
“This law will have serious consequences other than those that were conceived by its initiators,” said Scott McKintyre, a representative for British American Tobacco in Australia.
Manufacturers of counterfeit products from China and Indonesia will be supplying much more such goods for sale on the streets of Australia.
For some, on the contrary, new laws promote business growth.
Sandra Ha from a small family-owned company Zico Import Pty Ltd claims that the demand for cigarettes and silicone cases, hiding unpleasant pictures on the packaging, has grown rapidly, where the law has grown (practically from zero) and the debris has grown steadily since two months ago, companies such as British Tobacco, Japanese Tobacco.
According to Sandra Ha, the company Zico has already sold about six thousand products to wholesale companies and is waiting for a new batch.
This is a good business for us.
The potential impediment to the effectiveness of such measures is, according to experts, the popularity of social networks among the part of the population to which these measures are directed.
After the adoption of a number of laws in Australia that made illegal television advertising of cigarettes and their support of sporting events, as well as prohibiting sellers from displaying cigarettes in a prominent place, tobacco advertising moved to the Internet.
The Australian government has banned local companies and websites from posting advertisements on the network, but it can’t restrict foreign websites.
“If you’re dealing in tobacco products and you’ve only got this little gap left, the idea of promoting your product online will seem extremely tempting to you,” said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman noted an increase in the number of reviews of trademarks written by the face of supposedly ordinary users, on social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
The question arises – is it really a business of the hands of an ordinary citizen who loves cigarettes so much Marlboro that he did not regret the forces and time and made a video, or is it worth the advertising company?
The Australian branch of British American Tobacco claims that the industry is now more engaged in adapting to new rules than advertising.
Representatives of the tobacco industry even went to such measures as the sponsorship of Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules: these states are making claims that they are not in the framework of the World Trade Organization (WTO), claiming that the trade was subject to the new rules.
The WTO decision is expected by mid-2013.
According to Tani Plibersek, the government was discussing with other countries the possibility of adopting similar laws on packaging.
In 2001, Canada introduced the first mandatory placement of photographs warning of the harm of smoking.
Now this rule is adopted in more than 40 countries, including in Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The possibility of tightening the laws is considered in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia are demonstrably not adhering to innovations.
These pictures don't bother me.
I'm just not paying attention.
“Just pick up a cigarette and hide the pack in your pocket,” explains Victor El Haig, a cigarette shopper with a photo of the oral tumor on the pack.
Honestly, the only thing that can make me leave is my little daughter.
James Yue, head of the King of the Pack tobacco store in central Sydney, claims that the same packaging has complicated the task of placing goods on shelves.
“I used to have an hour to unload the new batch, and now it’s four hours,” he complains.
"The government had to take and ban cigarettes altogether, we would have said: what to do, okay, it's all over, we're closing the store," he said, throwing his hands up.
Being bored in the world of electronic networks and constant connections is not so bad.
On this Thanksgiving day, I had to spend five hours at the airport, because our plane had mechanical malfunctions and it was replaced by another plane that we had been waiting for.
So I had enough time to think about the nature of boredom.
I won't fool you.
An afternoon at the airport waiting for a flight is really boring, and neither books, nor magazines, nor iPhones, nor even duty-free shops will help here.
However, more and more scientists and specialists in child development have recently expressed their support for boredom.
They say that in certain situations it is not so bad for us and for our children to miss.
This forces the brain to divert to interesting related topics, which may contribute to creativity.
And since in the modern world we are all constantly in front of some screen, the advantages of boredom pass us.
Do we need to get bored?
Oh, yeah.
And at the same time, it's not.
We'll get back to that.
In the past, I, like many, believed that boredom was an invention of relatively recent times, when people had more free time.
This is not the case, says Peter Tuy, a professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada, author of Boredom: A Lively History, Yale University Press, 2011.
“In fact, boredom can boast a very ancient history,” he says.
On the walls of Pompeii are found Latin inscriptions about boredom, dating from the first century.
The question remains as to how we understand boredom.
The problem is, says John D. Eastwood, assistant professor at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, that the understanding and vision of boredom has often changed.
After studying the research materials on the topic and asking a target group of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the following definition: boredom is when people “want but cannot do what would satisfy them.”
The difference between boredom and apathy, he says, is that a bored person does not do something he would like to do.
I don’t want to do anything with apathy.
The main thing about boredom, he says, is “a violation of attention and associated deterioration of mood and a feeling that time is slowing down.”
According to the description, boredom may seem very similar to depression.
However, Professor Eastwood argues that despite the possible link between these conditions, people who are bored see the causes of the problems in the world and the circumstances, and people who experience depression see the problems in themselves.
Sometimes we feel like we’re bored when we’re actually just having a hard time focusing on something.
In his study, “Unemployed Mind: Defining Toughness from the Point of View,” published in the September issue of the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and colleagues refer to a previous experiment, the participants of which were listening to the recording.
Some participants also heard loud sounds that were not related to the TV show included in the next room, others heard the same sounds at low volume, so that they could hardly be analyzed, and the third group listened only to the recording of the voice without a foreign ringtone.
Those participants who heard the low-volume TV noted that they were bored, more often others - they had difficulty concentrating, but they didn't know the reason for this and attributed it to boredom.
When we try to focus attention on a difficult or exciting task, interrupting attention can cause boredom, says Mark J. Fensk, an adjunct professor of neurology at the University of Gwell, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when we do something uninteresting, "for example, by looking at the flow of products on a conveyor in search of marriage, distracting music can help avoid boredom."
It is believed, he continues, that when people start climbing on a chair or drawing caraculi on a sheet of paper, they do it out of boredom, but now we know that in fact such actions just help not to relax physically.
“The study showed that children who are not banned from scratching and spinning are better able to learn and memorize more information than children who are required to sit quietly,” Fensk said.
At some point, we all get bored: when a flight is delayed (as in my case), listening to a monotonous speech, watching an uninteresting movie.
However, different people show a different degree of propensity to boredom.
In the 1980s, to measure such individual characteristics, researchers developed a special “strain to boredom” scale.
To determine the assessment on such a scale use questions and affirmations, for example, "A lot of what I have to do is uniform and monotonous" or "I'm interested in too much, so there's no time for anything."
Using such questionnaires, the researchers determined that boys miss girls more often, says Steven Vodanovic, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, - especially in the presence of a variety of external irritants.
In general, however, teenagers are often bored.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of personal and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents 7-8 times a day using a pager.
He received the following results: 32% of teenagers said they were bored in school and while doing homework, and 23% said they were bored outside of school.
Only 3% of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson notes that he has no data on what such data about boredom would be now, 21 years later.
However, he knows that “the teenage age has a peak of propensity to boredom,” mainly because children and adolescents are not allowed to fully decide what to do.
Let’s get back to my original question: Is boredom useful?
Sometimes it doesn’t because in extreme manifestations, research shows, it can push people to absurd and dangerous physical actions, risky gambling, or abuse of certain substances in an attempt to get rid of boredom.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers have been thinking about the connection between boredom and creativity, says Professor Vodanovich, who has devoted more than two decades to the study of this problem.
“So our brains tell us that we should do something else; that’s boring,” says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the University of New York.
However, this very brain does not always know what is best to do.
If you get bored and you direct that energy to playing guitar or culinary experiences, you’ll do better.
However, if you start watching TV, you will only get better for a while, and soon it will pass.
Therefore, if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, he will stop being bored, but he will not learn to deal with boredom alone or in any other way to manage his time and employment,” says Professor Fensk.
“And such self-regulation skills are involved in a variety of situations,” he says.
Your child not only learns to do something on his own, he also learns to control himself in general.
I don't think we need to be bored in any way.
However, it is not worth considering something bad either.
Rather, you should learn to feel comfortable even outside of the continuous flow of action and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees with that.
“We see it so that we need to experience boredom more often, while boredom is an extremely unpleasant, irresistible desire to do something meaningful,” he says.
In fact, people tend to somehow disconnect from constant worries and just relax.
“In the modern world, we are used to the constant overstimulation of the senses,” he says, “and when silence comes, we get lost and don’t know what to do.”
It is not yet clear how the new law on the legalization of marijuana in the state of Colorado will apply.
Anthony Orosco, a nineteen-year-old football team player and a public college student in the southeastern state of Colorado, is accused of committing a criminal offence, consisting in the fact that soon the scoundrels will be completely legal in the scoundrels and scoundrels throughout the state.
Mr. Orosco says that once in September, he and his friends were in Lamare, driving in a prairie car near the Kansas border when they were stopped by police.
After a police officer found marijuana in a car, Mr. Orosco went to court for drug storage and possession of a drug-use device - minor offences, each of which is subject to a fine of $100 - and the court was appointed.
“We are being treated like criminals,” says Mr. Orosco.
But is he a criminal?
As a result of the uncertainty that has been going on for weeks after the state of Colorado voted to legalize the use of small amounts of marijuana for entertainment, the resolution of hundreds of small litigation cases depends not so much on the law as on the place of consideration.
Accusations of minor marijuana-related offences have already been dropped in hundreds of cases here and in the state of Washington, which has taken a similar measure.
Police have already stopped indicting people aged 21 and over for keeping small doses, which will be considered legal as soon as the law comes into force in a couple of weeks.
However, in more conservative Colorado counties, prosecutors have decided to consider existing marijuana-related cases, and are still holding the drug in custody.
At the same time, in some cities from the suburbs of Denver to the mountainous regions of the West, people are voting in favour of not allowing new, state-licensed marijuana stores to appear in their locations.
“It’s all going so fast that I don’t even know what to expect next,” said Daniel J. Outs, chief of police in Aurora, east of Denver.
Representatives of the control bodies in Washington state also inadvertently honor their heads.
They are to draw up rules to determine the procedure for licensing the cultivation, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, and all of this must be done by December 1, 2013.
They say Colorado, whether it’s good or bad, is ahead of most other states in tackling marijuana use issues, first for medical purposes, and now for entertainment.
“Colorado has a more orderly market, so they will serve as a good example,” said Brian I. Smith, a representative of the Board of Regulators for the Production and Sales of Alcohol Products in Washington, D.C.
But now no one can do more, Mr. Smith admits, than to make some suggestions and hope that it will work.
“We don’t have a real precedent that we could focus on,” he said.
The Washington State Bill, called I-502, will enter into force on December 6 and will put the state in a state of uncertainty for a whole year, when the state licensing system is not yet in place and the right to own marijuana is already legal.
And there are still difficult technical aspects that need to be resolved during this period, for example, how to find a balance between the state’s order for “adequate access” to licensed marijuana with a ban on trade in it at a distance of 1000 feet from schools, parks, playgrounds.
“It will be particularly difficult to place licensed marijuana-trading businesses in the city, particularly in Seattle and its suburbs,” said Ben Livingston, a representative of the newly created research group, the Marijuana Legalization Center.
On November 21, the Aurora Police Chief Outs sent an e-mail to his subordinates saying that the city’s prosecutor’s office would no longer attract people under the age of 21 to the responsibility for the possession of the data by a small number of people, and that the police would stop robbery.
The chief of police, Outs, said the police would monitor compliance in the city with rules regulating the activities of marijuana growers for medical purposes, and would prosecute illegal drug dealers and drug dealers.
North Colorado’s Weld County Attorney, Ken Buck, has a more stringent approach to the issue.
After the vote on the bill, he said that the prosecutor ' s office would continue to take responsibility for the possession of marijuana, mainly to encourage its users to undergo a course of treatment.
At present, 119 individuals have been charged with storing two ounces of marijuana or less, although many of them are also accused of other violations.
“It is our institution’s responsibility to prosecute for acts that are considered criminal at the time of their commission,” Buck said in a statement.
The reaction was ambiguous even in places such as rural Mesa district, where voters rejected the proposal to legalize marijuana.
The Grand Junction Police, the largest city in the district, no longer hold minors accountable for possession of a small amount of drugs.
District Attorney Pete Hutzinger supported the decision, but also decided not to lift charges for already open cases related to the storage of marijuana.
“I believe that ensuring compliance with the law until it changes is our direct duty,” he said.
Despite the fact that 55% of Colorado residents who took part in the vote supported this decision, including marijuana issues for entertainment in the state and legal system would not be easy.
And the contradictory reaction of residents in different places of the state has revealed the ambiguity of the attitude of local authorities to the state experiment with marijuana.
“The district attorneys have a cultural barrier in this matter,” explains Sean Macalister, a Danish lawyer representing the interests of those convicted of storing marijuana, and a local representative of the National Marijuana Law Reform Organization.
“They’ve been chasing people for so long that they can’t really accept that it’s no longer a crime,” he says.
Colorado and Washington—the first states to have a small amount of marijuana as much as alcohol—are destined to become a nation-wide experimental field to test the very idea of drug legalization.
Proponents of the legalization and state officials plan to expand the territory of the legalized trade, but at the same time they eagerly await instructions from the federal authorities, who still plan to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Proponents of the legalization of marijuana hope that the Office of Justice will give in to this issue.
Despite a few wide-ranging arrests of drug traffickers and patients using marijuana on medical grounds, the federal government has in most cases benefited from the trade of marijuana for medical purposes in Colorado, Washington, and 16 other states.
Agents of the Bureau of Drugs Control are unlikely to break into homes to confiscate a small bag of marijuana, however, they are hardly going to close their eyes to the state-regulated soybeans of the soybeans in the soybeans of the state stores of recreational marijuana, which is allowed under the new law.
Some cities in Colorado did not wait for the actions of the federal authorities.
Even before the presidential election, some local administrations have approved a moratorium on opening new marijuana stores, which could not open anytime sooner than a year later.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the western part of the state, proposed a six-month ban on the trade in marijuana, which is likely to be approved next week.
“We don’t want to be in a position where we’re going to give someone a license, and then it’s going to cause serious problems at the federal level,” said Bob Nicholson, a city council member.
Our city voted against this amendment.
And now we have a contradiction between the results of the local vote and what the state voted for.
There are still a lot of unresolved questions.
Petronella Wyatt: I survived from Oxford for being a conservative.
The persecution of university students for their views did not begin today.
As far as I can remember, I've always dreamed of going to Oxford University.
My father and older brother studied in Oxford and described it as the best educational institution in the world, a modern analogue of an ancient symposium laying the two foundations of civilization – freedom of thought and tolerance.
And yet, after two weeks of studying at the University of Oxford’s Faculty of History in the late 1980s, I picked up my suitcases and left, which turned out to be the first real scandal in my life.
My father couldn't stand it and cried.
My friends were blown away by it.
The Evening Standard newspaper claimed that I had dropped out of college because I didn’t like my classmates having sex in the next room.
The writer E. Norman Wilson joked that I had to leave because I had to drink from broken cups.
It wasn't really that much fun.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran away because I was systematically bullied and intimidated.
Not because of my rather unusual name or the fact that I was in a private school.
I was haunted for only one reason, and in this glorious cradle of enlightenment it seemed real barbarism and blind fanaticism: my father, now deceased Woodrow Wyatt, was a well-known advisor to Margaret Thatcher, and I myself was a supporter of the Consortium.
You will ask, why should you remember this now?
According to the latest data, a new generation of students, adhering to right-centered views, is subjected to the same harassment.
This institutionalized and ever-increasing hatred of conservative students in Oxford is so strong that last week a group of such students demanded the same protection of their rights as that afforded to disabled, sexual and ethnic minorities.
Conservatives at Christie's College College student club in Cambridge say they are "often actively isolated, subjected to personal attacks and made to feel like unwanted guests" because of their political views.
They want to introduce an additional representative to the College's Committee on Equal Rights in order to ensure the freedom of expression.
Their situation was only aggravated by the recently released documentary on BBC 2 about the politics in the student environment "Land of Wonders: Young, Smart and Right", in which the conservatives were presented by eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
The film features Joe Cook, a former president of the Association of Conservatives at the University of Oxford, who rides in Rolls-Royce, wears a silver suit and a stick with a silver buckle.
In other universities, conservative students complain that they are making them "goats to lay off because of increased tuition fees."
Luke Black, 20, vice president of the Association of Conservatives at the University of Nottingham, said in an interview with one of the Sunday newspapers that "in the university environment, there is an increase in bias towards left-wing views.
People who don’t even know us, consider us in advance to be the naked and impunityly generous children of wealthy parents.”
Samuel Roberts, 21, a student of the College's historical faculty, the Christie's Corps, in which a request for reinforcement of protection was submitted, calls such an atmosphere "uncomfortable", and St. Stephen's Right-Wing is a member of the St. Stephen Church, 19, the new president of the Association of Conservatives, Oxford.
“This poses a threat to both the atmosphere of intellectual discussion and simply to the normal lives of the club members,” she says.
For the first few weeks in Oxford, I was not just in the minority, I was alone.
I came there in September 1986, a slave and shy eighteen-year-old girl.
Oxford has swarmed with hatred for the Conservative Party.
A year earlier, the university voted to deprive former student Margaret Thatcher of her honorary degree due to a reduction in budget appropriations for higher education.
In such an atmosphere, even the Stalinists would be uncomfortable.
In the first days of the first week of the first year, when the students met each other and the teachers, I felt for the first time what was ahead of me.
I did not yet know that the teachers not only looked through their fingers at the trauma of the conservative students, but they themselves gladly took part in it.
Political issues – miners’ strikes, privatization and the government’s disagreement over sanctions against South Africa’s apartheid government – have penetrated through the wooden paneled walls of the audience.
In my first seminar I had to translate the French text of the eighteenth century into English, and I was not ready for what followed.
“Miss Wyatt,” said the professor, now deceased Harry Pitt, “please translate the first paragraph.”
The text was hard for me, I stopped.
Harry Pitt was a very agile man with a face similar to a cake.
"The tatcherists basically don't teach French or they just don't have a brain?" he asked.
The other students sneered.
I had tears in my eyes.
“I advise you to take a few initial lessons of French in your spare time, if you’re certainly not very busy turning around in society,” Pitt said.
I went back to my room, completely unhappy.
That night in college, I was sitting alone for lunch; then someone stabbed me in the shoulder.
It was James, a second-year student from the English language faculty who presented himself as a member of the University Conservatory Association.
"I know who you are," he said friendlyly.
- Unfortunately, the case is as follows:
Everyone who is suspected of sympathy for the Conservatives will be ridiculed.
It's not easy for me, and in your case, they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be harder for you.
“Most conservative first-year students pretend to be Labourers.”
Later, at the local pub, I was trying to make a cowardly hypocrisy.
I was insisting that I disagree with everything Margaret Thatcher says.
The trick didn't work.
A freshman in the faculty of philosophy, politics, and economics, who himself studied at Eton, said: “You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You're contagious."
The other students grabbed his words.
I was spoiled, dirty.
“How do conservatives have sex?” one of them asked.
"They're screwing each other, aren't they?"
I felt the way homosexuals must have felt before the abolition of the criminal persecution in the 1960s.
Will I ever be able to live a normal life in Oxford?
Or do I have to meet with like-minded people only under the cover of the night?
Will I be forced to become a laborer and hide my true beliefs?
The next three years seemed like hell, full of persecution and loneliness.
The only teacher in my college who didn’t hide his conservative views was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history.
He was hated not only for being a member of the Conservatives, but also for being a foreign policy adviser to Thatcher and one of her spokespersons.
He didn’t appear in college at all.
He despised it for its provinciality, pettyness, and commitment to the Marxist-Determinist view of history.
In 1997, he took up a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
“You won’t be happy here,” he told me.
I went to Oxford from my parent’s home in London, trying to find shelter among relatives and inexperienced friends in the capital.
I told my father I hated Oxford and explained why.
He didn't believe me.
During his studies in the 1940s, any political views were adopted there.
"But it's the best university in the world," he said.
- You can't do that, except not in the city of sleeping spires...
Even my communist friends have always behaved impeccably.”
His wet eyes were cloudy.
“Don’t make hasty decisions.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
You'll break my heart if you leave the university."
I was exhausted by constant trips to London and my emotional defenses were weakened.
My friend, also a conservative, could not stand the pressure and gave up his beliefs.
The next week during the seminar, when the next history teacher called me “the enemy of the people,” I decided to do the same.
Burning in my soul with shame, I confessed that “my parents brains were washed away” and called them “old fools.”
The inhalation was short.
The last nail in the cover of the grave of my career in Oxford was destined to kill my father.
At the time, he wrote two columns each week for publications belonging to Rupert Murdoch.
My door was locked.
I did not go out, and after five minutes my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I picked up my suitcase and boarded the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a squirrel and a squirrel.
But at the age of eighteen, no one should become the object of such anger and intimidation in an educational institution.
Even sadder, it was Oxford, who not only released fourteen tory prime ministers, but still hides behind the unearned reputation of the university, in which equality and freedom of thought are valued.
“Valentino prefers elegance to fame.”
About the exhibition "Valentino: Master of Sewing", which opened this week in London, ABC talks with Nati Abascal, Fiona Tissen-Bornemics and other famous clients of the Italian designer
The Somerset House, the former residence of Queen Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
The designer acknowledged this during the opening of Valentino: Master of Sewing, a triumphant retrospective exhibition that brings together more than 130 high fashion dresses created by his "home" over the past 50 years.
“I love this palace,” he says with his unparalleled Italian accent.
This exhibition is the final part of the story, the only character of which - "or the Signor" Garavani, but it could not be written without his famous clients.
Valentino has always felt enchanted by the rare and distant world of knowing.
In the first hall of this exhibition, open until March 3, are filled with personal letters and photographs signed by the most noble aristocrats, from Princess Salima Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, including Marie-Santal, Princess of Greece, and Margaret, Princess of Wales.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social uplift: from the modest porter from the city of Voghera in the north of Italy to the idol of the international "elite".
Being in love with the royal court - there's nothing wrong with that.
“They don’t at least put their cigarettes out of your great carpet, as some great pop stars do,” says Baroness Fiona Tissen-Bornemicsa.
In the 1960s and 70s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a wonderful host and welcomes guests with generosity and elegance.
“We all really enjoyed coming to his chalet in Gstaad,” explains ex-wife Heini Tissen, a close friend of forgotten beauties like Marella Anelli or Eugenia Niarhos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to fame.
And yet, he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, representing Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Mozza is reminiscent of a charismatic model.
One day we went to dinner at his home, it was after showing the fashion in the square of Spain in Rome, many years ago.
Among the 20 guests were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy, the youngest.
Valentino's style was manifested in everything - in every detail of his apartment, in its decor, in food, in music.
“Each of the guests made Valentino feel important and loved,” recalls the “top model”, whose work with the model began in 1995 during the Week of High Fashion in Paris.
“He never goes out of fashion because his sketches are real works of art,” she concludes.
Parade of the Ancestry
The life of Garavani is not a story of obsessions, but of love with complete reciprocity.
He loves people with good education and high titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries of the Somerset-house was converted into a glamorous podium of sixty meters in length, which offers a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and has to defile the podium, contemplating the "viewers" of the skeletons, which shine with the masterpieces of Valentino, such as
In this audience, the models shine names such as Sibilla Luxembourg, Gloria von Turn und Taxis, Mette-Marit from Norway, Rosario from Bulgaria or Sofia Habsburg.
Nati Abbascal and model, in 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentine is like the first love, "it is impossible to forget."
I remember him well.
These were pants, shirt, jacket and jacket from the autumn-winter collection 1971-1972.
“It was a gift he gave me,” said Nati Abascal, one of the designer’s museums.
“I prefer him to the rest because of his femininity, because of his great love for women, because he emphasizes our beauty,” the former Duchess de Ferria added.
I really like the colors he uses: they have a lot of light and they "fit" his face.
Proportions are ideal.
The princess and fashion lawmaker Patricia della Jovampaola d'Arenberg can't forget the first time she dressed in Valentino.
When I was a teenager and I lived in Italy, I dreamed that I would have the age and the reason to wear one of his evening toilets...
Finally came that hour in the late 1990s.
I bought my first dress from Valentino to wear it for a holiday at the castle of my cousin, Prince Edward de Lynn.
It was a red dress, with a skirt with ribs, a "corsage" in the fold and a cut without straps.
“It was a dream that became a phenomenon,” says the widow of Rodrigo d’Arenberg.
“Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his passion is timeless,” explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d’Arenberg keeps her holiday dresses from a model with “maximum caution... because the dress is not just a dress, it’s also a set of memories that accompany it.”
The "King" of Fashion
The grand finale of the exhibition at the Somerset House is the Marie-Santal Miller wedding dress for her wedding to Pavlos of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "girls" (as the designer calls their sewing) to make this outfit out of ivory silk with a pearl inlay, twelve kinds of different lace and a four-and-a-half-meter loop.
According to journalist Susie Menkes, the highest authority of the specialized press, the dress represents the epoch of high fashion of the end of the twentieth century, "the return of customers from the upper world."
Destroyed for many years by the "lifestyle" of the elite, Valentino himself is now her best representative.
The Knight of the Grand Cross (sign of distinction of the highest rank in Italy), the Knight of Labor, the Commander of the Order of Arts and Literacy, awarded with the Order of the Legion of Honour, Garavani collected as many honors as any of the spouses of his clients.
“My attention has always been drawn to his delicacy, his calmness, his neat and impeccable appearance,” recalls d’Arenberg.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a festive dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was sitting at the table with Countess Jacqueline de Ribe, my great friend.
“He was incorrigible, time does not exist for him.”
If that's what the princess says...
The hardest profession in the world: miners with Kawach-Idjana
For four euros, Indonesian miners risk life and health by dragging 70 kilograms of sulfur to the top of a volcano along steep rocky trails
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others literally work in hell.
Among them is Anto Vijaya, one of 400 miners who earn a living from sulfur mining in the Kawach-Idzhen volcano, located in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Every day Anto descends to the very bottom of the crater, where sulfur gas rising from the depths of the Earth freezes in contact with air.
Scraping huge pieces of sulfur, the total weight of which can reach 70 kg, he puts them in two bamboo baskets, rolls baskets on his shoulders, and carries them up a shattered stone road.
To the summit of the volcano, which is 2,386 meters high, only 250 meters, but heavy loaders take more than 40 minutes to climb a turtle step, hardly holding the balance and carefully tapping the road to not get down.
They know that one wrong step could cost them their lives, as it did a tourist from France who collapsed a few years ago from the cliffs of Kawach-Igen.
Miners from Kawach-Igen earn 5 eurocent for every kilogram of sulfur they mine
Upon reaching the top, they pave the road between the tourists who photograph them as if they were monkeys from the circus and, tired of carrying heavy baskets, walk three kilometers to the weights, which the mining company placed just above 50, at a height of 1.8.
This is Kandi Ngrimbi, a company that has been operating this volcano since 1960 and, better yet, its workers, who are paying 662 Indonesian rupees (5 eurocents) for every kilogram of sulfur.
It then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 eurocent) to petrochemical production, because this mineral is common in everyday life and is used to make spikes, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to bleach sugar.
“Just as the norm is the transfer of 70 kilograms, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each move,” explains Anto, who usually performs three daily transfers.
He spends three hours on each of them and in the end feels broken, but they allow him to accumulate 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) by the end of the day.
Although this seems miserable for such an inhuman effort, it is three times more than he would earn in the field.
"The salary paid to miners is very high according to local measures, where the collection of coffee is paid 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day and the average monthly salary is equal to two million rupees (167 euros) ", - explains the trucker, who previously worked as a quarry on the tour.
There his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the plot was not so heavy, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a town near the volcano, for a good reason that it was from Ishwa, which in Indonesia is as crumbling as the bass, "I married to the sulfur.
Anto has asthma, he breathes hard, coughs constantly, and his eyes go down because of toxic gases.
At the age of 27, Anto spent three years risking himself in Kawach-Igen, whose sulfur has already begun to affect him despite the presence of masks and special glasses.
He has asthma, he breathes hard, coughs constantly, and his eyes are tearing because of the toxic gases that the volcano releases.
This is the price he has to pay to achieve his dream.
“I’m going to work another two years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French,” he said in more than acceptable English.
Punished by life, this nice and smart young man could be a tour guide, waiter or porter in a hotel, but instead he does the job of a mule.
Sharing a dirty wooden hut with other carriers, he gets up every day at two o’clock in the night, because the sulfur does not stop flowing out at night, when its characteristic yellow color turns blue and shines in the dark.
Challenging the shadows, Anto descends into the crater, illuminating his way with a small lantern attached to his helmet, which he bought for his money.
About 400 Carriers Throw Grey Baskets On Their Shoulders From The Bottom Of The Volcano
Despite the high profits, the mining company has not mechanized the production of sulfur to save costs and does not provide any equipment to carriers who work at their own expense and with such deprivations.
In fact, they don’t even get a portion of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) photo shoot fee, which, along with an entrance ticket for 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), the guards of this reserve charge from tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its people-smugglers.
“It’s a job for cattle, not humans,” says Badrusin, a 42-year-old root-carrier who has spent three decades at Kawach-Igen since leaving college.
Able to lift up to 110 kilograms, he assures that he will tolerate the work "as much as he can" because he needs money to educate his three children between the ages of 18 and 10.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although sulfur burns the throat and burns the eyes, when the wind suddenly changes and catches the miners in dense columns of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so bearable that no one complains about the skeletons and the skeletons of their grave diseases.
By balancing the basket on the back, Uninik can now only lift 50 kilograms in its 53 years.
Every day he and his comrades carry 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which the three trucks transport to the warehouse in Tamansari, overcoming a distance of 18 kilometers on a narrow path amid the floods.
“I’m not going to retire, I’m going to die here because the volcano is my whole life,” Unaninik said, opening a mouth that lacks several teeth.
Of his five children, the older, 30, also works as a sulfur carrier.
Time passes, but poverty perpetuates from generation to generation one of the most difficult occupations in the world: what human mules from Kawach-Idjana do.
Singapore is looking for children to save the economy
Singaporeans blame careers, stress, and prices for housing and education in the absence of children.
“The population of Singapore needs to grow.”
I'm a patriot's husband, you're my patriot's wife, let's do our civil duty and create life!
It may seem unbelievable that these lines are part of mint advertising, but despite this – or possibly because of this – this video became a hit on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
These phrases are part of the rap, which uses local sayings like "Let's put the bao (bulku) in the oven" to laugh at Singapore's birth rate.
The advertising agency that made this video, BBH, hopes that with the help of advertising they will be able to attract attention to this problem in an entertaining form.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to get people to do “their national duty.”
This thing is exclusively for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
This is the main problem in the country.
We are the worst in the world to reproduce like ourselves, so we felt that this is the topic that we need to touch on.
We knew that the government was trying to do a lot, such as launching ghosts with pheromones or organizing parties for quick dating.
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but they didn’t necessarily work.
So we thought, why don't we do the most creative thing possible to solve this problem, namely to compose rap?
1.2 Children's
Whoever doesn’t take it so lightly is the government of Singapore.
It spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
The state package for married couples and parents provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity and maternity leave and provides tax benefits.
But all of this has a low efficiency.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for its conservatism of leadership and its strict social control.
The birth rate in Singapore, according to its national population management, is currently at the level of 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was below 2 - what is known as the percentage of substitution - in 1976.
So why don't Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Min, director of the Department of Policy for Spouses and Families of the National Population Administration, says the reason is “improved education” and “a wider range of career opportunities.”
“This has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, in addition to marriage and family building,” she explains.
These changes in social norms contribute to the increase in the number of singles and the postponement of marriages and child births, resulting in a decrease in the rate of birth in Singapore.
Meanwhile, the immigration policy, which is aimed at a sharp increase in immigration in order to counter population declines, is causing outrage among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where hardly-hidden xenophobia thrives against many new immigrants, especially Chinese, who are criticised for keeping salaries low and unwilling to integrate.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons that last year the ruling party of Singapore got the worst result in the elections since independence.
After the election, there was an attempt to solve the problem, with quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the decline in fertility has a certain impact on the nation’s economic growth, tax revenues, medical expenses, and immigration policy, Singapore’s example is also beginning to have some unexpected consequences.
The government is making efforts to prevent the construction of such small housing.
For example, this has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The Guide to Urban Development has shifted to controlling the number of small apartments known as the “shoe box” that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments with an area of 46 square meters are sold very well.
However, there is an opinion that they can contribute to a vacant lifestyle and deprive the incentive of developers who want to build a large family home.
But Lim Yu Sun, the CEO of home building firm EL Developers, says their “shoe boxes” sell much faster than more spacious copies.
They are more popular, in the sense that such apartments are bought for a few days, even a week, faster than larger apartments.
As a result, our cash revenues are increasing.
However, he acknowledges that the new rules provide clearer guidelines for developers who were previously put in charge if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in the project.
Excessively Tensed
Singapore is a city-state.
While these new rules may be a step towards increasing national fertility, after talking to Singaporeans who work in the center’s financial district, it seems they won’t have a particular effect.
“People are very overstressed, housing is expensive, as is education, and that’s why many people put it off,” says the young manager.
Other people may have children.
“But it’s important for me to have my own money and time,” says another 20-year-old.
Men and women mention their careers, stress, and prices for housing and education as reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, no matter how the government tries to encourage its citizens to give birth to children, with regard to childbirth, the last word remains for Singaporeans.
Personally Offline - Personally Online
Confidentiality.
According to the dictionary of the Royal Academy of the Spanish language, it is a property of private or "a sphere of personal life that is entitled to be protected from any interference".
What is personal for a minor under the age of 16?
How does he apply this definition in his daily life and on social media?
Does he understand the dangers he is exposed to when discussing situations on the Internet that would certainly not have been shared outside the Internet?
ElPeri<0xC3><0xB3>dico interviewed five children aged 10 to 15, frequent users of the network.
In four cases, they associated the term with "something very my own," in a personal sense, and "password and user name," when they applied it to social networks.
“My biggest secrets I wouldn’t post,” says 10-year-old Jorge when he tries to explain the importance of personal on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he’s had accounts for two years.
“It’s very secretive, my mom might know them, but not the whole world,” he says.
On FB I upload beautiful pictures or pictures from games.
I’m also having fun with my friends.
“I wouldn’t share a photo that isn’t mine, or someone who’s acting stupid,” he says.
The boy realizes that it is bad to post indecent photos of naked people, crimes, or write offensive or angry comments.
Jorge says he knows 35 friends he has on FB and nine of his followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
The mother knows she has a password to one of the accounts.
I started Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I'm just loading them," he adds.
“Social networks are entertainment, I can talk to distant relatives or to my friends more quickly,” he said.
Without thinking, he replies that he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
I wouldn't count on someone to recommend it to a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old Jose is different.
The teenager has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and the latter admits that he does not know 20 people added to his list of friends.
“It doesn’t scare me because we have something in common, music, for example,” he said.
According to the boy, no one rubbed him in confidence and did not ask for his home address or phone number.
“If they press me or demand me, I’ll just remove them from my account,” he admits.
Jose became a Ask follower after reading the recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is not a stranger to the experience of what is now known as cyberbombing.
A friend of mine was blackmailed on social media.
He was threatened and demanded money.
“He never knew who it was,” he said.
The victim, Jose said, did not delete the account.
“I just turned on the privacy.”
It then explains the sequence of steps to set up the account in a secure way.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would have uploaded photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or confusing situations.
Yeah, I'd do it if I didn't like people or if I wanted to.
“Although I know it’s cyberbobbing,” he confirms.
Key Issues <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Marielos Porras, an English teacher and education specialist, believes that in order to guide children and adolescents, it is necessary to understand that the purpose of social media is to inform.
"The Internet appeared as a means of finding information, but with the appearance of these sites changed the rules of the game," she notes.
Porras points out that academic Mark Prensky, a master of pedagogy at Yale University and author of Digital Aboriginals and Immigrants, invented these terms to explain this phenomenon.
Digital Aborigines are those, children and young people, who were born in the age of technology.
“We’re digital immigrants who have to teach them while we’re still learning ourselves,” she says.
He explains that this topic is complicated, “because we ask them to have a certain criterion of what can or cannot be distributed, published or spoken at an age when maturity is not enough for that.”
“Also that they are elective, while the most important thing for them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences,” she adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to show what privacy is to children and adolescents is to ask questions that make them think.
“Telling them not to do it is useless,” she adds.
Then Porras lists some options: there are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger, so why do you do it online?
Or, would you like to be published in a photo of you like the one you posted about your friend?
Do you know what others are posting about you?
When you sign photos from a party, do you ask other people’s permissions to mark them?
Do you want everyone to know what you’re doing at all times?
Another point is to let them understand that they should behave online in the same way that they do offline.
The rules are the same.
“Outside the Internet, a person behaves with respect, responsibility and other principles, and so should be on social media,” she says.
Vigilance
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, professor of primary education and education consultant, explains the need for family heads to read social media policies in good faith.
Understanding each of the points, they have good reasons to talk to children about the prerequisites for opening an account online.
“For example, age and what is allowed to distribute or publish,” he says.
According to Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>, the key question is to remind children of the lesson "do not talk to strangers".
UNASUR Summit ends without the release of the Lima Declaration
The 6th Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) ended today in Peru without the release of the Lima Declaration, previously declared by the family and theoretically signed by the obligatory members.
Efe has repeatedly tried to gain access to the document signed at the VI Ordinary Assembly of Heads of State and Government of UNASUR, but sources from the Office and the President’s Administration indicated on the main page that it will be handed over to the Government after the closure, but then confirmed that it will be made public at some point.
When asked about the text, they indicated that the content was presented by the President of Peru, Ollanta Umala, during brief statements to the press.
Journalists’ access to information about the Summit was limited at all times.
During the day, only a video of the presidential assembly was broadcast in the press room without sound with the message "closed meeting, sound is prohibited".
A small amount of information circulated among reporters was conveyed by the press secretaries of some UNASUR Governments who were present at the meeting, but not Peruvian.
The only document circulated during the day was a list of participating presidents, causing dissatisfaction among hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who asked for more information.
Subsequently, the Peruvian Presidential Administration sent an electronic media message with the summit’s “final declaration”, but it is about Umala’s statement, not the official document that ended the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third Summit of South American and Arab Countries (ASPA), and this time, despite the insistence of the press, the so-called Lim Declaration, which was previously announced, was also not circulated.
On the official website of ASPA, you can check that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities tried to provide transmission systems for all journalists, but limited access to information as much as possible.
The summit also concluded with a joint decision by Chile and Peru to adopt a judgment of the Hague Court, which will settle the territorial dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Umala, and Chile, Sebastian Piniera, met at a regional meeting and ratified that they would comply with the decision of the International Court of Justice, which begins Monday in The Hague to hear statements of both sides, as part of the charge against Lima.
“We will abide by and enforce a decision that will clarify the differences that we are presently presenting in this international court,” Umala said, alongside his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has been, is, and will be, a country that respects international law, peaceful settlement of disputes, pacts and international tribunals," he added, and welcomed Umalu's hand on the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation by both presidents that they will submit to the International Court of Justice came just after Colombia protested this week the Bogota Pact, according to which it recognized its submission to the judgements of the International Court of Justice following the decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which it said was not the case.
The summit was held in the absence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chavez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Kristina Kirshner.
Paraguay, whose membership in UNASUR has been suspended since 2011 after the impeachment of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Umala, was responsible for opening the discussions in the morning and closing the summit, just later in the afternoon at Limsk time.
The Head of State read the outcome document, in which he said that 16 agreements were adopted and approved directions of action for 31 projects among South American countries, the amount of the proposed investment amounted to 17 billion dollars.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that UNASUR countries will take “important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, for which we are expanding the residency agreement.”
He said that action is being taken to improve “cooperation in the fight against citizens’ insecurity and against organized transnational crime, actions to increase the availability of medicines, inexpensive internet access in all corners of South America’s eco-friendly areas and take into account the cumulative and efficacious risks.”
As Europe is in crisis, “economic unification (Latin America) should not have a triumphant basis, but should serve to expand our production base and foresee a better future for our cities,” Umala added.
“We have decided to give privileges to a group of 31 landmark projects that will improve the connectivity of South America’s areas, especially in rural and border zones ... by uniting our countries and forming new economic schemes,” the Peruvian president said in a statement.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five relate to Peru, and are limited to the transverse axes in its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two are aimed at greater liaison with Ecuador, but he did not provide further details.
The final document also touched on the political situation in Paraguay.
“We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve to rejoin the Union of South American Nations,” from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, to be united, and to have good relations between neighbours, was another theme underlined at the summit.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said before taking part in a regional meeting that he hopes to meet with his Nicaraguan counterpart Daniel Ortega, the Osama bin Laden on Saturday in Mexico City to hold talks in a respectful form on the sea.
“The next day (Saturday) I may meet with President Daniel Ortega,” Santos said.
“We will reconsider all these paths, they are not mutually exclusive, including the Nicaraguan pact will require discussions with Nicaragua,” he said.
"With President Ortega, I hope to be able to tell him that we will deal with this as civilized and respectfully as possible," Santos said.
Santos and Ortega will meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they are scheduled to attend the inauguration of the new president of the country, Enrique Penia Nieto.
Also within the framework of the summit, the bloc’s defence ministers met in advance to approve the 2013 Plan of Action, which is aimed at strengthening dialogue and consensus on the protection of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay form UNASUR, although the participation of the latter of the countries has been suspended.
Peru has a temporary presidency in the regional bloc.
“South America must learn from Europe in terms of integration of citizenship” – Rafael Correa
Ecuador’s president, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is the goal in which “South America, in this case, yes, must learn from Europe.”
Correa, who participated in the 6th Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), held in Lima, told state television Peru that the Europeans "killed each other during World War II" and in other clashes, "but now they are almost the same."
He defended, in this context, the draft establishment of South American citizenship, which was approved by UNASUR member countries.
“We need to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already the case with members of the Andean community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want to bring us back to the past,” he said.
The President of Ecuador has also expressed support for the resumption of the Organization of American States (OAS) on the premise of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account those who signed the San Jose Covenant on Human Rights.
Those who read the lectures never take on any commitments, and we, the South Americans, on the contrary, sign everything.
"It is inexplicable that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington and is funded by the United States," he said, referring to the political asylum given by Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa said he did not regret the decision because he did not betray his principles with him, but respected his “deep values of democracy and human rights.”
He added that at the time "there were certain suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and the process would not be followed."
He also criticised the Swedish judiciary for demanding to come to its territory for interrogation regarding the alleged crime on sexual grounds, while “only Swedish law considers it possible to implement it in the course of a video conference that could be done.”
Correa confirmed that there is a risk of deteriorating Assange’s physical and mental health.
"I haven't spoken to him since he arrived at our embassy, but the ambassador told me that he had a small lung problem, nothing serious," the Ecuadorian head of state said.
What there really is is the danger of deteriorating his physical and mental health due to tightening in a small space without being able to do exercise in the air.
“It affects everyone’s health,” he added.
Correa pointed out that the solution to the asylum problem provided to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, through the provision of a guarantee of inviolability that will allow him to go to the Lonchean, the solutions to the problems are in the hands of the UK, Sweden and European courts.
We do not negotiate human rights, we do not use the word in this case, but there have been constant discussions.
“The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the European judicial authorities, because Assange’s lawyer, Baltasar Garson, is conducting a number of trials in various European courts,” he said.
He said: “If the UK gives a guarantee of inviolability tomorrow, it will be over.”
And if Sweden, as perfectly permitted by its legislation and as it has already done in other cases, will question Mr. Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London or question him via Skype, tomorrow the problem will be exhausted.
Correa took the opportunity to express himself as a defender of freedom of the press and stressed that he does not tolerate “mediocrity, infidelity and lies that distort freedom of expression.”
“The main enemies of freedom of the press are not corrupt politicians, but bad journalists who support bribery, blackmail and extortion,” he said.
In this regard, he remained satisfied that neither these journalists, nor the bankers, nor the bourgeois hegemony do not prevail in Ecuador, and added that, being re-elected, he would “deepen the revolution to continue development in the right direction.”
Correa also supported the decision to keep Paraguay's veto at UNASUR at least until the next election, arguing that the organization "should be firm and not tolerate opportunism and support for coups under the mask of legality", because in reality "it destroyed the law".
The Ecuadorian president also considered the desire of his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos to now negotiate with Nicaragua on the maritime borders between the two countries after the decision of the International Maritime Court of Justice (ICC) in The Hague.
At the moment, this decision is not being followed.
This is a problem between South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the desire to go together.
We need to work with them together to overcome them and keep moving forward.
He also expressed hope for a good conclusion of the maritime border dispute, which is held in the same court of Peru and Chile, and said that "it is right for Latin America to appeal to international bodies if the two countries undertake to make a decision, no matter how difficult it may be."
Regarding the possibility of acting as a candidate in the forthcoming presidential election in Ecuador to run for a third term in a row, he pointed out that he considers this opportunity "with great optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite difficult."
Correa assured that if he lost the election in February 2013, he would be out of public life.
Personally, I have never been interested in power, but in such unfair situations as in Ecuador, socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
“My political movement felt that it was I who guaranteed this probable victory, so I have to acknowledge this responsibility,” he said.
In the event of a victory, this would be my last term as president, and then we will leave public life.
If we lose, the same thing.
“This is a decision,” he said.
Correa also mentioned a new course of treatment for Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
I just spoke to Venezuelan Vice President Nicolas Maduro, who told me that he went to a treatment that was already planned, routine, and that he is expected to miss the campaign to return to Cuba.
“This does not mean that President Chavez’s health is deteriorating,” he said.
The Head of State of Ecuador participated today in Lima at the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which ended with calls for greater regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
AIDS Mortality Today - The Result of Late Diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21 when he was announced that his analysis of AIDS had given a positive result.
"I feel like I'm deafened," he recalls that difficult moment, despite the whole beat of the doctor.
The young man hid it from his family.
Having decided to cope with the disease on his own, he wanted to know about it as much as possible. And his efforts were justified - he has already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
Fabrizio is one of the "oldest" patients of the HIV department of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), where he arrived in 1994, overcoming many obstacles.
He has been living with the diagnosis of "human immunodeficiency virus" (HIV) for 22 years. In the early 90s it would be difficult to believe - too few treatment options existed then, too little knew about the disease, too prejudicially treated the pain.
So, even the director of the clinic of the Mexican Institute of Social Protection did not want to say goodbye to him, "because he had a cut."
In other words, at that time, having AIDS was a sentence.
It is now possible to survive this syndrome and do so without deteriorating the quality of life.
However, not knowing about their illness, many people still come when the virus has already caused damage, “destroyed” their immune system, and they suffer from opportunistic infections.
31 years after the advent of AIDS in the world, at least after the first reported cases, "the greatest achievement at the moment is that the survival of a patient who begins treatment in a timely manner, and the survival of the general population in the year is the same," - said the head of HIV, H.C.
Infectionist and expert on HIV/AIDS, Andrade Vilyanueva explained that since 2008 the scientists have concluded that AIDS is not a conviction, but the duration and quality of life of the disease depends on the degree of damage to the immune system, the disease in the patients.
Simply put, the above means that anyone who is diagnosed with HIV-positive at the age of 25, according to these terms, “supporting control, will be able to live without problems up to 75 years,” he explained.
To assess this progress, it should be remembered that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
Although mortality has declined significantly in recent years, in Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS has fallen from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that since the onset of AIDS, 60 per cent of the population has been infected with AIDS.
In Khalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and there have been 187 deaths as of May this year; however, there has been widespread access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- Why are there still fatalities?
- Personally, I don't think the problem is access to treatment.
So I can imagine it, that's the way things are in our hospital.
For at least the last 12 years we have not had a shortage of medication, the problem is that patients come very late because they do not know about their infected condition, that is, in the later stages of the disease.
He brought up the overwhelming data: "Nine out of ten patients come when they already have some opportunistic infection; what needs to be done to have a greater impact on the overall mortality is to make a diagnosis for people at an earlier stage in mass, and therefore it is necessary to provide samples for testing."
In his proposal, the experts and officials of the State Council for the Prevention of AIDS in Halisco (COESIDA), as well as the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who applied for the examination in his own private laboratory, have agreed.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die, and they don't want to know anything.
"If I die anyway, I'd better get dressed three times a week," they say. But not in my case.
There are positive changes, I eat well, do exercise, take medication.
To this day, his parents only know that he suffered from cancer.
I live a normal life like any other.
"I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I lead an active sex life, but with mutual responsibility, I take care of myself and the other person," Fabrizio, who has agreed to share his personal life with them, is happy.
Let them check if there was a risk of infection, let them know as soon as possible if they are HIV-positive, so better, and if they already have a diagnosis, let them know that they can live like any other person, being responsible.
This message summarises the theme of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the shelf
There is a huge gap between health programs and an ordinary citizen, says Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who dealt with the HIV-related problem.
And the biggest one is prevention.
“In places dedicated to this task, the distribution of condoms actually increased, we were given one or two before, now we are given packets for hundreds, and that’s very good, but it turns out that there are some who still don’t have access to a condom,” he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are teens.
"Why are they you?" is a popular question, with ecstasy and condemnation, from social workers, school consultants, pharmacy employees and health workers who do not want to hear teenagers, the propagandist assured.
I propose to change this inefficient distribution; that condoms are not just behind the shelves and that hundreds of them are in vending machines in public toilets in places that young people often visit.
This is not an encouragement to dissolve.
It is not about the payment of beer and motel, Governor Emilio Gonzales replied when asked if it is possible to distribute condoms under his leadership.
"It's not sexuality, it's best to make condoms available to those who already practice sexual activity," he said.
Key data in Halisco
There were 13,435 total cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state ranks 4th in the national ranking for new and total cases of AIDS and 13th in HIV.
92% of infections are related to the sexual pathway, 6% through the blood and 2% to the perinatal pathway.
It is estimated that 50,000 people can live with HIV, since there are 4 to 5 people who do not know about it for one recorded case.
Considering the ratification by the United States Court of Appeal of the decision that annuls the restructuring of the debt of the Vitro Group, achieved through competitive production in Mexico, the scenario that has a problem-solving capacity sets a year-long precedent for any national company with a fiat.
It seems that the procedures in support of the survival of firms, which are permitted by Mexican laws, are not valid in the country of stripes and stars, contrary to international agreements.
In practice, judge Harlin Hale’s June 15 ruling in the bankruptcy court in northern Texas leaves Mexican firms defenseless in the face of the possibility of imposing arrest on their property on the other side of Rio Grande.
The ruling, however, opens the door to the leading glass producer in Mexico for referral to the United States Supreme Court, proving three inconsistencies.
As an entry, while the case judge notes that creditors must be regulated by the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the Fifth District Court of Appeals, located in New Orleans, says the main proceedings relate to the competitive proceedings under consideration in Mexico.
The first paragraph entails the annulment of international judicial cooperation in cases of insolvency of transnational corporations.
In fact, for this purpose, the United Nations Standard Law on the Unification of International Trade Law was created, defining as an arbitrator the American Institute of Law.
Secondly, the judgment establishes that without an inter-company vote, the debts recognised in the critical mass of competitive production that had before the parent company of the Vitro subsidiary, would not have been achieved by the majority necessary for the approval of the restructuring.
However, this possibility is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro was not the first case when this scheme was adopted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose inter-company debts were guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Competitive Manufacturing.
It is also true that deducting the votes of the affiliates, somehow the Vitro creditors who fought against him in the courts of the United States, namely the “wreckers” funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have reached the top.
The vote would be 45 per cent against 37.
The Court of Appeal lowers this data.
On the other hand, he accuses Vitro of the difficult situation that it has faced since 2008, affected by the severe economic crisis that has hit the United States, inflicting blows on the country.
So far, the firm of the family Gonzales Sada will appeal the decision in the court of appeal itself, so that the vote reaches his prison, that is, five judges, due to the fact that only three voted.
In the event of failure, an application for a certificate will be filed, which will require a review of the proceedings by the Supreme Court, in this case the Supreme Court of the United States.
Worst of all, the court rejected a document sent by the Mexican government in the role of amicus curiae ("second court") describing the process followed by Vitro under the Competition Act, signaling that the U.S. should notify the court that it is exempting itself from compliance with the agreements signed by the banks.
In addition, it is noted that the country has complied with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, that is, rules established for cases of interstate insolvency that guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
Carambola from two sides: they beat the Vitro and beat the country.
Total Balance Sheet
Given the several months-delayed complaints placed on the table by the Mexicana de Aviaci<0xC3><0xB3>n trade unions against the former owner of the company, Gaston Ascarrag Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent management, the trade union pilots' association of aviators has already found out.
The body headed by Carlos Diaz Chavez Morino has just filed a criminal case against the National Commission on Banks and Securities, which is accused of obstructing justice.
Accordingly, the supervisory authority systematically refused to report to the Prosecutor General ' s Office on the transaction carried out by the entrepreneur to withdraw 198 million pesos from the trust fund of IXE Bank F/589 on behalf of Mexicana Airlines.
Resources would be directed to the purchase of shares in the Professional Hotel Management Company.
As you know, Ascarraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Surrounded by Dragon Mart
A group of local and foreign ecologists, scientists, businessmen, and members of the general civil society, meeting at a forum at the Caribbean University, approved the creation of a broad front to counter the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
We are talking, as you know, about a giant sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean countries of the isolated country’s products, with a residential area close to 150 companies’ employees.
Previously, Canacintra managed to unite the governors of the southeastern zone to confront the monumental forces, which flattened part of the protected territories from the ground and pose serious threats to the industry.
Death of ACTA
Regarding the government’s rejection of the Senate’s request to explain the circumstances and circumstances under which the Mexican ambassador to Japan signed the Trade Agreement against Counterfeiting, known as the abbreviation in English ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property.
As you know, the action was carried out despite the fact that the Senate itself disqualified the possibility of viewing it as a violation of freedom of expression on social media.

Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
Busy basketball traveler Hector "Hetin" Reyes has been associated with this sport for more than 60 years and, thanks to him, has travelled the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico remember as many basketball stories as Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
In fact, before a brain hemorrhage tied him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes had been immersed in sports for more than 60 years, as a small-tier player, a player of the Higher Basketball League, a delegate and the head of the BSN with the Cowboys.
"I've played many roles in basketball throughout my life, including several at the same time as when I was president of BSN, general manager of the National team and president of the federation in the 1990s," he recalled during his visit to Primera Hora.
“Basketball was my life.
Reyes does not exaggerate by making this claim.
The walls of his house, almost all of them decorated with photographs and memorabilia collected for his long journey, testify to this.
Bayamon in the heart
With the greatest emotions, he retains those who remember his way through the Cowboys, starting in the mid-50s as a player until 1982, when he turned 15 years of acting as a co-agent or contract agent.
“These were my best years I enjoyed the most because I had the opportunity to be part of eight Cowboy Championships since 1967, as an agent, co-agent or manager.
There were many years of joy, including five championships, which took place from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, the year that Jerome Minsy made his BSN debut.
From that moment on, Kuko Ortis, who was a great administrator, was still in charge,” Reyes said.
I remember Gene Bartow, who was heading here and at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), telling me, "I have a very strong player for you, 6'7."
"Would you?"
And that was the beginning of Minsi, one of the best players in Puerto Rico.
Bartov then recommended sniper Raymond Gauss, who was granted citizenship and became one of our best bombers.
I remember saying that if Minsy brought the championship to Bayamon, Gauss would help win another one.
I enjoyed the Cowboy Championship with Gauss, but already at a distance, because by 1988 he was already the head of the federation.
At the time, I preferred to enjoy Minsy’s achievements and achievements in the national team.
I remember how we won the first time in the United States during the Olympic qualifying tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we got fourth place and it was supposed to be bronze, if not the Canadian judge who made us play the final game again, Reyes said.
Is that team from the 1990 World Cup the best team you've ever seen?
She is among the best, as well as the one that won the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was that since the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and beat the U.S. team, which was pretty similar to the one that won the bronze at the World Cup.
In that team not only played again Minsy, Gauss, Ramon Rivas, Fico Lopez and 'Piculina' (Ortis), but also young (Havier) 'Tonito' Col<0xC3><0xB3>n and James Carter, the Travisa brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario 'Kichote' 90 with Morales.
The team, which may not have been the best in terms of personnel, but brought us a gold medal and great joy, was the team of the 1995 Olympic Qualifying Tournament in Neuquen, Argentina.
With role-playing players like 'Canito' Newves, Pablo Alicia and young Rolando Hurruitner in exchange for players temporarily eliminated for the disorder in the Pan American Mar del Plata Championship, we won gold against all odds.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without a doubt, it was Piculin Ortis.
His performance in international tournaments is impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico dominated this level the way Piculin did.
And that doesn't matter his career in the different leagues he played in.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It's a very complicated question.
We had a very good young man, including Julio Toro, Flora Melendez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
From a young age, I really like the work of Leo Arilla.
What do you think is your main achievement in the federation?
Participation in the most glorious era of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and that in the early 1990s BSN had up to 17 teams per season.
What do you have to do?
There were things I wanted to do, for example, regionalization of smaller categories.
For example, that the boys from Pons play only in their area and only against teams from other parts of the island in the national play-offs.
Now the kids are traveling and playing too much, and that's too much.
At least, I see the fruits of mandatory certification and coursework for managers, officials and judges.
It's a pleasure for me.
What are you doing now?
Most of all, I listen to music, watch music videos of my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren, and occasionally go to basketball games.
And, of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Icabel, who has always been with me.
The late actor Larry Hagman.
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931 in Fort Worth, Texas, became world-famous for his leading role as John Ross Young, better known as "J.R.", in the television series "Dallas", in which he embodied a businessman without principles.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oil robber J.R. Ying in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in the new season of Dallas, died Friday evening of complications caused by cancer, according to a family statement provided to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., a Dallas production studio.
"Larry has returned to his beloved hometown of Dallas, playing the iconic role he liked the most," his family said in a statement.
Larry’s family and close friends were with him in Dallas at a Thanksgiving party.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original series and the sequel, was next to Hegman when he died in a Dallas hospital, her spokesman Jeffrey Lane said.
He brought joy to everyone who knew him.
He was creative, generous, cheerful, kind and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived a full life," Gray said in a statement.
Hegman was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver in 1992 and he admitted to drinking for many years.
In 1995, he was diagnosed with a malignant tumour in his liver, and he underwent a transplant.
Long before Dallas, Hagman gained fame on television due to the role of a decent type in the light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie", which was broadcast on NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it, he played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life changes when he meets an attractive gin girl played by Barbara Eden, and begins living with her under one roof.
He was also the main character in two comedies that rarely appeared on the air, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His film work included critically acclaimed roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his workshop interpretation of the admirably disgusting J.R. that brought Hagman to the top of fame.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing Clan and other characters around it aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertising slogan "Who shot J.R.?", designed to create noise around the episode, full of emotions, in which the character of Hegman is almost killed, spawned international discussions and millions of dollars risked in bookmakers' accounts.
It also helped to attract a record audience to the series at the time.
When the response was given in the November 1980 episode, an average of 41 million viewers watched it and turned Dallas into the second-largest entertainment program in history, after the 1983 MASH finale, which attracted 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s stepmother, Christine (played by Mary Crosby), who shot him.
J.R. stopped her and then threatened to accuse her of prostitution if she didn't get out of town, but others had reason to attack him, too.
Hegman played Yuing as an unsatisfied corrupter with a charismatic smile: an dishonest entrepreneur and an unfaithful husband who wanted his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Grey), to be put on treatment.
“I know what must be on the J.R. gravestone,” Hagman said in 1988.
It must be said, "Here rests the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
It's the only deal he's ever lost.
Victoria Principal, also the heroine of the original series, recalled on Friday Hegman as someone "giant, both on and off the screen".
It is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of fans around the world, and in the hearts of each of us who have been lucky enough to know and love it.
Ten episodes of the new release of "Dallas" were shown a few months ago with great success on the TNT channel.
The recording of five episodes of the second season has already been completed and the sixth was in production, the channel reported.
Warner or TNT have yet to make a statement about what will happen to the series after Hagman's departure.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who excelled in classics such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when she gave birth to him in 1931 during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the New York theater scenes in the early 1950s, and then served in the British Air Force from 1952 to 1956.
While there, he met a young Swedish artist, May Axelsson, and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities live.
In 2001, he called his memoir "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
“I didn’t include anything that I thought would be able to hurt someone or affect them in any way,” he said at the time.
After a liver transplant, he began to promote organ donation and worked as a volunteer in the hospital to help patients experiencing fear.
"I give them advice, I give them courage, I meet with them when they go to the operation, and then," he said in 1996.
I’m trying to offer some comfort, like, “Don’t worry, it’ll be a little uncomfortable for a short time, but you’ll be fine.”
He also actively opposed smoking and participated in several campaigns.
Starting a course that explores "The End of the World"
Every week, students explore apocalyptic phenomena such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
In this semester, when the professor of religion Stewart Charme decided to read a course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistible temptation: the end of the "long countdown" of the Mayan calendar, which is the light for which many people took hold as proof of it.
But Sharm had no idea what to expect in the next couple of months: the catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, the financial crisis that some call a “long-armageddon,” and the growing conflict that is engulfing Israel, a place where Christian theories end.
“I didn’t realize it would be the most apocalyptic semester of all,” Sharma told students at Rutgers-Camden University this week.
If we analyze what is happening in the world right now, as if we only had 30 days left, it was a really good time.
And remember that bad is good for those who have an apocalyptic mindset.
And he’s not the only professor who offers courses on the “end of the world” topic this semester, theoretically the last in history.
Adjunct Professor Barry Walker at Temple University reads the course “Media, Culture and the End of the World.”
Every week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
“We’re analyzing why these ideas are spreading over time,” he said, and the way hypothetical scenarios suggest that trigger certain human actions.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, war could break out.
This month, students analyzed films on apocalyptic themes and studied how they relate to real-life examples.
“I tried to tell students about what is possible, what is probably plausible, and what is not possible,” Walker said.
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, Professor of Latin American History Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, Associate Professor of Art History and Anthropology, joined forces to read a course called simply “The End of the World.”
"We're not adding '2012' to always be able to read the course again in case the world doesn't end," Restall said.
Despite “inevitable destruction,” students must learn, prepare projects, and pass final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, leaving students no choice but to work “until the very night the world is supposed to end,” Restall said.
The courses have proved to be quite popular.
"The places are over in two hours," Restall said of his high-scoring class, which had 35 students enrolled.
We received emails from people who asked if there were any more places in the weeks before the start of the semester.
Students, in turn, assure that this course is one of the most interesting.
“I like to watch what people do to comfort themselves,” said Bridged Robinson, a 23-year-old student in the department of religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, in Rutgers-Camden.
And the apocalyptic image of thought, secular or religious, is only a matter of comfort or absence.
Will Vekesa, a 25-year-old student in the Department of Psychology and Nursing, said he had watched all the apocalyptic films.
“I’ve never heard of a course that would teach it,” he said.
I like him.
But none of the students surveyed - not to mention the professor - said they believed in the end of the world on December 21.
“Our first project touched on Maya prophecy, and in some way we discredited it,” said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old student of the last course at the University of Temple, West Chester.
Maya never predicted the end of the world; it’s just a key moment in the calendar, Restall said.
But he noted that there is an apocalyptic concern in Western culture, which counts for several centuries, where people react to changes around them, predicting the end of the world.
The internet has seen an increase in these speculations.
“In other places people don’t think about it,” he said.
Mainly in an English-speaking world.
Joseph Dogerty, a professor of religion at the University of La Sal, who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question of whether he knew of any course about the “end of the world” there.
"The Philippines does not take part in the end of the world," he wrote, pointing to the superior authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall noted that for a long time there was talk of many days of the last trial, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will immediately start thinking about the next date" or philosophizing that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period.
Students and teachers are carefree about this date.
Some said they were going to the "end of the world" parties.
“Maybe I’ll call someone from my friends to laugh together,” said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student at the Faculty of Communications.
