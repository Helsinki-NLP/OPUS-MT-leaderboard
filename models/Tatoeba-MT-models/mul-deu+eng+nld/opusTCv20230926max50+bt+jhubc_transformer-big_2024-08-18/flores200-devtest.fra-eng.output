This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already very widespread, but provides details that fossils generally cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional layout.
Scientists say the plumage of this animal was brown chestnut on the top and pale or carotenoid in color on the bottom.
This discovery also makes it possible to better understand the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since the dinosaur feathers do not have a fully developed stem, which is called rachis, but nevertheless show other features specific to the feathers – beards and beards – the researchers deduced that the rachis was probably a later evolutionary development to these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suggested that, even if it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows an adult feather and not the duck.
Scientists say it is a juvenile dinosaur's tail, but the sample reveals a feather belonging to an adult individual, not a juvenile.
A stolen car exploded at police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than 20 others.

The work carried out was mainly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by the tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon exerts traction on Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that black matter affects other black matter in the same way as normal matter.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter around a galaxy is in a kind of halo, and is made up of a large number of small particles.

In France, voting is traditionally an experience of low technicality: voters insulate themselves in a booth, put in an envelope a pre-printed sheet of paper indicating the candidate of their choice.
After the agents have verified his identity, the voter throws the envelope into the urn and signs his voter card.
The French Electoral Code regulates operations in a fairly strict manner.
Since 1988, ballots have to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that no envelope is present at the beginning of the vote and that no envelope is added, except for those of duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to attend each stage of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under high supervision, according to specific procedures.

She first took part in the slalom, where she scored a "did not finish" (DNF) in her first race. 36 of the 116 competitors achieved the same result in this race.
His other race, the giant slalom, allowed him to finish in tenth place in the group of women seated with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes less than the Austrian Claudia Loesch, who arrived first, and 1:09.02 minutes less than the Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani, who arrived ninth.
In the category of women in seated skiing, four skiers failed to finish their course; in the case of giant slalom, 45 skiers out of a total of 117 in this race failed to rank.
Police in Madhya Pradesh have found the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya said: “We arrested five people for raping the Swiss national, and we recovered her phone and laptop.”
The accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the police commissioner, said the accused had their faces hidden when they appeared in court.
Although three people were present in the house when the car hit her, none were injured.
However, the driver was seriously injured in the head.
The road where the accident took place was temporarily blocked to allow emergency services to extract the driver of the red Audi TT.
He was first hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with the murder of her son by the Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She is in custody pending her examination and trial, but eyewitness testimony could be compromised because her portrait was widely circulated.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the United Kingdom, but Scottish justice works differently and the courts have considered the publication of photos to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson, of the University of Dundee, notes that “journalists seem to follow a dangerous line if they publish photos, etc. of suspects.”
The Crown Prosecutor's Office, which is in charge of all prosecutions, told reporters that no further comment will be made at least until the indictment.
According to the leak, the document will deal with the border dispute that Palestine claims on the basis of the existing frontiers before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics discussed include the future State of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the question of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for a period of ten years from the signing of an agreement, while the Palestinian Authority only consents to a period of five years.
The shooters of the additional parasite-fighting trial had to be closely monitored by rangers, as the trial was controlled and its effectiveness was evaluated.
As part of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited as part of the Sporting Shooters Association’s hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, interim head of park and heritage conservation at the NPWS, the four shooters designated for the first slaughter campaign were properly trained and trained in safety instructions.
Martelly inaugurated a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) consisting of nine members.
This is Martelly's fifth PEC in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the dissolution of the previous CEP as part of a set of measures to engage the country on the path of new elections.
This committee was Martelly’s response to the massive protests against the regime that began in October.
These sometimes violent protests were triggered by the absence of elections, some of which were due to take place in 2011.
About 60 cases of overheating of defective iPods have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it had been aware of 27 accidents related to these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as “non-serious.”
The department responded by calling the postponement of the report “really regrettable” by Apple.
The earthquake struck the Marianns at 7:19 local time (21:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office said no damage had been reported in the country.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Philippine policeman has taken tourists hostage from Hong Kong by diverting their bus to Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shoots tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued, and the deaths of at least six of them have so far been confirmed.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released prematurely, as did Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an old lady who needed to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a career as a doctor.
He was trained as an obstetrician, and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating premature births during his free time.
Her research has shown that if a hormone was administered, it would accelerate the pulmonary maturation of the baby.
The Xinhua agency reported that government investigators recovered two flight recorders (or “black boxes”) on Wednesday.
The other fighters also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, “Luna was the first queen of the extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away the night of two moons. A unique moment, just like her. A strong woman.”
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as weird as me... or even more... I love her and I will miss her... I hope she rests in a better place."
A survey of 1,400 people prior to the 2010 federal election revealed that the number of opponents of Australia's transformation into a republic has increased by 8% since 2008.
Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of respondents share this view, and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch to rule Australia.
At the extremes of the survey, 29% of respondents think Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% think Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim at 100 m and 200 m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his physical condition was questioned.
He was not able to take the necessary medications to overcome his pain, as these are prohibited within the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered on January 25 the largest number of primers known to date.
Several people verified the discovery using different hardware and software at the beginning of February, and it was announced Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water supply for the earth, as well as for organic matter that can form proteins and promote life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, and more particularly how the Earth formed, since comets collided with it a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his term as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month to legalize same-sex marriage.
He described the rumors as “political gossip and stupidity.”
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
According to the FAA, NextGen is a system that would allow aircraft to fly over shorter distances and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, limiting carbon emissions.
It relies on satellite technologies, not ground-based radar systems used previously, which allows air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more detailed information.
Additional transport is non-existent and surface trains will not stop in Wembley, and parking and relay parks are not available on the ground.
The fear of lack of transport has given rise to the possibility that the match can be played indoors, without the supporters of the teams.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the genesis of a new bird species in the Ecuadorian Gal<0xC3><0xA1>pagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have indicated that the new species had evolved in only two generations, although this process has been estimated much longer, as a result of the reproduction between an endemic Darwin pine, Geospiza fortis, and the immigrant pine.
Gold can be shaped in many ways. It can be rolled into tiny pieces
It can be pulled into thin wire, which can be twisted and woven. It can be hammered or laminated into sheets.
It can be made very fine, and glued onto another metal. It can be so fine that it has sometimes been used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on the acidity or basicity (alkalinity) of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in the pH) present in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of their electrons (since hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, then, with clean and wet hands, squeeze them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will induce a strange sensation and produce a sort of shell.
The towns of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets equipped with a water hunt in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China; in Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of the public baths where men and women sided with each other.
When you call a person who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite receives the call into space and then sends it back to Earth, almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket, and scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket more than 30 meters high to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in many ways. The biggest advantage it has brought us is that it has made transportation much simpler and faster.
This brought us the train, the car and many other means of transport.
Below are medium-sized cats that eat also medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelope and other goat.
In addition, there are many small cats (including pet cats in the wild) that eat much more small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of niche, a special task assigned to each cat, preventing it from competing with others.
Lions are the most sociable cats, living in large groups called packs.
The packs consist of one to three related adult males, as well as about thirty females and lions.
Women are usually very close to each other, their family being made up of a large number of sisters and daughters.
Lion troops act like packs of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other large cats) in their behavior, and also very deadly for their prey.
A balanced athlete, the tiger can climb (but sometimes difficult), swim, jump long distances and pull with five times the strength of a powerful human.
The tiger belongs to the same family (genus Panthera) as the lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only cats capable of roaring.
The roar of the tiger does not resemble the roar of the lion, but rather a phrase whose words would be screams and groans.
The ocelots are fond of small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than him.
According to scientists, ocelots track and find animals to eat (proyed) by the smell, sniffing their way on the ground.
They see very well in the dark thanks to their night vision, and also move very stealthily. The ocelots track their prey by melting into their environment before throwing themselves on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it originates (e.g., if it moves over a mountain range or river, or if it moves to a new island in the environment so that it was different in the environment it can not easily return in the background often), a recurrence occurs.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need new features or adaptations to be a powerful competitor compared to what it used to be.
The indigenous population has not changed at all, it always needs the same adaptations.
Over time, as the new population adapts to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different that they can no longer be considered to belong to the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e. exhale).
Plants produce their food with the help of the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses and our clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The mossaurus was the superpredator of the time, he feared nothing except the other mossaurus.
His long jaws were equipped with more than 70 sharp teeth like razor blades, as well as an additional series of teeth in the palate, so that everything that crossed his path could not escape.
We're not sure, but he may have had the forked tongue, his diet included turtles, big fish, other mossoids, and he may even have been cannibalic.
He also attacked everything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur such as a T. rex was no size against him.
Although the Romans ate the food we know, they ate some strange or unusual festive dishes, including sandwiches, pawns, snails and lobster, a kind of snail.
Another difference: while the poor and the woman ate their food while sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to organize banquets together where they rested on the side while they were eating.
Ancient Roman meals could not include these foods of American or Asian origin that were introduced to Europe centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman has ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a main temple that was considered the home of the god.
The people were making sacrifices to the gods and the priests were trying to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivities.
Each temple had an open courtyard, and then an inner sanctuary that only priests could access.
Some pyramid towers, the ziggurats, were sometimes built as elements of a temple.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family took place in the open air.
The women cooked in the yard; the shops were only open countertops overlooking the street; the houses were built in stone.
As there were no great forests in the land of Canaan, the wood was extremely expensive.
In the Scandinavian sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder that he found Greenland — and named it so — while traveling further west.
But regardless of its discovery, eskimoud tribes already lived there at the time.
Although each country is "Scandinavian", there are many differences between peoples, kings, customs and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you’ve seen the Benjamin Gates movie and the Treasure of the Templars, you might think that a treasure card was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although there is an inscription on the back of the document, it is not a treasure card.
At the back of the Declaration of Independence, the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776" could be read at the bottom of the document, at the reverse.
Although no one really knows who wrote it, it is known that at an early stage of its existence, the large parchment (which measures about 29 inches three quarters by 24 inches) was stored rolled.
It is therefore likely that the notation was simply added as a label.
The landing of Day J and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
It was ruled by the Vichy French, who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupier instead of confronting it.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies landed in the south of France, an invasion called Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Forces de la France Libre had liberated the south of France and were heading for Germany.
A civilization is a singular culture shared by an important group of people who live and work in cooperation, a society.
The term "civilization" is derived from the Latin word "civilis", which means civil and is related to the Latin words "civilis", which means citizen, and "civitas", which means big city or city-state and which also indicates, in some way, the size of the society to which it refers.
Cities-states are the forerunners of nations. A civilizational culture involves the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a sustainable cultural footprint and equitable dissemination.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical traces and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government—the Congress being its only component—under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress did not have the power to impose taxes and, as there was no national executive or judicial power, it turned it over to the state authorities, often uncooperative, to enforce all its acts.
Nor did it have the power to derogate from the tax laws and customs laws between States.
The articles required the unanimous consent of all States before they could be amended, and States took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, with the German national team, the second most titled team in the world and it won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, scrimmage, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions, with Italians participating in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the group of islands that make up it, Japan is often referred to, geographically, as an "archipel".
The earliest information about Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, while European navigators passing there made mention of it as Ilha Formosa, or "beautiful island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, introducing a transformation of Aboriginal cereal production practices and employing Chinese workers to work in its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty forces (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared it a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after his defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which he ceded Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan, which then ruled the island until 1945.
The Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the room of the three windows.
Most of the surrounding buildings of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better insight into their original appearance.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and this restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common photography format in the world is 35 mm; it was the most common film format at the end of the era of analogue films.
It is still manufactured today, but what matters is that its image format is inherited from the digital camera's photographic sensor format.
The 35 mm format is actually, and it's pretty confusing, 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
So the aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to get the simplest of integer ratios) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (a family of APS formats, for example) are equal to or close to this aspect ratio.
The rule of third parties, heavily abused and often ridiculed, is a simple directive that arouses dynamism while offering protection to the image.
It indicates that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was challenged.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion has linked European states with each other despite differences in language and customs.
Its ubiquitous power touched everyone, from the king to the rotary.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth must be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church’s monetary funds are there specifically for this reason.
The central authority of the church has been in Rome for over 1,000 years and this concentration of power and money has led many people to wonder if this doctrine was respected.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Britain set up a naval blockade against Germany.
This strategy has proved effective, cutting vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade has violated international law generally accepted and codified by several international agreements over the past two centuries.
The UK mines international waters to prevent ships from ventureing into entire maritime areas, thus presenting even a threat to neutral ships.
As this tactic provoked only a shy reaction, Germany expected a similar reaction to its limitless underwater war.
During the 1920s, most citizens and nations showed a propensity for pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of war during the First World War, the nations wanted to prevent such a situation from recurring in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four hundred in his name, a poetry book and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his director in his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing the different epochs; every stage of China or every family in power was a separate dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also an unstable age of divided provinces, the best known of which is the Three Kingdoms era that took place for 60 years between the Han Dynasty and the Jin Dynasty.
During these periods, fierce struggles took place between many members of the nobility who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms were one of the bloodiest periods in the history of Chinese Antiquity. Thousands of people died in battle to sit on the throne of the great palace of XI.
There are many social and political repercussions such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single leader.
Also, after the Revolution, the professions were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and the most talented to succeed.
The same goes for the army, because the ranking of armies is no longer based on class, but on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other repressed working classes from other countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad was deeply interested in issues beyond the scope of this worldly life, and he used to go to a cave that became famous as "Hira" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which survived at the time, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In reality, it's not easy to find at all, even if you know it exists. When you walk into the cave, you're completely isolated.
Above, you can see nothing but the clear and beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains. From the inside of the cave, you can see or hear only very few things of this universe.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only of the seven wonders that still exist today.
Built by the Egyptians during the third millennium BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the many giant structures erected in honor of the deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "necropolis of Giza", in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, includes several pyramids (the great pyramid being the most imposing), several small tombs, many temples and the great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was created to honor Pharaoh Kheops, and many small pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honor his wives as well as members of his family.
The “pushing” symbol resembles a V and the “pushing” symbol resembles a staple or a square whose lower side is missing.
The top means you have to start with the tip and push the bow, and the bottom means you have to start with the ascent (which is where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
An upward arch generally produces a softer sound, while a downward arch is stronger and more assertive.
Do not hesitate to register your own marks on the pencil, but do not forget that the printed arched marks are for a musical reason, and that they must be respected in general.
On October 6, 1789, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thér<0xC3><0xA8>se, 11, and Louis-Charles, 4), and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, all terrified, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of sellers.
In a carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and shouting threats against the king and queen.
The king and queen were forced, because of the crowd, to open the windows of their carriages.
At one point, a member of the crowd brandished the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles in front of the frightened queen.
The war expenses of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover much of the expenses and interest on bonds issued on behalf of the Philippine government by Wall Street banking establishments.
Naturally, the superprofits resulting from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people could constitute the fundamental advantages of American imperialism.
In order to understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the creation of order.
These events took place in the period generally considered the High Middle Ages – period of history in Europe from the 11th to the 13th century (1000-1300).
The Middle Ages was preceded by the Upper Middle Ages and followed by the Lower Middle Ages, which by convention ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, ranging from technological advancement or technological imperative to a strict sense that the fate of humanity is dictated by an underlying logic related to scientific laws and their manifestation in technologies.
Most interpretations of technological determinism agree on two general ideas: technological development itself takes place in a process that goes far beyond cultural and political influences, and technology has an impact on intrinsically conditioned societies rather than socially.
For example, one could say that the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for a handful of cars, which is why new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Massive car ownership also leads to a greater incidence of road accidents, leading to the invention of new techniques in the field of health care to treat bodily injuries.
Romanticism was an important element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
According to the theories of Romanticism, geography would have shaped individuals and, over time, customs and a culture related to this geography would have appeared. These, in harmony with the places occupied by society, would be preferable to laws imposed arbitrarily.
In the same way that Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered that of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began around the year 400, and lasted until about 1100.
Its status declined during the twelfth century, mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders were again charged with presents such as silk and spices, with which the Byzantine markets could hardly compete.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style peaked between the 10th and 11th centuries.
At first, the dress was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture, in the east.
However, due to the slowness of the means of communication, Western modes could be delayed by 25 to 30 years.
During the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest advances of the time, following the Crusades, was the use of buttons for the closure of clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is an agriculture practiced to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic system, using preserved seeds from the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals who feel neglected by societal norms and share the same ideas, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of members.
The criteria that determine a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often report their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which encompasses modes, mannerisms, and argot.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw inspiration from the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune or voluntary abuse, were not socialized by adults during their childhood.
These children are considered "wild" or wild. Some wild children have been confined by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of that child was due to the parents' rejection of a severe intellectual or physical disability suffered by the child.
Wild children may have suffered serious abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fleeing.
Others would have been raised by animals; some would have lived alone in nature.
When fully raised by non-human species, wild children exhibit behaviors (within the limits of their physical dispositions) almost identical to those of the animals who raised them, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
While project pedagogy should make learning easier and more interesting, support goes further.
Support is not a method of learning, but rather a way to help learners discover a new teaching, such as using a new program or starting a new project.
Support can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of support, but the little trombone man from Microsoft Office is one too.
Virtual scaffolding is embedded in the software and is intended to interrogate, guide and explain procedures that could have been too difficult to manage for the student alone.
Children are placed in foster families for a wide variety of reasons ranging from neglect to abuse, through extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not stimulating, thoughtful and educational, but that is the case.
We perceive the family placement system as a safety zone for these children.
Our foster-family placement system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
The foster-family placement is supposed to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home from which they were previously withdrawn.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinct features of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approximation of uses and gratifications.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are considered major factors promoting the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995).
“Personal involvement” and “continuous relationships” were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied public responses to websites.
The use of video recording has led to major discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, i.e. facial expressions for a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can detect if a person lies by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President’s Speech, pointed out how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage are nevertheless able to assess sincerity accurately.
He even suggests that such interpretive abilities of human behavior can be found in animals such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two reservoirs of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
The mutation adds a new genetic variation, and the selection removes it from the reserve of the expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination alternating variations between the two basins in each generation.
In savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a human-like digestive system to meet its amino acid needs from the available plant resources.
In addition, a lack of response has serious consequences: growth disorders, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would be the proteins contained in the leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless cooked.
In contrast, animal-derived food (ants, termites, eggs) is easy to digest while providing a large amount of protein containing all the vital amino acids.
All in all, we shouldn’t be surprised if our own ancestors solved their “protein problem” a bit the same way savannah chimpanzees do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentional awakening during your sleep period and softening shortly after (10 to 60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a relatively silent awakening, in order to make you regain consciousness without waking up completely.
If you find yourself restarting the clock during your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids before going to bed (including water or tea, known to be diuretic), which forces you to wake up to urinate.
The degree of inner peace of a person is opposed to the degree of tension in his body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force present. Each person has the opportunity to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can reach enlightenment. The only thing that hinders this goal is our own tension and our negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been enriched by the path of Mahayana love and many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
With Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened by yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of deity. It is through the visualization of different deities that the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras activated, and the awakening consciousness created.
Germany was a common enemy during the Second World War, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, deep conflicts between their different systems, methods and cultures ended the agreement between the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would see real clashes, through replacement armies, on battlefields as well as in Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
But these plans became obsolete almost day after day, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union arrived and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian front after invading the other regions of the East of Poland, thus infringing the peace treaty of Riga, the non-aggression pact.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most effective way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The work of the Marines has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move your people and property, while interfering with your enemy's ability to move his people and property.
One of the most notable recent examples of this situation was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. The Americans were trying to get soldiers and equipment across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mostly U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain as it did for the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them close to them for easy access to milk, hair, meat and skins.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that wandered on hills or other grazing areas, often cared for by goats who were mostly children or adolescents, similar to the more well-known term shepherds. These pastoral methods are still in use today.
The “wagonways” were built in England from the 16th century.
Although the wagon lanes were simply made up of parallel wooden boards, they allowed the horses that pulled them to reach higher speeds and to pull larger loads than on the slightly more rugged roads of the day.
The crisscrosses were introduced early enough to keep the tracks in place, however, it was gradually realized that the tracks would be more effective if they were equipped with a strip of iron on top.
This has become a common practice, but iron has caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first iron rails appeared.
The very first means of locomotion was walking: humans began to walk upright two million years ago with the arrival of Homo Erectus (“right man”).
Their predecessors, the australopithecines, did not walk upright as usual.
Bipedal specializations are found in the fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although the Sahelanthropus was able to walk on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start by living in better harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even militate in order to mitigate future suffering.
In many cases, this is a symptomatic treatment. However, if we do not want only a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problems and deactivate them.
It is clear that the world has changed a lot thanks to scientific and technological advances made by humans, and that problems have become more important due to the overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle of humanity.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a manuscript draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to a few streets from there, at John Dunlap's printing house.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap Broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in the court of Independence Hall on July 8.
One of them was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who had it read to his troops in New York on 9 July, and a copy arrived in London on 10 August.
The 25 Dunlap sheets still known to exist are the oldest copies of the document. The original manuscript copy did not survive.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs has survived and is still alive. They are called birds.
Few people regard them as dinosaurs given that they have wings and can fly.
But there are a lot of things about birds that still look like a dinosaur.
They have legs covered with scales and claws, they lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs like T-Rex.
Virtually all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values: 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary numbers, or bits to use the computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately visible. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are general enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of an internal poisoning is probably the presence of an open container of toxic domestic drugs or chemicals.
Refer to the label for the specific first aid instructions for this poison.
The term "insect" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term derives from an ancient familiarity with bed bugs, which are insects very suitable for parasitizing humans.
Reductions, like bed bugs, are nesty, that is, suitable for living in their host's nest or habitat.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of plaque sclerosis (SEP), making it the leading neurological disease in young people and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, composed of the brain, spinal cord and the optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may well estimate that it is not in their own interest, nor in that of the child, to take care of the upbringing of a baby.
These couples can choose to make an adoption project for their baby.
As part of an adoption, biological parents end their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method guides most of the scientific research.
However, this is not the only experiment, and an experiment is a test that serves to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, ask questions and make observations, but which also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers have focused on ancient texts, and especially on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all scientific issues, including psychology, have been accepted.
With the decline of knowledge of Greek, the West has found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend largely on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic stimuli, have been documented for most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sufficient oscillators that will continue a cycle of operation for a certain period of time, even in the absence of external stimulation.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main indications that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments to mark either phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the part of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only germ cell mutations can be passed on to children, while other mutations can lead to cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism is of interest to those who wish to visit natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, in particular the fauna and flora.
Hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, park visits and the study of ecosystem information are examples of on-site activities.
For example, you can go see, photograph and discover the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small rural towns by car to get to their workplace and meet other people who will work in the countryside they have just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, each is somehow connected to a transport system based on private cars and supports it.
Science now shows that this massively carbon-based economy has shifted the biosphere from its stable state that has supported human evolution for two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear so many complaints about water quality or the collapse of bridges.
Why do transport systems generate such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movements of drivers and particular vehicles between two points, and the interactions they exert between them.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study the flow of traffic because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, the conductors tend to act in a reasonably consistent range; thus, the flows of circulation tend to have a reasonable consistency and can be represented mathematically in an approximate manner.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow rate, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help with the planning, design, and operation of road installations.
Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly allowed them to escape their enemies more easily and to find more effectively food and companions.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along the body.
This gives them a larger number of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and ephemerals.
A few thousand years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system was moving around the Sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system was moving around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, carrying more than eight times the volume of water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on the planet, sometimes up to 10 km wide.
No less than 20% of the water that flows from the planet’s rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main branch of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long and collects water from thousands of small rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Ancient Empire, the pyramids of Gizeh were never surpassed by their size and technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Empire were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, who were then much more than a thousand years old.
The Vatican has about 800 inhabitants, the smallest independent country in the world, and the least populous.
The Vatican City writes its legislation and official communications in Italian.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most people who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
The citizens of the Vatican City are all Catholics.
Since ancient times, peoples have been familiar with basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper, as they are found in nature in raw form and are quite simple to mine using primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything consisted of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
Rather, it was the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, although it also issued the theory that these are transformed into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that the periodic table contains many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys that include a small amount of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are so incredibly small that billions of them could enter the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it came out.
Unfortunately, the emergence of new modes of writing has relegated the pen to a more confidential status and to fewer uses.
People are now writing messages on computer screens, without ever having to approach a pencil size.
One can only wonder what the keyboard will become when the next novelty arrives.
The fission bomb operates on the following principle: it transforms energy by assembling a nucleus of a myriad of protons and neutrons.
It's kind of like climbing a hill to a heavy cart, splitting the core again, then releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, so they tend to break with little or no pressure.
The surface of the moon is made up of stones and dust. Its outer layer is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is about 70 km on the visible face and 100 km on the hidden face.
It is thinner at sea level and thicker under continents.
There may be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are focused on researching what makes people feel good or that they are attracted to.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature towards adulthood.
These theories examine what drives some people to want the things they do and what, in their environment, drives them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's theory of two factors.
In general, two behaviors can emerge when a manager becomes the leader of former colleagues. From one end of the spectrum is trying to remain "the right friend" (or the right girlfriend).
This type of manager has a hard time making unpopular decisions, conducting disciplinary actions, carrying out assessments, assigning responsibilities, and holding others accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, one transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels he/she must change everything the group has created so far and do things his/her way.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of a virtual team often act as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can meet according to different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique element of a virtual team.
The “Invisible Team” is the management team to which each member accounts and sets the standards for each of them.
Why would an organization want to impose itself on the tedious process of creating a learning structure? One of the goals related to the implementation of organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively used in an organization’s functional services, creativity and ingenuity can be fully expressed.
Therefore, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the customer’s need.
Before an organization is innovative, its management must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge and its own culture of learning.
Angel (2006) presents the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve better results.
The neurobiological data provide material evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, thus reducing the field of research and making it much more accurate.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of damage, injury, tumours and brain trauma affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our mind.
Although Artificial Intelligence is often strongly known as science fiction, it is a very important part of computer science that studies the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of a machine.
The aim of artificial intelligence research is automation by task machines that require an intelligent approach.
Examples include control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to diagnostics and customer questions, as well as the recognition of writing, voice and face.
These practices have led to separate disciplines, focused on providing solutions to the problems of everyday life.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as it has been laid out in several home computer software and video games.
Excursions are an integral part of any school class. Often, a teacher would like to take his students to places where a bus trip is unthinkable.
The solution is brought by technology in the form of virtual educational outings. Students can look at the ancient objects of a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire a wonderful work of art while sitting with their class.
Practically taking part in a trip is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share your experiences with future generations.
For example, students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website dedicated to their visit to the state capital every year. Each year, the site is updated, but older versions are kept online to serve as an album.
Blogging can also help students improve their writing skills. Even though students often try blogging experience with neglected grammar and spelling, having an audience usually makes the situation evolve.
As students are often the most critical audience, the blog author begins to strive to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
In addition, blogging “forces students to get to know the world around them better.” The need to arouse public interest encourages students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a tool that encourages collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning well beyond the traditional school day.
"When used well, blogs can enable students to strengthen their analytical skills and critical minds: by actively responding to online content, they can confront their opinions with that of others and express their own views on very specific topics" (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital and has a large number of art galleries and museums that highlight Canada's past and present.
You will find further south the Niagara Falls and north, the Muskoka region and its surroundings that possess unspoilt natural beauty.
All these measures, and many others, make Ontario what foreigners regard as the quintessence of Canada.
Large areas further north are fairly unpopulated and some are almost uninhabited in the wild.
For a comparison of the population that surprises more than one: There are more African-Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest country, and even a continent all by itself, in terms of wildlife.
Most of the small islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known to be luxury resorts.
The Arabs also brought the practice of Islam to the lands and this religion spread widely to the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco de Gama discovered the Cape route that connects Europe to India.
To the north, the region is bounded by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
To women: It is recommended for any woman traveling to say that she is married, regardless of her civil status.
It is also advisable to wear an alliance (which should not seem too precious.
Women must realize that certain cultural differences can lead to behaviors that they consider to be harassment, because it is common for them to be followed, caught in the arm, etc.
Be firm in refusing men’s advances, and don’t be afraid to hold on (cultural differences or not, that doesn’t mean it’s acceptable!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber sinners in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese, who had rebuilt it after destroying it and named it Casa Branca, finally abandoned it in 1755 after an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city under the name of Daru l-Badya, and it was renamed Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading counters there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in all of Morocco for shopping.
Around the old medina, you can easily find places to buy traditional Moroccan products, such as tajines, pottery, leather goods, nargiles and bibelets of all kinds, but it is all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town located in the far east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano that buried most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside of Goma must be researched to understand the state of fighting that persists in the North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for the ascent of the Nyiragongo volcano as well as for mountain gorilla trails among Africa's cheapest.
You can use boda-boda (moto taxi) to move to Goma. The normal (local) price is about 500 Congolese francs for a small race.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, “Tombouctou” has become a metaphor for distant and exotic countries.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered world heritage sites, due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stages of Henry Louis Gates’ “Wonders of the African World” on PBS.
The city contrasts strongly with the cities of the rest of the country, as it has a more Arab than African style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and along the border of Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The total area of the park is 19,500 km2, which is divided into 14 ecozones, each housing a specific fauna.
It is one of the most well-known amusement parks in South Africa and considered to be the blossom of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily entry and conservation rights for the park.
It may be beneficial to get a Wild Card that gives access to some of South Africa’s parks, as well as all of South African national parks.
The island of Hong Kong gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the main center of interest for many tourists.
The row of buildings drawing Hong Kong’s horizon has been compared to a sparkling bar graph, which is revealed by reflection in the waters of the port of Victoria.
To admire the most beautiful panoramas of Hong Kong, leave the island and join the Kowloon seafront located in front.
The vast majority of the urban development of the island of Hong Kong is concentrated on the land-full of the north bank.
This is where the British settlers have invested, so it seems to me to be a good starting point if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past in this region.
The Sundarbans are the largest belt of coastal mangroves in the world, extending over 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the hinterland of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest located on Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not only composed of mangrove swamps: they also contain some of the last remnants of the majestic jungles that once covered the Ganges Plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about a third is covered by water/watershed areas.
Sundarbans has been a nature reserve since 1966, where you can find about 400 Royal Bengal tigers and 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart from the interdistrict bus station (located on the other bank) throughout the day, but most, especially those serving the east and Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 6:30 and 7:30 in the morning.
Inter-district buses are often full, so it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese caboteurs, which are comfortable and robust.
Collective taxis are a quick and comfortable way to get to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The bridge over the Oyapock River overlooks the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oyapock with Brazil and St. George of Oyapock in Guyana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters; it is 378 meters long and has two lanes of 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The structure was completed in August 2011, but it was only opened to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaran<0xC3><0xAD> were the most important indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters and also practicing subsistence farming.
Other indigenous tribes that inhabited the Chaco, such as the Guaycur<0xC3><0xBA> or the Payagu<0xC3><0xA1>, survived mainly through fishing, hunting, or harvesting.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly nicknamed "the giant province of India", was born from the encounter between Spanish conquerors and indigenous peoples.
The Spaniards inaugurated the period of colonization, which lasted three centuries.
Since the foundation of Asunci<0xC3><0xB3>n in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams and among the best polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields of Las Ca<0xC3><0xB1>itas.
In addition, tournaments and smaller-scale matches are sometimes held here at other times of the year.
For information on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, visit the Polo Argentina Association.
The official currency of the Malouines is the Malouines pound (FKP) whose value is equivalent to one pound sterling (GBP).
The money can be exchanged at the only bank of the islands located in Stanley, in front of the FIC West store.
The Pound Sterling is a commonly accepted currency throughout the islands, while at Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the surrounding islands, credit cards will probably not be accepted, even if the UK and US currencies may be. Talk to the owners in advance to agree on a payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange Malouines money outside of the islands, so change it before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located in the south of Ecuador, winter in the northern hemisphere corresponds to summer there and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical area and summer temperatures above 30 <0xC2><0xB0>C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but wind and humidity combine to give the impression that it is colder than what the thermometer says.
There are not really "rainy" and "dry" seasons: precipitation is approximately constant throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are used to seeing humans, they are still wild species; please do not feed or disturb them.
According to the park authorities, you must stand at least 100 meters from bears and wolves and 25 meters from all other wild animals!
As docile as they may seem, the bison, the eel, the orignal, the bear and almost all the large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they have not kept a sufficient distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Also, know that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid transporting or cooking fragrant food and keeping the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a notorious naval impasse in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk, with the exception of a British cruiser, and nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
Supreme leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III was assassinated during a peaceful rally in the city, during the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement.
The beaches are numerous, as Auckland is on horseback on two ports. The most popular are located in three zones.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay to the north to Devonport to the south.
Almost all the beaches are sandy and allow you to swim safely, and most are shaded by pohutukawa.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located on Waitemata Harbour, in the chic suburbs of Mission Bay and Saint Heliers in downtown Auckland.
These beaches, sometimes very frequented by families, have many shops along the coast. Swimming is safe there.
The main local beer is “Number One”, a fairly ordinary beer, but tasty and refreshing. There is also another local beer, “Manta”.
There are plenty of French wines to enjoy, but New Zealand and Australian wines may travel better.
You can drink the water from the local tap safely, but you can easily find bottled water if you have concerns about it.
For Australians, the idea of a "cream coffee" is foreign. A short black is an "espresso", the cappuccino is filled with cream (no foam) and the tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is in accordance with Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many reef trips are made throughout the year, and injuries due to one of these causes on the reef are rare.
However, follow the advice of the authorities, obey all signs and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
From October to April, north of 1770, the boxed medusas arrive near the beaches and estuaries of rivers. They can also sometimes be seen outside of this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most of them are afraid of humans and would turn away from them.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean, their main habitat is in the estuaries of the rivers north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the peace of mind to know that he will have a place to sleep once he arrives at the destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but you can also book through travel agencies of other types of accommodation, such as camping areas.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport shuttle service, or even packages that combine flight and accommodation.
They may also retain the booking for you if you need time to reflect on the offer or to provide you with other necessary documents for your destination (e.g., a visa).
However, any modification or request must be addressed to the travel agency first and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of participants decide to camp on site, and most consider this to be an integral part of the experience.
If you want to participate closely in the musical event, you will have to arrive early to find a well-placed campsite.
Keep in mind that even though the musical performances are finished on the main scenes, other musical performances can continue until late into the night at other festival sites.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the north of the Baltic in winter, be sure to check the location of the cabin, as crossing the ice can cause unbearable noises at the most exposed cabins.
Cruises in St. Petersburg include time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (see conditions).
Casinos usually make a lot of effort to maximize the time and money spent by customers. There are rarely windows and clocks, and outputs can be difficult to spot.
They usually offer special offers of dishes, drinks and entertainment in order to maintain the good mood of the guests and keep them on site.
On some sites, it is the locals that offer free alcoholic beverages. However, intoxication alters judgment, and all good players know that it is crucial to stay sober.
Anyone who drives at high latitudes or crosses mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice or ice temperatures.
On the ice and snowy roads, the friction is low and you can’t drive as if you were on the bare asphalt.
During blizzards, it can fall in very short time enough snow to block you.
Visibility may also be limited by snowfall or powder fall or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, the presence of ice and snow is normal in many countries, and traffic is virtually uninterrupted all year round.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the most striking time for many visitors.
In the common language, the term “safari” refers to an excursion on African land, and in particular in the savannah, with the purpose of attending the show catching wild animals in their midst.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars and the standard equipment makes it possible to observe them well.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you will see them better with twins.
A walking safari (also called “walking in the bush”, “walking safari” or “walking”) consists of hiking, either for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, after hosting the Games in 1964.
If you have booked your flights and accommodation in 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, you may be faced with a delicate situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of the end of March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend until July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with typical tickets costing around 7,000 yen.
Wet clothes can be made easier to dry. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board that can be borrowed, even if they are not in the rooms.
If you don’t have iron to iron or don’t want to wear ragged socks, you can try using a hair dryer if you find one.
Avoid letting the fabric overheat (which can cause it to shrink or in extreme cases, burn it).
There are different methods of water purification, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some places, it is enough to boil the water for a minute; in others, you have to do it for several minutes.
The efficiency of filters varies, and if you have a concern, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter harmful animals that they do not know in their home region.
Parasites can contaminate food, cause irritation or, in the most severe cases, cause allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force, are generally not considered parasites.

Travellers to countries where taxes are high can sometimes save significantly, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages or tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, often passing through isolated terrain from the hinterland.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep an open mind: steep slopes, narrow lanes and tight curves predominate.
The speed limits displayed are significantly lower than in previous and subsequent sections – usually from 35 to 40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and their strict compliance is even more important than before.
On the other hand, the mobile service is curiously much stronger here than on many other parts of the road, for example the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are rather good, and in Bavaria, they are very rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbour, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common here: apples are cooked and baked throughout the year, while cherries and plums point the tip of their nose in summer.
Many German bakery products also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. Popular cakes often marry particularly well with a cup of tight coffee.
If you want small but copious pastries, try the Berliner balls, also called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen depending on the region.
A curry is a dish made from herbs and spices, accompanied by meat or vegetables.
A curry dish can be “solid” or “liquid,” depending on the amount of sauce it contains.

With 17,000 islands, Indonesian cuisine is a generic term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines present throughout the country.
However, when this term is used without another qualification, it tends to refer to foods from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine offers a range of simply seasoned dishes, the predominant flavors that the Javanese prefer being peanuts, peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The latches are supports for the rider's feet, which hang on either side of the saddle.
They offer greater stability to the user, but they can pose a security problem: in fact, the user’s feet can remain stuck there.
If a rider is projected from a horse, but has a foot caught in the latch, it could be dragged if the horse escapes. To minimize this risk, a number of safety measures can be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, rather narrow sole.
Then, some stools, especially the English ones, have safety bars that allow a stud to fall off the saddle if it is pulled backwards by a falling rider.
Cocham<0xC3><0xB3> Valley – The top destination for climbing in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with many different large granite walls and cliffs.
From the top of the peaks, the views of the mountains are breathtaking, and climbers from all over the world are constantly discovering new routes on the slopes, where the possibilities are endless.
Winter downhill sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that consist of sliding to deflect a snowy slope with skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity that has many aficionados, sometimes called “ski bums”, who organize their entire holidays according to skiing in specific places.
The idea of skiing is very old: cave paintings showing skiers date back to some 5,000 BC!
The practice of alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century; the first leisure ski club was founded in 1861 in Australia by Norwegians.
Skiing: this activity is also called Nordic skiing, cross-country skiing or hiking skiing.
This is similar to alpine hiking skiing, as well as mountaineering, but does not generally incorporate these activities, which are practiced on rugged terrains and require the use of skis and boots much more rigid.
Think of the ski itinerary as a similar hiking itinerary.
Under good conditions, you will be able to travel distances a little longer than on foot – but very rarely you will reach the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on steep slopes.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. In classical circumstances, travelling through several countries therefore implies having to make several visa applications and undergo several passport checks.
The Schengen area, however, functions a bit like a single country in this respect.
As long as you stay in this area, you can usually cross the borders without going through the passport checkpoints.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa separately for each of the member countries of the space, which saves time, money and administrative formalities.
There is no universal definition of whether a manufactured item is an antique; some tax authorities define goods over 100 years old as antiques.
The criteria vary depending on where you are located; in some parts of the world, such as in North America, the age limit may be lower than that in Europe.
Artisanal products can be considered antiques, even if they are less ancient than similar industrial products.
The breeding of reindeer is an important livelihood for the Sami and the culture surrounding this trade is of great importance for many other professions.
Although, according to tradition, not all Samis were involved in large-scale reindeer breeding, they lived from fishing, hunting and other similar activities, while using reindeer mainly as reindeer.
Nowadays, many Sami practice modern trades. Tourism is an important source of income in Lapland, the Sami region.

Transgender people in the preoperative phase should not expect to pass the scanners while preserving their privacy and dignity.
Rigging currents are the currents that come back from waves that break on the beach, often on a shell or equivalent.
Due to underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated on a few deeper sections, and a rapid flow to deep waters can form there.
In most cases, deaths are due to exhaustion that results from an attempt to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the water, going back to swimming is no more difficult than usual.
Try to target a place where you won't be taken again. It's also possible, that depending on your skills and whether you've been spotted or not, you might want to wait for help.

Travellers who have had difficulty adapting to the new culture sometimes have a lot of difficulty re-adapting to their original culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have already adapted to the new culture and have lost certain habits of your original culture.
At first, when you went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
People may not anticipate that patience and understanding are also necessary for travelers and travelers returning home.
The sound and light show at the pyramid is one of the most interesting attractions in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show starts.

The scenes are displayed on the pyramids and the various pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the largest number of research stations and sixteen of them are active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The island of King George, with the village of Villa Las Estrellas, is the largest.
Other examples: Livingston Island and the Deception, where the inundated caldera of a still active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the southern region of the peninsula, bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The peninsula's mountains merge into the plateau, then reappear to form the 360 km long Ellsworth mountain range, crossed by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinel chain, contains the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson massif, which peaks at 4892 m.
In remote locations, without a cell phone network, you may have no choice but to use satellite telephony.
A satellite phone does not usually replace a mobile phone, as you need to be outside and have a clear view of the satellite to make a call.
It is a service often used by navigation, including pleasure boats, as well as by expeditions that have remote data transmission and telephony needs.
Your local phone operator should be able to tell you more about connecting to this service.
Those who plan a sabbatical year have the opportunity to learn while traveling, and more and more of them choose this possibility.
This formula is particularly appreciated by young people who leave school, as it allows them to take a year off before university, without compromising their studies.
Often, attending sabbatical year courses abroad can actually give you better chances of doing graduate studies in your country.
As a general rule, registration fees must be paid to follow these educational programs.
Finland is a destination of choice for leisure sailing. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don’t necessarily need a yacht in the archipelagos and on the lakes.
Although coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are actually large enough for a yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Sailing is a national hobby in Finland, due to a boat for seven or eight people.
Norway, Sweden and New Zealand are in the same situation, but apart from that, this is a unique case (in the Netherlands, for example, the figure is one to forty).
Most Baltic cruises are characterized by an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for a few full days while returning to sleep on the boat at night.
If you only land with cruise excursions, you will not need a separate visa (from 2009).
The city of Berlin, Germany, is mentioned in some brochures for cruises. As you can see by looking at the map above, Berlin is not located at all near the seafront and no tour of this city is included in the price of the cruise.
Flying can be a scary experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or experienced a traumatic event.
We should not be ashamed of it: it is no different from the personal fears and fears that many people experience in relation to other things.
For some, understanding something about the operation of airplanes and what happens during a flight can help overcome a fear that is based on the unknown or on not having control.
Transport companies are well-paid to make quick deliveries, and often, in the context of urgent repair, the question of time limits is crucial for documents, goods or spare parts related thereto.
On some routes, large companies have their own planes, but on other routes and for small businesses, there was a problem.
If they had sent goods by air freight, on certain routes, it would have taken days to pass the unloading and customs.
The only way to get it to you faster was to send it as checked baggage. Air regulations will not allow them to send baggage without a passenger, and that's where you intervene.
The most obvious way to travel in first class or business class is to pay a large sum of money for this privilege (or, better yet, ask your business to do it for you).
However, this is not inexpensive: as a rule, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economic rate for business class, and eleven times for first class!
In general, there is no need to seek discounts for business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know very well that they can count on a certain type of traveler who is willing to pay very dearly for the privileges of speed and comfort, and they set their rates in good faith.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is very common.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic suffering from ethnic conflicts.

Please treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not distort the site by marking or scratching graffiti on the structures.
