A Republican strategy to hamper Obama's re-election
Republican leaders justified their policy on the need to fight electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter a myth and claims that electoral fraud is less common in the United States than the number of people who die from the fall of a lightning bolt.
In fact, Republican lawyers have found no more than 300 cases of election fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In that sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Contrary to what happens in Canada, U.S. states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
And in that same line a majority of American governments enacted, starting in 2009, new laws that made the registration or voting process difficult.
This phenomenon has spread after the November 2010 elections, which saw the increase of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, during 2011, 180 bills were introduced that restricted the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require voters to present an identity document with a photograph, as well as proof of U.S. citizenship.
On the other hand, these laws reduce early voting periods, invalidate the right to register as an elector on the day of the screening, and revoke the right to vote to citizens with criminal background.
Prior to the 2006 election, no U.S. state required voters to submit a photo ID.
The state of Indiana was the first to demand it.
The U.S. Supreme Court confirmed the constitutionality of Indiana law in 2008.
As a result, the Republican authorities hastened to extend that practice to other states.
In recent years, these authorities have supported bills in 34 states to force voters to submit a photo ID.
It is important to note that, contrary to what is happening in Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity document, such as the Social Security card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, i.e. 21 million people of voting age, do not have any photo ID issued by a government agency in their state.
On the other hand, five million new voters in 2012 lack an identity document with these characteristics.
But, often, obtaining the required identity document costs more than a hundred dollars.
As a result, the new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25 per cent of African Americans, 15 per cent of people earning less than $35,000 a year, 18 per cent of citizens over 65 and 20 per cent of voters aged 18 to 29 do not have a photo ID.
And there's more.
In many states students, the voters who vote most for Democratic candidates, cannot use the photo ID issued by their institution.
On the other hand, those same states authorize members of fishing or hunting clubs who usually vote for Republican parties to use the documents issued by those clubs.
Before 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first state to make such a claim.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws that require voters to prove they are American citizens.
These measures clearly seek to limit the Spanish vote.
It seems that two out of every three Hispanic voters support the Democratic Party.
On the other hand, Republican lawmakers backed certain laws in 2011 that abolished voter registration on the same day of scrutiny in eight states.
In addition, they limited the right of individuals and groups to create a support service for voters who wanted to register.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns contributed to the registration of around 10 million citizens.
Measures taken since 2009 have reduced the enrollment rate of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers passed laws in five other states that favored reducing the voting period in advance.
For example, in the 2008 Florida election, 33% of voters who voted in advance were African-Americans, while the latter represented only 13% of the state’s voters.
In the case of Hispanics, the same thing happened.
These represent only 11% of voters, which is equivalent to 24% of citizens who vote in advance.
However, whites, who represent 76 percent of the electorate, represent no more than 46 percent of citizens who vote in advance.
Of course, Democratic legislators and their supporters have fiercely opposed the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters.
In this regard, the Democratic governors have blocked several bills.
The U.S. Attorney’s Office intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
It was possible, in part, to limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states passed the law requiring the submission of a photo ID.
However, it is undeniable that the new rules adopted will complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been voted on, since it is clear that with them it is intended to influence the 2012 results in the key states.
A 2011 Brennan Center report shows that states that have passed such laws represent 171 of the 270 votes needed in the electoral college to win the presidency.
It is too early to say for sure whether these legislative changes at the electoral system scale will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential election.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In this sense, the measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Prostate Cancer Detection: Do the Test or Not Do It?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes presents false results, with false negative or even false positive results, after which it is decided to perform useless medical interventions.
It is more than enough reason to make men, already reluctant on their own, doubt whether or not screening tests should be done.
Do you take the test or not?
We asked for advice from two experts.
Studies conducted in the United States detected a high rate of infections among the sample groups, making it difficult to interpret those data and make firm recommendations.
For its part, the European study showed a certain difference in mortality between patients who had been screened and those who had not.
The study, with a follow-up at 12 years, also showed that there is a 30-40% chance of metastasis if the detection test has not been performed.
I therefore recommend testing from the age of 50, or from the age of 40 if your father has had prostate cancer.
Men of African-American descent have a higher risk index.
The key is to make a good decision once the cancer is detected.
There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are indolent.
It is really necessary to ensure that the patient understands the degree of risk of his cancer. He should be offered all possible options and not necessarily treated prostate cancers that do not care for long-term life, in which case he should rather opt for active monitoring of the disease.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer are not treated, since the cancer is neither aggressive nor life-threatening.
Instead, we suggest active surveillance of the disease and, if it progresses, we offer treatment.
More and more often we determine precise criteria to decide who should or should not be treated.
I recommend that the test be done in any case.
But it is important that you talk to your doctor to determine if the test should be done or not.
Movember has created, in collaboration with the International Urology Society, a tool to evaluate the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of research, adopting healthy lifestyle habits remains the best way to reduce the risks of suffering from the disease.
We estimate that if everyone ate well and moved enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
“If no one smoked, that rate would be at least 50 percent,” said André Beaulieu, a spokesperson for the Canadian Cancer Society.
Instead, we estimate that about 10% of cancers are hereditary.
Many others are still totally inexplicable.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking continues to be a priority despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Tobacco is linked to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for other types of cancers.
It seriously damages people’s health.
"Today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," spokesman André Beaulieu said.
Ten years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is halved.
The Peso
Fat and obesity also favor the onset of the disease, according to the SCC.
They increase the risk of breast, colon and rectal cancer, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
“Research shows that regular exercise throughout life protects against breast cancer,” they add.
The food
The body also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In large amounts, they escalate the risks of colorectal cancer.
Charcuterie products should also be avoided.
Conservation of meat for smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
“They can damage the cells in the body and lead to the development of cancer,” they explain.
The Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin complexes and cancer.
At the moment, however, his research is not conclusive.
According to the SCC, studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While in one of them there was a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, in another what was observed was, rather, an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not been clearly determined.
On the other hand, Mr. Beaulieu insists on the importance of talking about everyone’s concerns and family history with their doctor.
"Doing the screening test does not cause cancer."
The Higgs boson in detail
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson generated a great shock last summer, and rightly so.
It is believed, in fact, that this boson is part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of all that exists in the universe, nothing more and nothing less.
And what is more, it is the particle whose existence predicted the standard model: our best or "less bad" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter, which has not yet been observed empirically.
But for physicists it is not entirely clear that it is Higgs.
We know without a doubt that there is a new particle and that it is very similar to the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, new data revealed this week at a major physics congress held in Kyoto seems to confirm that it is, although more data is missing to be completely safe.
Anyway, we assume it's Higgs, since the chances of getting it wrong seem few. We'll see what it's about.
There is, in this great world, a generalized and unavoidable law which implies that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
There’s no way to break that rule and don’t try too hard, because it will end up hurting yourself.
Although particle physics is a very complex world, it has been shown that there is also a law of these characteristics: the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state"; a "state" that consists, roughly, of some of its characteristics.
Physicists classify particles into two categories.
On the one hand we meet the good citizens called fermions, who wisely obey Pauli’s beginning.
And on the other hand there are the bosons, a dirty panda of anarchists who have no respect for anything, or at least not for this principle, which means they can be found in the same place and at the same time.
According to the website The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley Laboratories which, by the way, is extraordinary, the bosons are divided into two groups: the mesons, of which we shall not speak here, and the "particles of force", by which the great forces of nature propagate and with which the Higgs boson would be of some form.
These bosons, I might point out here, are not the exotic bugs that we might believe.
In fact, if you can read this chronicle, it is thanks to an extraordinarily banal boson: the photon or "light particle" that acts as the "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
Indeed, when a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it “disorders” the electromagnetic field in that precise environment; a bit like when we throw a stone at a pond.
In this “disorder” an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared, ultraviolet, etc.) is born, and this wave is nothing more than a photon; that is, one of the “force carrier” bosons.
More Stable Field
The same goes for the Higgs boson, with the difference that it is another field, the Higgs field, which needs to be "disordered" for this boson to appear.
Now, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field. To activate it, you need to reach extremely high energies, a bit like a frozen pond where only a thick rock could slide across the surface.
That’s why it takes a huge particle accelerator like CERN’s (the great Hadron Collider is a ring of 27 km in circumference!) to reach such energy levels.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is a new tool that explains the relationship between Higgs and mass.
In fact, not all particles or materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do, but others do not: a piece of paper, for example, will never hold itself stuck to the door of a refrigerator.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have a mass, while the rest (like the photon, by the way), do not.
Now, what “can they contribute” to all these investigations?, asks Mrs. Plamondon.
For science, this serves to verify the validity of the standard model (MS), and also allows physicists to scrutinize the differences between observations and predictions of MS.
On the other hand, many want them to find each other, as the slightest difference could open a door to a “new physics” that taps certain holes in the model.
This, it must be said, still has enormous shortcomings, as it does not propose any explanation regarding gravity (ups!) or dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the matter of the Universe (ups!).
But we have not found such differences at CERN so far.
Repercussions
The repercussions of such research in our day-to-day are difficult to predict, but we do not believe we are wrong to say that we will not have any.
To see: in the early 1960s, laser pioneers in laboratories did not at all suspect the revolution that their work would provoke.
They interviewed the scientific applications, but nothing more.
In fact, as physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who made the first continuous laser (the first ones were pulsed) in 1962, was at first considered a "laboratory device".
Just imagine...
And in addition, applications can also come from all the instrumentation surrounding the research.
For example, Willard Boyle himself developed a light sensor in 1969 in the course of his research into optics.
Although it wasn’t his original intention at all, this pickup now serves as the “eye” for all the digital devices in the world, which earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
That doesn’t mean, of course, that the activities of the LHC necessarily want to transform our lives, but you never know...
Palliative care. The best way to die... <0x7C> Le Devoir
In its Death in Dignity Commission, Quebec recently debated the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate should resume soon as a bill is being prepared.
Now, within that essential domain, there is still a lot to do.
Le Devoir tried to see it closely.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in the Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that was destroying him had given him a two-year breath.
“I had been given five years of life, but I’ve already had seven,” he says, made a pass, lying in his bed in the Victor-Gadbois palliative care center in Beloeil, which he arrived the day before.
“But it’s always a shock, we can’t be prepared for this,” he continues.
The disease has wreaked havoc on him: a huge weakness that prevents him from going to the bathroom alone and even eating alone.
Sitting in front of an appetizing lunch, he accepts resigned to help him eat.
Brave, he even comes to smile, to talk to strangers who pay attention to him, bring him medicine and offer him a bath.
The Courage of Ordinary Death.
“My biggest wish is that my diarrhea is cured, it’s humiliating,” she confesses.
A few hours later, the team found a remedy for that evil.
“Over the course of our lives we learn that a man walks up,” says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois Center.
Returning to your childhood, for certain people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
“That depends on the person’s ability to accept that regression,” he notes.
Because, in the opinion of most people who work in palliative care, the great moments take place at the very heart of that regression.
All patients entering the Victor-Gadbois palliative care center suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
In that state, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer offer "curative" care.
The greatest fear of Mrs. A., 89, is to die "consciously and drowned".
But the disease has made her discover her children.
“I have good kids,” he adds.
“I don’t have any more wishes in this life,” she says, before agreeing to wear a mask to help her breathe.
And in the next few days, he expects a last visit from his son who lives in Italy.
In Victor-Gadbois, with a group of volunteers, body care and food assistance is offered.
It is palliative care that is given when nothing else can be done.
To help make his death more comfortable.
In Quebec we have one palliative care bed for every 11,700 inhabitants.
It's very little, since we all know we'll end up dying someday.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors at the center.
Whether at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
The dying are offered mouth rinses with brandy or Pepsi, according to demand.
Diabetics are no longer able to control their sugar levels.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served a beer to Mr. X, who died in the course of the night.
This morning, his son finished the beer at the feet of the deceased.
“We help both patients and their loved ones,” says Nathalie Savard, director of care.
In the Victor-Gadbois center, the days go by without ever being the same.
Next to a 94-year-old man tasting his last family reunion in the yard, well placed among his pillows as everyone drinks to his health, a 36-year-old dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two children, having tried everything to survive.
“For six months now, there have always been three to five beds occupied by people under the age of 45 who have cancer,” says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients who are admitted to the Victor-Gadboisarrivent center come from their home and 47% from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care designed to alleviate suffering when a patient reaches the terminal stage of their life, whether at home, in hospital or in a care center.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois Center and the Grand Montreal home palliative care society, specialize almost exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely this relative shortage in Quebec’s health care that causes many doctors specializing in palliative care to fear the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto signed by eminences of palliative care, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, is circulating to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec’s health care system is not competent enough to ensure that anyone has the right to quality palliative care before they agree to proceed with euthanasia.
“Recently,” she reports, “I’ve seen a patient spend 14 days in E.R.S. suffering great pain without doing what it takes to relieve her.
I'm afraid patients want to die just because they don't get the right care."
And at the same time, many oncologists persist with their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognosis.
Hél<0xC3><0xA8>ne Richard’s hopes of survival were already low when she left an exhausting chemotherapy treatment.
“When I told my oncologist that I wanted to stop treatment, she told me she was very sorry that I wanted to stop fighting,” she says.
"However, she had told me there was nothing else to do!"
There is no all-powerful care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who request to die thank their caregivers for not meeting their demands once their pain has been relieved thanks to a palliative care team.
But it has to be said that palliative care is absolutely not all-powerful in terms of pain treatment.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative home care at Grand Montreal, patients do not respond to pain treatments in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, which serves to sleep the patient until the moment of his death, either sporadically or permanently.
We cannot pretend that we do not understand that part of suffering.
Increasingly, unrelievable disease will have the possibility of having that palliative sedation.
The sick who are not relieved say the same thing: “I want to die.”
But that doesn’t necessarily mean “I want euthanasia,” but “I want relief.”
The realization of this report has been made possible thanks to a journalism scholarship from the health research institutes of Canada.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Road network officials, BTP entrepreneurs, fundraisers of political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia tell, day by day, what they know of a formidable “system”, of which the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafiososo are part.
An "industry" that was too expensive for Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
“It’s curious how the system is sprayed once we’ve hunted the mainstream media,” said Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec deputy and former chief of police in Montreal.
He led the outbreak of the scandal in 2011, which was made possible thanks to an in-depth investigation into road contract malpractices in Quebec, which the then liberal prime minister, Jean Charest, had agreed only to delay.
The Duchesneau report established a direct link between industry, clandestine party financing and corruption among officials.
“Since the start of the investigation in 2010, only the Department of Transportation would have saved billions of dollars in contracts,” containing some of its instincts to stay with a proportional share.
The Charbonneau Commission has "already dropped two mayors," he added, while he hopes to be able to "prove the existing stratagems behind the individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, created in 2011, also applies with its team of intervenors, researchers and government analysts.
This unit works in addition to the "Marteau squad" police, who, since 2009, have made Montreal's " sewer cartel" moderate when it comes to inflating contracts.
In recent weeks, the unit has filed a series of fraud and corruption charges against municipal officials such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a city outside.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his post as mayor of Laval, Quebec’s third city.
It is suspected that repeated bribes have been bagged in exchange for public contracts.
Montreal road network engineers and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accorso and Lino Zambito, have been formally charged.
The latter has caused shock by explaining to the commission the mechanics of the "system" for obtaining public contracts.
For three years, he himself paid 3% of the value of contracts obtained in Montreal to a Mafia-linked intermediary who transferred the money to Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambito distributed money to the right and to the left during the 2000s, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially to liberals in power.
He also admitted to having organized an illegal fundraiser for former Liberal Deputy Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Inflation in the cost of sewerage contracts
In Montreal, the “system” of corruption worked effectively.
Gilles Surprenant, an engineer of public works, explained it perfectly before the commission: in ten years he received gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games and bribes from construction companies for a total of $736,000, all in exchange for sewerage contracts whose cost was not exceeded.
Other road network officials have admitted they received money for inflating bills between 30 and 40 percent in terms of fake extras.
In addition, an organizer of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Tremblay of deliberately staring at a parallel budget and filling his coffins with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Tremblay resigned in early November and led to a massive crisis in Montreal.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first elected politicians in Montreal to sound the alarm.
As mayor of the district of Rivi<0xC3><0xA8>re-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, she opposed since 2010 the sale of municipal land purchased for $5 million and resold for 1.6 million to developers in full real estate boom.
70% of election campaign money was dirty money.
From the investigation that will eventually be carried out, she says she pulls “a thread to be able to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop gangrene and catch the culprits.”
And he adds that the process is “painful, but positive.”
We're clearing the wounds but we'd need a clean research unit in Montreal and be very alert so that dubious practices don't repeat themselves.
How to do the cleaning.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, declares that “officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars,” but is concerned especially about the role of the “elected politicians in the current of the strategy.”
Estimating at 70% the proportion of dirty money that was destined to fund election campaigns in Quebec, it is ironic: “I have been told that this is nothing more than a pale reflection of reality.”
The Quebec government proposes limiting donations to parties to $100, but that will not change the donation, according to him, "until election spending is strictly limited, there will be dirty money in politics."
He advocates a comprehensive review of the system of awarding public contracts and financing of parties: "We can't go lower; going to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow us to rebuild the house with a stronger foundation, with more controls and laws."
If this story spoils the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh to look in the mirror.
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season has acquired a new entity with PSG.
How would you explain that advance?
It could be explained by an individual awareness, but also by the new dimension of PSG.
Great players have arrived.
A day-to-day advance by your side.
The technical staff also helped me a lot.
And those elements push me every day to raise the level of my game.
In a game, that’s easier.
Everything is going very fast in football.
But I'm not hot.
From my beginnings at the INF Clairefontaine preformation center to my stroll through Saint-Etienne, I’ve always progressed in strides.
It will benefit from the competition recruited by Carlo Ancelotti.
This summer’s recruits are used to playing very high-level matches.
They know that every training is crucial.
That makes a player like me want to fight and give it all.
On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in terms of my positioning.
He's backed by adjuncts like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man who needed the team?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all technicians.
Today, there is no one equal in League 1 and is among the best European coaches.
He has a great experience and has won numerous titles with the best clubs.
He has worked with great players.
I think there will be other titles in Paris.
In January I had a very comforting conversation with him.
I just got out of a series of injuries.
The trust you have in me also explains my good performance.
What do you think of PSG in the first half of the season?
In League 1, Lyon has taken our leadership position.
But we're still in the ambush.
One of our biggest goals is the Champions League: we have qualified for the octaves in style.
What is the club’s goal in this competition?
We'll try to get as far as we can.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we have a lot to say in front of many very good European teams.
We want, to start, to finish the first of our league against Porto in order to be able to receive the round of octave finals.
Can PSG become a big European club in the short term?
You already have the budget...
To become a great European club, Paris has to win titles and be there in the long run.
Today, that is not the case.
At the economic level, the PSG is committed to its means for that project to be realized.
Not winning the Cup in League 1, as in the last season, would it be a big failure?
Of course, it would be a big disappointment.
This year we are going to invest all our efforts in bringing us that title of champion.
In the last season we didn’t get far.
In May we were disappointed, as we had the optimal conditions to finish first.
We had a strong season.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points we should have been champions...
But another team, Montpellier, had a better season.
This year I think it will be the good one.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have the weapons to take it.
Do you think the media expects more from PSG?
It’s normal that they expect a lot from us if we think about what has been invested in the players we have.
We have fully accepted it.
After we won 4-0 at home to Troyes, they still find things to blame us for is a bit frustrating.
We wonder what more people are waiting for.
We will never be able to win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We are trying to launch a game project.
A team is built over time.
In the Champions League we have shown that we can respond and be present.
Look at Manchester City who, after two seasons, has not managed to qualify for the finals, and they have also invested a lot!
In view of the amounts invested, we would imagine you with 15 points of advantage per day.
That would be neglecting our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not well the previous season, have been “driven” by this new PSG.
That proves that League 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we can say with a smile that, despite all the difficulties, we have ended up taking the trophy.
PSG seems totally dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s successes.
Let's just say we have a "golden independence."
That means that Ibrahimovic is very competent and that he scores a lot of goals.
He has come to prove that he is the star of League 1.
And he has shown in all the teams he’s been through that he’s a great player, a world star.
In the group we respect the man and the player.
And he also respects the men he has around him.
What he has done is truly exceptional.
That pushes others to increase their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows us all to progress.
How did you live the Euro 2012 with the French team?
It's been a disappointment.
I was very excited to participate in this European Cup.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from accumulating playing time.
I saw things there and came out reinforced.
Today I managed to play good games in the selection.
That's what I expected from my Baptism with the Blues.
We learned the lesson from what happened in Ukraine and that is because we have exemplary behavior today.
What vision do you have of the first month of Didier Deschamps at the front of the "blues"?
It's getting results.
They are well placed in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The coach is rigorous, close to the players and inspires to win.
As was the case with Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make comparisons.
Blanc achieved his goal of qualifying for the European Cup.
I hope Didier Deschamps leads the team to Brazil.
Did the 1-1 draw of October 16 in Spain serve to lay the groundwork?
That game gave us confidence.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before that shock in Spain, I had never experienced a similar game in my entire career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
In contrast to current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing charges between the parties.
Moreover, as is often the case with technologies, the political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, composed of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is at the same time a virtual currency convertible to dollars, euros, etc. and a secure exchange protocol in the manner of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files equal to equal.
Nearly 200,000 transactions have been registered thanks to 15,000 computers in the network.
And about a thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a form of payment.
The bitcoin quotation, after reaching the top of $30 (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>23) in June 2011, fell to $2 five months later, before going back to round ten dollars today (the quotations are listed on the bitcoincharts.com page).
It is not surprising if we compare it to global changes in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in it in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
In it, bitcoin was described as “the most successful virtual currency”, “competitive with the dollar or euro” and “similar to conventional currencies.”
Bitcoin differs from other systems with types of virtual currencies such as “credits”, used to advance in a video game and that can be won by playing or can be purchased (and even occasionally exchanged).
The social network Facebook also developed this type of system.
But in every exchange, a central authority controls and deals with changes.
With bitcoin, all network nodes are accountants, verifiers, currency issuers, and buyers and sellers at the same time.
How does that network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually done between two email addresses in the form of email.
A user can choose a different address for each payment, thus guaranteeing anonymity.
A set of information linked to this transaction is electronically signed through a double-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that bitcoin changes are contained in the public account book, which is spread throughout the network.
The key milestone is to write that new transaction in that book.
This goes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge thrown to computers and the winner, a kind of temporary central banker, will have the privilege of adding that complementary line.
This is a phase of file cutting, that is, transforming a large file into a shorter and unique numerical footprint.
Computers "take" the new transaction and add a number before "twisting" the set.
The goal is to find the number that offers a particular footprint (plus zeros at the beginning).
Once that number is found, the other nodes easily verify that it is the good one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of sets of the other transactions; any modification would change the footprint.
If, to commit a fraud, a user would like to pay twice with the same money very quickly (in less than ten minutes), the network would only accept as valid one of the two transactions; the other would be orphaned, as both have different footprints.
The computer that solves the challenge takes 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, that reward is divided into two regularly, likely before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible up to one hundred millionth, leaving a wide margin.
The difficulty of this challenge is also revealed in each increase in computing power.
The life of the network already has its ups and downs.
Websites that offer services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins have been stolen in deposit.
“The default used does not affect the same protocol,” says Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a real currency payment company that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also takes into account the possibilities of money laundering thanks to this anonymous service.
But cash has the same flaw.
Weight actors like Wikipedia reject payments of this type.
Others, like the WordPress platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, of the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the book of accounting and showed that about 80% of bitcoins do not circulate.
In November, the "giant rebates" were launched.
“They changed $30,000,” says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, author of a pedagogical book on that coin, believes a lot in the potential of this technology as well as in the network of transactions.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a contactless mobile payment, but uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which are cheaper.
The bearer also manages his identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system is easy to set up in stores, which do not have to install new terminals or software.
Just provide an address that a phone can “photograph and recognize,” says Pierre Noizat, who claims to have thousands of users.
There is a general movement to review hierarchical systems by more horizontal systems.
“It will take a while for Bitcoin to be imposed, but in 2013 there could be a change,” he predicts.
On the other hand, in its report the ECB intends to reassess the various risks, now considered high, in case this currency succeeds.
We have come out of Afghanistan.
And then?
French troops abandoned their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans are due to leave by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain possession of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, without expecting anything from us.
We have especially punished the Afghan peasants, whom we have considered terrorists.
And to ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, plus the wounded and the mutilated.
The Taliban have foreign extremists and former refugee chiefs in Pakistan, but often also peasants who reject the presence of the foreign army, as in Soviet times.
They want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even if their causes are joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks or Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes even aided by local insurgents, these will no longer be when Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the Nijrab base, which I observed from the top of the almond-planted hills thanks to French credits, was done by order.
The truck and tank convoys returned to Kabul without any attack, monitored by helicopters.
There will be no influx of Taliban in Kabul from the end of 2014.
Circumstances have changed since their irresistible advance between 1994 and 1996.
Kabul was then empty and the country wrapped in fire and blood because of the struggles between different factions.
His takeover of the country had been perceived as a kind of liberation, the return to security.
Afghans have paid the price for the obscurantism of their peasants outnumbered by the al-Qaeda organization, but their situation is no better today.
The old mujahideen, the current government and the current Taliban share a desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main personalities of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become speculators, making use of government land to resell them as solar for refugees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting along with huge U.S. outsourcing contracts.
They are discredited; most of them have not fought.
People, as I have heard in the field, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as well as those who have been able to take advantage of American generosity: the capital leakage is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
They have lived the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan and have appreciated their advantages.
With about 65% of its population under 25 years of age, Kabul currently has 5 million inhabitants, one-fifth of the total population.
In cities, state schools are full of both girls and boys.
There will have to be work for those young people who will not want to return to the obscurantism of the old parties or the corruption of certain leaders.
All, including the armed opposition, are eager for mobile phones, and the Turkish television and its newspapers presenting a modern world have great admirers all over the country.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities that want to run the country be considered legitimate?
The former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already concerned with reconstituting the provincial militias, which will flee from the central power.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from some decentralization in the image of Western nations, but the United States has wanted to transform it into a centralized state with a strong presidential power, suppressing the post of prime minister that has existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, particularly on the basis of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, your country has depended on foreign aid since the 1950s and even before.
No industry has re-established its services, no reservoirs have been repaired or major irrigation systems have been repaired.
Everything is imported and nothing is produced except fruits and vegetables.
Priority is left to the private initiative.
In a country ruined after 30 years of war, government control would have been necessary.
There was a rumor that Afghanistan possessed immense mineral wealth.
And that only increased the feeling that the Westerners were there to take over them.
Without energy to extract the iron or copper minerals from the ground and without means of transport to export them through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have already almost abandoned the copper mines of the month of Aynak, leaving international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) to excavate the immense Buddhist site and remain there as the province’s most important employers.
Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports depend largely, will also need to restore their normal relations.
The French troops left on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aids: girls' schools, children's schools, a French department at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, health and agricultural fields and support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, with the aim of trying to "win hearts and spirits" and to carry out the impossible task of making aid and offensive actions coincide, a service of "civil and military actions" of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), suppressed in 2012, brought and made to bring in a small local labor NGOs.
Those labors, delicious for obtaining local labor, have been able to help contain the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, sun protection and growing crop surfaces.
What will we leave as a souvenir after two million euros of military spending?
A rather modest budget will contribute to improving local living conditions, very harsh in those valleys often located more than 2,000 meters high.
The Embassy received dozens of written demands with small agricultural proposals made by local communities in Kapisa province.
In order to get rid of the insurrection carried out by foreign groups, something that farmers have told me they want, it would be necessary to maintain a little civil aid, well controlled and that comes directly to them.
A Constitution with forceps in Egypt
It is a new double or nothing from President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever in terms of the constitutional declaration, which gives it provisionally full powers, he decided to play the whole for the whole.
He caught everyone by surprise on Wednesday, when he announced that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the next day.
Only a week ago, the Head of State had given two more months to the Assembly to complete its work.
And for almost two years, Egypt has been using a provisional text, several times modified, which weakens institutional stability and leads to judicial clutter.
This new initiative has only increased the fracture in the country.
For his opponents, the president persevered in his “autocratic delirium” and continues to “treasure his word” and “smear the right.”
On the part of its supporters, it is assured that this is a measure to end the institutional and political crisis faster and speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be held in the next 15 days.
A very short period of time that forces the Brothers to give up their plan to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the president, it is also a way to regain popular and democratic legitimacy while the controversy wreaks havoc across the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote in his favor, as he said in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Considering that this resource has been voted very quickly, it contains an ultimatum for the Egyptian people: "either they vote my text or I keep the full powers", powers that are supposed to come to an end with the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in that strange environment in which 85 members of this Constituent Assembly, mostly Islamist, voted the text yesterday.
The majority of the Liberals did not attend the call.
By mid-November, just before the constitutional declaration, they had closed the door because they felt they could not validate their views.
Representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society did the same.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, yesterday morning 11 people, alternate members, were added in a hurry.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
As you might expect, the articles voted unanimously.
The commentators are pleased, on the other hand, that one of the few discrepancies of the day has been practically expressed at the time of prayer, so much so that several members of the committee came to think that the Constituent's watch was wrong.
The text, which was still being voted on yesterday afternoon, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, which is the subject of all eyes, remains at last identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, which stipulated that “the principles of Sharia constitute the main source of law”.
The Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a fundamental claim, hoped that "principles" could be replaced by "standards", which would have allowed for stricter application.
For Islamists, that this article has not been modified is a guarantee of their goodwill and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
Liberals call it hypocrisy and consider it to be nothing more than an advertising scam.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They refer, in particular, to article 220, which confers on Al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular for anyone who has to confirm their compliance with Sharia laws.
According to Egypt expert Sophie Pommier, it is disturbing because "the people called to pronounce are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
Here we glimpse the premises of a theocracy.”
The fears of liberals are further heightened by the fact that the next rector of such a university would be much less moderate than the current one.
“For now, there is no concrete religious involvement.
With this Constitution we are in the framework of the civil state.
Most of the jurists who have worked on this text are not ulemas, but university students, some of them trained in the French system,” explains Alexis Blouet, who prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges that there may be some ambiguity about article 220, as the terms used mimic the religious vocabulary.
"We refer specifically to the term iqh [Islamic jurisprudence, ndlr].
And the question that might arise in the future would be to what extent are the civil judges competent to pronounce themselves above all this.”
Beyond its religious character, the text voted yesterday has received many criticisms regarding the extended powers it confers on the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood will claim that they are few compared to those they were during the previous regime.
Another conflicting point: the powers conferred on the army.
According to the wishes of the military, the revision of the defense budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a national defense council.
Prosecutions of civilians in military courts will also not be banned, as requested by human rights associations.
They also showed their concerns regarding the text, which they consider libertarian.
The crime of blasphemy is maintained and, from now on, insults are prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially that of the press.
In addition, no article emphasizes the protection of women, emphasizes Heba Morayef, of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive has been the prohibition of torture in accordance with article 36.
The word was not in the previous Constitution.
Although the Egyptian president was due to leave last night on television, protests are scheduled for this afternoon.
The supporters of the head of state protested on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for the holy land, the navel of the world and a sea of brine
The Promised Land combines the majesty of biblical truths with modern comfort and pristine nature.
“AIF” identified the five most important reasons why you should visit Israel.
Reverence in the Holy Land
It is worth visiting the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that anyone who enters this "baptismal pillar" will receive divine grace.
And Galilee, the place of the miracles of Jesus: the conversion of water into wine at the wedding, walking on the waters, the appeasement of the storm and the crowded networks.
In this same place, Jesus appeared before his disciples after the resurrection.
But most of the holy places are in Jerusalem.
Believers walk here the Viacross or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (Latin for "Painful Way").
It begins at the Fortress of Antonio, the Pretoria, where the trial was carried out, and continues through the streets of the Old City, goes to the Holy Sepulchre on Mount Golgotha, the place of crucifixion, to the Stone of the anointing and to the place of the burial of Jesus.
In this same place is also the symbolic Christian Ombligo of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of humanity.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem, built in the place where, according to a Christian legend, there was a tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem there is also the holiest place for Jews, the Wall of Lamentations; the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
As is tradition, people of different religions leave here notes with their desires, which will then become reality.
Performing a vertical journey
The ruins of the Masada Fort were what remained of a secret refuge against the enemies, which Herod the Great ordered to build in 25 BC for his family.
They are located on mountain cliffs at an altitude of 450 m above sea level.
And get there by your own means, only those who are dedicated to climbing can.
Others can reach this historic summit in the funicular.
And in the north of the country at an altitude of 1600-2040 m is the famous ski resort Herm<0xC3><0xB3>n, where in the winter months there is a large influx of tourists.
There, from the foot of the hill, bus services are offered.
The total length of the ski slopes is 45 km.
According to an ancient legend, pagan gods were supposedly inhabited on the top of the mountain.
Visiting unique museums
In this country there are about 300 museums.
In a single trip you will not be able to visit them all.
But it is worth visiting at least five of them, the most interesting.
Among them is the Israel Museum, located near the Knesset (Israeli Parliament).
In it are preserved the ancient Dead Sea Manuscripts or Qumran Rolls, discovered in the caves of the desert of Judea, and about 500,000 archaeological and anthropological pieces.
It is worth visiting the Art Museum in Tel Aviv.
In his exhibition of paintings he has canvases of impressionists and expressionists such as Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall or Picasso.
In Acre you can visit the museum-bathroom Al Basha, which are some rooms of ancient Turkish baths with model figures of visitors and swimmers of that time.
In Caesarea it is worth going through the exclusive private museum Ralli, where you can admire the sculptures of Rodin and Dal<0xC3><0xAD>.
There are no tourist guides or souvenir shops there.
Entrance is free, and donations are categorically not accepted.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, shows one of the most dramatic pages in history.
The most tragic section is the Children’s Memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter it and you find yourself in absolute darkness.
The stars are shining.
And the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they lost their lives are heard.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Healthy
The three main tourist areas of Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of them there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanographic museums.
It is curious that in the Red Sea you bathe even in the winter months, as the water temperature does not drop to 21 degrees and the air is heated to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and there they bathe all year round.
By the way, this sea, the most extraordinary in the world, is located at the lowest point on the planet: at 417 m below sea level.
The blue waters there are a brine that can easily hold even those who don’t know how to swim.
The surrounding landscapes are truly beautiful.
People come here to take courses of treatment with salt water, brine and healing muds and to fortify their health in cases of dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and to fix their broken nerves.
Touching the mysteries of antiquity
They are preserved in the ancient part of Tel Aviv, the citadel of Jaffa, on the Mediterranean coast.
Through it passed the famous sea route that united Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it was here that Noah built his ark and Perseus rescued the beautiful Andromeda with whom, in this same place, he lived a long and happy life.
Tourists love to stroll through the narrow streets that bear the names of the zodiac signs.
They say that if you touch the walls on the street of your "same" symbol, the fortune will be favorable to you.
In Jaffa you can find newlywed couples who come from all over Israel, and even from other countries to photograph themselves.
And in Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can stroll through the Roman theater, "take" the fortress of the crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the principal city of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is now used for night concerts and opera performances.
Tourists remember.
If you travel to Israel, don’t worry if your English leaves much to be desired: in this country about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
The money for this trip is not recommended to carry it in euros, but in dollars, which can be easily changed to shekels (currently 1-3$.8 shekels).
Urban transport consists mainly of buses, but in Jerusalem there is a fast tram and in Haifa there is the only metro line in the country, which consists of six stations and connects the Lower City with the High City.
Actually, it's from an underground funicular.
Travel in any type of public transport costs 6 shekels and for this price you can travel by transshipment for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated on Saturdays.
From the evening of Friday until the sunset of Saturday, markets and shops close and public transport interrupts their work.
But on Sunday morning, a new work week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels only Kosher food is served, which excludes pork, seafood, shellfish and dishes in which milk and meat are combined.
There is a wide selection of dishes based on beef and lamb, soups and desserts prepared with coconut milk, the traditional Hebrew cream called hummus, a wide variety of sauces, the falafel, which are balls of ground chickpeas, fruits and vegetables.
There are no street dogs in the streets of Israeli cities.
Instead, there are many well-fed cats that "walk to their liking" imposingly.
At night you can see them sleeping even on the roofs of parked cars.
Snorners love busy places and don’t reject treats.
Renting a car, depending on the brand, will cost from 37$ (Hyundai Getz) to 188$ (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day.
In addition to insurance, it comes out for $15 a day.
And renting a bike will cost you 15 shekels a day.
Tickets to museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
Israel in numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
The majority of those who came to visit the country and rest were citizens of the US, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and Ukraine.
The Promised Land, from January to October 2012, was visited by 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists, an amount that exceeds by 51% on the same index of the year 2010, before the cancellation of the visa regime on February 9, 2011.
"The great and powerful" will take you to Moscow: immigrants save for language
While deputies and human rights defenders discuss the consequences that the law would bring about mandatory review, timmerers have already appeared in the country who trade with "false" certificates.
Every year, 13 million migrant workers arrive in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asian countries: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make money to help their families who have stayed at home.
From December 1, a law comes into force, according to which every working immigrant will have to take an exam to check his knowledge of the Russian language.
For now, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service sector, community service institutions, domestic services and retail.
However, over time, as promised by the Federal Immigration Service, exams will become mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, it will not be enough to pass the examination of the language, if not also the Russian history and the fundamentals of the legislation.
The knowledge of the language must be confirmed even to receive and renew the work permit.
Citizens of countries where Russian is the official language are the exception.
Persons who succeeded in obtaining their education certificates and diplomas before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 shall not be subject to this law.
Usefulness, Fatality and Defending of Rights
The network of examination centres will operate under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, the University of Peoples’ Friendship, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian higher education institutions.
Immigrants will be able to take the test in all cities, right now in Russia more than 160 centers of this type are open.
The initiative on the introduction of the review was supported by the State Duma deputies and by the Federal Immigration Service.
But rights defenders, long before the law came into force, managed to ask this question many times to the press: And what will this actually bring?
What changes will the obligatory knowledge of the language bring, both for the Russians and for the immigrants themselves?
In the first place, the representatives of the Immigration Service respond, this will reduce the number of people suffering from "labour slavery".
Many people are talking today about defending the rights of working immigrants, explains Victor Sebelev, head of the representation of the Federal Immigration Service of Russia in Tajikistan.
The defense of your rights must begin before your departure.
Only an organized selection system will solve the problem of migrant workers in 90% of cases.
The problems are those of immigrants without profession, education, those who do not know the language or pass medical checks.
Without understanding the language, Sebelev says, the future immigrant will be condemned to find unscrupulous people who, on the pretext of helping, put a "paid trip" to a scary and narrow cow, where he and dozens of others like him are consumed for months without food or documents, working from 14 to 12 hours.
We have received countless complaints from our immigrants.
“In their homeland they are promised one thing, but when they arrive they are deceived, they are deprived of their passports, they are not paid the promised wages,” Tolib Sharipov, head of the Tajik Immigration Service’s Directorate of Labour Immigration, said in a statement.
Don't be mad, boss!
However, in the meantime, many citizens of the Central Asian republics who wish to work in Russia recognize that they not only do not know the language of the country to which they intend to go, but also write with difficulty in their own language.
Of course, this is not so much his fault but his own misfortune: there are few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks who can afford to receive normal primary education.
This is because their families don’t even have anything to feed the children, not to mention dressing them, footwearing them and buying them what they need for school.
Upon reaching adolescence, these boys venture to work at the first opportunity.
It is difficult, if you do not know the language, recognize them.
"One feels humiliated and inferior."
However, with regard to the law on language, advocates of rights point out an important point.
Examinations will be conducted only for immigrants whose legal status is required.
If they do not have that status, there will be no examination and consequently no official work.
Meanwhile, most migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or forbidden to pass to strangers"
Many visitors claim that receiving official status in our country is not so easy.
The cause lies in the bureaucratic obstacles and the difficulties of the language itself.
In addition, legalization costs money: from twelve thousand to sixteen thousand rubles.
However, a false registration can be done quickly and for only one thousand five hundred rubles.
Russian police officers know that we usually carry fake documents, we are not registered and cases of extortion appear.
“They ask us for a hundred or two hundred rubles for cigarettes or tea,” Umed Hushkadamov, a citizen of Tajikistan, told reporters.
"Come on, don't be lazy, buy a painting"
On the first day of the entry into force of the language law, it was revealed that not only immigrant registration documents can be false.
Several “false” certificates of knowledge of the language have already been seized by officials of the Federal Immigration Service.
The falsified documents had been printed on standard color printers.
Of course, they came to the hands of the new owners not as a gift: each immigrant, wanting to facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is two and a half times more expensive than the official examination procedure, which will cost the immigrant worker three thousand rubles.
The main task for the near future is to protect the system from corruption so that “diplomas” cannot be bought, government officials and rights defenders converge.
So far, the authorities can promise migrant workers that they would not have been able to successfully pass the exam for the first time longer to study the basic language course.
In addition, immigrants who do not speak Russian will be offered jobs that do not require active communication with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not take drastic measures against the illegal arms trade
The percentage of crimes committed with registered weapons is quite small
The Ministry of the Interior proposes to apply the law more rigidly in relation to owners of weapons of civilian use.
This is the government’s reaction to the recent incidents: To squeeze shots during wedding celebrations in which fortunately there were no victims, and the massacre initiated by Moscow lawyer Dimitri Vinogradov, in which squeeze seven people lost their lives.
The police want to ban the use and possession of traumatic weapons in public places and raise the minimum age for obtaining a license to carry weapons, from 18 years to 21 years.
This idea was supported by the head of the Duma’s committee on security and anti-corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that reforms to the gun ownership law will be brought to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is happy with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to counter this problem by applying the “hard-handed policy”.
An open letter has appeared on the network, the authors of which, representatives of various social organizations of shooters, demand that such measures of "senseless rigour" be renounced.
The percentage of acts of vandalism using registered weapons is minimal, said Russia's BBC news service, criminal lawyer Vasiliy Lésnikov.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, during six months of 2012, 142 offences were committed with the use of firearms registered in internal organs, compared to a total of 1,168 offences registered for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that stricter legislation in the civilian arms sector will not be an inconvenience for the offender to go to the black market.
Now, according to his words, in Moscow you can find any weapon at a low price.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior says that the situation of the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officials
The black market of weapons is supplied through several channels.
The main channels are years, says retired Colonel V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor Baranets, who worked for ten years in the Ministry of Education and in the Higher Staff.
Screenshot of the website that accepts weapons orders
The first, "army or military vestige," i.e., weapons that were stolen during military actions in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by Russian officers and by the same Caucasians," Baranets said.
The next type of "black weapon", stolen by criminals and representatives of the security forces.
Baranets explains that this includes the stolen weapons from police warehouses and those stolen directly by law enforcement officials.
Illegal weapons go on sale from military arsenals.
In many military arsenals there were often explosions.
“There are proven versions that some fires were premeditated to cover the lack,” one ex-military said.
According to Baranets, weapons manufacturers also put their sand granite.
“They have now proliferated private arms factories that are not competitive in the international market and distribute weapons under a rope to the black market, including that of Moscow,” he said.
Another source of the black market is smuggling.
A large number of guns and machine guns come from poor countries like Kyrgyzstan.
“There they have their own production, sometimes craftsmanship, and a mafia has formed that has organized the flow of weapons,” explains the ex-military.
Where do the weapons come from?
Experts have calculated the approximate share of each of these sources of illegal arms supply to the black market.
A report on this issue was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Public Management Planning.
The experts analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminological literature and public access data from portals whose theme revolves around weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to investigators, come from the armed forces and security forces.
Half of the black market’s weapons have arrived there “because of officials whose work is related to weapons,” the report says.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from places where there are armed conflicts, 14% of the cases are stolen during the production of weapons and 5% corresponds to “illegal archaeology.”
The gun dealer, who asked his last name not to be mentioned, says the weapons found by illegal excavators have not been bought for a long time because they are too old.
More often, he says, suppliers go to military warehouses when they need a departure.
Through some bracket, the supplier purchases a unit, for example a TT gun.
They remove it from the register and pass it over the fence.
“This brings the gun to the city and sells it for 900 euros per unit with two chargers,” he tells us.
“But, of course, the police are aware of all matters, so periodically, when the crime discovery plan has to be fulfilled, they make test purchases to illegal arms dealers.”
"Like in a luxury boutique"
The seller and the buyer usually meet through acquaintances.
"I visited websites and blogs until a guy who proposed to me to go to the Begovaya platform, where I would be a man who would take me to a "skinny" where we could negotiate.
From the price of the gun, I will find out only there.”
Military commentator Viktor Baranets
“To get a gun I need a friend who has contacts,” says the store addict. “I have a friend like that, but I don’t trust him very much.”
In the markets there are sellers, but there you also have to get there, say "from Mr. Ivanovich, who asked me to tell him that a tooth had fallen on his daughter".
I can even get a pair of steel cuffs through a trusted person.
He also supplies them to me only because he knows I’m not going to betray him.
Novices are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former militaryman Viktor Baranets was put to the test as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when he was willing to publish an article on the subject.
The schematics, according to your words, have not changed.
They gave him a photo album where there was no "everything".
“I felt like in a luxury boutique,” the military recalls.
The buyer, in the words of Baranets, is not offered a cat for a hare: anything there can be tried.
I, as a potential customer, not only buy; we go with the seller to the forest, where we put a target.
“They give me the chance to shoot and when I make sure the gun is firing well, we start negotiating,” the expert said.
Shop of sofas
Web search engines lead to "Vkontakte" sites and groups, where it is offered to buy weapons "for different purposes".
No documents or personal meetings are required for this.
“It’s enough to have a certain amount of money,” they write in the headline of the ad, “Buy a gun or machine gun.”
There users place their orders and ask questions.
And they sell to minors?
"Without permission, of course," asks the user "Iv<0xC3><0xA1>n" (conserved spelling).
"Compro pistol TT. Moscow", laconically formulates his question "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictional websites and captures those who want to buy firearms.
And people go, like hungry fish to the bait, and then, to extract coal in Siberia
Military and ex-military commentator Viktor Baranets
I have heard of these systems: usually, the website is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People make orders.
The buyer makes the payment through an ATM.
“In response, they send him a photo and instructions so he knows where the weapon is hidden,” says the NGO’s press secretary for the right to arms, Dmitri Kislov.
Viktor Baranets claims that if an online order is made, one is left without a gun and put in jail.
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictional websites and captures those who want to buy firearms.
“And people go, like hungry fish to the bait, and then to extract coal in Siberia,” he says.
Makarov for 100 dollars
In the purchase of illegal firearms, according to experts, one can spend 100 to 900 dollars.
According to Dmitri Kislov of the NGO "The right to arms", a Makarov gun can be purchased for 100-300 dollars.
It will have to wait a month and a half.
It is shipped from military warehouses by middle-ranked chiefs.
According to official statistics of the ministry, compared to the period January-October 2011, the total number of these crimes in Russia decreased by 7%, which constitutes 22,900, and the number of identified cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosives artifacts decreased by 7%.
Employees of fast food restaurants and supermarkets in the U.S. are on strike.
Up to a quarter of U.S. teenagers find their first cashier jobs at "McDonald's"
In recent days, there has been a wave of protests against the low wages paid in Walmart supermarkets and restaurants in popular fast food chains such as "McDonald's", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken".
For now, no one dares to ascertain whether or not this wave will reach the nine points, or whether it is intended to lose strength and wail in its early stages.
The protests are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing NGOs.
In addition to the increase in modest wages received by Walmart workers and those of the fast food system, the protest organizers’ goal is to create workers’ unions in these companies.
For now, this sector of the economy has practically not been occupied by the trade union movement.
Forty-six cents a year?
The action began last week, after Thanksgiving, the so-called “Black Friday,” that day, in the United States, the orgy of discounts co-occurred that captured millions of inhabitants, and that was sometimes accompanied by clashes.
That day, some workers from the Walmart corporation, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, left their jobs and formed protest pickets with left-wing unions and activists in the corporation’s stores, whose products target people of modest and moderate income.
Walmart sells everything from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products in their stores are on average between 8% and 27% cheaper than those in larger supermarkets.
That’s why many poorly paid Walmart workers buy only at work.
The availability and range of products have made Walmart one of the largest corporations in America.
According to two critics, Walmart can afford to sell products at a very low price, partly because it pays its workers little.
The latter also complain of poor working conditions, such as the lack of forklifts or hand-held scanners.
That "Black Friday" protesters demanded a raise in wages and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation rose from $30 to $100 a month.
For a typical Walmart worker, who receives $9.5 an hour, this expense is excessive, they said.
Scientists at the University of California at Berkeley argue that if Walmart raises the average wage to $12 an hour, it will cost the corporation $3.2 trillion.
This is about 1.1% more than you spend on salaries now.
If Walmart places the wage increase on consumers’ shoulders, every visit to the store will cost them only 46 cents more.
In one year they will spend the ridiculous amount of $12.39 more than they spend now.
Walmart supporters are satisfied that the protest took place in only nine states and did not cause any loss to the corporation.
Black Friday continued in its stores from 8 p.m. on Thursday to midnight the next day, and during that time, Walmart sold around 5,000 items per second.
In total, their cash registers made "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.
The company's representative, Dan Fogelman, said in an interview with the left-wing Huffington Post website, that they left their job "less than five" Walmart employees and that the protest had been nothing more than "another public relations trick", organized by the workers' union.
"Free box!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where the targets were not the Walmart department stores (which in this progressive city do not appreciate them, and therefore for now there are none), but the "McDonald's" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald’s says it sells billions of servings, and then they don’t even give you the sick leave and they don’t pay you for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, New York City City Council member
Currently, according to federal and New York law, the minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food restaurants are increasing over time, but only slightly, and on average, ordinary workers in New York get $8.90 an hour.
No one earns less than them in this city.
How it is possible to survive in New York with that money, for me it is something incomprehensible.
There was a time when nearly a quarter of U.S. teenagers were passing McDonald’s and working there, behind desks, part-time after school, although they still lived with their parents.
Few people saw this as the main source of income or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now, I constantly stumble upon some interviews with McDonald’s workers who complain that they have to live on this salary, and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, in a Wall Street Journal forum there is a comment whose author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know what to feed them with.
Participants in the protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at McDonald’s on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and fast food chefs start paying at least $15 an hour, i.e. double their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that workers' unions be created in the fast food sector.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from impeding this right and punishing trade union activists with arbitrariness and dismissal.
On the other hand, administration rarely makes life easier for them.
But for objective reasons, it is easy for unions to cover the fast food sector.
One of the main ones is the excessive rotation of staff.
Discordant
Loud protests took place that same day in other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The climax of the action took place in the middle of a rally at McDonald's near Times Square, in which several local Democrat politicians took part, in particular City Councillor Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald's says he's selling billions of jobs."
The protesters received support from other prominent New York Democrats, such as New York City mayoral candidate Bill de Blasio, who said that "we must support fast food workers so that they can get fair wages and the economic prosperity every New Yorker deserves."
As described by the New York Times, this has been the largest demonstration of its kind in American fast food history.
But only a few hundred people participated in it, even not all of them were employees of the fast food service, in which tens of thousands of people from New York worked.
It is not yet clear whether this will serve as a spark to provoke a mass movement.
"For now, cheating on the brain is not that easy"
The theme of augmented reality, so popular among fans of modern technologies, is recently normally perceived mainly through the prism of special glasses.
In early summer, at its annual conference, Google demonstrated a moving model, and later, in November, it became known that Microsoft had also filed an application to claim the corresponding patent.
However, from a conversation with the head of the 3D interactive technology group in Cambridge’s Microsoft lab, Izadi Sharamom, it was diluted that for the company’s scientists, the glasses already belonged to a past stage.
They are attracted by the perspective of the manipulation of virtual objects in the air with their bare hands and the creation of open virtual spaces.
- Please, in general terms, what is the study object of your research group?
- We are dedicated to the person-computer interaction, but we also try to expand the boundaries of this interaction.
For now, humanity in its great mass has been trapped in the working stage with the pixels of the flat screen, sometimes touching it with the finger.
But we want to look 5-10 years ahead and guess the cardinal changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors represent a step forward and today no Xbox is sold without Kinect, as everyone is interested in gesture control.
- What else does the future hold for us?
Although Kinect has brought the interaction to the physical level, much of it still happens on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information has improved (the system receives more data), and the output is still not very good.
We’re trying to change this, we’re working on truly three-dimensional visualization systems, based on different technologies, including design ones.
The world of computing must be freed from ours, the physical, to make it more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also the space around him.
Then we can complete the real world with virtual objects in a more comfortable way.
First of all, the devil with those stupid virtual reality helmets!
What do you think about voice control?
A very popular detail, but don't you think they overestimate it?
- Of course, it cannot be considered a panacea, it is pending to resolve the issue of privacy, as you do not always want others to know about our actions and intentions.
In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but each in its own field.
For example, for controlling devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not in loose movements, but shorter ones.
In addition, the gestures were captured not by the device’s camera, but by a bracelet that recorded the movement of the bones and muscles.
For now it is very large, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But, in general, the future is for a combined type of control, e.g. gesture <0x2B> voice.
- How's that?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass you this can of soda?
You will talk and show it at the same time.
- Normally I just talk.
- Oh, that's going to be very hard to recognize.
- That is, do you want to force users to adapt to what the machine can or can't do right now?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual approach.
I think in the near future we will have to work mainly on the design of new types of sensors that can accurately determine the reactions of the person.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, as they provide a good resolution in depth, which is very important.
- If we talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what complaints do you have about modern cameras?
Do they lack resolution, depth or something else?
In principle, the current generation is what can be the beginning of our work with three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at the speed of 1000 fps.
But the question is not in megapixels, but in the quality of the matrix and in depth.
From this latter point of view, not all current technologies are good enough for us; this gives more work to algorithm designers.
That is, we have to remember not only the resolution on the X and Y axes, but also on Z.
Also important is the speed, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic and the current 30 fps are really scarce, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our lab in Redmond, made a contact sensor with an adjustable processing delay of 1 to 100 ms and it should be mentioned that modern sensors produced in series are closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands the extent to which this affects human-machine interaction.
To me it would be very useful for my work an equivalent of such a device, but that does not require contact for the frames per second to be more.
Is it necessary to increase the number of cameras?
The Kinect now has three “cameras”, one of which is actually the infrared emitter and the second the receiver of the reflected signal.
But the third camera is actually a simple sensor of the visible slide.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially, more cameras could solve the problem...
Or on the contrary, increase it and increase the required amount of calculations.
It would be good to create a flexible Kinect analog, play with the camera’s location curvature and see how this would help determine the three-dimensional position.
As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, has not presented its glasses to the public.
Do you not think that, from the point of view of the daily use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the most visible platforms?
- Of course, spending all the time holding up a smartphone in your hands, it's not very comfortable, but I think: the best option would be a "transmutable" augmented reality when, based on a cloud platform, you could switch from glasses to smartphone,
Glasses are very personal devices, in that is their strength (private things only you can see them), but also their weakness: an augmented reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark from the film "Iron Man", but also to any simple mortal.
There is a problem with this idea that critics often point out: there is no tactile response!
The hands don't feel anything!
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
In my lectures I often say that augmented reality is the seventh eruption in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth might well be the addition of tactile sensations.
Meanwhile, one of the most interesting tricks is the use of second hand as a support for the image.
Record the touch perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are truly oriented to bring tangibility to these "images in the air." For example, the interference of several ultrasonic rays directed at a specific point where the finger is located gives a feeling similar to that one feels if someone was blowing it on the fingertips, but that feeling is still very much.
There are also wrist bracelets that influence the nerve endings of the fingers, this also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to trick the brain?
Make him think he feels what he should feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried it yet.
Here is another challenge that we will have to fight for a long time, how to make a person physically located in a very small space believe that it goes to an open space, almost endless. We are also working on the idea of treadmills (not like those of gyms), mobile platforms, as well as that of giant balloons.
For now, cheating the brain is not so easy, you still have to work for many years.
That’s what makes working with virtual reality attractive to researchers, who find many things in a state of total conception.
Subjective personal taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "St. Petersburg Vanguardism", dedicated to the citizens who are in front, at the forefront of art and culture.
In this list of the best there are brilliant figures of art and the scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements reach beyond the city: they often find recognition in Europe without Russia even knowing them.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city meets Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed in red from the top down, who can be found near the Russian Museum, near the Summer Garden or at fashion meetings and inaugurations.
Kirill Miller’s paintings always attract crowds, wherever they are displayed.
Kirill Miller is one of those purely socio-philosophers of St. Petersburg, creators of new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant representative of the St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 80s - early 90s.
In addition, he is an urban man, whose appearance in the streets of the city awakens the smiling inhabitants and raises everyone’s mood.
Recently, he took in his hands an organelle and became the organizer of St. Petersburg, as he has matured to make such a difficult role, for his Bohemian existence, his philosophy and his image.
Kirill, why do you go around the city dressed in red and not yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose the color red because I am a fashion designer and I dedicate myself to appearance and image.
In this world, red is a commitment between the artist, the creators of images and society.
Although in society, anything other than a little gray arouses aggressiveness and agitation of nothing good properties.
But my provocations are aimed at initiating a conversation.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to debate.
- When did you realize you were supposed to be an artist?
- In an exhibition at the Nevsky Palace of Culture, where my works were exhibited.
I realized that was my way.
Then the wave of old unofficial artists had ended, and the new ones, free like me, were still misunderstood.
I became friends with artists of the new wave, with the subsequent ones that were exposed in Gaza and Nevskiy, which led to "Pushkinskaya-10", and the new wave is over.
I went to the theater for clothes, music of all genres, but not for lyrics.
And all this came together in your Art Clinic... it was important to me to be in the St. Petersburg cultural center, where the best creative minds were supposed to gather.
In 1995, I occupied a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and there, while there were no reforms, there was a music art club, a bohemian club, the bohemian house of St. Petersburg.
Many were born there: Noms, Tequila Jazz, I remember the way Schnur brought the project to "The Ear of Van Gogh".
Schnur and his friends sang light songs under phonograms, wore tight pants, among them was the current fashion composer Igor Vdovin.
When the group started playing live, it became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg was the animator of many programs before the times of Hali-galivskih.
We gave it to Trachtenberg and it was the beginning of his great career; basic education and training received it from us.
Gallery "D 137", the "Club Griboyedov, are the remains of the Art Clinic.
That’s where our employees and customers went.
I'm a hero of the last century, when culture meant something.
In 2000, the poll was made in the press, the award was "The people of our city".
In the nomination "Artist of the Year" I was elected myself, so ended my climax.
In these new times it is not comfortable to work; I am a man who likes the truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In our times it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are separated. One can be popular but very little cult.
- There's something recognizable about your work.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they clearly express the actuality and occurrence.
I'm going to do a scheduled exhibition, "The Russian Museum in Clowns."
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be sociable, but now being like that is painful and frightening.
But in the clowns everything is embroidered and tragedy is eliminated.
I love the grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the salvation of the world through a totalitarian and obligatory change of clothes.
Now one is followed by clothes, oriented on the outside, but not on the inside of the person.
And, perhaps, that person should not be given a hand, but spit on his face.
And the deception will be eliminated when you change your clothes.
- We just saw you in the role of urban organizer. - A cult city must have a hero like that.
Who better than I to be!
- Well, but, at best, commercial art can be beautiful?
- Now the commercial art must be scrupulous, sweet, have touch.
We are witnessing the disintegration of cultures.
Before people were grouped into herds, the Bohemians wanted one thing, the Simplons the other.
Now everyone has split into micro-communities, it’s hard to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar bill to please everyone.
Now you have to think about who you want to like.
Now, each cult hero has its 100 fans.
- And to listen to Stas Mikhailov come for thousands!
- They're going to see the abandoned ones, that's where the sex-social sphere works.
And at a cultural event, 300 people go, 10,000 will never come. As a result, less management, less money, everything goes away.
I have my fans, the most important thing is not to deceive them, not to lose what you have achieved.
When he was young he made such paintings that a collector had them hung on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings, with which people usually end up.
Now they often confuse concepts.
They say spiritual culture, culture of consumption.
There is no culture in consumption, that is another story.
I am a man of yesterday’s culture, I grew up under the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, who refused money just to paint paintings.
I am in favor of this culture.
Kirill, what's wrong with St. Petersburg?
- Good experts in culture.
There is a concept: culture official.
But not all of them can be devoted to culture.
When the kings were the right things were different, the kings may not understand culture very well, but they knew that it was necessary to keep the right experts.
There are now very good consultants in Moscow.
We have people in St. Petersburg who might well be experts, but they are closed down, because you need top-level experts who properly evaluate these and get them on their way.
The subjective personal taste is now thriving.
The same Erarta, but the difference is that they honestly say that not all modern art is accepted, there are some artists who have to look for other museums.
- What's St. Petersburg for you?
- St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital. In Moscow there is much more culture, there is land.
But on our stones it is difficult for art to grow.
We need cultural ground and we now have more writers than readers, this is wrong.
In Europe there are a lot of curious people who go to exhibitions and concerts.
In our case, this class is small.
We have to make art fashionable, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project will be implemented with a St. Petersburg grant.
Giving birth in space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
Spaceship caravans with humans on board leave in search of a replacement planet.
In order to preserve humanity, the main question is: How to continue the species in conditions of weightlessness or on the same replacement planet?
I think there is little to choose from.
In fact, only two are real planets that can be colonized, at least hypothetically.
“These are Venus and Mars,” says the head researcher at the State Astronomical Institute, Sternberg P.K. (IAES), Vladimir Surdin.
But if the conditions on Mars are better for life, on the surface of Venus the temperature is 500 degrees.
You can only live at high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
The problems of reproduction in space with the flora began to be addressed.
Experiments with plants have been carried out for half a century.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit differed in nothing from terrestrial varieties.
Then came the breeding of insects in the orbit, small fruit flies, the drosophila.
In 1979, egg yolks were sent to space to check how the embryo develops in conditions of obesity.
As a result, we get a normal chicken.
But then the problems begin.
“The problem is that this chicken has to find support, it has to stay on its own feet and start moving,” explains Vladimir Sychev, the laboratory director of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IPBM) of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
When no support was found, the chickens randomly returned.
And after 10 hours in newborns there was a total atrophy of the instincts.
Chickens did not react to light or sound.
And the misfortune was that after four days they simply died.
“And twice we got the chickens born, but then we left it because it was impossible to work there with them,” says Vladimir Sychev about the failure of the experiment with the chickens in space.
The last time a biological "miniarca" flew into orbit was 16 years ago.
Experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, in the biosatellite "Bion" will only travel species of the same sex.
There was an experiment with rats, which were sent to space already with fetuses.
In principle, nothing supernatural was found.
“This was precisely in the biosatellites, but this was a unique experiment, and studies like this should be carried out,” says Vladimir Sychev.
After the landing, the space rats had offspring.
However, the problem of reproduction directly in space has not yet been addressed.
It's a tough challenge.
Animals, by losing their habitual habitat, simply cannot realize their sexual instinct.
Man, however, unlike small animals, in principle, can.
The Homo sapiens has the abstract reasoning and is able to create an appropriate emotional background.
Similar experiments are not carried out for ethical reasons.
But women have been traveling in space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was Tereshkova.
And the most precious thing that humanity has is the female organism.
Our gull flying, and no one on Earth could say: if it is after a flight into space.
You may or may not have a baby after this flight.
"After all, no one has answered this question," commented the veteran of the aerospace sector Vakhtang Vachnadze.
In June 1964, just after a year of space flight, the first woman cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The girl's father, Andrian Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman cosmonaut, Svetlana Savitskaya, who was twice in orbit and even worked in open space, had a son.
However, the risk persists.
We are few, the astronauts are told to whom after long flights everything has worked out well, and a healthy generation is growing.
"And if more can be said, it is dangerous even in orbital flights," sums up the cosmonaut pilot, hero of the Soviet Union, hero of Russia, Valery Polyakov.
However, humanity must seek some new ways in biotechnology, in radiological protection, in the creation of artificial gravity.
The Cosmonaut Preparation Center’s hydrolaboratory is a mandatory stage in flight preparation.
In conditions of zero floatability, cosmonauts practice their working skills in space.
The water begins the insufficiency.
If for an adult the water is a comfortable environment, although still hostile, for a newborn it is its birth element.
The small amphibious men seem to confirm that life on earth originated from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is about 9 months inside his mother in the amniotic fluid, as it will be easier for him to get used to the water afterwards.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth to the moment of the first bath only 2 weeks pass.
“This is too little to forget about,” says Marina Aksenova, a newborn swimming monitor.
In short, if pregnancy is a more natural state for a newborn, for women it is necessary gravity, the strength of gravity.
In weightlessness, the abdominal and pelvic muscles decrepit very quickly, the ability to expel the fetus is reduced.
Well, we omit that, relying on the action of stimulants for childbirth.
You can, of course, give birth in a special camera, this will push you.
"And then what?", Valeri Polyakov asks this original question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without the feeling of gravity, the body does not generate the skeleton or the muscular system.
A newborn in orbit is impossible to wear a special suit for training, such as for adults.
You will simply be deprived of what is vital to him.
“And this experiment that we are going to do together, by allowing the birth of a child in a strange environment, will lead to bringing to Earth a disabled person, a totally inappropriate person,” says Igor Pestov, head of the bioethics committee of the Institute of Biomedical Problems at the Russian Academy of Sciences.
For now, the birth of children in space is a theoretical issue.
However, over time this will be a reality, when human beings on their ships head to a distant planet that will be home to their children born in space.
Head of NK<0xC3><0x9A>: The inspection of the system "<0xC5><0xA0>varc" has not given with the politician guilty
In the field of public procurement, the Czech Republic has good inspectors and quality legislation, although its application is stagnant.
This is stated by Miloslav Kala, vice president of the Office of Supreme Control (NK<0xC3><0x9A>) in an interview for Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz.
“The law will never be perfect,” but its application must be correct. “This is, in my opinion, what we lack,” the current situation describes.
Joint checks by Czech and German inspectors also come to similar conclusions.
As an example of an incorrect practice, he mentions Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as' attitude towards the system of being autonomous only on paper, which is known as the "<0xC5><0xA0>varc" system.
The prime minister recently said that the SDG (Civil Democratic Party) would not bother entrepreneurs with inspectors, so is it forbidden or allowed?
“The law must be regulated in some way and if it prohibits anything, in that case, neither the president of the government can prevent the office from acting that has the obligation to carry out such checks or require obligations,” Kala said.
At the meeting of the Control Committee in the Congress of Deputies, you spoke about the joint project between the Czech and German team, in which the legislation on public procurement in both countries was compared.
Exactly what is it?
This is a parallel control that we started doing about two years ago.
Put simply: European legislation regulates how public procurement should be organised, followed by the legislation in force in each country and then by the practice itself.
We have brought it all together and, although the control has not yet been completed, we have obtained very interesting differences. Generally, the legislation of our country is "more stringent and more complete", however, the concrete practice in some parameters is better in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to incorporate increasingly strict rules, but that it is necessary to focus on the implementation of the law itself.
What can this project actually bring? What do you think are the conclusions?
Precisely a joint control of this kind could help us to stop investing in lawmaking, reducing and improving limits, even if this does not have such a positive impact.
The economy of savings means getting a proper thing at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the price is the lowest) to avoid enrichment and, in the long run, criminal actions.
But not by lowering the limit of the allocations means that we are going to achieve it.
Perhaps because the system is saturated with so much "paperwork", those who want to look for failures in the system will be able to do so more easily than if the limits were kept as high as they are now.
You talk about the problems of our country with the transfer of the legislation regulating the practice of public procurement.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is it an office similar to our NK<0xC3><0x9A> or is it organized in a different way?
In so far as the offices, such as the NK<0xC3><0x9A>, there is the Bundesrechnungshof, with an organization similar to ours, with a school as well, the only thing is that in their case it is structured in a somewhat different way, but in principle both offices evolve in parallel.
Competencies are also to a certain extent analogous, however, as Germany has a federal organization, the Courts of Auditors are even at this level. In this respect it differs slightly from our system.
The Federal Court of Accounts (BRH) can only control federal money, which here we call state funds.
Public funds, which are administered by the regions and municipalities, there, in Germany, are controlled by the Federal Court of Auditors.
As for local legislation, is it simpler than ours?
I would generally not like to make a comparison without specific data, but Germany remains a model in some respects, but it cannot be precise in what is better.
Could it be better, for example, with regard to the quality of inspectors?
Of course not, but, I repeat, I don’t like to make such comparisons.
It is necessary to say that even those countries that we take as a model have to deal with a large number of problems.
If it wasn't, it wouldn't be of any benefit to you to collaborate with our office, wouldn't you think?
With regard to the legislation of our country, what did the amendment of the law on public procurement mean to your Office, and does its impact in any way manifest?
Given that the validity period of this amendment is relatively short, it has not yet been manifested in the control actions.
Since we perform ex-post checks, we need to have a certain delay.
For now, it is observed in the process of preparation of future controls: we have launched a new tool of "detection of non-economic risks", by which we have passed almost 14,000 public tenders, which have been analyzed. The changes will be perfectly reflected here, as the limits are modified, the conditions of some types of selection process are corrected.
Do you believe that the passing of this law is beneficial or that it is rather a mess for the bureaucratic system?
I think this law is surely a step in the right direction and I hope so.
The problem that may arise is that the regulation "hardens" and that it is impossible to comply with it.
Already with the previous legislation, the controlled persons were linked to the contractor (for example, in the case of the regional operational programmes of the regional council), and any non-compliance with public procurement law meant a violation of budgetary discipline.
Does it make sense to harden the law this way?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack it or take advantage of it and not punish those who commit a formal ruling, which has no impact on decision-making.
Such a system will only create greater bureaucratic pressure.
And how do you get out of this?
We’ll see where this path begins.
The Prime Minister has recently stated that the SDG would not bother entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called <0xC5><0xA0>varc system, with reference to the fact of being autonomous only on paper.
Is the <0xC5><0xA0>varc system prohibited or allowed?
The law must be regulated in some way, and if it prohibits anything, then not even the Prime Minister of the government can prevent the Office from acting that has the obligation to carry out such checks and require obligations.
You can say, “We changed the law and we allowed it,” but you can’t say we’ll do it like nothing.
In the Public Procurement Act, the regulation is quite strict as to how it should be formally acted, and that is how it should be to protect public competition.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic that the candidate with the best offer is excluded for not meeting the formal requirements.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct, which, in my opinion, is what we are missing.
The roads have ice plates, although they are mostly transitable.
In several places in the Czech Republic the roads have plates of ice and snow.
Although most roads are transitable, caution should be exercised in some areas.
Karlovy Vary Region
This morning the roads in the Karlovy Vary region were transitable, but they had ice and snow plates.
The temperature drops and will fluctuate between five and ten degrees below zero. During the day the thermometers will rise slightly.
It has stopped snowing in the region and in the low areas the snow layer is thin.
Instead, in the ridges of the Metallic Mountains the snow reaches almost 30 centimeters.
In some places the visibility was still poor due to the fog, according to information from the regional road operations control center.
The R6 expressway and the first-class road in the region are now accessible without restrictions.
However, caution is recommended, especially on some bridges whose surface may be frozen and slippery.
All second- and third-class roads, including mountain roads, are also accessible.
However, in some of them there are still sections with remnants of ice and snow.
There is a need to increase attention on the road, especially in the higher areas.
Region of Pardubice and Hradec Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lové
On some roads in eastern Bohemia there is a danger of frost and in higher areas and in the mountains a layer of snow may have formed on the roads, reports on its pages the Roads and Highways Direction.
Road operators warn drivers about the danger of ice sheets forming, especially in higher areas of the Pardubice region.
Frost can occur in the vicinity of Lan<0xC5><0xA1>krouna, <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Orlic<0xC3><0xAD>, Poli<0xC4><0x8D>ky, Svitav or Vysokého Myta, and especially on second and third category roads.
The roads I/43 and I/34 in Svitav have been chemically treated.
There is snow especially on the roads of the Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e and Orlické mountains.
There is a layer of snow apex in the highest areas of the roads in the municipalities of Rychnov nad Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>nou and Trutnov.
In the area of eastern Bohemia, the sky will be clear and partly cloudy today, with no precipitation.
Temperatures will usually fluctuate between three below zero and a positive degree, a weak wind will blow.
Pilsen Region
The roads in the Pilsen region are transitable today in the morning, although caution will have to be extreme and it will be necessary to adapt to the weather.
In the early hours of the morning there will be frost, temperatures will range between three and nine degrees below zero.
After the snowfall and subsequent drop in temperatures, some lanes may also be covered with ice.
In some places drivers will encounter fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is what emerges from information from the region's road operations control center.
The D5 motorway is almost unrestricted, although caution is recommended, especially on the road between kilometer 80 and 131.
The surface of most first-class roads is dry and free of ice.
In the area of the Pilsen and Tachov road bordering Germany there may be sections with ice plates.
The second and third category tracks are wet, so in this case, it is also warned of sections with ice plates.
Drivers should be more cautious, especially on less crowded roads in the <0xC5><0xA0>umava area.
Olomouc Region
Drivers heading to the highest areas of the Olomouc region will find themselves with partially wasted snow.
After the chemical treatment, there was still snow in the port of <0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské and on the road towards Videlsk<0xC3><0xBD> kr<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xBE>.
Road operators removed snow overnight; about three centimeters of snow accumulated on the <0xC5><0xA0>umper road, according to road administrators.
In the rest of the region, most roads are transitable without restrictions.
"In the higher areas of the <0xC5><0xA0>umper road, there are remains of snow.
Drivers in the port of <0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské will meet with medium waste snow in the direction of Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k," an operator of the <0xC5><0xA0>umper road administration told <0xC4><0x8C>TK today.
On the ground and at night his colleagues also visited the Jesenick<0xC3><0xA1> and, after the chemical treatment, the slopes of the higher areas are now cleared and wet.
On the road of Olomouc the roads are transitable without restrictions, on the road of <0xC5><0xA0>ternbersk<0xC3><0xA1> the drivers should drive carefully in the forest stretches, where the roads are still wet.
<0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem region and Liberec region
Northern Bohemia road operators have reported complications in different stretches early in the morning.
Apart from some places where it has snowed or frozen, according to the police database the mountain road between Telnice and Kn<0xC3><0xAD>nice in the region of <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem is closed.
Temperatures are kept at zero, even in the lowest areas, so ice and snow obviously remain on the sidewalk; instead, in the lower areas, especially in the southeast of the Czech central massif, there are no problems and the roads are usually dry.
No service complications have been reported for the time being.
Road operators have warned of the presence of ice in the vicinity of <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>t<0xC3><0xAD>.
According to meteorologists, conditions have been ideal during the night. During the day we expect rain and snow to melt and at night the sky will be clear and there will be ice.
Unfavourable conditions have been announced from the general roads on the I/13 road, on the border between the region of <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem and Liberec.
The road between Telnice and Kn<0xC3><0xAD>nice had to be cut off by the branches of trees that had arched over the road with the weight of snow.
<0xC5><0xA0>imon Ornest: In our concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
It is said that in a little less than a month the end of the world will come, what do you think about it?
It’s just one of so many other alarming news we like to grab hold of.
The Tap Tap music group likes to make jokes about this and we like to say that we are the only music group in the world that manages to gather enough positive energy to postpone the end of the world or to avoid it.
In addition, in December you organize a truly original project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you explain this to our readers?
This is a state benefit that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential that has the end of the Mayan calendar stated for December 21 at 11:10 a.m.
The previous day, December 20 at 9 pm, we will organize 3 concerts simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end at about the same time the Mayan calendar ends on Kiribati Island, in the Pacific Ocean, 12 hours ahead of our time zone.
Who did this idea come up with?
Initially it was my idea, then we were forging the project together with our designer Honza Augusta.
In addition to wanting to gather enough positive energy and avoid the end of the world, we also want to reflect, along with society, on the state in which we will leave the world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar we have also created a unique collection of items: boots, t-shirts, bags and original keychains against the end of the world that can be purchased at www.e-tap.cz, another way to support us.
The Tap Tap group, along with other performers, also sang the so-called anthem against the end of the world, titled "End of the world, cancelled".
It is currently very popular on YouTube, can you hear it at benefit concerts?
Of course it is, and it will be just the last, well, as long as everything goes well and the world does not end...
It will be sung by all the performers at the same time in all three concerts.
The anthems will be linked simultaneously thanks to the special live broadcast on Czech Television.
Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Han<0xC3><0xA1>k has written the lyrics of this song and plays the protagonist role of Jesus in the video clip, where he also sings Xindl X...
How did this collaboration come about?
We work together even with other celebrities from the Czech cultural scene, besides organizing many charity events and concerts...
We make every effort to participate in this project.
It has been shown that most of them are interested and enjoy working with us.
What will the money raised in concerts against the end of the world be used for?
A equipment for the barrier-free educational center Studeo, which we have completed in its sixth consecutive year with the civil association Tap in Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v <0xC3><0xBA>stav.
Students of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v <0xC3><0x9A>stav school regularly receive visits from teachers with whom they perform fun and interesting activities.
Students do not have sufficient financial resources to pay the teachers and we make an effort to make it possible.
In the framework of the completion of the works in Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v <0xC3><0x9A>stav, there will be an independent building to which we will move with this project.
In each concert there are several groups and performers.
What are the selection criteria?
We try to develop a program that is appealing to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague will perform Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan B<0xC3><0xA1>rta, The Tap Tap, Mari<0xC3><0xA1>n Bango and Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Such<0xC3><0xBD>.
For more detailed information, you can consult www.kpks.cz.
Do you have any other similar “spectacular action” in the future?
In May we will perform for the first time at the Pra<0xC5><0xBE>ské jaro festival, so here we will surely prepare an attractive program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to play at the Bohemian National Hall in New York and me personally, taking advantage of that we are in the United States, I would like to complete it with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your plans abroad are not exactly minimalistic, so far you have acted for example in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group of people with disabilities.
How is the logistics and organization of these trips?
It’s not as difficult as it may seem at first glance.
There are five members in an electric wheelchair, the chairs must travel in the luggage compartment and we also carry a lot of weight, the boxes with the instruments...
However, so far we have done well, <0xC4><0x8C>SA and British Airways were perfectly prepared, which always surprises me.
Even in Moscow, from which we have recently returned, everything went smoothly.
Thanks to trips abroad you can compare the different attitudes of society towards the disabled and other aspects.
What have you encountered so far?
In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, everything works better than here; in Russia we have witnessed that, in the east, there is a long way to go.
Unlike Prague, Moscow is full of barriers, where it is still not common for a person to move alone through the city center in an electric wheelchair.
Something as common as, for example, preferring someone in a wheelchair in an elevator, there it is not.
Fortunately, a civil association has been created that strives to address the problems of people with disabilities.
In what ways should we take the example of more advanced countries?
There are a lot of things we go behind...
But it is important to mention that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on the people it directly affects.
In London and Madrid it is very normal for people with a serious disability to travel on their own in public and can go to the service, to the museum, wherever they want...
But it’s not very common for a large number of people with disabilities to participate actively in social life, in this respect, with The Tap Tap let’s go a little further!
A respectful or barrier-free society is one thing, but when the moment comes when eminent athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers emerge, it will begin to change everything really.
So far, they are isolated cases of people who have a great willpower.
The Tap Tap band is currently very popular, but if we look a few years back, what led you to form the band in 1998?
I entered as an educator at Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v <0xC3><0x9A>stav, where there were many young people around me who wanted to devote themselves to something.
And since I am a musician, I play, among others, the saxophone, I founded an amateur group with a colleague.
And over time, as our moderator L<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8F>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D> says, we got a little out of hand (laughs).
However, the popularity didn’t come up until these last few years, or am I wrong?
It is true that it helped us quite a lot by connecting with famous singers and also actively working to promote the group.
We come to the conclusion that the work that is not seen is as if it did not exist.
Thanks to the help of the European Union, we can also afford quality teaching, equipment, etc.
Were you going to get that far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning I saw the potential that there was, that something else can be done.
The show world is full of things that look like each other.
It is logical, in its own way, that everything new is welcomed with caution and takes a long time to accept.
There are few extraordinary things, but I dare say that The Tap Tap is one of them.
The impression of someone who sees us for the first time is clearly compassion, it is a natural reaction...
But compassion is totally superfluous because people with disabilities are not abandoned beings who suffer and of whom we must have compassion.
There are people who are able to live a full life and develop, provided, of course, that they have the necessary means.
I always say that if something goes well for people with disabilities, then it’s not just a breakthrough for them, but for society as a whole.
Did the fact that you are a demanding boss help, as many people describe you?
If we want to do quality work, we have to be rigorous in many aspects and demand some discipline.
I think it's completely normal.
Some people come with a romantic vision and head in the clouds and when they learn that they have to go two days to rehearse, go to the preparatory test and spend a lot of time traveling and in concerts, the initial euphoria quickly leaves them.
But that’s how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and get something.
The Tap Tap group currently has 20 members.
How many of them were there at the beginning of 1998?
Only one: La<0xC4><0x8F>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D>.
We are an open group, people come in and out, you can’t avoid it.
Those who have the will and desire will always find the doors open
It will be the day before the expected end of the world, Thursday 20.12.2012 at 9 pm
It will take place in the Incheba Arena in Prague, in the Brno Flake and in Plynojem in Ostrava and will be attended by 12 groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic
The three cities will connect at the end of the evening via video conferencing to sing together the group's song The Tap Tap "End of the World, Canceled"
The purpose of the concert is to gather the necessary resources to finance multifunctional equipment of the barrier-free educational center STUDIO in Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v <0xC3><0xBA>stav in Prague, whose cost amounts to 25 million Czech crowns.
Entrance to the concert costs 400 CZK and children up to 12 years have free entry to the pre-sale option on Bohemiaticket
Poland and the Cosmos.
At the meeting of ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency last week, Poland was accepted as the twelfth member of the ESA, the second member of the former Eastern European bloc, after the Czech Republic, which became a full member on 12 November 2008).
Poland started an intensive collaboration with ESA in 1994 and during the following years participated in the Agency's project committee.
However, Poland’s path to the cosmos began much earlier.
Polish enthusiasts were already engaged in spaceflights before World War II, although their work was not always understood.
I remember, for example, A. <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld's lecture at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory in which, on December 6, 1933, he presented his ideas on the pioneering study "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
The ideas of the young engineer (born in 1905) left the attendees indifferent and, years later, <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld recalled that Dr. Jan Gadomski had been the only one who had shown interest in his work.
In 1934 <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Prize in France for his "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), mentioned above, later became a major driver of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and wrote a series of books dedicated to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a promoter of cosmonautics, he was known all over the world and his contribution to science was rewarded when he put his name to one of the craters of the moon's hidden face.
As early as 1925, a trainer was built in Poland that was to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, it is not known who was the author of the proposal and the details of the project are not known either.
It is not clear whether the rocket was to be used for launching or braking.
The information about this dress is limited to the collection in the press of the time.
Beginning in 1933, Polish artillery began to dedicate itself to missiles.
The research was funded by the Kom<0xC3><0xB3>rka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and Prof. Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim.
From the preserved material, it becomes clear that the research has reached the stage of practical testing.
However, with the arrival of German troops, the investigation was interrupted.
In 1937 the prototype of a photoelectric fighter missile designed by the engineer Rohozi<0xC5><0x84>ski appeared in the specialized press and the following year the study "Rakete - torpedoes airborne and aerial bomb", by the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki was published.
Both projects were intended for military use of missile engines.
Shortly before the war, the Provisional Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) was in charge of all projects of missile techniques for military use and coordinated all work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, it was interrupted by the onset of the war.
Other studies dedicated to cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
In the November 1954 issue of Problemy magazine, for the first time reference is made to society with four very extensive articles devoted to astronautics.
In one of them, Prof. M. Subotowicze, proposed the creation of a society that would be devoted to cosmonautics.
Artificial satellite projects had already been launched at that time and it was obvious that cosmic research was a discipline with future prospects.
From the beginning of 1956 the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) aspired to be part of the International Federation of Astronautics (founded in 1951) and in the autumn of that year the PTA became a full member.
The following year the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became the vice president of the International Federation of Astronautics.
He held this position until his death in 1959.
Beginning in 1956, the PTA significantly participated in the development of the RM (Meteorologiczna) rocket, which was a success and became the first Polish rocket to conduct scientific research.
The first RM-1 was completed in 1957 and was first launched on October 10, 1958.
The rocket had a peak of 1,800 meters, about 80 cm in length and did not reach 5 kg in weight.
Later, the RM-1A version was completed and aerial testing of the RM-2 two-stage rockets began in the B<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>d<0xC3><0xB3>w desert in the summer of 1959.
The rocket measured 1.4 meters and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another type of rocket in development was to be the object of real scientific study. The RM-34 rocket was to have a peak of 14.5 km and its mission would be to control the high wind.
In 1962, however, the work was suspended.
The successor to the first RM rockets was the Meteor-1 rocket, which was built during the years 1962 and 1965.
It was designed as a two-stage rocket, with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, which differed from each other by the space available for scientific devices.
On the Meteor-1A rocket the available space for the volume was 0.4 liters, on the Meteor-1B 0.34 liters and on the Meteor-1C 0.62 liters.
The maximum peak in the three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Air Institute, whose first aerial tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a useful weight of 10 kg up to 60 km in height.
Subsequently, the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
It is also necessary to mention the entry of Poland into the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the formation of the national committee of COSPAR two years later.
As part of the Intercosmos program, Poland joined the cosmic space research on Soviet artificial satellites and, in 1978, Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remek.
Suspension of the Social Work Act is not the solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court suspended the Social Works Act.
The resolution sparked a heated discussion in society.
It will certainly be interesting to look at the existing problem from a broader point of view.
Liberal economic systems in the EU, as in the globalised world, are based on the principle of greater economic competition and less regulatory.
Consequently, this means that different economic forms and national economic systems are in permanent conflict with each other.
The cause lies in the principle of free trade and the free and unlimited movement of private capital, along with unbridled financial speculation.
The effect of large differences in labour costs (of wages) produces economic tensions.
Under this concept it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer, with the importation of cheap goods, tries to shorten distances and to this end "provokes a downturn" of the competitor's price with the aim of getting the most part of the market and thus increasing its profit margin.
Large-scale means, for most employers, moving production abroad, buying there cheaper or disappearing. The result is high unemployment in those countries where the price of labor, compared to other economies, is higher.
Because private capital has no social responsibility and, therefore, is not responsible for the unemployment generated by this phenomenon, the social expenditure of the state necessarily increases.
All this causes the total disinterest of employers in paying taxes and offset the economic and social damages they have caused in their desire to make profits.
The situation is so universally known that it is not necessary to present specific statistical data.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital create situations, in certain economies, in which the governments of these countries are forced to compete with the aim of artificially reducing the social level of their own population and thus attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments make private capital available to their own population without taking social decline into account.
This is especially evident in the changes in the laws in force.
The aim is to force the population to accept the dictates of private capital, especially with regard to wages.
This takes place, on the one hand, through the system of economic obligation in the case of long-term unemployment, and, on the other hand, through the restricted right of employees with regard to labour rights.
The result is an increasing poverty along with the increasing differences between the poor and the rich.
For a number of years, there have been food delivery points in Germany for poor people who cannot keep up with their own work.
The number of people who receive this kind of help is already reaching a million.
In the context of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, a fairly frequent case occurs: people employed with a salary so low that the state must pay the rest to reach the minimum necessary to survive.
A scandal of this kind related to the situation of the assistant employees of the German federal parliament was made public.
The austerity measures of almost all the southern states of the EU undoubtedly lead to the same situation. People, pressured by an abysmal decline of their social level, are forced to emigrate as in the nineteenth century or to live with a very bad wage at the limit of society, in the hope that some day the country will be deprived of capital.
Is it necessary to ask where it comes from?
In the case of other EU countries, then poverty passes from one country to another or never arrives, since Chinese, Indians, Brazilians, Turks, Moroccans, Egyptians or Africans continue to work for a small part of a European salary.
This also affects all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media assert to the satiation that the state should not contribute capital to the economy, that leading the economy leads to its failure.
Private capital defends with nails and teeth the thesis that the state should not intervene in the economy by meddling in control.
Then it is necessary to ask whether private capital does not influence with its selfishness in the political march and, therefore, in the whole state.
In this case, the answer is clearly yes.
The proof is the existence of lobbies, in practice very powerful and ubiquitous, in all states.
The result is a desperate situation that manifests itself in the field of corruption, in mutual favor, in legislation that is practically reprehensible everywhere but not punishable.
In Germany, the situation is as follows: state ministries, in the absence of financial means, commission the drafting of bills to private legal firms, which are often linked to industry.
This type of bill is then passed in the Bundestag, the German parliament.
Thus, all power does not emanate from the people, as announced in the constitutions of Western democracies, but from the strong financial groups that represent their own interests.
It is obvious that liberal-oriented democracies quickly find themselves in a situation like that described by Appian in his work The Crisis of the Roman Republic in the days of Caesar and Pompey: "The state had been disintegrating for some time and administrations were forcibly engaged."
In exchange for bribes, favors obtained illegally and help to finance stones or swords.
The bribery and corruption were spread without any impediment and the people went to the polls with the ballot in advance"... "there were no people with a character who aspired to a position in the administration, so once, it was necessary, because of this disorganization, the state was in a single place, in a single place, in a single place, in which there were no consuls"... "It began to be a serious one, in the state, in which was not a single place."
The conclusion, as in antiquity, is that today’s society is based on unconscionable preferences of individual benefit without taking into account common interests.
Private capital is not, in its essence, able to understand and claim the benefits of society as a whole.
The result is the same as then, an unprecedented decadence of the elite, without any effort being made to reform it in depth.
The causes of the rise of fascist and communist regimes must therefore be sought in the unbridled liberalization of economic systems in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
With respect to the current situation, it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of a liberal democracy, as a definite pause, pending the next coup.
The really devastating fact is that the current elite completely ignores the losses of hundreds of thousands in lives, the social and humanitarian catastrophes we have witnessed, as well as the crimes against humanity, as we know them in ancient and recent history.
Suspension of the Public Procurement Act is not the solution; at least not in the long term.
Under pressure from economic competition, both at the international level and within the EU, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for other ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution goes through concrete socio-political reforms, which reinforce both the participation of state capital and the influence of citizens in government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.

"If my children didn't want wars, there would be none" Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, on his deathbed in 1849.
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, various reactions have emerged.
One, on the Israeli side, argues for the right to self-defense and frames the Palestinians in the role of terrorists; the other supports the Palestinians and alleges racism by the State of Israel, genocide against Palestinian Arabs and smearing Israel of a terrorist state.
I do not want to focus on who is to blame for the repeated killings and who is the victim; in the end, the citizens of today's Israel, including the autonomous territories, were born within the current political situation and did not live the beginnings of violence.
My intention is to offer readers a look behind the scenes, a look to discover who takes advantage of the tensions that have been dragging for 95 years (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small land surface of the Middle East.
Some of my considerations are based on historical facts, others on conclusions that I have come to based on my own understanding of the matter, on who or what group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history.
In the history of humanity, the history of power struggles is at the forefront.
In each epoch we can find a Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
But what is no longer so obvious is whether these characters were always directing their steps autonomously or if behind their throne was someone oriented their actions towards a certain goal.
We must accept that we live in an age that concentrates the wealth of the world in the hands of a few individuals and that this concentration of money and the power it entails has not been reached in a single generation.
Among these astronomically rich families stands out one that could be considered the most prominent (if there’s still someone behind it, I don’t know, but I don’t rule it out): the Rothschilds.
There is not much written around them.
Of course.
In the 1990s, they bought the first news agency (Reuters) to stop associating their name with very serious criminal acts. Power and wealth, or both, covered their backs, which for them always meant a strengthening.
They have significant stakes in almost all the central banks of the world and in those countries where they are not represented, declared or are preparing for a war: before the attack on Afghanistan there were seven countries, after the attack on Iraq there were five, after the overthrow of Gaddafi there were only four, but in the meantime Russia has subordinated the central bank to the government.
Anyone who has tried to oppose this family has died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of the Rothschild Central Bank of America, began printing money during the War of the Secession, and was assassinated in 1865 in the theater.
JFK began printing money and wanted to suspend the Federal Reserve System (FED) and was assassinated in 1963; Congressman Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after wanting to sue the FED for triggering the great economic crisis of 1929.
Their quest for world power led them during the years 1859 - 1871 to draw up a plan with three world wars, designed by Freemason Albert Pike, decorated with Grade 33.
The first war was marked as the goal of eliminating the great monarchical states throughout Europe; the second wanted to eliminate colonial supremacy, especially from Britain, and the third was intended to reduce the population of the earth between half a million and a billion people (the same number of slaves in the world and the same number of slaves in the world would not be enough for their well-being and luxury), and the third would not consume so much resources.
The method by which the group of the richest families operates, together with the Rothschilds, follows the dynamics of the triggering of crisis and the subsequent offering of a solution (order ab cao - order from chaos).
These solutions are, however, erroneous, and always lead to a worsening of the situation; if not, it is enough to remember that the Fed was created so that a crisis like that of 1907 would not be repeated.
So, after the success of the assassination of the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, Francisco Fernando, in Sarajevo and after the outbreak of World War I, destroyed Tsarist Russia with the beginning of the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended suddenly and unjustified from a military and economic point of view, the capitulation of Germany (the wars to end Tsarist Russia were already unnecessary) and the subsequent dismemberment of the great power of Central Europe, the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
In order to prepare the foreground of the Second World War, it allowed the bankers and politicians to create, covertly, a conflicting situation in consequence of the enormous war reparations imposed on Germany, with which was created the optimal conditions for the radicalization of the impoverished masses.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds promoted the founding of the Zionist movement, a branch that aspired to the formation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of ancient Judea with Jerusalem as capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration mentioned above laid the foundations for the mass immigration of Jews into Palestine and began the first conflicts with the Arab population of the place.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
World War II broke out: it is difficult to know whether Hitler pulled too much of the rope that international bankers had tied him to in the beginning or whether everything he did was part of a plan. However, the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the optimal conditions for the acceptance of the Jewish state in world society.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, similarly to the way war reparations imposed on Germany paved the way for World War II, with the proclamation of the state of Israel the focus for a third war was created.
If the international bankers managed to start it, the Jewish nation, as in World War II, would become a victim in the front line of battle, now along with the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is an immense laboratory, a welding machine and chaos, not only within its own country, but also on an international scale. Let us take as an example how Israel's sympathizers and detractors are cutly divided.
Who is to blame and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict? Where injustice breeds injustice in a spiral of endless violence, if at the beginning of everything was the greed of some individuals and their desire for world power?
At this point it is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their representatives, because, as is the case in our country, international bankers only present their candidates in elections.
The current president of Israel B. Netanyahu is the typical example of a fascist politician, loyal to international bankers, who does everything possible to declare war on Iran and, considering that Iran is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), it would threaten to turn into a global conflict or, if we will take into account the control of it.
In 1994, David Rockefeller said, “All we need is a general crisis and people will agree with a new world order.”
The new world order in your imagination is a world of lords and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the population serves a handful of people who are part of the well-accommodated financial aristocracy.
A world in which each new individual is implanted a chip at birth that controls his whole being.
And he makes all men, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to have a mark on their right hand or on their forehead, not to be able to buy or to sell, unless they bear the name of this beast or the number of their name.
It is necessary to understand: who has two fingers in front, who adds up the numbers of this monster.
The number marks the person and this number is six hundred and sixty-six.”
Argo: If it gets raw, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a group of Islamist students held the U.S. embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
His release was to be in exchange for the dethroned Shah Mohamed Réza Pahlevi, who fled after the revolution to the United States, a country that had sponsored his regime for decades.
For the American administration, the situation did not offer any positive outlook: pulling the shah over the edge could not be allowed, since if it did, it would endanger the confidence of its allies in other countries.
But the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution had led to the constitution of the theocratic regime, was not within its reach.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later further intensified with the failed attempt to free the hostages by force.
The imprisoned diplomats were released 444 days after the Algerian government’s negotiating intervention.
In the U.S., his fate caused a wave of solidarity and animadversion against Iran.
The failure in Iran contributed decisively to Jimmy Carter's defeat of Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film "Argo" by director and actor Ben Affleck themes an episode of this story, which was a small success for America.
Shortly before occupying the embassy, six employees escaped from the building.
After a complicated journey, they ended up in the residence of the Canadian embassy.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, for this helped a covert story one extravagant point: they went out with Canadian passports, as members of the film crew examining the location in the country for the shooting of a science fiction superproduction.
Combination of genders
The plan drawn up by "exfiltration" expert Toni Mendez required Hollywood's collaboration.
To make the lie seem true, it was written about the film project in specialized magazines, press conferences were organized, the fictional production company even had a real office.
Details about the operation were kept secret for a long time, the film has been made from the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a singular combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a realistic political thriller; on the other, a so-called "caper movie", the story of an episode that went well, a hoax (an example may be the Ocean's Eleven series).
In the film the moods are combined. On the one hand we find well-documented sequences of Tehran. In the sequence of credits are shown emblematic photographs of the time of the events, which were shaped in the same way in the film; there are not many differences in this regard.
On the other hand, typical Hollywood scenes are slightly lighter, marked by irony and a slight exaggeration.
And in addition, scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions: costumed men analyzing the situation at the negotiating table, in the office hallways, by phone...
Ben Affleck has been able to restart his career in an excellent way.
The actor, who had been the subject of mockery, has become a respectable director and his way of acting has ceased to be the target of ironic comments.
Argo is his third feature film, after "Goodbye Little, Goodbye" (2007) and the thriller "The Town. City of Thieves" (2010).
At the same time, it’s Affleck’s first film in which the action doesn’t take place in the city of Boston, where it was raised.
Also, the sensitivity of capturing the atmosphere of the place was a feature that placed old film directors above Hollywood standards.
And Affleck demonstrates it in Argo, where Tehran is "wheeling" in Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets, in the reconstruction of the real events. The introductory sequence of the taking of the embassy is impressive for its synoptic ability that, at the same time, conveys the emotion of the confusion and the lack of foresight that arises when, somewhere, the story gives a step to the story.
Affleck and his collaborators achieve a similar effect on the fictional scenes (the impostor team in Tehran’s bazaar).
Too much action in too many places
The director had to accept the fact that an explained story does not offer much in the cinematic sense of the most intriguing scenes.
Sometimes it adds something to the reality: here everything does not come out so elegant (the scene in which the crisis at Tehran airport, the diverting of a call to America and the unbridled quest for its track turn into a madness).
Argo’s weakness is the uncontrollability that arises from the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman have a very funny role as Hollywood collaborators, although their characters deserved more space and are not, much less, the only ones in this film.
For these reasons, Affleck’s film loses a bit of dramatic trait, but it’s a film that can be followed with moderate interest, valuing its performance and the retro style of a thriller that evokes the 1970s.
But if it collapses, that will be difficult.
As an evocation of a real story and as proof of how exaggerated the notions of omnipresence and omniscience of secret services can be, it is enough.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circus
The www.bankovnipoplatky.com server, which annually presents a survey of the most absurd bank rates, has now decided to announce the contest on "the EU's most absurd workshop rules or ideas".
“What happened after the last event, the EU is planning to approve a 40 percent share of women in management positions in major European companies,” said Pr<0xC3><0xA1>vo Patrik Nacher, the survey’s organiser.
Among the absurdities nominated is, for example, the recent decision of the European Court of Justice to unify insurance policies between men and women.
Until now, women were guaranteed better prices in life insurance because they objectively represent a lower risk.
“Other incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be proposed by the people until the end of this year.”
The election will take place at the end of February 2013,” Nacher said.
Among the contested EU regulations is, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents to the fuel which as a result harms the environment; another prohibition is the use of lifelong mercury thermometers only because they contain a small amount of a dangerous substance or the guideline obscures the size of the cages of the chickens, which has contributed to it.
The de facto ban on the use of the term "butter butter" or the removal of the classic light bulb from trades has been criticised.
A quality banana should have a length of 14 centimeters.
The Union apparatus often makes such decisions under the pressure of one or another commercial or industrial lobby, whose petitions in Brussels are usually defended by some state or group of states (the Czech Republic, even with the threat of veto, claims the demands of its banks).
The interests of a lobby were behind the request, for example, that higher-quality bananas should have a length of at least 14 centimeters in the EU and could not present "abnormal curvatures".
The European Commission defended itself by saying that this only seeks to harmonize national standards that have not been homogenized to date, which only complicate their marketing.
The rules that refer to fruit and vegetables in the EU, despite opposition from some states, have been softened on the basis that the existing directive entails a waste of foodstuffs.
The candidate to win the poll could be last year’s EU prescription that on inflatable balloons being marketed it is mandatory to warn that children under 8 years old are not allowed to inflate them without the supervision of an adult.
The U.S. was referring here to an American study that, when it comes to toys, balloons are the leading cause of infant death due to suffocation.
A similar restriction also applies to the use of matasugra by children up to 14 years of age.
Curious occurrences are born even in our country
Equally absurd is the regulation concerning European officials: anyone who has any official function in the EU cannot use the name Macedonia. In order not to hurt the sensitivity of Greece, we must speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The Bankovn<0xC3><0xAD>poplatky.com server, in collaboration with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, nominated in the survey, among some absurd proposals mentioned above, the Union’s prescription on the volume of food supplies in the territory of a Member State.
The EU determined the maximum volumes of food supplies that can be found in the territory of the Czech Republic on the same day as our entry into the EU.
Subsequently, the Czech Republic exceeded, for example, the established volume for canned mushrooms, which posed a substantial threat of fines.
The organizers of the survey were also interested in the occurrence of paying to those countries that did not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a grant for the grant application.
This kind of ideas did not arise in Brussels but in Prague.
"We're at a disadvantage because we don't have a sea.
We are asking the European Union for compensation,” said the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) in autumn 2004.
He argued this with the fact that a lot of cereal was produced in our country and, as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, the state had full warehouses and had to export.
According to Palas, given that the Czech Republic is far from seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
In the end, the European Commission was willing to help the Czech Republic and organised a public tender for the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The grant to receive a grant was proposed to the municipalities by the Ministry for Local Development led by Minister Pavel N<0xC4><0x83>mec (US-DEU). Specifically, it is intended for the drafting of grant applications from Brussels.
EU: Rare prescriptions are an exception
The guidelines of the Member States are often subject to criticism, the EU's regulatory efforts and more effective functioning and development across the Union deserve our recognition, according to several experts.
According to the experts, the most serious problem is, for example, the collection of EU grants for projects that have nothing to do with the deepening of European integration, but that Member States have achieved in the negotiations on budgets.
The Czechs are also affected by sensitive fibre, as are other countries of the Union, by the struggle for the right to the designation of origin of their traditional products, although our country has not always emerged victorious from these struggles.
The Czechs, after six years of disputes with the Germans and Austrians, successfully defended the origin designation of the Olomouc hamlet, but had to change its name to the national rum, whose tradition in our country goes back to the 19th century, and became called "tuzem<0xC3><0xA1>k".
Only products made from sugarcane distillate can be called rum, but not those made from sugar beet.
In the official list of protected designations of origin of the EU, along with the famous feta and gorgonzola cheeses worldwide, the mazapan of the German city of Lübeck or the ham of Parma, are already found, for example, the cookies of Karlovy Vary, the tent of Poho<0xC5><0x99>elice and T<0xC5><0x99>ebo<0xC5><0x88> and, even of the variety of L<0xC3><0xBA>a.
As protected maras of the EU, they will be proud of the Pardubice gingerbread and the Ho<0xC5><0x99>ice barquills in Podkrkono<0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xAD>.
People want me to save the republic, but I’m an amateur, says Okamura
Senator, how did you come to run for president?
It’s not about being a senator or president.
If all was well in our country, then I would not submit my candidacy.
But I can no longer bear to see how it has been stolen in the last twenty years in our country, how thieves are left unpunished, taxes are rising and retirement age.
He had no ambitions to be a politician.
When I see something I don’t like, I try to give a solution to change it.
And since I’m already forty years old and my candidacy is independent, the only chance I have to change things is to run as a senator or president.
The Senate has already arrived, but soon after it has set itself on its way to the presidency.
Isn't he turning his back on those people who voted for him?
I always said that my candidacy for the presidency depended on the results of the Senate elections.
I later made it clear that if I was elected senator, I would run for president.
But my goal is not the function; the function is the tool with which I can make my own ideas come true.
That is why I need the greatest possible influence and the strongest possible mandate.
The problem is not only that we are a nation that we criticize at the bar or in front of the television, but we step on anyone who wants to initiate a change.
To this is added the media, which disdain you and confuse freedom of expression with freedom to lie.
It is said that I have bribed journalists and that I have been an adviser to Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Paroubek.
Let's talk about your ideas.
It is presented to the presidential struggle with financial theses and criminal responsibilities of politicians and the declaration of ownership over twenty million.
To do this, the law must be changed.
As president he does not have this competence and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve it?
As a citizen, I have been part of a pressure group for the leadership profession to be recognized as self-employed, and we have achieved it.
The problem is in politics: if someone comes up with a good proposal, either from the right or from the left, it is deliberately rejected and this affects the citizens.
As an independent candidate, I have greater potential to gain the support of all parliamentary groups.
Without framing or party dogmas, I have the ability to choose something from each party that is best for our country and apply it.
Is he considered a man of the right or of the left?
From the Czech point of view, I have the impression that people consider me more left-wing.
It doesn’t matter to me, whether it’s a little left or a little right.
What matters to me is that we're moving forward.
I don’t care if someone is from the right or the left, I want to unite people.
I always openly support any good solution, whether the proposal comes from the KS<0xC4><0x8C>M or the SDG, and in the same way I will be against bad ideas.
He jokes about you being a populist.
But isn't he proving it with what he says?
When you create a business plan for the company, you also have certain goals and ideals.
And try to get close to them.
There will be those who call it populism, but all the proposals I speak of already work in the world or well-known experts talk about them.
But without the support of the parliament, only slogans remain.
And with that, he cannot survive in long-term politics.
Or do you think that if you address people and talk to them, you will get, for example, criminal and financial responsibility?
I don't have a choice.
Convince politicians, journalists and civil society and try to put them on my side to achieve it.
If he were elected president, there would be no problem in organizing a live television relay in which he would ask the leaders of parliamentary parties to legitimize criminal and financial responsibility for the politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors of the state.
And eventually, they would have to communicate why they don’t want it.
If there is a strong character pointing to disputes, you can put pressure on the political scene.
Let’s take the direct election of the president, which has been an achievement of public pressure.
At the same time, I affirm that I am only an amateur, I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
For my opinions and ideals I try to seek allies.
I just started politics and try to get as much support as possible for my program.
I try to get things ahead myself, but in case it doesn’t work out well, within six years I’ll leave it and go back to the private sector.
It sounds a bit like Okamura was going to save the Czech Republic.
I am not a savior.
I know I don’t do anything with a person, that’s why I’ve visited a number of well-known personalities, in order to encourage them to run for the Senate.
I went to see Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, but he refused because he had a lot of work.
For my part, I have at least supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencov<0xC3><0xA1>, who brought to light the scams with light heating oils.
I presented myself on the basis that people are really dissatisfied, now I’m on the balance.
Sixty percent of the population did not attend the polls and, those who did, voted for the representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate we are two of the independent sector.
The people elected the Senate, so it will be difficult to make changes.
However, I will defend my own ideas, such as the direct election of mayors or governors.
Are you considering forming your own party?
I haven’t considered it yet because I don’t have time for it, to check the intact past of each of the potential members of the party, nor do I have money.
I don't have money for the presidential campaign, there's only 20,000 kroner in my transparent account.
Don't you have money?
It's about property claims, how's yours?
I estimate my private property at about 60 million.
In Prague I have a land valued at 25 million, a floor valued at ten million, another floor valued at eight million, a collection of artworks valued at ten million, an Aston Martin of about 3.5 million and a <0xC5><0xA0>koda Superb valued at one million, and in the account I have a couple of million.
By the way, I have an Aston Martin because it was my childhood dream. I always liked James Bond, who was driving this car, was gallant with women, and at the same time, I was fighting evils and injustices.
Does he drive an Aston Martin, his property is valued at 60 million and he has no money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the republic but you don't want to put too much money on your side.
It's not very convincing.
I don't have $15 for the campaign.
Do I have to borrow?
In the campaign I have already placed 2.5 million.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors proves that there isn't too much interest in my program.
And I have no obligation to pay the campaign with money from my pocket.
The campaign expenses essentially cover what I will receive as a senator's salary.
But I couldn't live with it, for example, I couldn't pay my son for English school, which costs 30,000 kroner a month.
If I just wanted to make money, then I wouldn't be a candidate.
So will you continue with your business activity to be able to live?
Didn't you say before that I was going to quit this activity?
This has nothing to do with a higher salary.
As I promised, I have partially quit my activities.
For example, the representative of my travel agency will become my replacement in spring.
People would want it to be the Samaritan who saved the republic.
But I also need to live something.
How much are you used to earn as an entrepreneur on a monthly basis?
Between 200,000 and 400,000, which I keep winning.
If I were president, then I would quit business.

The architecture study MVRDV shows that the real adventures are not only in the head - in the example of the Spijkenisse library and the newly completed "mountain of books" - 2 photos
“I think the building is fun, it looks futuristic, and finally there’s something interesting to see,” says Lisette Verhaig, a passer-by who walks down the street.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT technician at a large company located near the library, points out: "Moreover, the building is beautiful."
But I wonder why we need a library these days.
We all have internet, tablets and e-books.
Nobody gets into those old-fashioned libraries for good, right?
Spijkenisse, a bedroom town located at the gates of Rotterdam that is barely worth a fugitive visit, has the dubious honor of standing up with a record to forget.
The population of 80,000 has the lowest literacy rate in the Netherlands.
To counter this embarrassing situation, a few years ago it was decided to somehow contribute to the general culture and copy the seven fictitious bridges that appear on the euro banknotes in the form of decorated miniatures of reinforced concrete.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And that’s how political leaders decided that there was only one possibility to improve the statistics: you had to build a library!
Winy Maas, from the Dutch architecture studio MVRDV, a master in the art of bar charts and responsible for fun and cynical buildings, took the topic with her usual serenity and appeared at the presentation of the competition in 2003 with five books under her arm and a smile on her face.
And as the jury looked puzzled around and shrugged, Maas proceeded to pile up the books by size forming a pyramid and concluded his brief speech with the following words: "Dear fellow citizens:
Here you have it, my proposal for the Spijkenisse book mountain, the so-called 'Bookenberg'."
Nine years later, the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 million mountain rises in the planned location.
This is part of the revitalization project, which is completed with an underground car park, a supermarket, a post office and a couple of residential and residential buildings.
At the beginning of November the Mountain of Books was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project is also nominated for the "Dutch National Wood Award 2012".
In this way, the small town lacking history, which to date had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian area and an incredibly ugly town hall behind which one would rather intuit a milky power station, now boasts a work of contemporary architecture.
But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The long way to the book
The first impression is that it is a book paradise under a cheesecake.
It is true that there is an elevator that transports us right to the center of this mountainous massif, but the true lovers of space and reading do not use it, but prefer to merge with its topography at every step of its climb to the top.
The fully glazed interior is bright and easy to embrace with the view, the glazed brick floor and the elegant lighthouses unequivocally support the public condition of the library.
The urban environment is perfect.
As you look up, you can see the park benches, the dogs and the boys and girls playing football.
And everywhere books, books and more books.
“Normally the book shelves are arranged along the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade and in the center opens a huge dark room that is usually a bit uncomfortable and impersonal,” says Winy Maas.
What we’ve done is put up the classic spatial configuration and take out the reading area from the inside out.
The interior of the mountain is very well exploited: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the environmental education center and the maintenance room.
Special mention is given to the black shelves that assume the functions of wall cladding, parapet and railing at the same time.
The sight, the touch and the smell are strange.
Even architects and civil engineers shake their heads more often when they hear about this unknown material.
“We wanted to work with recycled materials,” explains Joop Trouborst, head of the project in the city of Spijkenisse.
And that is how one day, on a Frisian farm, we come across the right by-product from agriculture.
For many years, in the greenhouses and in the fields of the Netherlands, a plastic fabric of a few millimetres thick is used as a base to hold the roots of the crops.
This is a cheap and efficient material.
This fine tissue lasts two seasons and is then discarded.
For the library this fabric was pressed, for the first time in such quantities, until plates of four centimeters thick were obtained.
With heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) changes color and becomes a dark, homogeneous and resistant material that smells like a new mix of car and sports shoe.
After 105 steps you reach the top of the mountain.
At the end of this continuous route of almost 500 meters around the mountain awaits us the reward: from the cafeteria you not only have a fantastic view of the city, but you can also enjoy some tasty Dutch croquettes and its ficus planted in huge pots.
These create a pleasant atmosphere at the same time that they maintain the atmospheric humidity suitable for this mountain of literature.
Donations for a New Soul
“Although it’s hard to believe given its large glazed surfaces, this building is an exemplary project in terms of ecology,” says Trouborst.
The necessary heating and cooling is obtained from geothermal energy.
Despite the fact that the mountain of books is located under a huge glass pyramid, even on the sunniest days the sun only shines for a few hours inside.
The huge wooden circles located transverse to the glass fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade serve to give shade and absorb most of the sun’s rays.
This creates a comfortable indoor climate.
The rest is a matter of automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the sceptical worker in the information technology sector, has already dared to stand up in the new library.
And Lisette Verhaig has also been there.
Also, Chinese traditional medicine teacher Cynthia Bogarde has visited the library, calling the "Bookenberg" as Spijkenisse's "late soul".
The reason is that, on the occasion of the inauguration that took place a couple of weeks ago, all the inhabitants of the city were invited to donate a book from their private collection.
In this way, it is intended to fill, at the moment, the optical gaps of a library that does not yet have its complete archive; it currently has 70,000 copies.
The concept has gone deep.
The shelves are full.
“There’s nothing worse than a half-empty library,” says architect Winy Maas.
"I believe that thanks to our initiative, all the inhabitants now have a certain connection with this building.
Everyone knows that your book is part of the library.
Even though it's only there to decorate.
In this way, the MVRDV study has achieved complete success in that discipline that in the specialized argot is known as "creation of an identity".
The city of Spijkenisse has written a piece of the history of literature.
No matter how young and uneducated she may be.
Finally a starting point for shaping your identity.
Szabo: "The Germans must play a more protagonist role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on U.S.-Europe relations, this puts Berlin in a rather pessimistic diplomatic position.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany indicated that it would vote against the proposal to grant the Palestinian territories observer status of the United Nations.
In the end, however, Berlin abstained.
What's the point?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
Now, because of the special relationship that unites the country with Israel, Germany must be careful.
But at the same time, I don’t think it supports the American stance either.
Germany wanted to prove its independence without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to establishing a no-fly zone.
It has finally been declared by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear stance when important international issues are at stake?
Yeah, that's right.
This is because at the moment he is reorienting his foreign policy, moving away from a policy led, so to speak, by the United States and focusing on a German foreign policy.
And what makes things even more difficult is that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
Therefore, the Germans are at a crossroads.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to doing so.
I think they’re still pondering what their role will be, but they’ve already started the road to a “normal” foreign policy.
A foreign policy similar to countries such as France or Britain.
What exactly does a "normal" foreign policy mean from the German point of view?
It is a policy that, when it comes to national interests, is willing to defend positions different from those of the United States or its European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy finds a strong motivation in economic policy, that is, in exports and in their relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
German economic interests are to a certain extent different from those of other great powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the position taken with regard to the conflict in the Middle East and the vote of the UN?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf.
For this reason, it must be careful and not be alienated from Arab public opinion or from Arab elites.
This is important, of course.
But I would not give it such importance since it is not a totally unilateral relationship.
However, they do play a fundamental role in German considerations.
Has Germany undermined its relationship with the United States by abstaining from voting on important decisions such as the Palestinian vote?
I believe that in Europe, and even in the United States, the German attitude enjoys an enormous degree of understanding.
For this reason, I do not believe that such a drastic rupture has occurred as in the case of Libya.
It may be that Germany has managed to cultivate some respect.
After all, all this has done is prove that it is a country that is taken seriously as an international actor and whose interests must be taken into account.
There are different views in Europe about the Palestinian initiative.
On the other hand, the U.S. has clearly shown itself in favor of a veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the United States and many European nations?
These disparities have always been due to U.S. domestic policy.
I believe that the Obama administration secretly shows great understanding of the European position.
But because of the political situation here, it is obvious that the government cannot publicly defend that position.
I believe that the true disparity of views does not actually have the scope that is attributed to it.
If we look at the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, we see that Obama is by no means enthusiastic about the policy he develops.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of its main partners in the EU, on the other?
I think that’s exactly what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course it would be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and homogeneous European policy, but that is not the case.
Therefore, they do not have the possibility of being part of a higher entity, but they must push things from their own position.
That is exactly what they are doing now with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will take a leading role in forcing Europe to adopt a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, either simply because of its relationship with Israel.
This has always been a hot topic.
But I think the Germans are clear that they should play the role of an independent figure.
Does Germany see itself as an important international actor? Does Germany really want to take on a leading role?
Or is it still difficult for you to accept that leadership?
Germany has not yet gotten used to it, it is always something uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country is still struggling to play a more important role.
If we look at the euro crisis, for example, we see that every time Germany positions itself as the main player, certain anti-German feelings are unleashed.
This is not easy for the Germans.
This is an old problem and is that no one wants to be surrounded by enemy countries.
In this way, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It should show a receptive attitude towards different neighbors and opinions and that is not easy.
The U.S. influence on European policy is diminishing more and more, but the EU is not currently covering that gap, then who is left?
The Germans will have no choice but to take on a more protagonist role.
Even if they don’t like it, if they find it unpleasant or if it makes them an even more unpopular town, it’s life!

"Mark Protection" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese brands
Armani is a world-renowned brand and Polo Ralph Lauren as well.
What is Armani Polo?
Behind this name is a name officially registered in China but that has nothing to do with the original companies.
However, it enjoys protection while the real eponyms do not file a claim.
And even then it is not clear that they will be given the reason.
“Foreigns find it increasingly difficult to protect their brands in China,” says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at firm Taylor Wessing who specializes in violations of protection rights in the Far East.
Every week a new case comes to my table.
Imitators simply add a couple of letters to be able to register their marks.
In this way, Gucci becomes Lu-Gucci and instead Prada registers Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copied in the same way, as happened to the Puma sportswear manufacturer.
Pattloch opens an archivist in which he holds seats at the Beijing Trademark Office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company applied to register the Zegna DF Puma brand, an artificial name that was also used by the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
That the Chinese are world champions in copying and violating intellectual property rights is well known.
In the big cities there are large warehouses of several plants dedicated exclusively to the sale of counterfeits.
However, Pattloch’s cases are of a different kind: on behalf of his clients, he is fighting the fact that the trade mark office officially grants Chinese companies the right to take advantage of a name that is already registered elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Ming Pai" or companion brand.
The word has its origin in the Chinese term "Bang Dakuan",
It refers to women who have "fished" a rich man.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty.
“It’s detrimental to the business, we have to fight it,” Pattloch says.
“The brand makes water, the monopoly position disappears and the damage the image is suffering is enormous.”
The financial losses and procedural costs of the sectors concerned are millionaires, especially in the case of emblematic luxury products.
According to data from the market analysis company CLSA, with a volume of 15 billion euros per year China is, in size, the third largest market for luxury goods and the fastest growing.
However, achieving the cancellation of registrations of dubious legality in the registration of trademarks is complicated and also involves a lot of money.
Processes can last up to nine years and the result is uncertain.
Pattloch speaks of cases in which the court rejected a lawsuit because it had been so long that the name that was the subject of the lawsuit had already become a “market reality”.
"If the plaintiff is unlucky, he may even have to pay money to the plagiarist because the process has damaged his mark in China," Pattloch said.
Sometimes this is the law of the jungle.
Some of the best-known cases have to do with graphic elements.
In 2009 Daimler-Benz lost a lawsuit against construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that has recently been absorbed by German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
That’s why to this day the Chinese can continue to use a very similar emblem to the Mercedes star.
Volvo’s buyer, Geely, initially used a white and blue logo that was largely reminiscent of BMW; the matter was settled in court and Geely had to modify it.
The clothing manufacturer Lacoste lost in China against imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore whose logo represented a crocodile looking in the opposite direction to the original.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty.
The CTMO brand office in Beijing recognizes that in 2010 they had difficulties due to the lack of equipment and staffing.
Last year, however, “the labor emergency situation returned to normal.”
In this way, the number of unprocessed claim processes has been reduced by 22%.
Nearly 57,000 of these cases were resolved, 75% more than the previous year.
However, 81,500 complaints are still pending resolution.
Fighting this costs a lot of money.
As is usual in China, the figures are surprising.
Last year, the CTMO registered more than 1.4 million trademark protection applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
It would be a new record and means that China leads the list of new registrations worldwide for the tenth consecutive year, according to the brand office.
It seems that this also happens with the number of valid logos, a figure that amounts to 5.5 million in total.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan would have been invested in rights.
In other words, this means that on average each registration costs 1,280 yuan or 160 euros.
Fighting this costs a lot of money, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the group has been fighting in court against a Chinese impersonator.
While the Germans have managed to stop the illegal manufacture of imitation car parts,
the imitator has managed to secure the Chinese rights over the Freudenberg brand.
“We ourselves have provoked this situation because in Germany the surnames are not protected,” says Hanno Wentzler, President and CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO trademark office also rejected the monks’ appeal.
In the following two instances they have given Freudenberg the right, but the opposite side continues to fight today.
You have to be very careful
Now the case has reached the doors of the High Court of Justice, where it is still pending a resolution.
Wentzler trusts in being able to resolve the issue favorably and praises the professionalism of the courts.
However, it also states that “the procedure is extremely expensive, both in terms of money and time.”
It is difficult to estimate internal costs; the enterprise archive has had to review files up to a hundred years old in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the opposing party a “six-digit sum in euros” with the aim of reaching a friendly agreement, but it was unsuccessful.
“This shows how much we care,” Wentzler says.
The dangers lurking in the Far East threaten even to affect Europe.
in particular if imitators are secured there the rights to unprotected trademarks.
A Chinese manufacturer tried to register in Germany the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather products.
The group has long since left this commercial area, but managed to prevent registration.
“We have to be very careful,” says Wentzler.
Both he and lawyer Pattloch recommend German companies to be extremely cautious when doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark law, but what needs to be done is “register in China also everything that may be susceptible to protection,” as Wentzler points out.
Otherwise, the subject can be much more expensive than a simple registration.
In fact, in case Freudenberg lost the last assault of his particular battle, then he would have to pay the opposing party licensing rights for his own name, as Wentzler explains.
That or in the segment in question would drive us out of the market.
World AIDS Day: Dancing, Singing, Helping
In Heidelberg the Imbongi choir rehearses and in Swaziland the AIDS orphans rejoice
The history of a link capable of exceeding much more than 8,733 kilometers away.
First it starts with the dance: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, heel shoes and moccasins look for the compass on the parquet floor, and find it quickly.
One, two, three, four.
It is only then that the vocals of the singers (control, bass, tenor and soprano) slowly begin to rise, rippling, numbing and following each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old director, threatens to get out of his box almost by trying to put order with his energetic and gentle gestures.
It is Monday afternoon and in the music hall of the Heidelberg Institute of Medical Psychology the chorus Imbongi rehearses a new song.
The 50 singers, aged between 23 and 69, have also arrived, from the human geneticist to the host.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each voice of the choir has a different text and also in a barely known foreign language: Zulu, a language spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and some areas of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
According to an estimate by UNAIDS, the United Nations Programme to Combat AIDS, there are approximately 34 million people infected with HIV worldwide.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
There are 245,000 AIDS orphans in Swaziland.
More than 40% of the population is already HIV-positive.
The Voices for Africa association has found in Germany patrons for the 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni.
Seventy of them attend high school.
For 15 or 20 euros per month you can sponsor a child.
This contribution will cover the school’s tuition, uniform and guarantee you a hot meal every day at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means "story-teller" or "panegirist" in Zulu.
No one in this room can speak this Bantu language fluently, but singing does.
For ten years this choir has been rehearsing songs in this soft foreign language that sometimes manages to transport them to their place of origin: South Africa.
At 8,733 kilometers in a straight line from Heidelberg, in the northeast of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is a village called Esitjeni that depends on the voices of this German choir.
Forty percent are infected.
Approximately 2,000 people live there, some even in simple mud and straw huts, many of them children.
More than 300 people no longer have parents because they have succumbed to AIDS.
Esitjeni is a small example of what affects Swaziland: the highest rate of AIDS infection and the lowest life expectancy worldwide, according to UNICEF.
The population does not see circumcision with good eyes, a practice that has been shown to halve the risk of infection.
More than 40% of Swaziland’s inhabitants are carriers of the immunodeficiency virus, and dying at just over thirty has become commonplace.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005 the choir discovered this hidden population, but what they saw above all were many children in the streets who lacked not only the protection of their parents, but the main thing: food, clothing and training.
Without a school degree, the chances in a poor country are more than limited.
At first it was only the private commitment of a few that made it possible for a child to go to school and enjoy a hot meal a day, all for a few euros.
A year later, however, the choir founded the “Voices for Africa” association, which has since professionally taken care of AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about Sexually Transmitted Infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial TSEs include syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
The most common viral-born STIs are AIDS, human papillomavirus, genital herpes, or hepatitis.
The larvae and the larvae are among parasitic-transmitted TSEs.
What are the main groups of affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are more common in men who have sex with other men.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, at least four out of every five cases of syphilis registered in Germany have their origin in sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, the most common sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydia, trichomonas, human papillomavirus, candidiasis (hong) and gonorrhea.
HIV infection among heterosexual adults in the country is relatively rare; however, approximately 20% of new HIV infections are registered in this group.
Among young people, chlamydia infections are much more common than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
In our country, the human papilloma virus is also added to the most common diseases among youth.
How has the number of infections evolved?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory declaration.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been declining since 2007.
In 2011, there were approximately 2,700 cases.
This is one-tenth less than in the previous year.
What symptoms indicate that it is a venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause genital ulcers, urination discomfort, flow, abdominal pain, as well as blisters or warts.
They often do not cause pain or cause other symptoms and therefore are not detected.
How can one be protected?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they don’t offer 100 percent protection.
Some pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through dirt and physical contact infections.
For this reason, experts recommend regularly undergoing medical examinations, especially if you frequently change your sexual partner.
If diagnosed early, most STDs can be cured and any delayed consequences can be avoided.
Through collaborations, donations and, last but not least, the fees the choir charges for its performances throughout Germany, they come to raise a lot of money.
“In total, we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitjeni,” said Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village of Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident and well-trained woman manages the money sent from Germany.
It ensures that orphans find good accommodation, for example with one of the grandmothers.
The "gogos", as older women are called in Zulu, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them have up to 14 orphans in their charge, offer them a roof where to live and take care of that children come to school every day on time and dressed in their uniforms.
Those who have no one remain under the protection of Khanyisile, a single woman who, like the two cooks who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day, receives a salary from the association.
In addition, Voices of Africa has launched a sewing school, built two henhouses and, in collaboration with the American health organization PSI, has managed to get many of the villagers tested for HIV.
This is not obvious, since, despite the fact that this disease is evident throughout the country, it is not often openly spoken of.
A king with 14 wives
“AIDS is an absolute taboo,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it has to do with sexuality.”
Something strange in a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his opulent and exaggerated lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This officially unaccepted way of life is largely responsible for the rapid spread of the HIV virus in recent decades.
But it is also due to the countless temporary people who travel the country from side to side and take it where they go.
According to Annette Lennartz, "in any corner you can get free condoms, but these are hardly used.
It’s another culture, here they only accept skin-to-skin contact.”
To foster cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels every two to three years in southern Africa singing songs that speak of melancholy, combative spirit, hope and trust in the black race, songs that many in the southernmost tip of the African continent still remember from the time of apartheid.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a language of blacks; both recognition not only brings with it an excellent atmosphere and a lot of joy, but it has also managed to tear out a couple of tears to some other angry border soldier.
The journey always takes them to Esitjeni, where the singers visit the sponsored children.
Although this small town hardly appears on the maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni River it is well known.
“Go to Esitjeni, there’s light,” the locals say.
And after traveling the 8,733 kilometers straight back to Heidelberg to the rehearsal rooms on Bergheimer Street full of singers marking the pass, one realizes that it is also possible to see its light shining from there.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence of the existence of ice on Mercury.
Probably the ice layer has a thickness of up to 20 meters.
NASA, the U.S. space agency, has provided evidence of the existence of ice on Mercury.
Although it is the closest planet to the sun, there is also ice water, as evidenced by three studies published Thursday in the specialized journal "Science".
The Messenger probe would have found evidence that a layer of ice has formed in the area of the planet that is permanently in the shadow.
It seems that it is at least 30 centimeters and probably up to 20 meters thick.
The water is presumably comets or, most likely, asteroids that in their day collided with Mercury.
No one links the finding of ice to the possibility of life on the planet, said Sean Solomon, lead researcher at the Messenger spacecraft.
The temperature in Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees centigrade.
However, the findings could help clarify how water and other components of life have arrived in other areas of the solar system.
Completely inadvertently for the inhabitants of planet Earth, probes, telescopes and small robots like the Phoenix are dedicated to exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time they send images to Earth: small windows to the vastness of space.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets that make up our solar system, in addition to the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which revolves around the sun just behind Neptune, according to the new definition of the term published by the International Astronomical Union in 2006 Ceres is no "planet".
This section of an infrared image taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" showing infinite generations of stars: the oldest stars are shown as blue dots, although the most difficult to recognize is the pink color of the "newborn" stars.
This region of star formation, unromanticly named by scientists W5, was discovered by the Spitzer Telescope in the constellation of Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6,500 light-years.
This sunken image of an extinct star was taken by NASA’s Spitzer Telescope.
The ring in the form of a donut is composed of the material that the star spits out in its extinction process.
In the huge Trifida Nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, new stars are formed from gas and dust.
NASA's Spitzer Telescope took this photo of the galactic star-forming zone.
The Pleiades, a group of stars also known as the "Seven Sisters", are a visible object in the night sky.
However, with the telescope you can better appreciate the colors.
The Helix Nebula appears as a huge red eye appears in this infrared image.
It is located 700 light-years from the constellation of Aquarius.
Its similarity to a terrestrial continent has earned it the nickname of North America.
The combination of a normal photograph and an infrared image gives rise to a spectacular colorful.
This bright star could be captured in all its glory for the first time by infrared detectors from the Spitzer Telescope.
Saturn and its rings: how they originated remains one of the great unknowns of astronomy.
They are probably the remains of one of Saturn’s moons that disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and sharpest photographs taken by the Hubble telescope: the Removal Galaxy.
Depending on the tones, some images of spiral galaxies become real works of art.
The image published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Triphyte Nebula located several thousand light-years away in the constellation Sagittarius.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin term "trifidus" (divided into three), as dark lines of dust divide the hot heart of this star-forming zone into three lobes.
In the constellation of Ophiuchus, astronomers were able to photograph the clues of a cosmic carambola: 400 million light-years from Earth, the nuclei of two galaxies in the process of fusing sway toward each other to end up colliding irreparably.
This star formation was captured by the Hubble Telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Those who do not like technical abbreviations can refer to it with the surname of Molinillo Austral.
The Hubble Space Telescope photograph shows a section of the Iris Nebula in the constellation of Cepheus.
The nebula located 1,400 light-years away is composed of dust particles that are between ten and one hundred times smaller in size than the dust particles we can find in a house.
This image was created from optical images and x-rays made by different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes located 430 million light-years from Earth.
This cluster of galaxies, called Arp 273, served as a model moment for NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope.
Scientists call the larger spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
In this nebula is the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
This star-forming zone is constantly producing new stars.
In this cloud of stars, associated with the Rosetta Nebula, also emerges continuously new stars; 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this galaxy so bright with a small black hole there is still no dust, only gas.
The researchers assume that it formed shortly after the big bang, when in the universe it could be found mostly hydrogen.
Our window to the universe: the most important telescopes
It appears that the telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, before Galileo Galilei used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have not stopped growing and the images they offer us are getting deeper and deeper.
For 30 years, specifically from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest in the world.
His mirror, in the picture, had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, U.S., the Large Binocular Telescope is being built.
It allows you to observe the cosmos through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Gran Telescope Canarias located on the island of La Palma is huge - only the mirror has a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Nevertheless, it reaches a diameter of approximately eleven meters.
The disadvantage of this more economical construction is that the telescope has a fixed lifting angle, so its mobility is limited.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Tejas also has a fixed elevation angle.
Its particularity is its enormous ability to collect light.
Despite having a comparatively smaller mirror diameter, this capacity is comparable to that of the world’s largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of the Arecibo radio telescope (Puerto Rico), researchers can explore the universe in search of signs of extraterrestrial life.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) you can help anyone who owns a computer, providing processing capability.
View of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) located in the Chilean Andes.
This is where the Very Large Telescope stands, a telescope that honors its name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can also illuminate the medium infrared spectrum.
ESO will also host the European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT).
Its primary mirror will cover 42 meters and will be composed of a total of 1,000 reflective elements.
Until 2018 we are not expected to be able to take pictures.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes located on the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
These have two mirrors, each with a diameter of 10 meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which along with them explores the sky with the help of the Subaru Telescope and the IRTTF.
In Mauna Kea it is planned to build a new telescope of enormous proportions and with a mirror diameter of thirty meters.
This is an image of what it would look like.
However, the most important information in the cosmos comes from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has been sending images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been looking for extrasolar planets, mainly those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that since the start of its mission, 1,235 planetary candidates had been located.
The image shows the latest pre-launch preparations for the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will not launch into space aboard an Ariane 5 rocket until 2018.
The primary mirror of this space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the functions of this telescope will be to look for the light of the first stars and galaxies formed after the big bang.
The researchers are based on the fact that there is also ice at the south pole of Mercury.
However, there is no conclusive evidence, as the Messenger probe revolves around the planet in a much closer orbit to the north pole.
For decades, radar measurements have pointed to the existence of ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger (2004) probe, the first to orbit Mercury, scientists are now certain that it is.

A search for footprints in a country where 97-year-olds are still considered young.
The tour of the Talysh mountain region could be described as wild and romantic.
The minibus advances with great stride through the winding road that passes next to wooded hills, rivers of great flow and the simple houses of local farmers.
Everything is green and juicy, one might even think that it is in the Black Forest.
However, we are in the southernmost area of Azerbaijan; from here the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here the "talyshi" live, a town of which not much is known, except that they perfectly dominate Persian and Azerbaijani and are very long-lived.
Our final destination is Lerik.
This small town boasts perhaps too massive architecture designed in the Soviet era and that doesn’t seem to fit into such a picturesque mountain landscape at all.
European tourists are barely getting to this place, as the road from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is too heavy.
To travel the 323 kilometers that separate both urban cores, it takes eight hours because the road is one-way.
The amazing wealth that the country enjoys thanks to the oil of the Caspian Sea has not yet reached this remote region.
However, Pilatea Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what it takes to become a tourist attraction.
“Baku became famous in May on the occasion of the Eurovision Song Contest and next year we will celebrate the Festival of the oldest people in the world,” says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, perhaps the only one that exists in the world.
Here is documented the life of eight dozen talyshis of the place who have exceeded 100 years of age. Fatulayeva points out an image in black and white.
This is my grandfather, who lived 120 years.
His son died at the age of 136.
However, the undisputed star of the museum is sheep shepherd Shirali Muslimov, who appears to have lived 168 years.
However, there is no birth certificate that certifies this.
And if we take into account that the documented older man lived 122 years, it seems that the age of Muslimov is quite suspicious.
"He was born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973," Fatulayeva explains.
The man was married three times and had 23 children. Apparently he still had time to conceive another daughter at the age of 136.
Has Shirali Muslimov been wrong then at his age in a couple of decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard of the advanced age of this Central Asian inhabitant.
“In some regions of China, Japan, or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan, very old people also live,” says Scholz, “even in Sardinia there are many older men.”
Due to the lack of documentation, it is impossible to provide scientific evidence about age; maximum when there is also no civil record.
Every day glasses full of melted butter
It is a fact that, surprisingly often, the inhabitants of the region around Lerik usually reach a biblical age.
There are currently 20 people over 100 years of age.
Why do so many elderly people live here in the south?
The Azerbaijani tourist guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains that these are the special genes of the talyshis.
The museum’s director, Ms. Fatulayeva, believes that the cause lies in food.
However, from a nutritional point of view, it does not seem logical that precisely the calorie-rich diet of the talyshi, who adore meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of whom, in addition, drink a glass of melted butter daily, is so healthy.
In Cengemiran, a small settlement not far from the town of Lerik lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At 97 years old, he is relatively young for what is styled by these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
Sitting on the floor, it moves tirelessly a huge butter pot.
Eight people live under a roof, including one of Mirzayeva’s sons and a daughter, both of whom became grandparents a long time ago.
They also play side by side with two young children.
In the kitchen they prepare tea for the guests, a tea served in typical cups with a bumpy shape.
Mirzayeva’s teeth are white and are perfectly aligned and under the scarf she hides two long braids of dark blond hair that her son discovers us proud.
I have always washed my hair with milk, so it has never fallen off and has kept its color.
“I’ve never used a shampoo, either,” Mirzayeva says.
The pension is enough to live
He has always eaten only what he produced on his own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
I’ve never been to a supermarket in my entire life.
Then she tells us about her husband, who was in the army.
The worst was the post-World War II period.
However, it all came back to its infancy when the "dear father", Heydar Aliyew, took control of the situation.
This kind of propaganda sounds rare in the mouth of an older woman.
However, in Azerbaijan the cult professed to the paternal figure of the nation, which leads its country as a dictator, knows no limits.
He remained in power until 2003, when the witness ceded to his son Ilham.
At least the elderly in Azerbaijan do not know what poverty is.
Mirzayeva charges 230 manat (about the same amount in euros) in terms of monthly pension, an amount with which you can live well considering the situation here.
And perhaps Mirzayeva’s canonical son is right: “in our culture, the elderly are very respected.”
They live in a large family, are loved, receive all the necessary care and are happy.
As if this wasn't reason enough to stay alive for many years...
The Constitution lacks the expression "Human Rights"
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Protests that rival each other in Cairo show the tremendous division in which the country is submerged.
The future constitution, with Sharia as the basis, is highly controversial.
The Egyptian president did not scuttle in patheticism.
“We have to overcome the transition.
And that is my responsibility, to the people and to God,” he said on public television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, especially to Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslims and secularists.
All of them, so far without remedy in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a theocracy on the banks of the Nile by the grace of the powerful Muslim community.
As Mohammed Morsi explains, almost apologizing, he has had to temporarily cancel the powers of the Constitutional Court and expand his powers "in order to save the revolution."
However, neither the Egyptians nor the entire world know very well what this 61-year-old engineer with a doctoral degree awarded by the University of Southern California really wants to save.
Do you intend to deprive the judiciary of its power?
In fact, the 234 articles, which have been forcibly approved by a constituent assembly composed of 100 predominantly Islamist members in a 15-hour nightly meeting, are truly worrying.
As in previous constitutions, the draft also says that jurisprudence is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
However, what does that mean for “principles”?
This was and continues to be open to interpretation and it seems that Islamists are going to take advantage of this vague formulation, as well as the legal maneuvering margin it carries, to impose a stricter interpretation of Sharia.
This is at least what a new article suggests: in all matters relating to Sharia it is obligatory to consult Al-Ashar University, the most important Islamic institution in the country with great power throughout Sunni Islam.
It doesn’t have to be that way, but this can mean that the clergy would control the legislation, something that – in fact – would result in the incapacity of the judiciary.
Much of the draft constitution is open to interpretation.
What is also problematic is that it intends to maintain military jurisdiction.
During Mubarak’s dictatorship, these courts served to exert harsh repression on the opposition.
After the dictator's fall, up to 11,000 civilians were detained in military prisons.
As the draft states, the state must protect “the true essence of the Egyptian family” and “promote its morals and values.”
This is such an inaccurate formulation in legal terms that with the help of this article state institutions could even control the content of cinematography and literature.
To be clear, this is nothing but censorship.
In fact, no article explicitly establishes equality between men and women.
Instead, another prohibits offending or slandering the Prophet Mohammed and his legacies.
However, it is not clear what an offense is and how it should be sanctioned.
Equally doubtful is the formulation that prohibits "offensive to people"
Is a caricature of the president or a joke about a letterhead enough?
A matter of interpretation, like many other things in the draft that has been presented to Mursi for his signature and that according to his words, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians to be submitted to a referendum.
"The Revolution is Back"
For weeks the opposition has been closing down rows in front of the superiority of the Islamists.
Ten thousand people gathered in an unusual harmony on Friday afternoon in Tahrir del Cario Square and vowed to fail the Act before it could come into force.
“The revolution has returned and we will end up winning,” said Hamdin Sabbahi, who ranks third on the presidential election lists.
Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, said the draft constitution should be “in the trash bin of history.”
Through Twitter, he accused Mursi’s followers of wanting to lead a “coup against democracy.”
“When the referendum is called, we will go to his palace and overthrow it,” opposition leader Jasser Said said.
“We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers has not yet been smeared,” opposition politician Chaled Ali was quoted as saying in Egyptian media.
And several judges announced that they did not want to oversee the referendum, so it would not be considered valid.
“The Qur’an is our constitution.”
For its part, the well-organized Muslim community called for a counter-demonstration, not in Tahrir Square, but after a prayer on the other side of the Nile, before the University of Cairo.
Many women covered in a veil and supporters of the Salafists took part in it with the cry of: "The people demand the application of the divine law."
They demanded Mursi to “clean up the country,” while proclaiming: “The Qur’an is our constitution.”
A struggle for the sovereignty of the symbolic Tahrir Square, where it all began, would have provoked a situation similar to that of a civil war.
It is clear that Mursi’s supporters did not want to risk that something like this would happen.
The Muslim brothers claimed that both those who opposed the draft constitution and its supporters would have expressed their views loud and clear.
Now would have been the time to let the people decide in the ballots what direction the country should follow.
In this sense, it seems that the draft of the Islamists has guaranteed the majority.
"The expression 'Human Rights' doesn't even appear"
Hafez Abu Saeda is furious with this forced constitutional process that should actually have lasted until February and included all social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended the Muslim brothers when they were held in prison or had to face trial during the Mubarak dictatorship.
Not because he shared his ideology, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
For this reason he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
"And now the phrase 'Human Rights' doesn't even appear in the new constitution," he laments in a conversation with the newspaper "Welt am Sonntag".
The extension of Mursi's powers to the three powers of the state caused this lawyer to resign.
The measures taken are flagrant violations of the rules of the democratic game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
“Instead of strengthening civil society, what the president has done is abolish it,” Saeda laments.
However, democracy cannot work without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels abandoned, also by the international community, which observes the ideological struggle that is taking place on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This could turn against you.
A protester in Tahrir Square warned: “You are conceiving a monster that you cannot control.”
The Norwegian rakfish: the world's most malleable fish?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe but in the world.
Is it possible that the success of the country retains any relation to its greed for an extremely malleable fish?
Take a series of over-healed cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a mountain of dirty and wet football clothes.
Leave it there for a week.
You can then smell the paralyzing scent of rakfisk, one of Norway’s delicacies.
I find myself in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
The landscape is spectacular and that smell, always present, floats in the air.
Rakfish is a salted trout that is allowed to ferment in water for up to a year, depending on how bad you prefer it.
As it darkens and gets colder, the Norwegians flock to a festival that is held here, in Fagernes, dedicated to this most, so to speak, captivating meal.
"You eat raw and then drink a glass of a drink of aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, a city firefighter who is also known as the "General of Rakfish", who is in charge of organizing the festival.
Everywhere we see people eating this fish that is stored in small cubes and drinking from a drink significant amounts of the drink.
“Some people prefer aquavit rather than rakfish,” says Havard.
The drink can kill the smell.
I'll try some pieces.
If you can avoid passing it near the nose, it’s not bad; it’s not very different from a portion of sushi that has traveled a few miles by bus.
Rakfisk is a product that comes from a very different era, in which poverty struck Norway and in which, before refrigeration existed, the fish was stored during the fall submerged in water and salt in hermetic barrels.
Later, in the middle of winter, when it is already well fermented, it is removed and, obviously with the inactive senses due to alcohol, it is eaten.
Just one generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, and emigrated mainly to the United States.
Currently, the population is growing rapidly; more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by the abundance of jobs, high wages and a complete system of social services.
A stream of inhabitants of Sweden, the old rival and not much richer than Norway, arrives in this country to work.
The rakfisk is considered something important, an essential, albeit rather unkind, part of Norway’s past.
It is among the most expensive dishes you can buy.
But, in fact, everything is expensive. A can of beer or a sandwich cost you 10<0xE2><0x82><0xAC> ($14) a chiller each.
Norway does not usually appear on the international news agenda and most Norwegians like it to be so.
Here people are still unwilling to pronounce the name of Anders Breivik, the far-right racist who shot and killed 77 people, including men, women and children.
Instead, they refer to the shooting as "the July 22 incident".
It is very difficult for the Norwegians to believe that in their peaceful country one of their own was capable of committing such cruelty and murder.
After much of Norway’s current wealth lies the growth, since the early 1970s, of one of the world’s largest oil and gas industries.
“But oil isn’t the only reason we’re doing so well,” says Anna, our waitress, as she walks through trays of rakfisk and that, with her long blond melancholy and surprising blue eyes, represents the image of Norwegian well-being.
“We are, as you say, wise people.”
His English, like that of most people in this country, is impeccable.
“We don’t like to brag, we don’t like ostentatiousness.”
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great care; everything, except a small percentage of the money coming from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
While everyone was wasting money they didn’t have in the years leading up to the financial crisis around the world, Norway kept the wallet well closed.
“While we can ski in the winter and hike in the summer, we’re happy,” says Anna.
"And eat rakfish," he adds with a loaded wrap.
I'm in the snow making queues to eat something; I've already had enough rakfisk.
Now an almond burger is definitely something different and quite juicy to taste.
But at night, that bad fish comes back.
The hotel where I stay is one of the many venues where a rakfish dinner is held in which the diners vote for the best fish, or perhaps the one that tests the nasal cavities the most.
A television has connected live with a bird-carrying presenter that is surrounded by rakfisk dishes.
It looks like the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What are your scores for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"Here's our score, Havard."
There is laughter and applause.
A man falls off the chair, perhaps defeated by the aquavit.
Or maybe they're the vapors of all that fish.
Mexico: Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto faces tough start
As Mexico’s incoming president, Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto, prepares to take office, BBC correspondent Will Grant discusses the challenges facing the new president and the different expectations of his population.
Traffic in Mexico City is especially bad right now.
In a city that, in the best of circumstances, is already congested by itself, a steel siege has been installed since Monday that cuts several of the main roads leading to the city and is causing huge chaos on the roads.
The aim, however, was not to prevent workers from reaching their workplace, but to prevent protesters from reaching parliament.
On Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto, will receive the presidential gang and take over the management of the nation.
He faces a complicated task.
Mexico has achieved good economic results during the outgoing government of Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, but the country is plunged into a war against drug trafficking that has already claimed about 60,000 lives in six years.
“My government has the great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence,” Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama earlier this week in the Oval Office.
“I’m going to propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve that goal.”
Before coding with the President of the United States, Mr. Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a’s previous political experience was as governor of his native state, that of Mexico.
A very populous and fast-growing state that surrounds the capital; opinions about the new leader are divided in this territory in which he used to move.
A sincere man
In the bucolic city of Valle del Bravo, for example, he is remembered with affection.
Its residents attribute to it the merit of on-site tourism growth and infrastructure construction.
To get to the city you can drive by one of the new roads of Mr. Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto, which is a huge improvement compared to the cracked roads and full of pits that were rehabilitated.
Plaques with their name can also be seen at the entrance of a modern multi-sports stadium and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
“We are confident that he can make a real and lasting change,” says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, MP for Mr. Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto’s party, the PRI.
“Particularly, in terms of security and the economy, we expect the interesting and true change that our country so much needs.”
After an uninterrupted period of 81 years in power, the PRI was overthrown by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Olvera admits that, after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, within the party there are many expectations about Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto.
He also rejects the criticism that the opposition lacks the essence of the new president.
"He is a very sincere man, very committed and with an excellent vision of the country.
He’s a fantastic man of state and, above all, he’s a person who knows how to listen.”
However, on the other side of the state that is not the impression that many people have of his former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
Hidden under elevated stretches of highway is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems of the municipality are also hard and urban.
Earlier this year, the military was asked to intervene to help fight drug gangs operating in neighborhoods and violence against women is particularly serious.
In a desert plot next to a garbage dump, dozens of women’s bodies have been abandoned in just the last two years.
More than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico while Mr. Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto was the governor, a far higher rate than that of Ciudad Juarez, unfortunately famous for its violence and a place that is synonymous with murder of innocent women.
Critics of Mr. Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto say, at best, that he did not know how to address the issue of feminicide while in office.
The most critics accuse their administration of making their eyes fat.
In a concrete house, typical of the deteriorated neighborhood, Irinea Buend<0xC3><0xAD>a has to make efforts to contain the tears while showing me photographs of her late daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the facts, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes her partner murdered her.
“When I got home, it looked like they had cleaned her body,” recalls Mrs. Buend<0xC3><0xAD>a.
"There were signs that it had been hit and rigor mortis had already appeared."
As her mother tells the story, a photograph of Mariana watches from the walls, next to a cross that reads a single word: Justice.
However, that’s exactly what the family says he’s been denied.
“State officials have treated me as if I were an old chasm, a tumultuous one, a grievance.
What they want is for one to simply accept what they say and shut up.”
“But that can’t be the case when there have been so many irregularities and so much negligence,” he says.
The presidential gang that President Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto will receive on Saturday will be accompanied by a huge responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crimes in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has promised to give them priority during his term.
“I hope he’s the same kind of president he was when he was governor,” says the deputy of the PRI Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
However, that’s exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear most.
Bradley Manning did not report abuse, prosecutors say
Prosecutors try to deal with allegations of abuse of Bradley Manning during his prison stay
The trial focuses on Manning’s period at Quantico’s military prison in Virginia
The defense wants the case to be dismissed on the basis that Manning's imprisonment was severe.
The army soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors tried to prove Friday that soldier Bradley Manning, accused of the largest leak of confidential information in U.S. history, missed multiple opportunities to report the ill-treatment he now claims he suffered while under military arrest.
During the interrogation that the prosecution conducted Manning in a preview of the trial in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Attorney Commander Ashden Fein claimed that records of the weekly visits of officers of the unit that Manning received during nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, do not show any denunciation of the charge.
The interrogation, which took place during a hearing following the defence’s request to dismiss the case given that his imprisonment had been harsh and that this had already resulted in sufficient punishment, came a day after Manning testified that he had thought of suicide while in custody.
The army intelligence analyst, who was arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while in service in Iraq.
Later, WikiLeaks published the material on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of information.
In view of Friday, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms that officers filled out after visiting Manning during his arrest at the Quantico military prison, where he was held in maximum detention from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officers would have asked Manning questions and noted their answers.
When Fein asked about the forms on Friday, Manning acknowledged that he had described the treatment given to him by the keepers as "excellent" and the treatment received at the facilities in general as "very professional".
The forms do not show any complaints of ill-treatment, despite officers asking Manning directly about the treatment he received, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had expressed concern about some issues and that the officers visiting him had discussed those issues and indicated that they would be dealt with, but that they did not state those issues in the register.
"They wrote 'no incidents' (after talking about the problems) but this doesn't necessarily mean I wouldn't have mentioned any problems," Manning said.
The judge, Army Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why she had not denounced the treatment she received during the January 2011 meeting with a council tasked with examining the suicide intentions she had expressed on a form months earlier.
Manning responded that his intention during that meeting was to get the reduction of the "injury prevention" regime under which he was.
The military said it had been placed under that restrictive regime, which is one degree below surveillance for possible suicide, to ensure its protection and the safety of others.
“I wanted the senior staff to know that I was okay and [I wanted] to stop being under injury prevention... so I could enjoy what, in my view, is a better quality of life,” Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before being transferred to a military prison at the Marine base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he had considered suicide in Kuwait and that on one occasion he lost consciousness due to the heat.
He said the fact that he was not allowed to know what was happening to him or what was happening in the outside world was very distressing.
“My world was reduced only to Camp Arafjon, to that cage,” Manning said on Thursday.
“I thought I was going to die in that cage.”
Manning claimed that, once moved to Quantico, he spent most of the days in a small cell, at least for 21 hours and often for 23 hours, without company.
Manning said he was only allowed to have a mattress, a blanket, a pair of chancles, some clothes and his glasses.
He explained that he was trying to move all the time, as it was forbidden to sleep or even lie down during the day.
Manning said he always had a light coming from outside pointing at his eyes while he was sleeping.
He said that if the guards couldn’t see his face when he turned around at night, they would wake him up to turn around again.
Manning’s lawyer filed a formal complaint in January 2011 about the treatment Manning received.
Manning was transferred to Fort Leavenworth military prison in Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday, the judge asked Manning about an allegation he had made in Thursday’s statement that, after being forced to sleep naked one night in his Quantico cell, he was forced to stand naked in front of the guards and other prisoners during a morning count.
Manning had testified that he had never been given the opportunity to cover himself with the blanket during the count.
During the judge’s interrogation on Friday, Manning said he deduced from the order he gave the celebrator that he should drop the blanket he could have covered with, but admitted that no one had ordered him to drop it.
Manning testified on Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before because of an attempt to prove to an officer that he did not pose a danger to himself.
Manning claimed that he had told the officer that he could have used the elastic of his underwear or his underwear to self-injure but that he had not.
Manning testified that that night they had removed his underwear, shawls and glasses from his cell.
Her lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account the experiences she had during her prison stay and drastically reduce her sentence in case she was convicted on the war council, which is scheduled to begin early next year.
The defense said it intends to make Manning plead guilty to minor crimes and defend other allegations considered too extreme.
The hearing is scheduled to resume this weekend and prosecutors are expected to argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon has argued that Manning was detained in accordance with rules for the enforcement of all detainees who are under maximum custody in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include cooperating with the enemy, illegally provoking the publication of information on the Internet, leaking information from the national defense and theft of property or public records.
If he is found guilty of all charges, he could face life imprisonment.
My Mexican-American Identity Crisis
He says many were forced to leave Mexico due to lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to criticize those who left; says they remind Mexicans of those difficult times
Navarrette says Mexican-Americans are trapped between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, he had barely come down the expanse and reached the immigration processing area and was already totally confused.
Posters indicated the way to two queues: one for "Mexicans" and one for "Foreigns".
I stayed there for a few seconds, not sure where to go.
Growing up in Central California, my whole life I’ve been called “Mexican.”
This is ethnic tachygraphy, just as my friends in Boston refer to themselves as "Irish" or my friends in New York call themselves "Italian."
I later decided to be "Mexican-American."
But this was Mexico.
And, in my grandfather’s homeland, tachographs or scripts were not necessary.
I was just American.
I speak Spanish well enough to handle myself during an interview in this language.
But I don’t have the vocabulary level of a native and I can’t get rid of my American accent.
So I took my American passport and put myself in the queue of foreigners.
I thought about that moment this week when Mexico’s elected president, Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto, visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
The agenda of the day, as always when the leaders of these two countries meet, included: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto was also keen to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, one of the reasons why at the moment a Mexican is as likely to stay in Mexico as he ventures to go to the United States.
It wants to partner with the United States and Canada and create in North America a trade bloc in the style of the European Union.
In addition, Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto promised to continue fighting drug cartels in Mexico, but did not give details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never remember that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to cede half of their territory at gunpoint.
But for Mexicans, who think for centuries, not in minutes, the elements that remember it are everywhere.
So, the moment a U.S. official says anything that brings the slightest criticism to Mexico, you start to hear complaints, both in the press and among the Mexican elite, about how Americans are usurping the sovereignty of their neighbors.
And the sons of Moctezuma stand up for war.
And yet, for Mexico, the relationship that really poses a challenge is the one they have with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
Are we talking about resentment?
There's a lot.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for whom it is not.
The only reason why there are so many people of Mexican descent living in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that, at some point in our family tree, there was a person, maybe the father or the mother or some of the grandparents, who has not been closed the door of the opportunities in Mexico.
And most of the time that person fits into a certain profile: dark skin, a low level of study, from a poor people, etc.
We are their descendants and we are loyal to them.
Mexico does not.
And even though we may be living the American dream now, having gone to good schools and having had good jobs, we can never lose sight of that what we are living is that, the American dream, and not the Mexican one.
Sometimes our identity may not be clear, but our loyalty is.
It's for the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many of the Mexicans belonging to the elite of the ruling class do not like us.
The feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look over our shoulder as if we were in a lower category that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough and our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
In his view, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families hadn’t failed in Mexico, they wouldn’t have left.
And now we would not find ourselves trapped behind this silk curtain, living well in the United States but still, as lonely souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally came to the United States when I was a girl, reminds me that this rock exists between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans because the first know more firmly who they are and the second it bothers them.
Although she is a citizen of the United States, she is considered part of the two countries.
Meanwhile, many Mexican-Americans I know feel like they’re not part of either.
We love to hear the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You have the best of every country, but you are not rooted in any of them.
In Mexico they see us as Americans.
In the United States, we are considered Mexicans.
Now, to make things even more complicated, so I learned during my trip, some Mexican leaders and some intellectuals want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican-Americans to work as improvised "ambassadors" of Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We would tell our fellow Americans how fantastic it is to visit that country and we would pressure political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico.
Yeah, sure.
That's not gonna happen.
There's too much resentment.
And, with wage inequality, galloping corruption and drug violence, many of us aren’t so sure it’s a fantastic country.
I'm afraid you're going to be left alone with this idea, friends.
It's fair.
If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, then they have to accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans are still resentful about how their families were treated far less ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more "Mexicans" than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could well be an unlikely basis for peace
Will there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed that seems to indicate that any hope is in vain.
In the midst of useless and usual discussions about who first started, piles of buildings have been reduced to debris; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed and, for the first time, missiles from Gaza have fallen near Tel Aviv, the metropolis of St. Israel, and Jerusalem.
But even though Israelis and Palestinians seem to be anchored in their old conflict, everything around them in the Middle East is changing.
The Arab Spring has left everything torn apart whether you like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have been trapped in regional unrest.
Perhaps this will make his struggle even more bloody than before.
However, there are reasons to think that their lethal dead-end situation could unravel.
A war that is neither lost nor won
At first glance, optimism now seems very difficult to justify.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on November 21 is maintained, this week’s clashes have reinforced the hawks on both sides.
Hamas leaders, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced the Israelis to withdraw, even though Gaza has received a good beating.
And despite killing some of its leaders and putting pressure on the 1.7 million Gazans in one of the most miserable and populous corners of the planet, Israel has not been able to put an end to Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently ruled by its ruthless rivals of Fatah, the most moderate Palestinian faction.
In addition, Hamas leaders could come to the conclusion that time is playing in their favor.
Since Islamists have been gaining influence throughout the Arab world, Hamas has made rich and powerful friendships.
Turkey, a renaissance regional power that had previously been Israel’s closest Muslim ally, has embraced the cause of Hamas, as has Qatar, one of the Gulf’s richest and most dynamic states.
Exciting Hamas members say the Islamist crescent is encircling Israel, from Lebanon to the north, where the Hezbollah militia party dominates, through Syria, where rebels of an increasingly Islamist tendency could overthrow Bashar Assad, until they reach Jordan, where Hamas’s allies are threatening the king.
Especially on the southern flank of Israel, the growth of the Muslim Brotherhood led by President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, unlike the most populous and fundamental of the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, did not have much time for Hamas.
Instead, the Muslim Brotherhood is Hamas’ cousins and its leaders rely more on popular opinion.
In future diplomatic actions, Hamas may emerge as a protagonist that cannot be excluded, not even Israel and the United States.
In the meantime, the hard wing of Israel will draw the opposite conclusion.
As far as the military issue is concerned, they have put Hamas in its place.
Israel’s Iron Dome anti-missile system has demonstrated its effectiveness and many of Hamas’ missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will sleep calmer... for a while.
In terms of diplomacy, the United States is stronger than ever; many European countries also blamed Hamas for initiating the last wave of violence.
Above all, Israel has prospered, especially under the rule of Benjamin Netanyahu, a prime minister who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets fired from Gaza have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has not had too many suicide bombers, in part thanks to the barrier that crosses the West Bank, the main piece of a territory aspiring to become a state of Palestine, and protects the international Jewish settlements that continue to increase, despite the fact that the number of Israelis has increased.
Netanyahu, whose Likud party has joined an even tougher line led by Avigdor Lieberman in the run-up to the January 22 election, is in a good position.
Why mimic those twisted Palestinians by giving them a state of their own?
If they really ruled in the West Bank, wouldn’t they fire rockets as their compatriots did in Gaza?
It is better to have them behind that wall and give them a good blow if they raise their heads.
The hard wing may be imposed, although the Arab Spring could alter its calculations.
Although Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere do not have too much appreciation for Israel, their priority will be to address internal difficulties.
Israel’s defense budget is larger than that of its four Arab neighbors combined.
Starting a war with the area’s superpower will hardly help new Arab governments improve their economies.
That the pragmatic Mr. Morsi has worked with Barack Obama to get a ceasefire is a good wish and could mark the beginning of something.
Israelis should also think in the long run.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination means creating a dustbin that one day will explode in the Israeli-occupied territories, just as a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state and demographics worsen the situation as the Arab population grows.
The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to reject Hamas will pay an ever-increasing diplomatic toll.
Both sides need a push from people outside the conflict.
The solution remains the one preached by sensible people on both sides, most of the outside world and this newspaper: two states and the transfer of territory by Israel for security reasons.
The hope, small in the short term, is that the ceasefire will give a little more momentum to outsiders who are fighting for this cause.
Egypt, which must begin to curb the entry of arms into Gaza, along with Turkey and Qatar, is in an unprecedented situation to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem.
Foreign Arabs should also pressure Hamas and Fatah to join in.
That would contribute more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the imminent attempt to obtain a category of virtual state at the UN.
Mr. Obama also plays an important role in getting Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term, he omitted presenting his own plan for peace.
Again in the White House, he seems equally reluctant to devote his attention to him.
This attitude is a deplorable vision of the future.
A stable Middle East is of vital interest to the United States.
This implies a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine.
The Generic Tobacco Packaging Act enters into force in Australia
Warnings about the risks of smoking and parts of the body with diseases shine on boxes of a green off, which are the same for all tobacco brands
Australian tobacco and generic packaging law, pioneering in the world, comes into effect and replaces the logos and colors of the brands with an envelope of an olive-green blackout, horrifying images of parts of the body with diseases and representations of children and sick babies for being children of smoking parents.
With the exception of the different images and health warnings, the only difference between the boxes, mandatory since Saturday, are the names of the brands, all of them printed on a small type of font.
It is the strictest regime in the world applied to tobacco packaging.
The federal government of Australia claims that the goal is to deter young people from smoking by eliminating the traits that make this habit have glamour.
Studies show that if a person hasn’t started smoking before the age of 26, there’s a 99 percent chance they’ll never smoke.
“You can see that children, even from a very early age, understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through its brand,” said Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that showed, for example, how girls related the logo of a crown to the idea of being a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest rates of smokers in the world and these changes will not affect the benefits of multinationals too much, other countries are considering taking similar measures.
The tobacco industry has exerted enormous pressure against the law.
Tobacco companies said the law would encourage the black tobacco market, where cigarettes would be cheaper and more accessible.
“Legislation will have serious involuntary consequences,” said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco in Australia.
It will increase the amount of tobacco brought by counterfeiters from China and Indonesia to sell it on the streets of Australia.
Other people say their business has benefited from the passing of the law.
Sandra Ha, of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family-owned company, said the demand for sawmills and silicone covers to cover the nasty images of the crates had fired almost from zero two months ago, when British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a lawsuit in Australia.
Ms. Ha said that Zico had sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale establishments and that she was expecting more stocks.
“It’s a good business for us.”
According to the experts, the possible obstacle is the popularity of social networks among the demographic sector to which the plan is directed.
Following a series of Australian laws banning television advertising and sponsorship of sports and forcing most sellers not to put cigarettes in sight, tobacco marketing has begun to take place online.
Australia has banned online advertising to local businesses and websites, but cannot restrict it to foreign websites.
“If you’re selling tobacco and you just have this little window left to promote your products, online space is the most compelling place to be,” said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman noted an increase in reviews of brands from “walking citizens” posted on social media websites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
One wonders if it’s just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and has taken the trouble of making a video or if some marketing company is behind it all.
Australia’s British American Tobacco said the industry is focusing more on what the new regulations entail than on marketing.
The industry has even come to pay for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to reject the new rules; these countries are claiming before the World Trade Organization that trade is being unfairly restricted, even though neither of these countries has a significant volume of trade with Australia.
The WTO is likely to issue a resolution by mid-2013.
Plibersek said the government had held talks with other countries that are considering applying similar laws on tobacco packaging.
In 2001, Canada became the first country to introduce the obligation to include images in the boxes.
They are currently mandatory in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
In Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India, tougher laws are being considered.
In Australia, many smokers are challenging.
“The photographs don’t affect me.
I just don’t pay attention to them.”
“Take the cigarette and keep the package,” Victor El Hage says as he buys a package with the image of a tumor in his mouth.
“There’s only one reason I’d quit smoking: for my daughter.”
James Yu, manager of the King of the Pack pond in central Sydney, indicates that the uniform drawers make it harder for him to put them on the shelves.
“Normally it took an hour to make a delivery; now it takes four,” Yu says.
“The government should have totally banned tobacco and then, okay, it was over and we closed the store,” he says as he raises his hands up.
In a constantly connected world, it’s not so bad to get bored a little
During this year’s Thanksgiving celebrations, I unexpectedly had to spend five hours at an airport because the plane we were flying had a mechanical problem and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
So I had a lot of time to think about boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Spending half a day at an airport waiting for a flight to arrive is pretty boring, even if you have the means to be entertained, such as books, magazines or iPhones, not forgetting the duty-free shops.
But there are more and more academics and experts in child development who praise the benefits of boredom.
In their opinion, it’s okay for both us and our children to get bored from time to time.
Being bored forces the brain to look for interesting options and may encourage creativity.
Since most of us are currently connected to this or that screen, we don’t experience the benefits of boredom.
So, should we accept boredom in a good mood?
Oh, yeah.
And no.
But we will talk about it later.
First, like many people, I assumed that now that we have more time for leisure, boredom would be a relatively recent phenomenon.
But, as Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman History at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of the book Boredom: A Lively History, published in 2011 by Yale University Press, says, it is not.
“In fact, the story of boredom is very extensive,” he says.
In the walls of Pompeii there are graffiti in Latin about boredom dating back to the 1st century AD.
We should also consider how we define boredom.
“The problem is that it has already been defined and discussed in a variety of ways,” says John D. Eastwood, a professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada.
After examining the published research and presenting the idea to a discussion group of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as the experience of “desiring but not being able to participate in an activity that fills you.”
He claims that the difference between boredom and apathy is that the person does not do something but wants to do it.
He points out that with apathy there is no desire to do anything.
The main experience of boredom, he says, is “the alteration of the attention process, associated with a low mood and a feeling that time passes slowly.”
Boring can sound terribly similar to depression.
However, Professor Eastwood says that, although they may be related, people who are bored tend to see the problem as a matter of the environment or the world, while people who are depressed consider the problem to be theirs.
Sometimes we think we are bored, when what actually happens to us is that we have trouble concentrating.
In his study “The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention,” published in the September issue of the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues referred to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape of a person reading a magazine article.
Some groups listened in the adjoining room to an all-volume television show that did not hold any relationship, others listened to it with the low volume, so it was barely noticeable, while the third group did not listen to the audio at any time.
The group that listened to the program with the low volume showed more boredom than the other two groups; it was difficult for them to concentrate, but they were not sure why and attributed it to boredom.
“When you try to focus on a difficult or interesting task, shifting attention can lead to boredom,” said Mark J. Fenske, a professor of Neuroscience at the University of Guelph, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
“On the other hand, when you’re doing something boring, like detecting faulty pieces in a manufacturing line, a music that distracts you can help you not get bored.”
“In fact, we currently know that moving or shaving, actions that are often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can actually help fight it, as they make that person physically more alert.”
“Research shows that those children who are allowed to move learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to be quiet,” says Professor Fenske.
We all know what it’s like to get bored at some point: the delay of a plane, a monotonous speaker, an especially boring film.
But some people are more likely to get bored than others.
To help measure it, some researchers developed in the 1980s a “development trend scale.”
The scale includes issues like “many of the things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous” and “there are so many things that interest me that I don’t have time to do it all.”
Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, says that using these scales, researchers have found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, and specifically need more external stimulation and more varied.
But, in general, teenagers are a type of group that gets bored quite easily.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted 400 adolescents and their parents between seven and eight times a day through a search.
He found that 32 percent of teens said they were bored while at school or doing homework, while 23 percent said they were bored when they weren’t at school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know if the current boredom rates, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he said what he did know was that “adolescence is a period when boredom reaches its highest levels,” largely because both children and adolescents are not given much control over what they want to do.
So, back to my question from the beginning: Is it good to get bored?
Sometimes it is not, because, taken to the extreme, it can cause us to expose ourselves to absurd physical risks, such as making bets or falling into substance use as a method to combat it, as research shows.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers talk about the connection between boredom and creativity, according to Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying this issue for more than two decades.
“Sadness is the way the brain has to tell you that you should be doing something else,” says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain doesn’t always know what’s most appropriate.
If you are bored and use that energy to play the guitar or cook, that will satisfy you.
But if you watch television, it may satisfy you in the short term, but not in the long term.
“So if your child is bored and gives them an iPad, they may not be bored anymore, but they won’t have learned to entertain themselves or dosed themselves,” says Professor Fenske.
“This ability to dosed applies to other situations,” he says.
Your child not only learns to entertain themselves, but also learns to better control themselves in other areas.
I don't think we really want to praise boredom.
But we shouldn't be too critical of him either.
Rather, our goal should be to feel comfortable away from the constant rumor of activities and technologies.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
“In our view, we need to get bored more, but boredom is too distressing and disturbing a desire to relate to something worthwhile,” he says.
It points out that what people are really looking for is a way to disconnect and enjoy a dead time.
“In an environment where we are constantly overstimulated,” he says, “it’s hard to find ways to focus our attention when the noise stops.”
Colorado: No Instruction Book for the New Law on Marijuana Consumption
Anthony Orozco, a 19-year-old student at a community college and a soccer player in southeastern Colorado, faces a criminal trial for something that will soon be legal across the state: possession of marijuana stones and a pipe he used to smoke it.
Orozco says that one day in September, he and some friends were driving through Lamar, in the plains near the Kansas border, when police stopped them.
Police found marijuana in the car and a while later Orozco received a court summons for possession of drugs and related articles (minor crimes each carrying a fine of $100) in which he was informed of the date of the trial.
“They treat us like criminals,” says Orozco.
And they are?
In the weeks of uncertainty following the vote that took place in Colorado to legalize the possession of small amounts of recreational marijuana, the response to hundreds of smaller causes for drug possession depends less on the law than on the location.
Hundreds of minor crimes for marijuana possession are being overturned both here and in the state of Washington, where a similar measure was passed.
Police departments have stopped filing charges against people over the age of 21 for small-scale possession, which will be legally passed once the law comes into force in the coming weeks.
But Colorado’s most conservative district attorneys have pledged to go ahead with open cases of marijuana possession and are still citing people.
At the same time, several cities, from Denver suburbs to the western mountains, are voting to prevent recently authorized marijuana stores from opening in their communities.
“This is all changing so quickly that I don’t know what the next one will be,” said Daniel J. Oates, chief of police at Aurora, just east of Denver.
Those in charge of regulation in the state of Washington are also turning the matter around.
And they continue to seek advice on setting up a system of production, manufacturing, distribution and sale licenses – all before the deadline, December 1, 2013, is reached.
They say, for good or bad, Colorado is ahead of most states in terms of regulating marijuana use, first for therapeutic purposes and now for recreational use.
“Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide,” said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Washington State Alcohol Control Commission.
But Mr. Smith admits that any place or system can only make suggestions about what might work.
“There is no real precedent that serves as a model for us,” he says.
Washington’s I-502 law comes into effect on Dec. 6, which also leaves a year in which it will swim between two waters, as the licensing system in that state will not yet exist, but possession will be legal.
In addition, there are some delicate mechanical issues that must be resolved during that period, such as how to maintain a balance between the state’s requirement to offer “adequate access” to authorized marijuana and its ban on conducting cannabis business within a radius of less than 300 meters of schools, parks, infanti playgrounds or infanti center.
“There will be nowhere more difficult to locate an authorized cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the metropolitan area of Seattle,” said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a recently created research group.
On November 21, Oates, Aurora’s chief of police, sent an email to his police officers informing them that the city’s prosecutor would stop bringing lawsuits for minor misconduct over marijuana possession to people over 21 years of age and that the police would stop filing charges against them.
Police chief Oates said they would enforce the city’s regulations regulating the cultivation of marijuana for therapeutic purposes and would continue to pursue drug traffickers and drug dealers.
In Weld County, in northern Colorado, the district attorney, Ken Buck, represents a stricter view.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly to pressure consumers and that they decide to receive treatment.
Currently, 119 people face charges for possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, although many of them have other charges.
“Our office has an obligation to take legal action against those wrongdoings that were a crime at the time they occurred,” Buck said in a statement.
The response has been complicated even in places such as rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana legalization initiative.
Grand Junction Police, the county's largest city, no longer cites adults for possession of small amounts.
Pete Hautzinger, the county district attorney, supported this decision, but also decided not to dismiss any of the pending cases for possession.
“I don’t think he’s wasting his time by continuing to enforce the law until it changes,” he said.
Although 55 percent of voters supported the measure, it was never considered that bringing recreational marijuana use into the government and the justice system would be easy.
The contradictory reactions that arise throughout the state show a marked ambivalence among officials with respect to the great ecological experiment in this state.
“This is a cultural barrier with the district’s prosecutors,” said Sean McAllister, a Denver attorney who represents marijuana possession defendants and is a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Law.
“They’ve spent so much time taking people to court that, in reality, they still can’t accept that it’s legal,” he said.
Being the first states to consider small amounts of marijuana in the same way as if it were alcohol, Colorado and Washington are preparing to become nationwide drug legalization trials.
While lawyers and state officials have a new legal sales border, they also look forward to receiving directions from the federal government, which still envisages considering selling and growing marijuana as federal crimes.
Proponents of the legalization of marijuana are hopeful that the Department of Justice will cede.
Although there have been some prominent arrests of patients and marijuana sellers for therapeutic purposes, the federal government has mostly allowed marijuana sales businesses for these purposes to exist in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
“Although anti-drug agents are likely not to pull doors down to confiscate a small drug bag, they will likely be reluctant to allow the operation of state-regulated stores for the sale of recreational marijuana, permitted under the new law,” said Kevin A. Sabet, a former anti-drug policy adviser to the Obama administration.
Several cities in Colorado do not wait for federal authorities to act.
Even before the election day, some local governments approved moratoriums on any new marijuana store, although it will take about a year before any of them can open.
Last week, the western city of Montrose adopted a six-month ban and is likely to pass it next week.
“We don’t want to put ourselves in a situation where we authorize someone and then we have a serious problem at the federal level,” said Bob Nicholson, a councillor.
"Our community voted against this amendment.
We are studying in favor of what the community voted in versus in favor of what the state voted in."
There are many questions about this.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was harassed to get kicked out of Oxford for being a Tory"
Don't attack college students for their views only now
I don’t remember any moment in my life when I wasn’t dreaming of getting a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and older brother had been in what I supposed was the best place in the world to learn, a contemporary Greek symposium that encouraged the two pillars of civilization: free thought and tolerance.
However, two weeks after taking my place at Worcester College in the late 1980s to pursue the career of History, I had already packed up, triggering the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and started crying.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard newspaper claimed that I had given up because I did not tolerate some college mates having sex in the next room.
Writer A. N. Wilson announced jokingly that I had left because I was forced to drink in unpeeled cups.
The truth was less fun.
I ran away from there.
Yes, I ran away, because I had been subjected to systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of my extravagant name, nor because I came from a private school.
I was harassed for a single reason, which in the cradle of the supposed illustration turned out to be something intolerant and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a prominent adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I supported the Conservative Party.
You may be wondering what that is coming to right now.
Well, several reports indicate that a new generation of middle-right students is suffering a similar persecution.
The institutionalized and growing hatred of conservative party students is such in Oxford that last week a group of them called for the same level of equality of rights as homosexuals, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Corpus Christi College’s JCR (Group of Grade Students) claim that they are “often seriously removed, personally attacked and treated as ungrateful people” for their political ideas.
They want to create a position on their college’s Equal Opportunities Committee to ensure they can freely express their opinions.
Her situation was not favoured by a recent BBC2 documentary called "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" about student politics, which featured the Tories as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
He showed graduate student Joe Cooke, former president of the University of Oxford’s Conservative Party Association (OUCA), in a Rolls-Royce, wearing a silver suit and a stick with a silver handle.
At other universities, conservative students say they are treated as “Turkish heads” by the introduction of higher tuition fees.
Luke Black, 20, vice president of the Conservative Party Association at the University of Nottingham, said in a Sunday newspaper that "there is a growing trend of leftists in universities.
People assume we're like the Bullingdon Club without even knowing each other."
Samuel Roberts, a 21-year-old history student at Corpus Christi who tabled the motion for greater protection, says this environment is “uncomfortable,” while Stephanie Cherill, a 19-year-old OUCA president-elect, says the attitude of JCR members towards people who are center-right has gotten worse.
“This poses a threat to the environment of intellectual debate, as well as to the well-being of members,” he says.
During my first weeks at Oxford I was more alone than one.
I entered college in September 1986, she was a terribly shy 18-year-old girl.
Hatred for the Conservative Party was at its highest point.
The previous year, the university had voted to deny Margaret Thatcher, a former student, a title "honoris causa" after cuts in funding for higher education.
The atmosphere would have terrified any Stalinist.
Already during the first days of the week of welcoming new college students, when the new students meet and meet the professors, I received a sample of the bitterness that was waiting for me.
I found that the professors not only looked fat at the mockery of the conservative university students, but participated in it willingly.
The policy of miners’ strike, privatization and government opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa reached the seminary’s wooden rooms.
The first I attended was to translate French texts from the 18th century into English and I was not prepared for what came next.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (already deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I didn't even say.
Pitt, a slim man with a face that looked like biscuits, knew how to throw out bad bile.
“Do the Thatcherists refuse to learn French, or are they just fools?” he asked.
The other students laughed.
My eyes were burning with the tears I was trying to contain.
“I suggest you go to French classes in your spare time, as long as you’re not too busy meeting people,” Pitt said.
I went back to my room like a soul in pain.
That night I sat alone at dinner time in college; then I felt a slight pat on my back.
He was a second-year English student named James who introduced himself as a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are," he said kindly.
"I'm afraid that's how it goes.
They're messing with anyone who's suspected of being Tory.
It's very complicated for me, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it'll be even worse for you.
Many newly arrived Tories seem to be laborers.”
Later, in a local pub, I cowardlyly tried to hide.
I insisted that I disagreed with everything Mrs. Thatcher said.
That trick turned out to be useless.
A first-year student of Philosophy, Politics and Economics who, paradoxically, had studied at Eton, said: “You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You're contaminated."
Other students have adopted this song.
I became the dirty pervert.
“How do the Tories have sex?” one asked.
"They beat each other up, don't they?"
I felt the same way homosexuals should have felt before the liberal law of the 1960s.
Could you one day live a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to stay with people who would think like me only after nightfall?
Should I become a laborer and suppress my natural tendencies?
The three years that were waiting for me were presented as a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only openly Tory lecturer was Norman Stone, Professor of Contemporary History destined for my college.
He was hated not only by the Conservative Party, but also by Thatcher’s foreign policy adviser and one of the people who wrote his speeches.
I was barely there.
He hated the place because he considered it provincial and insignificant and because of his adherence to the Marxist-determinist view of history.
In 1997 he accepted a chair at the University of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.
“You’re not going to be happy here,” he said.
I started moving daily from Oxford to my parents’ home in London, finding shelter in my family and friends with a more open metropolitan mindset.
I told my father that he hated Oxford and why.
He didn't believe me.
When he studied there in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But if it's the best place in the world," he said sadly.
“They would never do that, not there among my dear dream needles.
Even my communist friends always had an impeccable attitude.”
His sore eyes began to be clouded.
"Give him another chance.
I'm sure they did it just for jokes.
My heart would break if you let it go.”
Tired of so many trips to London, my emotional resistance was deteriorating.
A friend of mine, who also supported the Conservative Party, had succumbed to pressure and renounced his creed.
The following week, during a seminar in which another History professor had insinuated, speaking totally seriously, that I was an “enemy of the people,” I decided to do the same.
Red with shame on the inside, I admitted that my parents had “brainwashed” and called them “stupid old people.”
The truce was short-lived.
It was my father who put the last nail in the coffin of my university career in Oxford.
At the time, my father was writing two weekly columns in the Murdoch press.
My door was locked with a key.
I was inside full of fear and, after five minutes, my pursuers gave up.
When they left I packed my suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
You might call me a weak cry.
But no 18-year-old should be subjected to such level of intimidation and hostility in an educational institution.
What turns out to be even more tragic is that it was Oxford, which has not only formed 14 Conservative Party prime ministers but, to this day, hides behind a reputation of nothing-deserving equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentine prefers elegance over notoriety"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentine: Master of Sewing", which has been inaugurated this week in London, ABC speaks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian designer
Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
The designer has recognized it during the inauguration of "Valentine: Master of the Sewing", a retrospective apotheosis that brings together more than 130 high-height dresses created by his "maison" over the past 50 years.
“I love this palace,” he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the epitome of a story whose only protagonist is "Il Signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his distinguished clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the rare and distant world of nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until next March 3, there are plenty of private letters and photos with the signature of the most pomegranate of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, through Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino teaches these personal memories as trophies of his social ascension: from the humble fashionista of the city of Voghera, in northern Italy, to the idol of the international "jet-set".
Being in love with royalty has nothing wrong.
“At least they don’t turn off the collars on your magnificent carpet like some beautiful pop celebrities do,” says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and entertains with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved being invited to their chalet in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, intimate with forgotten beauties like Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance over notoriety.
And yet, he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, earning a Valentine
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza also does not forget the charisma of the fashionista.
Many years ago, after a parade in Piazza di Spagna, in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment.
We were twenty people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of the floor, the decoration, the food, the music, in everything you could see and feel your spirit.
“Each of the guests made us feel important and loved,” recalls the “top model”, who started working with him during the Paris Sewing Week, in 1995.
“It never goes out of fashion because its designs are works of art,” he concludes.
Parade of Alcurnia
The life of Garavani is not a story of obsessions, but of well-matched love.
He loves people with good education and better titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous sixty-meter-long walkway that proposes a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and has to parade through the walkway to contemplate a "audience" of dreams that looks like the masterpieces of Valentino.
In that audience of mannequins there are names such as Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofia of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the Moderator, 2006
Many of those clients say that the first Valentine is like the first love, "impossible to forget".
I remember it perfectly.
It was a trousers, a shirt, a vest "gillette" and a jacket from the autumn-winter collection 1971-1972.
“It was a gift he gave me,” says Naty Abascal, one of the designer’s muses.
“I prefer him above others because of his femininity, because of his great love for women, because it enhances our beauty,” the former Duchess of Feria added.
I really like the colors it uses, they have great light and are "donors" to the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and fashion prescriber Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg cannot forget the first time she wore a Valentine.
When I was a teenager and I lived in Italy, I dreamed of getting old and the opportunity to wear one of my nightwear...
Finally came the time in the late 90s.
I bought my first Valentine's dress to wear at a party in the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard of Ligne.
It was a red suit, with flared skirt, draped "corsage" and word of honor necklace.
“It was a dream come true,” says Rodrigo d’Arenberg’s widow.
“Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his obsession is timeless,” explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her fashionista's party dresses with "the utmost care... because a dress is not only a dress, it is also the set of souvenirs it carries."
The "King" of Fashion
The grand finale of the Somerset House exhibition is the wedding costume of Marie-Chantal Miller at his wedding to Pablo of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (as the tailor calls his seamstress) to make that ivory silk suit with pearl inlays, twelve different types of lace and a four-and-a-half-meter tail.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the top authority of the specialized press, that dress represents a milestone of the high seamstress of the late twentieth century, "the return of the customers of the high society."
Dressed for years with the elite's "savoir-<0xC3><0xAA>tre", Valentino is now his best example.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the distinction of the highest rank in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur of the L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, decorated with the Legion of Honor, Garavani accumulates as many honors as any of his clients' husbands.
“Its refinement, its calmness, its velvety and perfect appearance has always caught my attention,” D’Arenberg acknowledges.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a great friend of mine.
"He was impeccable, time doesn't pass for him."
It is said by a princess...
The hardest trade in the world: Kawah Ijen’s human mules
For four euros, Indonesian volcano-carriers play life and health by loading 70 kilograms of sulfur through steep stone paths
There are people for whom their work is hell and another who literally works in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their living by extracting sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, it has to descend every day to the bottom of its crater, where the sulfurous gas that emanates from Earth’s bowels solidifies when it comes into contact with air.
After tearing off large sulfur rocks, which in total weigh about 70 kilograms, he carries them in two bamboo baskets that loads on his shoulders through steep stone paths.
They are only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to 2,386 meters altitude, but exhausted carriers take more than 40 minutes to ascend to the step of a turtle, keeping the balance and carefully measuring their steps so as not to slip and fall down the precipice.
They know that any transpiration could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who was sacked years ago by the risks of the Kawah Ijen.
Kawah Ijen miners earn 5 cents for every kilo of sulfur they extract
Once up, they open the door between the tourists who photographed them as circus monkeys and, loading the heavy baskets, they walk three kilometers to the scales that a mining company has set a little lower, 1,850 meters high.
It is about PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been exploiting the volcano since 1960 and, never better, its workers, who pay 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents) for every kilogram of sulfur.
He then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, as this mineral is widespread in everyday life and is used to make cherries, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to bleach sugar.
“It’s normal to weigh 70 kilograms, so we take out about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) on each trip,” explains Anto, who usually performs three daily ports.
It takes three hours in each and ends milled, but they allow you to add 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems a misery for such inhuman effort, it is triple what it would gain in the field.
“The miners’ newspaper is very high here, where coffee collection is paid at 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day and the average monthly salary is two million rupees (167 euros),” explains the carrier, who previously worked as a carpenter on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the cut was not so hard, but Anto has returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village close to the volcano, for a reason of weight that, in Indonesia, is as strong as the sulfur: "I married a young woman from Bali, where I have stopped the Hindus."
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases
At the age of 27, Anto has been playing hide-and-seek in the Kawah Ijen, whose sulfur has already begun to pay him a bill despite covering his face with a mask and special glasses.
He has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases released by the volcano.
It’s the price you have to pay to get your dream.
“I will work two more years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French,” he promises in a more than acceptable English.
Punished for life, this friendly and intelligent young man could be a tour guide, waiter or hotel receptionist, but instead does the work of a mule.
Sharing an unclean wooden cabin with other carriers, he gets up every day at two o’clock in the morning because the sulfur does not stop eating at night, when its characteristic yellow color turns blue and shines in the middle of darkness.
Defying the shadows, Anto descends to the crater lighting himself with a small flashlight attached to his helmet, which he himself has bought with his money.
About 400 carriers carry sulfur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater
Despite its penguin benefits, the mining company has not mechanized sulfur extraction to save costs or supplies any equipment to carriers, who work on their own and at both weight.
In fact, they do not even see part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) camera surcharge that, alongside the entrance of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), the guards of this natural park charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
“This job is for the beasts and not for the people,” Madrusin, a 42-year-old supply carrier who has been in the Kawah Ijen for three decades, has protested since leaving school.
Able to lift up to 110 pounds, he says he will endure working "everything he can" because he needs the money to educate his three children, aged 18 to 10.
I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life
Although sulfur burns the throat and clears the eyes when the wind suddenly changes and traps the miners in the thick columns that come out of the volcano, they are so hard that no one complains of suffering serious diseases... beyond, of course, of their usual respiratory problems, arthrosis, pain in the lips.
Balancing the basket on his back, Unainik can only weigh 50 kilos at 53.
Every day, he and his companions extract 15 tons of sulfur to the volcano, which three trucks transport to the Tamansari warehouse, 18 kilometers away on a goat road in the woods.
“I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life,” Unainik proclaims, opening his mouth well, where he lacks several teeth.
Of his five children, the oldest, 30, also works loading sulfur.
Time passes, but misery perpetuates generation after generation one of the hardest trades in the world: the one done by the human mules of the Kawah Ijen.
Singapore Seeks Babies to Save the Economy
Singaporeans blame race, stress, and the cost of property and education for not having children.
"The population of Singapore needs to grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife, we do our civic duty and we create life!
It may seem unlikely that these verses are part of a mint pill ad, but despite that – or perhaps because of that – the video went viral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The phrases are part of a rap that uses local references like "Let's put a bao (ball) in the oven" to laugh at Singapore's birth rate.
The advertising company that made the video, BBH, hopes that with the announcement they will be able to draw attention to the problem in a fun way.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to get people to fulfill “their national duty.”
This is something purely from the internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world to reproduce ourselves, so we felt this was an issue we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as throwing perfumes with pheromones or organizing speed-dating evenings.
Many of those ideas may have been creative, but they didn’t necessarily work.
So we thought, why don't we do the most creative thing we can to solve this problem, which is compose a rap?
1.2 Children
The one who does not take it so lightly is the government of Singapore.
Spend $1,300 a year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for marriages and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all this has had little effect.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech state city in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
Singapore ' s birth rate, according to its national population division, is currently at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was above 2 – known as the replacement rate – was in 1976.
So why don't Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of Marriage and Family Policies at the National Population Division, says it is due to “better education” and “a wider range of career opportunities.”
“That has allowed people to have a wider range of choices in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond getting married and forming a family,” he explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to increased singleness, and to delaying marriage and births, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at drastically increasing immigration to cope with population decline has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore there are websites where xenophobia abounds barely disguised against many new immigrants, particularly Chinese, who criticize for keeping wages low and not integrating.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year Singapore’s ruling party experienced its worst electoral result since independence.
Since the elections, there has been an attempt to correct the problem, with higher quotas and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the drop in birth rate has known effects on a nation’s economic growth, tax revenues, health costs, and immigration policies, Singapore’s example is also having some unexpected consequences.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, it has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development authority has come to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoe box", that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and have been very successful in sales.
However, there is concern that they can promote a lifestyle of singleness and discourage developers who want to build large, family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of real estate company EL Developers, says his “shoe boxes” sell much faster than larger units.
They are more popular, in the sense that units run out of days, even weeks, faster than larger units.
This makes it much better for our cash flow.
However, he admits that the new standards give clearer guidelines for developers, who were previously barred from offering too many small units in a project.
Too stressful
Singapore is a state city.
While these new rules may be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, talking to Singaporeans working in the center’s financial district doesn’t seem to have much effect.
“People are very stressed out, homes are expensive and so is education, so many people are putting it off,” says one young executive.
Other people may have children.
“But for me it’s important to have my own money and time,” says another 20-year-old.
Men and women mention their career, stress, and cost of property and education as the reasons for preventing them from having children.
So, as much as the government tries to push its citizens to have children, when it comes to having babies, Singaporeans are the ones who have the last word.
Private off line is private on line
-Privacy.
According to the Dictionary of the Real Academia Espa<0xC3><0xB1>ola it is about the quality of private or "the sphere of private life that you have the right to protect from any interference".
What is private for a 16-year-old?
How does this definition apply in your daily life and on social media?
Do you understand the dangers you are exposed to by ventilating on the Internet situations that you would surely not share offline?
The newspaper interviewed five boys between ten and 15 years old, frequent users of the network.
In four of the cases, they associated the term with “something very mine,” on a personal level, and “in the user’s key and name,” when they applied it to social media.
“My deepest secrets wouldn’t go up to a post,” says ten-year-old Jorge, when he tries to explain the meaning of privacy on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he’s had accounts for two years.
“They’re very secretive, my mom can meet them, but not everyone,” she says.
On FB I upload beautiful pictures or games.
I also have fun with my friends.
"I wouldn't share a photo that's not mine, or someone who's making the ridiculous," he says.
The child acknowledges that it is wrong to post obscene photographs, nude people, crimes, or write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge says he knows all 35 friends he has on FB and his nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
The mother is included, she has the key to one of the accounts.
I opened Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
“I don’t know if they answer me, I just pick them up,” he adds.
“Social media is entertaining, I can talk to distant relatives or my friends quickly,” he says.
Do not hesitate to answer that I would never accept a request from an unknown person.
I wouldn't even pay attention to anyone recommending it to a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old Joseph is different.
The teenager has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, in which he admits not to know 20 of the people added to his friend list.
“Don’t scare me, because we have something in common, music for example,” he says.
According to the boy, no one has been insinuated or asked for his home address or phone number.
"If they pressure me or demand it from me, I'll just take it out of my account," he admits.
Joseph became a follower of Ask, after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is no stranger to the experiences of what is now known as cyberbullying.
A friend of mine was extorting him on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money from him.
“I never knew who he was,” he said.
The victim, according to Joseph, did not close the account.
"I just put privacy on him."
Then explain a number of steps to set up the account securely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
I'd do it, if I'm sick or I'm hungry.
“Although I know that’s cyberbullying,” he says.
Key Questions <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Marielos Porras, teacher of English and graduate in Education and Learning, believes that to guide children and adolescents it must be understood that the purpose of social media is to inform.
"The Internet emerged as a means to search for information, but with the appearance of these sites changed the rules of the game," he says.
Porras points out that academic Marc Prensky, a Master’s degree in Pedagogy from Yale University and author of the work Natives and Digital Immigrants, coined these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are them, the children and young people who were born with technology.
“We’re the digital immigrants we have to teach them, when we’re still learning,” he says.
He comments that the topic is complex, "because we are asking them to have a defined criterion on whether or not to disseminate, publish or tell an age that maturity doesn't give for that."
“Also be selective when what matters most to them is being popular, having thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences,” he adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach what privacy is to children and adolescents is through questions that make them think.
"Telling them not to do it is useless," he adds.
Next, Porras lists some options: There are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or, would you like them to post a photo of you like that of a friend?
Do you know what others post about you?
When you tag party photos, did you ask other people for permission to tag them?
And one more thing, does everyone need to know what you’re doing every moment?
Another point is to show them that they have to act online as they do offline.
They're the same rules.
“A person outside of the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, just as it should be on social media,” he says.
Surveillance
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary professor and educational consultant, comments that it is essential for parents to read the policies of social media.
By understanding each of the incisors they have solid foundations to talk to their children about the implications of opening an online account.
“For example, age and what is allowed to share or publish,” he says.
According to Guardian, it is key to remind children of the lesson of “don’t talk to strangers.”
Unasur Summit ends without making the Lima Declaration public
The 6th Presidential Summit of the South American Union of Nations (UNASUR) concluded today in Peru without the Lima Declaration being made public, previously announced and theoretically signed by the seven assistant presidents.
Efe tried repeatedly to access the document signed at the VI Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of the Unasur, but sources from the Chancellery and the Presidency indicated at first that they were going to deliver it after the closure, but then stated that at some point it will be published on the Peruvian Government's website.
When consulted by the text, they noted that the content had been exposed by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, during a brief statement to the press.
The access of journalists to information from the Summit was restricted at all times.
During the day, only the video without sound of the presidential assembly with the message "private session, audio restricted" was broadcast in the press room.
The little information circulated among the reporters was delivered by the press spokesmen of some of the Unasur governments attending the meeting, though not the Peruvian.
The only document released during the day was the list of assistant presidents, causing the discomfort of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who asked for more data.
Subsequently, the Peruvian Presidency sent an email to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but this is Humala's statement, not the official document that closed the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third South American Arab Summit (ASPA), and on that occasion, despite being urged by the press, the so-called Lima Declaration that had previously been announced was also not disseminated.
On the official ASPA website, it can be confirmed that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities sought to ensure that transmission systems were insured for all journalists, but limited access to information to the maximum.
The summit also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a ruling by the Hague Court to resolve a border dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebasti<0xC3><0xA1>n Pi<0xC3><0xB1>era, met during the regional meeting and ratified that they will respect the decision of the (CIJ), which begins Monday in The Hague to hear the allegations of both parties, in the process Lima filed against Santiago.
“We will uphold and execute the judgment that defines the differences that we are bringing to this international court today,” Humala said, alongside his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has been, is and will continue to be a country that respects international law, the peaceful resolution of disputes, treaties and international courts," Pi<0xC3><0xB1>era added, and greeted Humala with a handshake, alongside the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation by both presidents that they will submit to the ICJ came after Colombia this week denounced the Bogot<0xC3><0xA1> Pact for which it had agreed to submit to the judgments of that international court, following a decision on maritime borders with Nicaragua that it considered gravely wrong.
The summit was held with the absences of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff; Venezuela, Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 after the dismissal of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was in charge of opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit, shortly after noon in Lima.
The president read the final document in which he reported that 16 agreements were adopted and the lines of action were set for 31 projects among South American countries for a total of $17 billion in investments.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that UNASUR countries will take "important steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship for which we are expanding the residency agreements."
“Actions are being promoted to improve cooperation in the fight against citizen insecurity and transnational organized crime, actions to make medicines more accessible, low-priced internet access in all corners of South America, and to jointly and efficiently address natural disaster risks.”
With a Europe in crisis, “economic consolidation (from Latin America) should not have a triumphalistic matrix but should serve to expand our productive matrix and to glimpse a better future for our peoples,” Humala added.
“We have decided to privilege a group of 31 emblematic projects that will improve the connection of South American spaces, especially in rural and border areas ... by bringing our countries together and generating new economic circuits,” the Peruvian president said in a message read.
Among those projects, he mentioned that five correspond to Peru, and are located on the transverse axes of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two point to a greater connection with Ecuador, although he gave no further details.
The final document also mentioned the political situation in Paraguay.
“We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve for its reintegration into the Union of South American Nations,” from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated, and good relations among neighbours, was another of the issues underlined by the summit.
In this regard, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said before starting his participation in the regional meeting he hoped to meet with his Nicaraguan counterpart Daniel Ortega on Saturday in Mexico to treat the maritime dispute respectfully after a ICJ ruling, questioned by Bogot<0xC3><0xA1>.
“Tomorrow (Saturday) I may have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega,” Santos said.
“We are going to review all these paths, they are not exclusive, even the Nicaraguan treaty will require a conversation with Nicaragua,” he said.
“With President Ortega I hope to be able to tell you that we will handle this in the most civilized and respectful way possible,” Santos added.
Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico where they plan to attend the inauguration of the new president of that country, Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto.
Also, as part of the summit, the bloc’s defence ministers met in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defense in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, although the last country is suspended.
Peru has the pro tempore presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America must learn from Europe to integrate a citizenship": Rafael Correa
The president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which "South America, in this case, must learn from Europe".
Correa, who participated in the 6th Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), held in Lima, told state TV Peru that Europeans "killed themselves in World War II" and in other conflicts, "but now they are practically a homeland."
He defended, in that sense, the project to establish South American citizenship that is encouraged by the member countries of the Unasur.
“We need to get the free mobility of citizens and workers by any South American country, as is already the case with the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want to bring us back to the past,” he warned.
The Ecuadorian president was also in favour of the recomposition of the Organization of American States (OAS) on the premise of lowering the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those who have signed the San Jose pact on human rights.
Those who give chair never commit to anything, and on the contrary, we South Americans sign everything.
“It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under U.S. funding,” said Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks.
Correa said he did not regret the decision because he did not betray his principles, but respected his "deep democratic and human rights values".
He added that, at the time, “there were well-founded suspicions that Assange was extradited to a third country and his process was not respected.”
He also criticized the Swedish court for demanding that it be questioned in its territory for an alleged sexual offence when "Swedish legislation itself allows it to be done through videoconferencing, which could be done from the Ecuadorian embassy in London."
Correa said there was a risk that Assange’s physical and mental health would deteriorate.
"I haven't spoken to him since he's at our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, nothing serious," the Ecuadorian president said.
What there is is the danger that your physical and mental health will deteriorate by being locked up in a small space without being able to exercise outdoors.
“That complicates anyone’s health,” he added.
Correa noted that the solution to the asylum granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, by granting a rescue conduit that allows him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European legal authorities, and stressed that there have been talks with London fundraiser in search of a solution.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been permanent talks.
“The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European legal authorities because Assange’s lawyer, Baltazar Garz<0xC3><0xB3>n, is doing a series of proceedings in different European courts,” he said.
“If Britain gives the salvage pipeline tomorrow this is over,” he said.
And if Sweden, as its legislation perfectly permits and as it has done in other cases, questions Mr. Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London or questions him via Skype tomorrow this problem ends.
Correa took the opportunity to reaffirm himself as a defender of press freedom and said what he did not tolerate was "mediocrity, bad faith and lies, which distort freedom of expression."
“The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not the evil and perverse politicians but the bad journalists on the basis of profit, blackmail and extortion,” he said.
In that regard, he welcomed that it was no longer these journalists “neither the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador”, and argued that if re-elected “it will delve into the revolution to continue the way and the right direction”.
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto to Paraguay in the Unasur at least until its next elections, arguing that the body "should be firm and not tolerate opportunism and coup d'état clad with legality" because it actually "destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy."
The Ecuadorian president also considered the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to now negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime borders between the two countries following the judgment of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which benefited Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
For the time being, this failure is not being tolerated.
It is a problem between a South American and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to walk together.
We need to process them extensively to overcome them and move on.
He also relied on a good conclusion of the maritime boundary litigation held in the same court Peru and Chile and said that "it is right for Latin America to seek international instances if the two countries commit to accept a verdict no matter how hard it is."
Referring to the eventuality that he presents himself as a candidate in the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador to seek a third consecutive term, he noted that he sees that possibility "with a lot of optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite hard".
Correa said that if he loses the February 2013 elections, he will retire from public life.
Personally, I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unfair as that of Ecuador that socio-economic poverty can only be corrected from political power.
“My political movement believed that it was I who guaranteed that probable victory, so we have to accept that responsibility,” he said.
Winning would be my last term in the presidency and that is where we get out of public life.
If we lose the same.
"It's a decision," he said.
Correa also referred to the new health treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez in Cuba.
I just spoke to Venezuelan Vice President Nicol<0xC3><0xA1>s Maduro and told me that he traveled to a treatment that was already planned, routinely, that was expected to pass the campaign to return to Cuba.
“It doesn’t mean a relapse in President Chavez’s state of health,” he said.
The Ecuadorian Head of State participated today in Lima at the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
AIDS Deaths Cause Late Detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed the test result: AIDS positive.
“It was like I dropped a bomb,” he says, recalling the moment of the announcement, that the doctor was trying to make “softer,” with no obvious success.
The boy hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to inform himself about it; with such an effort that he had already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV Unit of the Civil Hospital of Guadalajara (HCG), to which he arrived in 1994 after several battles.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something hard to imagine in the early 90s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
So even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye to him "because he brought a cut."
AIDS was synonymous with death.
It is now possible to survive this syndrome and do it with quality of life.
However, unaware of their illness, many people still arrive when the virus has already caused damage, "swept" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the onset of AIDS in the world, at least of the first reported cases, "the great achievement at this time means that the survival of a patient who begins treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population, is exactly the same," said head of the HIV Unit of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva.
Infectologist and expert on HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, the scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a fatal sentence, but the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of impact on the immune system when the patients present years with CD4 drug use at the beginning of the diagnosis.
In simple words, the above means that those who receive a positive HIV diagnosis at the age of 25, under these terms "as long as they remain in control, they can live without problems up to 75 years," the interviewee explained.
To scale this advance, it should be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years on average.
While mortality has declined significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS has fallen from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that since the onset of AIDS, 60 percent of patients in the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and 187 have died as of May this year; however, there is universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- Why are there still deaths?
It seems to me that the problem is not access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's what happened to us in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years we have not had a shortage of medication the problem is that patients get very advanced because they do not know their state of infection, that is, in the late stages of the disease.
“Nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have some opportunistic infection what needs to be done to have a greater impact on global mortality is to make early diagnosis and therefore have to offer massive screening tests to all people who require it.”
In his proposal, specialists and officials of the State Aids Prevention Council in Jalisco (Coesida), also the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who went to be tested in a particular laboratory, only motivated because he had done it by a friend and, despite his complication, was already in the stage of AIDS.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're going to die and they don't want to know anything.
“If I’m going to die already, I’d better come back three times a week,” they say no in my case.
The change was to improve, I eat well, I exercise, I take medication.
To date, his parents only know that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, just like anyone else.
“I work, I have many activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but I take care of myself and the other person,” said Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with Millenio Jalisco to motivate with his testimony those who today, as part of World AIDS Day, are afraid.
That the test be done, if they were at risk, that the sooner they know if they are HIV-positive, it is better and if they already have the diagnosis, that they learn that they can live like anyone, being responsible.
That, his message, sums up the 2012 AIDS battle motto.
Condoms behind the counter
Great are the gaps between health programs and the common citizen, said Ricardo Salazar, a tapatio journalist who has assumed the cause around HIV.
And the biggest one is in prevention.
In the places dedicated to this task "the distribution of condoms has actually increased, before we were given one or two, now they give us packets of one hundred, and that's fine but it turns out that there are those today, still, who don't have access to a condom," he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
“Why do you want them for?” is a common question, with sorority and value judgments from social workers, school counselors, pharmacy employees and health workers, to whom adolescents are not wanted to be exposed, the communicator said.
He proposed reorienting this ineffective distribution; that condoms are not just behind the counters and those hundreds are in public toilets dispatchers from the sites frequented by young people.
It is not motivating promiscuity.
Nor is it a question of paying them the fees and the motel, as Governor Emilio Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez replied, when asked if there would be a distribution of condoms in his Administration.
"That's not sexuality, it's best to bring condoms closer to those who already engage in sexual activity," he said.
Keys in Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state is 4th national in new and cumulative cases of AIDS and 13th HIV.
92% of infections are related to the sexual pathway, 6% to the blood pathway and 2% to the perinatal pathway.
It is estimated that 50,000 people may be living with HIV since for one recorded case there are 4 to 5 people who do not know.
Ratified by a U.S. appeals court a ruling that ignores the debt restructuring of the Vitro Group achieved through a mercantile competition in Mexico, the scenario sets a nasty precedent for any domestic company with branches in the neighboring country that has solvency problems.
It would be said, therefore, that the procedures for the survival of signatures that allow Mexican laws are not valid in the country of bars and stars, contrary to international conventions.
On practical grounds, the backlash to the June 15 ruling by Judge Harlin Hale of the Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas, leaves Mexican firms defenseless in the face of the possibility of embargoing their properties on the far side of the Bravo.
However, the resolution opens the door to Mexico’s leading glass manufacturer to go to the U.S. Supreme Court, alleging three inconsistencies.
At the entrance, while the case judge points out that creditors must be governed by the U.S. Quiebras Act, the New Orleans-based Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals says the main proceeding is the trade contest processed in Mexico.
The first point would involve ignorance of international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with a transnational profile.
In fact, to that end, the United Nations Model Law for the Uniformity of International Trade Law was created, placing itself as an arbitrator the American Law Institute.
Secondly, the judgment states that without the intercompany vote, recognised in the critical mass of the commercial competition the debts held by Vitro’s subsidiaries with their parent company, the majority required to approve the restructuring would not have been achieved.
However, the possibility is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro has not been the first case where the scheme is accepted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose intercompany debts were assessed by the Federal Institute of Mercantile Competitions.
What is also true is that the votes of the subsidiaries, however, the creditors of Vitro who fought against it in the U.S. Courts, i.e. the "outside" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, will not have achieved a majority.
The vote would have been 45 percent against 37.
The data is omitted by the Court of Appeal.
From another angle, he blames Vitro for the difficult situation that he faced from 2008 on the back of the severe economic crisis that the United States faced, by hitting the collections on the country.
Soon, the signature of the Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez Sada family will file a reconsideration appeal before the appeals court itself so that the vote reaches the plenary of the same, that is, the five judges, given that only three voted.
In the event of failure to prosper, Cerciorare’s appeal, which requires a review of the process by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States, will be appealed.
The seriousness of the case is that the court dismissed a document sent by the government of Mexico under the figure of amicus curiae ("friend of the Court"), which details the procedure followed by Vitro under the framework of the Law of Commercial Competitions, noting that the State was dismissed with attachment to the agreements signed by the Ban and the Ban of the 15 of the two countries.
Furthermore, it is noted that the country adhered to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules for cross-border insolvency cases, which ensure fairness for debtors and creditors.
Two-band carambola: they take Vitro and take him to the country.

Searching for the Dragon Mars
Meeting over the weekend at a forum at the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and members of civil society in general approved the creation of a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
We are talking, as you know, about a colossal sales and distribution center facing Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of wall country products, with a limestone housing area for employees of 150 companies.
Previously, the Canacintra had managed to unify the governors of the southeastern area to oppose the monumental thing that swept with part of protected areas and poses the mother of all hideouts against industry.
The ACTA died.
Solayed by the government a Senate requirement to explain under what terms and circumstances the Mexican ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known by its English abbreviations as ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property the matter has already passed to the archive.
As you know, the action took place despite the fact that the Senate itself had disqualified the possibility by considering it an attack on freedom of expression on social media.

Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball has been my life"
Hector "Hetin" Reyes was more than 60 years connected to the sport of the table tennis and, thanks to him, traveled the whole world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a mental collection of the history of local basketball as extensive as Hector "Hetin" Reyes has.
And it is that before a stroke confined him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, whether as a minor-category player, National Basketball player, runner-up and leader in the BSN with the Bayam<0xC3><0xB3>n Cowboys or president of the Ba Federation.
“I put on many hats in basketball throughout my life, including several at the same time, like when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the National Team and federation president during the 1990s,” Reyes recalled during a First Hour visit to his home in Bayam<0xC3><0xB3>n, where he resides with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
“Basketball has been my life.”
Kings don't exaggerate by making that assertion.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memorabilia that denote his wide path, so testify.
Bayam<0xC3><0xB3>n in the heart
Of all, those who treasure the most excitement are those who remember his passing through the Cowboys from the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, when he turned 15 serving as co-author or master of the franchise.
“Those were my best years, the ones I enjoyed the most because I had the opportunity to be part of eight Cowboy championships since 1967, whether as a runner-up, co-owner or leader.
It was many years of satisfaction, including the five championships raced from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, Jerome Mincy's debut year at BSN.
From then on he took over "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator," Reyes said.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had run here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me, "I have a very strong player, 6"7" tall.
Do you want it?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended sniper Raymond Gausse, who was born and was one of our best shooters.
I remember he said that if Mincy had given Bayamon a championship, Gausse would help bring in another one.
The Cowboys' championship with Gausse was enjoyed, but already at a distance, as for 1988 it was already a federative mandate.
For that time he preferred to enjoy his executions and those of Mincy in the National Team.
I remember when we first won the United States during the Pre-Olympic in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we reached fourth place and it must have been bronze for not being by that Canadian referee who made us repeat the final move a second time, Reyes said.
Is that 1990 World Cup team the best national team you've ever seen?
He is among the best, just like the one who won the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was that of the Pan-Americans in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and gave the American team a fur, which was quite similar to the one that won us bronze in the world.
That team not only repeated Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico L<0xC3><0xB3>pez and "Picul<0xC3><0xAD>n" (Ortiz), but also had (Javier) "To<0xC3><0xB1>ito" Col<0xC3><0xB3>n and James Carter young, the Le<0xC3><0xB3>n brothers (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to be in the 90.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of personnel, but gave us a gold medal and a great joy was that of the 1995 Pre-Olympic in Neuquén, Argentina.
With role-playing players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and a young Rolando Houruritiner replacing the players suspended by the Pan-American Sea of Silver riot, we won gold against all forecasts.
What has been the best player in Puerto Rico?
No doubt that was Picul<0xC3><0xAD>n Ortiz.
The number of international tournaments is impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated that level as Picul<0xC3><0xAD>n did.
And that’s not to mention his career in the different leagues he played.
Who has been the best Boracay Leader?
That's very difficult.
We have had a very good layer that includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
I really like the work of Leo Arill.
What do you consider your greatest achievement in the federation?
Having been part of the most glorious era of the National Team between 1988 and 1995 and that in the early 1990s the BSN had up to 17 teams in a season.
What do you have to do?
There were things I would have liked to implement, such as the regionalization of the smaller categories.
For example, the Ponce boys would only play in their area and only face teams from other corners of the Island in the national playoffs.
Right now, children travel and play too much unnecessarily.
At least I see the fruit of compulsory certifications and coursework for managers, table officers and referees.
I like that.
What are you doing now?
The most I do is listen to music, watch music videos of my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball games.
And of course, enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been with me.
Actor Larry Hagman has died.
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, became world famous for his central role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R.", in the television series "Dallas", in which he played an unscrupulous, malicious and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as predator oil tycoon J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas," died Friday afternoon from complications from cancer, according to a statement from the family provided to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., the production house of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, once again representing the iconic role he liked most," the family said.
Larry’s family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for Thanksgiving.
Linda Gray, who played her wife's role in the original series and in the sequel, was with Hagman when she died in a Dallas hospital, her publicist, Jeffrey Lane, said.
It brought joy to everyone I knew.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him a lot.
"He was an original person and lived life to the fullest," Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and admitted he had been drinking a lot for years.
In 1995, he was found a malignant tumor in his liver and underwent a transplant.
Years before "Dallas", Hagman became famous on television as a decent guy in the light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie", broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
She played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life is altered when she meets an attractive genius, played by Barbara Eden, and takes her to live with him to his home.
He also starred in two short-lived comedies, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
Her film work included critically acclaimed roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful interpretation of the charmingly disgusting J.R. that led Hagman to his highest stardom.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and other characters in its orbit aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional phrase "Who shot J.R.?", thought to generate expectations around an episode full of emotions in which Hagman's character is nearly murdered, generated international speculation and millions of dollars risked in betting houses.
It also helped give the series a record audience at that time.
When the answer was revealed in a November 1980 chapter, an average of 41 million viewers tuned it and turned "Dallas" into the second-most-viewed entertainment program in history, behind the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. got her pregnant and then threatened to spot her as a prostitute unless she was out of town, but others also had reasons to attack him.
Hagman portrayed Ewing as an insatiable corrupt man with a charismatic smile: a cheating businessman and an unfaithful husband who tried to get his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), to be interned.
“I know what I want in J.R.’s tombstone,” Hagman said in 1988.
I should say, "Here lies the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only deal he lost.
Victoria Principal, co-star of the original series, reminded Hagman on Friday of someone "huge, inside and outside the screen."
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of admirers in the world, and in the hearts of each of us, that we were lucky enough to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were aired a few months ago with great success for the TNT channel.
It had already finished recording five of the chapters for the second season and a sixth was in the process, the chain reported.
There was no immediate statement from Warner or TNT on how the series would handle Hagman’s loss.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who starred in classics such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when she had him in 1931 during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the New York stage in the early 1950s, and then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
While there he met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the California town of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001 he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
“I didn’t put anything there that I thought would hurt someone or affect them in any way,” he told Associated Press at the time.
After liver transplantation he became an organ donation promoter and volunteered in a hospital to assist fearful patients.
“I advise them, I value them, I meet with them when they come for their surgeries, and then,” he said in 1996.
I try to offer some comfort, like, "Don't be afraid, it'll be a little uncomfortable for a short time, but you'll be fine."
He was also an anti-smoking activist and participated in several campaigns.
Start a course that explores the "End of the World"
Each week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when religion professor Stuart Charmé decided to give a course on the end of the world, he knew he had an irresistible sting: The end of the “long countdown” of the Mayan Calendar, December 21, to which many people have clung as proof that the end of the world is coming.
But Charmé had no idea what awaited him in the next couple of months: The cataclysmic Hurricane Sandy, a fiscal precipice that some have called “deudarmagedon” and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where late-time Christian theorists believe the Apocalypse will begin.
“I didn’t realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester there has ever been,” Charmé told students at Rutgers-Camden University in New Jersey this week.
If one analyzes what has been happening in the world today as if we were at 30 days and counting, this has been a really good period.
And remember that bad is good for those with an apocalyptic mindset.
And he’s not the only teacher who offers courses on the “end of the world” this semester, in theory the last in history.
At Temple, Assistant Professor Barry Beautifulr is teaching the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World."
Each week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
“We analyze why these ideas proliferate over time,” he said, and the way they offer hypothetical scenarios that guide certain human behavior.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month the students analyzed films with apocalyptic themes and explored how they compare to real-life examples.
“I’ve tried to inform students about what’s possible, probable, credible and impossible,” said Beautifulr.
On the main campus of the State University of Pennsylvania, Professor of Latin American History Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of Art History and Anthropology, have teamed up to teach a course, titled only “The End of the World.”
“We don’t add ‘2012’ to always have the option to re-learn the course, in case the world doesn’t end,” Restall said.
Despite the “imminent ruin,” students must study, generate projects and take final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, leaving students no choice but to work "until the same night the world is supposed to end," Restall said.
The courses were quite popular.
“It was saturated in two hours,” Restall said of his high-average student course, which was filled with 35 students.
We received emails for weeks and weeks before the start of the semester, from people asking if there was still a place.
Students, on the other hand, say that the course is one of the most interesting.
“It’s fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves,” said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old career student in Religion and Sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, in Rutgers-Camden.
And it is that the apocalyptic mentality, secular or religious, is only a matter of consolation or the absence of it.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old psychology and nursing career student, said he had seen all the apocalyptic films.
“I had never heard of a class that could teach that,” he said.
I'm enjoying it.
But no student interviewed — let alone a professor — said to believe in the December 21 expiration date.
“Our first project dealt with Mayan prophecy and in a way we discredit it,” said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old West Chester senior at Temple.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it’s just a key point in the calendar, Restall said.
But he stressed that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, dating back several centuries, in which people react to the changes around them by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused a surge in these speculations.
“In other places people don’t think about this,” he said.
Mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question of whether he knew about any courses on the “end of the world” there.
“The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world,” he wrote, insinuating an exception from a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall noted that over the years many days of the final trial have been talked about, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will start thinking immediately on the next date" or to philosophize that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world will end.
Students and teachers are taking the date lightly.
Several said they plan to go to "end of the world" parties.
“Maybe call some friends so we can laugh together,” said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
