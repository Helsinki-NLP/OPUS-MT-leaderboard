The city of Juankoski will join the city of Kuopio at the beginning of 2017.
The City Council of Kuopio unanimously approved the alliance on Monday.
The city council of Juankoski approved the union last week.
The municipality of Tuusniemi was also involved in the investigation, but its board decided that Tuusniemi would continue to be independent.
Kuopio and Juankoski decide on the implementation of the following municipal elections separately.
The next municipal elections will be held in 2016.
After the accession of Juankoski, the population of Kuopio is about 111,000.

Putin: Ukrainian troops are shooting civilians
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday accused Kiev's leadership of refusing to engage in direct political discussions with the separatists in eastern Ukraine.
At the moment, the leadership of Kiev does not want to carry out an essential political dialogue with the eastern part of its country, Putin said, according to the Itar-Tass news agency.
He also said that Russian-minded separatists, who say Kiev and the West are aided by the Russian army, were trying to push Ukrainian troops away from their current locations where Putin said Ukrainian army forces were shooting civilians.
“The goal of the militia fighters is to push these armed forces and their artillery away so they don’t have the opportunity to shoot the inhabitants of the region,” Putin said.
The event was held on Friday and Saturday at the Ryrmikorjaam.
It was a surprise that the crowd came from the very beginning.
Visitors were expected within two days, promoter Tom Kangas says.
The Steinäjoki Hiphop Festival was held for the third time.
Next year again.
We’re going to continue to be hip-hop festivals, that is, pop is not allowed, Kangas assures.
On Tuesday, Finland will enter into force a law restricting the procurement of materials suitable for the manufacture of explosives.
In the future, individuals must apply for permission from the Police Authority to purchase or hold substances or mixtures that could be used as a so-called starting material for explosives.
Such substances include hydrogen peroxide, nitromethane, nitric acid, potassium chlorate, potassium perchlorate, sodium chlorate and sodium perchlorate and mixtures containing them if the specified concentrations are exceeded.
For example, hydrogen peroxide is present in detergents and detergents, but the concentrations in them generally do not exceed the limit values.
Nitromethane is used, for example, in acceleration.
However, the raw materials acquired before the entry into force of the Act may be kept and used until 2 March 2016.
George Webster charged with hotel robbery in Nairn and Pitlochry
Two suspects of rape in two hotels are awaiting trial.
George Webster, 28, heard the accusations at a hearing in the Glasgow Supreme Court.
He was charged with rape at the Pitlochryn Scotland's Hotel in Perthshire on 7 June 2013.
Webster is accused of attacking a woman "in an unconscious state, sleeping, and thus unable to make a decision on his own."
Webster was also charged with a second rape at the Golf View Hotel in Nairn on May 4, 2014.
According to the decision of Judge Lady Rae, the trial will take place in Edinburgh on 17 November at the High Court of Justice.
Valioliiga: Super Raheem radii - Mario stayed in the shadows - Valioliiga - Ilta-Sanomat
Only 19-year-old Raheem Sterling once again showed why he is considered a hope for the future of English football.
White Hart Lane had an electric atmosphere on Sunday when Mario Balotelli's reinforced Liverpool came to Tottenham.
Super Mario’s first appearance was promising: experienced English journalists saw a 24-year-old Italian working in the field with a completely different attitude than in Manchester City’s time.
Balotelli was still far from the top.
The Italian lost three high-quality spots and only fed half of his sixteen innings to his own team.
Pool fans who have already taken the player’s favorites expect better in the future.
Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers took on the role of Luis Suarez, who travelled to Barcelona as the team's second striker alongside Daniel Sturridge.
Instead of Balotelli, the team's star was Raheem Sterling, the head of the midfield diamond, who smashed a 3-0 victory over Hugo Lloris.
Sterling, 19, doesn't just shine with his power.
The Englishman is 20 centimeters shorter than the Balotelli than the fish in the water.
The feature is not common for a player who appreciates on the pitch at its best a speed of about 34 km/h.
Rodgers also deserves a big thank you for the development of Sterling.
After the match, the Northern Irishman told how Liverpool has systematically developed a more holistic player from a Northwesterner who grew up in Wembley.
Susanna Mälkki was elected Mayor of Helsinki - "I am happy and proud"
The Helsinki City Council has decided to appoint Susanna Mälkin as the next Master of the Helsinki City Orchestra from autumn 2016 onwards.
The Los Angeles Times has asked him which orchestra he will take next.
Susanna Mälkki says she will begin her new mission with joy and pride.
For more than a hundred years, the Helsinki City Orchestra has played a central role in our country’s music life, for example by performing a large number of Sibelius music.
The orchestra has been led by the best Finnish conductors and I have worked with many members of the orchestra in the past.
I look forward to our future cooperation,” he said.
Administrations of employers' organisations gather in pension negotiations - Homeland - Regions - News - Karjalainen
A new pace is being sought for the pension negotiations today from the meetings of the social organisations themselves.
The administrations of SAK, Akava and STTK of the employers’ organisations will discuss the negotiating situation in the morning.
After that, the actual pension negotiations will continue.
Among other things, labour market organisations have been hesitant to argue about the obligation of retirement age to a life expectancy.
The organizations have promised a work solution by the autumn, but the latest estimate is that it would be born during this week.

Rovaniemi women's volleyball league team Woman Volley tied for Vampula Athletes in the final of the training tournament in Pihtipua on Sunday.
Vampula won 3-2 in five games in a row.
The last batch of WoVo lost 15-11.
The neighbor was one step ahead.
The fight was good, but in the defense game and the pass game Vampula was a little better, WoVon coach Teemu Mäkikyrö saw.
WoVon's six-year-old was so big that the 190-cent American Jennifer Keddy was stuck on the side.
Sara Niemi played in the centre.
Karoliina Kyllönen, despite her thumbs, was playful and formed the most voluptuous combination of WoV with Johanna Pekkarisen.
Jenna Keskimäki, who started as a hacker, was able to make a place for Jana Jaudzema for the last 1.5 innings.
The best part of the vampire was a skilled Russian passer-by and libero Hillaelina Hämäläinen, which WoVo toured as much as possible.
WoV’s preparations will continue next weekend as Hämeenlinna HPK arrives at the training camp in Rovaniemi.
The team will meet on Saturday at the "trade" at 6 p.m. in the official practice game.
We will meet again at the Sports Academy on Sunday.

The company released its results on Monday.
Lidli now has a total of 142 stores in Finland, and the expansion is planned to continue.
Lidl also said that it paid almost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>14 million in taxes on Finland for the last financial year.
Lidl Finland is part of the German Lidl Group.
The company has more than 4,200 employees in Finland.
Ovarian cancer dies more often in sparsely populated areas due to delayed diagnosis and difficult access to treatment
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have released the video in tribute to her mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women living in rural Australia have a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than those living in cities.
Researchers reviewed the patient data of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 35% of women, or more than five years after the diagnosis.
Lead researcher Susan Jordan QIMR of the Berghofer Medical Research Institute confirms that women living in sparsely populated and remote areas were 20 percent more likely to die during the study than women living in urban areas.
SMALL RESEARCH: New medications may slow down lung and ovarian cancer
The researchers went through the women’s health history for seven years.
According to Dr. Susan Jordan, at the time of diagnosis, the age of the woman, the type of ovarian cancer, her previous illnesses and socioeconomic status also affected the chances of survival.
In older women and when cancer was more widespread, the probability of survival at the time of diagnosis was the lowest.
Women living in sparsely populated and remote areas were 20 per cent more likely to die during the study than women living in urban areas.
The study did not try to figure out why women living outside cities are less likely to survive ovarian cancer, but Jordan considers delayed diagnosis and difficult access to treatment as a possible cause.
"Gynecological oncology specialists treat this disease best, and their reception is mostly located in major cities," Jordan says.
While remote-service treatments are becoming more common and the importance of distance is diminishing, in addition to these, the researcher suggests increasing the mobility of doctors so that specialists can treat patients closer to their homes, as well as programs to support patients who are far from home.
According to Dr. Jordan’s research, the long-term survival rate of women with ovarian cancer is poor regardless of geographical location, which emphasizes the need for better treatment and better cancer prevention programmes.
The study, funded by the Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer charity, is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, a 33-year-old mother living on the Gold Coast, Elisha Neav, was diagnosed with malignant ovarian cancer.
The city of Rovaniemi wants to strengthen the stationary cycling park activity in the Friendship Park, which is located next to the hotel Pohjanhovi.
On Monday, the city government decided that the proposed status of the Friendship Park and its surroundings would be placed in Osviitta at a public service point.
The draft proposal will be requested for opinions from the Environment Committee and the Lapland Ely Centre.
With the change of station, the city wants to enable the continuation of motorskiing activities related to tourism in the area.
The site is intended to form a park area, which includes the area between the present Friendship Park and the river.
According to the presentation, between 15 November and 30 April, a maximum of 200 permanent motorcyclists will be allowed on site.
Tank points may also be placed on the designated part of the area.
The new park area is also allowed for maintenance transport.
The city of Rovaniemi has leased the Friendship Park area to safari companies for motorskiing during the winter.
The lease was last renewed in the spring of 2014 and the contract is valid for the spring of 2018.
The car park operation and the change of design have also raised a loud protest.
Residents of neighbouring flats have been worried about both the noise and the emissions.
However, emissions in the area have been investigated and no findings beyond the indicative values have been identified in the studies.
Refurbished vehicles are also lower emissions than old ones.
The Friendship Park as a parking lot is also supported by the fact that if the departure point was moved further, hotel safari customers should be transported to the safari departure points by buses that would be estimated to be 15 departures per day.
According to the city, the area and the surrounding area of Friendship Park is also wide enough for skeeling, better than the places presented as replacement starting points, such as the eastern side of the boat dock on the bridges of Ounasjoki.
The Friendship Park is also good for its location, because in the future the activities can be extended to, for example, the area of the Ounaspaviljon.
The consolidation of parking activities is part of the urban strategy adopted by Rovaniemi City Council, according to which the city aims, among other things, to create a good framework for business activities by reserving sufficiently high-quality areas logistically and functionally inexpensive places.
The Friendship Park has also been marked as the starting point for motorcycling in the city centre’s sub-universal formula, which has not yet gained legal force.
The decline of property properties is visible in garden shops
The decline in the number of homeowners, especially in the group of under-35s, may lead to a decrease in the turnover of garden shops by tens of millions, as today's young consumers reach the "main target group" of garden sales on their behalf.
According to a Financial Times report, homeowners spend only 55 percent of the money they spend on gardening.
The study also revealed that more and more people live in highly urbanized apartments with no gardens. In addition, the size of the garden decreases as the front yard is increasingly covered as a parking space. These factors also threaten the garden area, with an estimated value of about 5 billion pounds.
In the Greater London area, home ownership has fallen from 61 percent to 43 percent in six years, and garden products are the least spent per household in the country.
However, according to the HTA and the British Gardening Association (RHS), an increase in apartment rentals or a decrease in the size of the garden does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
RHS’s Lead Garden Adviser Guy Barter says that “for example, plants grown in portable nurseries are particularly popular among homeowners, as such nurseries can be included in change if needed.”
According to the HTA report, the years 1997-2005 were a booming period of garden resale, as property ownership and wealth increased from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
The report also predicts that trade will grow this year due to better weather conditions, worse than the weather in March and April last year.
Turkey interrogates U.S. diplomat over espionage report
Turkey’s foreign ministry has called on the country’s most experienced diplomat to give a report on a report on espionage carried out by the Americans and the British in Turkey.
According to Deputy Prime Minister Bulent, the U.S. Embassy clerk and Turkish authorities discussed the report on Monday.
The German newspaper Der Spiegel and the online magazine The Intercept have written that documents leaked by former analyst Edward Snowden of the National Security Agency (NSA) reveal that Turkey was the main U.S. and U.K. intelligence agency.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, according to Turkish news agencies, underestimated the importance of the report, saying that all major countries have been spying on each other.
A previous report of espionage targeting Ankara by the German intelligence service has provoked a more angry reaction in the Turkish government.
Cannes-winner Croze appears in new Finnish film
The Canadian actress Marie-Josée Croze, who has appeared in several successful films, has been attached to the female role in a new Finnish film.
Croze will star as director Mikko Kuparisen in the film 2 nights in the morning, which will be filmed in Lithuania this week.
Croze won the Cannes Film Festival Best Actress Award for her role in the 2003 film Invasion of the Barbarians.
He has appeared in Steven Spielberg’s film Munich and Julian Schnabel’s film Perhone’s Glass Picture.
The main character in the 2 nights of the film is Mikko Nousiainen.
The film will premiere in Finland in September 2015.
Majorcan Magaluf Police Chief Accused of Corruption
Reporters of the case presented evidence of the rape carried out by police and Calvi<0xC3><0xA0> city government officials at the Attorney General’s Office in Mallorca on Friday.
The Calvi<0xC3><0xA0> Police Chief, located on the holiday island of Mallorca, has been detained as a result of corruption charges brought by the movement and bar owners in the region of Magaluf, known for its humid celebrations.
Commissar José Antonio Navarro was put under investigation after several Punta Ballena street owners filed corruption charges against him, with most of Magaluf’s bars and nightclubs located on Punta Ballena Street.
According to an online newspaper published by Mallorca Diario, the defendants presented evidence of the rape carried out by police and Calvi<0xC3><0xA0> city government officials at the Mallorcan anti-corruption prosecutor’s office on Friday.
The Spanish National Card arrested two other local police officers in connection with corruption charges, and they are being questioned by the judge together with Navarro.
Across the country, the newspaper ABC wrote about the anger of nightclub owners over the authorities’ bias, which significantly hampered their business.
"It's not about money anymore, it's about survival," one of the landlords told the court.
You're not ruining our business.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf was featured in newspaper headlines in several countries this summer when a YouTube video spread online, where an 18-year-old British holidaymaker had sex with 24 men during a so-called pub crawling.
Since then, the island’s authorities have tried to curb the drunken and uncontrolled use of Magaluf’s holidaymakers by reducing the number of participants in notorious, alcoholic pub crawls.
In addition, the Playhouse race, where the oral video was filmed, was ordered to be closed for a year, and the owner of the nightclub and the organizer of the pub crawl were ordered to jointly pay a fine of 55,000 euros to Carnage.
Above all, the popular tourist destination of Magaluf among young British tourists has also become popular with the so-called balconing trend, which has caused several accidents due to alcohol use, when people have jumped from balcony to another or from balcony to the hotel pool.
Israeli Children Return to School After Gaza War
Thousands of Israeli children in the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters, as rockets and grenade launchers bombed their communities in the 50-day Israeli-Hamas war and schools remained closed as the area recovered from fighting.
The opening of the schools caused joy and excitement in the rocket-bombed communities of southern Israel, but traces of the fighting are still visible.
In the Pashosh day care home in the southern city of Ashdod, workers removed traces of chips from the walls and sliding before children arrived when a rocket hit the day care home.
“We’re a little scared but also excited,” says Ronit Bart, who lives in a kibbutz called Saad, an Israeli commune, and works as an English teacher at the city’s school.
Many children living in this area are in need of routines.
Bart’s 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said returning to school after a long time feels “a little strange.”
“We’ve had some difficult times when we didn’t leave our home anywhere,” he says.
President Reuven Rivlin visited a kibbutz near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Prior to the start of last week’s ceasefire, thousands of Saad-like border communities had stayed indoors or left their homes to safer areas beyond Gaza to escape the fire of rockets and grenades.
Many residents of the Nahal Oz community, located near the Gaza Strip, are suspicious about the return of a Palestinian grenade after a 4-year-old boy was killed in the community.
According to the Ministry of Education, a fair 10 families had not yet returned.
For the time being, the children of these families have been placed in alternative schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, near the Gaza border, which was heavily targeted by Palestinians.
He encouraged children to study hard and promised that "children's education and safety will be taken care of".
Israel and Hamas agreed on a cease-fire last Tuesday.
The ceasefire immediately suspended the fighting, but it did not provide a solution to many key issues, such as Hamas’s demand to remove the Israeli-Egypt embargo and reopen Gaza’s air and sea routes.
Israel wants to disarm Hamas and return the body of two Israeli soldiers killed in the war.
A new round of indirect negotiations is expected in Egypt later this month.
According to estimates by Palestine and the United Nations, more than 2,100 Palestinians died in the war, three-quarters of them civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel has disagreed with the number of deaths, according to which at least half of those killed were soldiers, although it has not had sufficient evidence of this.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians were killed, including a Thai worker.
Hamas and other Gazan soldiers fired 4,591 rockets and grenades at Israeli cities mostly in the south.
The Israeli army, in turn, carried out more than 5,000 demonstrations and other attacks.
Israel’s attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250,000 people fled to shelters in over 100 UN-maintained schools, which had been converted into temporary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people were still in protective custody and as the fighting continued, the school authorities moved the start of the school last week.
“I hope that the school will open soon and we will get back to school, just like other children in the world and just like Jewish children,” said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old sheltered school in Gaza City.
According to the commonly used meter, housing prices have risen the most to seven years in the Australian winter months.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic housing price index, which measures housing prices in the Australian capital, rose 1.1% in August, according to RP data on Monday.
With the increase, prices rose by a total of 4.2 per cent in June, July and August, which is more than in the same months after 2007.
The annual increase in prices was 10.9 per cent, more than twice as much as in the 12 months preceding August 2013, but prices have not risen steadily across the country.
According to Tim Lawless, research director at RP Data, Sydney and Melbourne are at the forefront of price increases.
The results of RP Data show that housing prices in Sydney rose 16.1 per cent and in Melbourne by 11.7 per cent last year.
Next, the housing market in Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin is the busiest; the average increase in prices is from five to six per cent.
The weakest housing market is in Canberra, where prices rose just 1.4 per cent a year as a result of government spending cuts.
According to Lawless, spring began in Australia to increase the number of homes on sale over the coming months, which is a real test for the housing market.
“Given the rise in sales of auctioned homes, generally a lively sales rate, and continued low interest rates, it is likely that house prices will continue to rise over the next three months,” Lawless says.
The new Gösta Museum has attracted record-breaking audiences to Mänttä
The new museum and visual arts have attracted record-breaking audiences this summer in Mänttä.
At the end of August, more than 70,000 guests visited the Serlachius Art Museum.
The new Gösta Museum opened in June and features classic pop art works by Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein.
Mäntä’s photography weeks again said on Monday that he had made a visitor record, when 14,500 interested visitors had visited the Moments event this summer.
We are not used to these numbers.
People have slipped through doors and windows,” says director Pauli Sivonen from the Serlachius Museum.
Sivonen estimates that the number of visitors to the Serlachius museums this year will be close to one hundred thousand.
In previous years there have been about 40,000 visitors.
Located in the middle of Tampere and Jyväskylä, Mänttä-Vilppula has about 11,000 inhabitants.
Museum director Sivonen reminds us that new museums are always a phenomenon when they open up.
“The challenge is to make the phenomenon permanent,” he says.
It is hoped that the season of art will continue well over the summer.
In the autumn, new exhibitions will open.
Police are investigating four thefts in Kajaani in the past few days.
On Sunday evening, a window broke into a commercial property in North Lancashire.
The author had received a small amount of money from the cash register.
Between Thursday and Monday, the Syväojankadu had stolen fuel from the tanks of the truck.
The boat was taken from the port of Peteisenniska again between Sunday and Monday with its engines.
The Soutuvene was light on the outside and light on the inside of the Kalapalta sign.
On the inside was the inscription "OIVA".
A couple of suspects in police robbery have already been arrested.
On Sunday evening, a commercial property was broken into on Tikkapuronti.
The police dog got a trace and a 20-year-old man was found in the woods under a six-month-old hideout.
On Monday, police arrested another man from Paltamo, who is also suspected of having committed the same burglary.
Missing amphetamine brought murder case in Kajaani
The disappearance of only 10 grams of amphetamine resulted in the murder of a Kayanite man born in 1977.
According to the prosecutor, the man had gone into the apartment with his open man and another man and shot a 34-year-old Kaianian woman, the owner of the apartment suspected of being a drug exporter, with a rifle.
The defendant disputed the charge and claimed that the other man was the shooter.
The incident came to the attention of the police when the police stopped a passenger car where the company was burning clothes used in the bloodbath.
In addition to the burnt clothes, a broken gun was found in the car.
The district court of Kainuu will issue a judgment later in the case.
In many places, August was a rare heat.
According to the Meteorological Institute, the same warm August repeats on average once every ten years.
Statistics from the Meteorological Institute show that the average temperature was higher than normal throughout the country.
For most of the country, the deviation was from one to two degrees.
Due to the July and August heats, the whole summer became warmer than usual.
The highest temperature throughout the summer was measured in the first week of August in Pore<0xC4><0x8D>, where the meter showed 32.8 degrees.
Lenny Henry says, “My father never cheated on me.
He never said he loved me.
Henry was born to a seven-child immigrant family from Jamaica in Dudley in the British Midlands in 1958.
Henry's father worked in a factory, and Henry died at the age of 19, and his relationship with his father was distant.
Henry is currently practicing for the Rudy's Rare Records comedy show, based in part on an imaginary conversation with his father and developed on the basis of the Radio 4 channel series.
Soundtracks are a mix of reggae and upbeat.
Henry has had to go through painful childhood memories.
He has been in therapy several times since his mother’s death, and he reflects heavily on his father’s relationship.
My father was very difficult to read.
His face was never seen, only the voice said, “Stop the noise.”
Leave your sister alone.
Go! Go!
I'm watching cricket now.
My parents, Seymour and Hilton, who were adults when I was a child, went to the pub with my father and talked about, for example, the form of beer lessons or the beauty of cricket.
I never talked to him about things like that.
For most of my life, he was the smiling man in the corner reading his newspaper.
Henry recently opened a metallurgy in Dudley, where he got an idea of what his father’s life had to be like, even though working conditions are now better than they were at the time.
The slurries are a little brighter today but they are practically dark, smokey, labyrinthine depths, where flames, smoke, and smoky fall and that bring to mind the dune.
Dad used to go to the bathroom and just land in the barn, and slowly he began to sing to himself as he washed the smelter's dirt away from himself.
As I walked around the shed, I realized that he had done that work for years to get us food at the table, and I began to appreciate him more.
Despite Henry’s childhood, there was a lack of closeness provided by his parents.
My father never gave up and never said he loved me.
It wasn’t until my mother started getting sick a little before she died that we began to reciprocate that we loved each other.
Henry has a Billie daughter with Dawn French, and through his own child, he has been able to share the love he lacked as a child.
Do you have to repeat "I love you" all the time?
Don't stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn French.
Why wouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mom.
Henry is still a good friend of French, with whom he has been married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why wouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mom.
Henry's mother had diabetes.
It was also one of the reasons that led to my mother’s death.
When I started to suffer from high obesity and diabetes symptoms, my doctor told me to make a full reversal.
After that, I started exercising a lot, and I also had to start a strict diet to reduce my symptoms.
It is very difficult –
And boring.
No one likes to eat carrots.
Henry's well-known, short beard perhaps depicts his change during his career development.
After receiving a lot of good feedback from critics about his role as Othello, he has become immersed in the making of theatre.
The next comedy was The Expeditions and August Wilson's Fences.
Making a theater offers a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that Henry has done throughout his busy career.
Henry started working in the industry when he was only 16 years old.
One of the dishwashers spotted him doing imitations on stage and contacted the New Faces competition.
Henry's television career began in the mid-1970s. "For a long time I was the only black imitator and comedian on television," he says.
Henry learned to do his job.
I had to grow up in the public sphere, I had to learn to make jokes from sliding tapes between 1975 and 1985, while I was connected and I was on TV. It was a difficult time.
Lenny New Faces in 1975.
Henry's manager had stage rights to The Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment show where people appeared in black-haired makeup, so Henry ended up being a comedian on the show for five years.
My family didn't like it.
On the other hand, I wish I had never participated in it, but I do not regret it.
Although my position was strange and disgusting, I was able to work on huge events and learn how to treat the audience.
Yet "British TV's award-winning, multi-year favorite and light entertainment program" was at the same time "an angry parody of black people".
Henry worked in the 1980s on a second comedy series, both spoiled and admired by black British culture.
The first episode of The Lenny Henry Show was shown in 1984, and in the 1990s Henry was known for his character as chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!
Henry spent the next decade on commercials, documentaries, TV shows, and feature films, but after his 2008 BBC LennyHenry.tv series, he said to himself, "What are you going to do next, Len - now it looks like you're just walking around or walking sideways."
Next up was Radio 4's documentary series "What's So Great About...".
The first part deals with Shakespeare.
I've always tried to avoid Shakespeare.
It was not really taught to us in school properly, and I think it belonged to a white middle class who wears socks and has money.
That's why Shakespeare's theme aroused fear in me.
All the people we interviewed on the show – Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench – said to me, “Try it.
Don’t give up the whole idea until you know what you’re talking about.
Meet words and you will understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry gave 20 rays of Othello's last speech for the document, and he was sold.
I felt like I could do this.
It almost felt like a part of me had been missing before, and now it was put in place.
“That’s what this is about, this is important, so take it seriously, learn your verse, do a little background research.
So the training process was tough, and I read the play for months before it was done.
The show was finally a success.
Obviously, it was expected to fail, but it did not.
Shortly thereafter, Henry played the lead role in the comedy Eredivisie.
All of a sudden, I was playing in the British National Theatre, and I couldn't believe it was true.
At one point, I thought, “Oh, you’ve changed.”
Once the play had technical problems, and Henry clearly felt that it was his job to entertain the audience.
“The little voice in my mind said to me, ‘You have to do 10 minutes alone until the computer works again.’”
Instead, the driver’s assistant announced that the presentation will continue as soon as the problem is fixed.
I walked out of the stage, and some of me was suffocating with relief.
It is not my duty,
I can leave it to others.
"You're part of the play, stay in your role."
Henry "Fences" at the Duchess Theatre
Learning the colloquial words for "Fences" was challenging.
Panic is a good thing, it makes a person more sustainable.
This play was also well received, so it was like a sign from the gods; "This is what you must do."
That’s what Henry says in a loud voice.
So I decided to stay here.
I sincerely love this work.
I love the training rooms.
Henry, however, is still essentially a comedian: the little humorous boys constantly interrupt our conversations as he switches from one imitation to another.
Abstaining from stand-up comedy is a matter of will, as it seems dangerous to receive immediate gratitude from an unknown audience.
If you keep thirsting for it, it can lead to a dead end.
Sometimes I spend a lot of time at the Apollo Theater when it feels like it, but in general, it no longer inspires me in the same way as before.
I'm asking Henry if he's going to go on a new stand-up tour.
It is a real joy for me to sit with a driver to help shape the beginning, middle and end of the whole journey, and I don’t think I ever want to give up that feeling.
So this is his new rebirth?
Yeah, I think so.
I like to play –
It's really fun.
The show is constantly telling the story, and in that role I am having fun.
I love stories.
People love to tell stories.
Kenya sets up a register of officials to remove ‘employees’
Kenya has begun to draw up a biometric register of officials in an attempt to remove “brain workers” from government salaries.
Employees who did not register within the next two weeks would no longer be able to be paid, the government said in a statement.
The government suspects that thousands of people will still be paid salaries after they leave their official duties.
President Uhuru Kenyatta vowed to crack down on corruption in the public sector after taking office in 2013.
According to an audit conducted earlier this year, salaries and other financial abuses of "employees" cost at least $1 million a month.
The government suspects that salaries will be paid to the account even after the person has died or left their official duties, BBC Wanyama Chebusiri reports from the capital of Nairobi.
In the coming weeks, all officials must register themselves in the identification centres in order to ensure that their data is stored in a biometric registration format, the government said in a statement.
According to the notice, anyone who fails to do so without a proper reason will be removed from the payrolls.
"This measure significantly rationalizes the public sector, because it defines how many people really work in their jobs. In addition, it cleans up the salaries at both levels of government. This solves the problem of the "cabinomie of the branch workers"," says Anne Waiguru, Minister of the Ministry of Interior, and the Minister of the Interior, Minister of the Interior, Minister of the Interior, Minister of the Interior, Minister of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the United States.
The result of the 2015 financial year of the Steinäjoki River may remain EUR 25.5 million in deficit unless the city adapts its operations and expenditure developments in a stressful economic situation.
Based on the current drafting of the budget, the annual deficit is remaining at around 9.4 million.
Possible ways of enhancing the efficiency of the services were to reduce the scope and level of the services, purchases of services, sale of assets and grants, as well as increasing tax and payment revenues.
The investment target of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 million totalled <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8.5 million.
There is no relief to the situation in the municipalities.
The new obligations imposed on municipalities, insufficient growth in tax revenues, increased unemployment and a 5% cut in state shares further undermine the prospects.
The purpose of the Economic Seminar is to look for new ways of balancing the economy.
The city government agrees that savings must be made.
The ship must be turned into a strategic target, says Kimmo Heinonen, Chairman of the City Council.
The city government has returned the presentations made for preparation by the management team.
The proposals of the municipal government will be the basis of the budget statement at the Council’s financial seminar in Fram on Monday, 8 September.
After the Board seminar, the draft budget proceeds through the Board of Directors to the City Council and the City Council.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested as suspects of 'running' against government
A total of 33 police officers have been arrested in Turkey on suspicion of "anti-government plots", local media sources say.
The police did not immediately comment on it.
According to the Hurriyet Daily News, 14 high-ranking police officers were among those arrested.
Some of the police were involved in the corruption investigations last December, which were targeted by government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several police officers were arrested in Turkey on charges of organising a wide-ranging crime and following up on telephones.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who served as prime minister at the time) said the police actions were part of the planned action against him and other in power by the Islamist leader Fethullah Gullen.
Not all children return to school in Ukraine
Most of the Ukrainian schools opened their doors on Monday (September 1) after the summer holidays.
This is traditionally a significant day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school.
At the same time, he told waiting journalists that not all schools have reopened, but he said he was committed to defending the country for future generations:
The first day of September ceremonies are not held in every school.
There is no peace in Ukraine as a whole.
We must fight for peace.
The whole of Ukraine, the whole huge Ukrainian peninsula, must fight for peace.
Aleksan Pastukhov, a leading teacher at the Slavian school where Yatsenyuk’s daughter visits, spoke Russian.
We hope that peace will finally return here and that children can learn from it, which will benefit them in the future.
The celebrations of the first day of school traditionally include children's written shirts, balloons and giving flowers to teachers.
Perry, Texas, said the tweet was unauthorised.
Texas Gov. Rick Perry’s confirmed Twitter account on Sunday night sent an outrageous picture of a Democratic district attorney amid allegations of abuse of power.
The tweet was later deleted, followed by a new tweet where Perry swore that he had nothing to do with the photo.
The tweet was sent unauthorised from my account.
“I don’t accept tweets and I’ve deleted them,” the post said.
Perry's background forces did not immediately respond to clarification requests.
Although the tweets were sent from Perry’s confirmed Twitter account, it’s unclear who posted the photo.
The first tweet included an outrageous joke about Travis district attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of driving drunk in April 2013.
Perry blocked Lehmberg's funding when he refused to resign, leading to a grand jury meeting in Austin this month with Perry being accused of being a potential candidate for the 2016 presidential election.
The headline of the tweet read: “I don’t always drive drunk, three times as much as allowed at mileages... But when that happens, I blame Governor Perry for pointing his finger.”
I'm the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
The Lehmberg agency did not lead the grand jury's investigation against Perry.
The investigation was carried out by Michael McCrum, a San Antonio-based special prosecutor appointed by a Republican judge.
Perry has said he is innocent and called the accusations a political plot.
His influential legal assistant has asked the trial judge to dismiss the charges and said the law on the basis of which Texas's longest-serving governor is accused is ambiguous against the Constitution.
Perry cut $7.5 million in state aid to a public inviolability unit operating in Travis County and handling public-sector indictments after Lehmberg refused to resign.
Perry's decision prompted a left-wing monitoring group to file a formal complaint.
Perry’s confirmed Twitter account is regularly updated – and sometimes famously as well.
After reaching fifth place in the Iowa Assembly during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry threatened to end the game by posting on Twitter an image of himself running on a lake with the text "This is coming, South Carolina!".
According to Berkeley, the housing market is “normal” again.
One of London’s leading builders has warned that the South East England housing market has “returned” to a normal level of activity.
The capital, London, has been plagued by huge demand and sharp price hikes while fearing a widespread credit bubble, prompting the Bank of England to impose restrictions on housing loans in June.
On Monday, Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of the high-level builder in Berkeley, said that "since the beginning of the cold financial year, the market and the number of trades have returned to normal since the peak of 2013" and added that this has enabled "a stable operating environment".
In London, the housing market was very recessive in the pursuit of the capital by foreign investors.
According to Maarekister, housing prices in the city increased by 18.5 per cent in the previous year alone, clearly exceeding the average in England and Wales, which was 6.7 per cent.
Average sales prices of private, affordable and student buildings in Berkeley rose by about a fifth in the previous year, reaching a price increase of <0xC2><0xA3>423,000 by the end of April.
However, the confirmed pound has made London's properties a less attractive destination in recent months - part of the interest has also been influenced by new property tax laws and political rhetoric about a possible "card tax" before the May general election.
London-based real estate broker Foxtons warned last week that an April home loan report, outlining tighter lending regulations, would lead to lower market growth in both sales volumes and prices in the second half of the year.
The Bank of England’s latest data showed Monday that the number of approved loans dropped in July, suggesting a cooling housing market.
The real estate broker Hamptons International has lowered its 2015 forecast of the prices of real estate in London, according to which prices will fall by 3%, as the index measuring the opinion of homeowners on prices has already begun to weaken.
The number of trades made in London’s most expensive areas in Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has dropped by a quarter a year ago, property broker WA Ellis says.
However, demand for homes in the capital is a blessing to Berkeley, which increased revenues from properties sold to more than <0xC2><0xA3>2.2 billion.
Pidgley added that "the demand for a well-designed, right-of-the-way product in the best locations has remained stable, and therefore sales have remained vivid."
In June, the company said it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year preceding April, almost a third more than at the time of the pre-economic crisis peak in 2007.
Annual earnings calculated before taxes rose by 40 per cent year-on-year by <0xC2><0xA3>380 million and sales grew by 18 per cent to <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion.
Pidgley said on Monday before the company’s annual meeting that Berkeley’s annual earnings match the market’s current expectations.
Analysts agree that the profit before taxes for the whole year is <0xC2><0xA3>450 million.
Berkeley's stock sold at the London Stock Exchange in the afternoon for <0xC2><0xA3>23.96.
Hacker leaked Jennifer Lawrence nude photos online
Jennifer Lawrence arrives at the 85th annual Academy Awards ceremony at the Academy Awards.
A hacker who claims to have 100 other stars in his possession leaked the nuggets of Oscar-winning actress Jennifer Lawrence online.
The star confirmed that the photos were genuine and condemned the hacker for "smoky privacy violations".
Officials have been contacted, and anyone who publishes Jennifer Lawrence's stolen photos will be indicted.
The images, originally published on the 4chan image publication page, apparently ended up in the wrong hands due to the weakness of Apple's iCloud storage system. The list of a hundred other hacked stars is claimed to have dozens of other females, such as Olihee and Mary-Keri.
It is not known how much of the images are authentic, but Scott Pilgrim v. World - star Winstead condemned the hacking on Twitter.
"For those of you who look at me and my husband in privacy at our home photos taken years ago: I hope you have a good mind," Winstead tweeted.
However, Nickolodeon's "iCarly" and "Victorious" series Victoria Justice denied the authenticity of the images and tweeted that "these so-called nude images of me are EXPERIENCED, don't you understand?"
Let me make this end as soon as it starts.
BuzzFeed announced late Sunday that the pop star Ariana Grande's representative banned the authenticity of the images about the star.
It’s just an excerpt from a new novel by Howard Jacobson that tells of love and the letter j.
They dissolved, it depicted what had happened best, and gradually they discarded each other like a cardboard box left out in the rain.
Only from time to time did she hear from a woman that she was too serious, troublesome, intense, detached, and perhaps also a little sluggish.
Then he waved his hand.
He recognized the squirrel.
Yeah, he was sluggish, like a sill.
The last victim of his peaks had been a relationship at an early stage, however, which had been promising; it had seemed that this relationship could have eased his lonely boredom, and it might have brought even some content into his life.
Ailinn Solomons had unripe hair, and she was a delicate handsome beauty with a cheerful heart, from the northern village, which was even rougher and farther from everything than Port Reuben.
He had come to the south with his older traveler, whom Cavern assumed to be his aunt, and his aunt had inherited a house that was located in a damp but paradise valley, and the name of the valley was appropriately Paradise Valley.
No one had lived in the house for years.
The pipes leaked, all the bathrooms had spiders, the snails had left their mark on the windows, keeping the whole place as their own, the garden grew weeds that resembled giant limestone heads.
The cottage was like a children's trap, at the same time threatening and magical, a garden full of secrets.
Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is nominated for the Booker Prize for Literature in 2014.
The nominations will be published next week.
Kevern had sat hand-in-hand with Ailinn on several broken terrace chairs in the middle of a long gorge, enjoying a surprisingly warm spring afternoon, both listening disjointedly to the receptionist, through which the whole country was listening to the river’s roaring music and calming news, while Ailin’s
Your legs are too big.
Such songs were basically too aggressive, and they were no longer played in the receiver.
They weren’t banned – nothing was actually banned – they just weren’t played anymore.
They wanted to be forgotten, like the word itself.
Public opinion achieved what was not achieved by the laws and decrees: just as in the field of literature, people chose to read heroes’ memoirs, cookbooks and romances, in terms of music they favored ballads.
With the wildness of the day, Kevern began to tap the imaginary piano and sing serenade to Ailinn’s big feet with a sly comedy sound.
Ailinn didn't understand.
"It was a famous song by jazz pianist Fats Waller," Kevern told him, and at the same time naturally raised two fingers in front of his mouth.
That's what his father had always done before the letter "j" got out of his lips.
It started as a game between him and his father when he was a kid.
His father said he played the same game with his father.
If you let a word out of your mouth that starts with j, and you didn't remember to raise two fingers in front of your mouth, you would have to pay a penny.
It wasn’t a fun game at the time, and it wasn’t.
He knew it was expected of him, that’s all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard of anything like that.
Jazz wasn't actually banned, it just wasn't played.
Improvisation was no longer fashionable.
There was only room in life for one if-word.
At the beginning of the song, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
It had been the same way for the dolls.
Its unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was a cleverness presented through music.
Although Kevern hadn't heard Sammy Davis Jr. by the age of 10, jazz music had become familiar to him through his father's semi-secret CD collection.
Well, at least he didn't have to tell Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
Given Ailinn’s age, it was likely that he did not remember the time when popular singers were not black.
There was no need for laws or coercion.
Obedient society meant that each of its parts accepted the principle that they were grateful — grateful that they were spared in the trade of happiness — that each group did something inherent to it.
Based on their temperament and physical characteristics, people with Afro-Caribbean relatives are best suited to entertain and sport, so they sang and ran.
Originally from the Indian mainland, they were naturally gifted with electrical appliances, so their job was to make sure that every family had a functioning phone that was used to handle things.
Those who were left of the Polish community worked as plumbers; the last Greeks broke the plates.
When they came from the Persian Gulf and the Middle East, those whose grandparents had not fled in vain, in fear that they would be caught up in the floods, and after the floods they would be caught up in the floods, and fear that the floods would come to them.
Let each act according to his gifts.
Ailinn had only heard the ballads, and it was difficult for him to understand how the words that Kevern had just sung could ever be used as music.
Through music, love was expressed.
"They're not really offensive," Kevern said.
Except maybe for the big feet.
My father never hurt anyone, but this song made him happy.
He had already said too much, but the abandoned garden created an illusion of safety.
Not a single word would pass through the soundproofing of the leaves of the giant cabbage plants.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why did your father love something like that?
He was going to say that the whole thing was just a joke, but he didn’t want to raise two fingers to his lips with Ailinn.
Ailinn was already holding him for the autumn.
“I think it was fun,” he said instead.
Ailinn shook his head in disbelief, and his hair covered Kevern’s field of vision.
There's nothing more to see in the whole world than Ailin's huge, squirrel-black hairspray.
He didn’t want to see anything else.
"If you say so once," he said, but did not sound convinced.
But that doesn’t explain why you’re singing it to me.
Ailinn seemed to be really confused.
Are my legs that big?
He looked again.
Your legs aren't really big.
Your ankle, maybe, a little...
And you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It was just a stupid song.
He could've said, "I love you," but it was still too early for that.
"I think you're charming because of your thick ankles," she tried to fix the situation.
I'm twisted in that sense.
This didn't help.
He wanted it to sound fun.
Often, when he wanted to entertain, the effect was quite different, because he, like his father, lacked the compelling charm with which the cruelty of jokes can be controlled.
Maybe his father meant to be cruel.
Maybe he, Kevern, wanted the same thing.
Despite his soft eyes.
The town of Solomons turned red and rose from the patio chair and at the same time dropped the receiver and smashed the wine that they had just drunk.
The wine was made only from backflowers, so he could not use it as the cause of the collision.
In his nervousness, he seemed to vibrate like the leaves of a palm tree in a storm.
"And your thick head is what intrigues me in you," he said.
Except I don't feel like it.
Kevern was sorry for Ailinn, both for his own unnecessary cruel words and for the fear that appeared in his eyes at the moment when Ailinn decided to stand against him.
Did Ailinn think he'd hit?
He had never told Kevern about life in the barren northern archipelago where he had grown up, but Kevern was sure that it was basically the same as life here.
The same huge, swollen sea that waved against them.
The same confused men, though, after a while, even paler and more corrupt than their smuggler and smuggler parents, walked from the pub to the pub, ready to beat any woman who dared to resist or harass them.
Thick head?
He'd still see a thick fist if he wasn't careful!
First suck – kissing had become the most common word for erotic encounters between a man and a woman; the antidote to the meaningless love balls pumping out of the receiver – suck first and then attack.
Kevern thought it was too much, because the immunization itself was already hostile.
Solomon's body language urged him to leave.
He pulled himself up from the terrace like an old man.
Ailinn also felt exhausted, but the depth of Kevern's grief surprised him.
This was not the end of the world.
They hardly knew each other.
Ailinn followed his departure—just as his traveling companion watched Kevern go from the top window—a man who was himself the cause of his heavy life.
Adam was leaving the garden, he thought.
He felt compassion for Kevern and the men in general, even though some of them had raised their hands against him to strike.
The man who turned his back, who was adorable, disgraceful, beaten man, who had lost all the will to fight—why did he feel that that vision was so familiar to him, even though he did not remember that he had ever seen such a thing before this moment?
When Ailinn Solomons was alone again, he looked at his feet.
A few years before the event just described, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher, Esme Nussbaum, who worked at a public opinion-based private institution in Ofnow, made a brief study on the reduction of the amount of energy and the continuance of medium- and medium-sized violence in the areas of the country, where the population is affected.
"A lot has already been achieved, and a lot is still to be done," he wrote, "to counteract the inherent aggression of the people who fought for thousands of years and who won most, especially in the abandoned and remote corners, where people have been scattered across the straits of the shrubs.
However, some things cannot be completely removed.
The higher the tower, the lower the desires it generates.
The people weep about sentimental ballads, embrace stories of defeated abuses and swear in the name of the virtues of marriage and family life, but at the same time the old-fashioned cruelty keeps in its unrelenting grasp both in rural communities and in rural areas.
“You have a regrettable tendency to dramatize,” his director commented after reading the entire report.
I'd suggest you read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum stared at the ground.
I have to ask, are you an atheist?
“I don’t think I have to answer that,” Esme Nussbaum said.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme continued to assert its right not to answer any personal questions.
Feminists?
Once again, silence.
“I don’t ask,” said Luther Rabinowitz, “because I oppose atheism, lesbianism, and feminism.
There are no preconceptions in this workplace.
We are the servants of an unprejudiced society.
While a certain type of hypersensitivity in itself is completely acceptable and respectable, it can sometimes lead to distorted outcomes, to the ones you just presented to me.
You obviously have something against the church—and what you call cruelty or annoyance, others usually call natural energetic and physical strength.
Hooking up here is what I would do if I did, as if it had happened yesterday, if it did happen at all, destroying the earth’s fundamental vitality.
Esme Nussbaum looked around at Rabinowitz speaking.
Behind Rabinowitz’s head, a flamingo-pink LED light announced the instruction that Ofnow had given to the country as early as a quarter of the last century or longer.
Smile at your neighbor, appreciate your partner, listen to ballads, go to musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, listen, disagree, apologize.
Talking is better than silence, and a sung word is better than a written word, but nothing beats love.
"I understand very well what you want to say," Esme Nussbaum replied in a silent voice, when she was sure that her director had quit, "and I just want to say that we are not as effectively healed as we imagine ourselves to be.
I am concerned that if we are not warned, we will find that we are repeating the same mistakes that originally led to the SITUATION, which IF I HAVE BEEN BEEN BEEN BEEN BEEN BEING BEEN BEEN BEEN BEEN BEEN BEEN BEEN BEEN BEEN BEEN BEEN BEING BEEN.
This time, however, we will not shed our hatred and distrust of others.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his fingers.
This gesture meant an endless amount of patience.
“You go too far,” he said, “describing as ‘wrong’ the actions our grandparents may or may not have done.
You also go too far in saying that they spilled their ‘hate and distrust into others.’”
A position like you shouldn’t have to be reminded that when it comes to understanding the past, or defending the present, we’re not talking about ‘us’ or ‘them’.
There was no ‘us’ or ‘other’.
It was a time of chaos, all we know about it.
"If we are quite honest, in that chaos," Esme dared to continue, "no group in society can say that they behaved well.
I don't blame anyone.
What was done was done, whether good or bad.
That's when it was.
There is no need to talk more about this – we agree on this.
And just as it is unnecessary to share the accusations, there is also no need to make corrections, whether they were appropriate or not, and even if there was some way to make them.
But what's the purpose of the past if it's not taken as a lesson --
The past exists so that we can forget it.
If I may add one more thing--
Luther Rabinowitz broke his pyramid.
"I'm going through your report," he said, stating that it was time for Esmen to leave.
The next day, as he went to work as usual, he was hit by a motorcyclist driving on the sidewalk, who was described by passers-by as "evil and angry".
Accidents happen.
Lesotho's army denies planned attack; prime minister stays in South Africa
Officials in the Lesotho army have denied having staged an attack aimed at overthrowing the government and said they are acting against the police, who were suspected of attempting to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country, saying the army had surrounded his official residence and seized government buildings in the capital Maserus.
The head of state traveled with his family to neighbouring South Africa after telling them he had been sentenced to death.
The army's representative, Major Ntlele Ntoi, denied the attack, saying the army responded to a threat from "political fanatics" and police were said to have attempted to arm the fanatics.
“Lesothon’s defense forces took action after receiving several intelligence reports that some police forces are attempting to arm young party fanatics while they are ready to cause problems,” he told the Voice of America news agency.
According to South African Prime Minister Clayson Monyela, the army’s actions looked like a revolutionary effort.
“Although no party has claimed to have abrogated the government by force, the actions of the Lesotho Defense Forces appear to be signs of a revolutionary effort on all sides,” he says.
According to the officials of the Lesotho army, the soldiers return to their barracks on Sunday, and the capital was in a peaceful atmosphere.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing will lead the government while Thabane is away.
Thabane says he believes he is the object of action because he has tried to fight corruption.
Tensions have emerged in Lesotho since June, when Thabane suspended parliamentary sessions due to disagreements between the large coalition government.
He denies the power of the government, even if it is said otherwise.
Microsoft to set up a data center for New Zealand
The information technology company Microsoft has established a large data center in the Uytenland region in a location that the company does not agree to specify.
In a statement sent to Microsoft’s media, the company said it did not disclose the location of all of its data centers for security reasons.
According to Microsoft, the center is already fully equipped and connected to the network.
It’s an investment of hundreds of millions of dollars for Microsoft.
In public, the center was formerly occupied by Oulu or Kajaani.
Microsoft will completely discontinue its Oulu office, which will take about 500 people to work.
In total, Microsoft has announced that it will lay off a maximum of 1,050 jobs in Finland.
Camilla Lindfors, Microsoft’s Communications Director, told STT that the company did not comment on the number of staff employed by the new data center.
On Monday, Kaupalehti announced the establishment of a data center in Uusimaa.
Man Accused of Girl's Overtime in Traffic Lighting

Four tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you want to take photos or videos underwater, you have a variety of options to choose from.
The cheapest option is a waterproof, compact point-and-shoot camera like the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action camera like the GoPro Hero3<0x2B> Silver Edition, both of which cost around $300.
I took these pictures myself at a family party using several different cameras, each costing less than $350.
Regardless of the device, there are a few rules that you should follow.
Always check your device twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery and other parts of the camera are waterproof.
In addition, set the camera’s description settings to match the images or videos you take.
Some cameras or combinations of camera and camcorder have an option to optimise shooting conditions underwater.
Also – before you jump into the water, make sure how deep your device can take.
Some cameras last only 5 feet deep, others up to 50-60 feet deep.
Check out both standard and waterproof models in our shopping guide and in the reviews of digital cameras.
Take a few pictures – many of them fail in some way.
Compact cameras have an LCD display that allows you to zoom in on the image, while action cameras often don’t have this feature.
Even if you have an LCD, it’s hard to see underwater, and the image sombrero can either succeed or fail.
So take a few pictures.
If your camera also allows for grabs, which means taking multiple images at once with different settings, take advantage of this feature.
Stay close to the surface.
The light decreases significantly deeper.
If possible, stay close to the surface when shooting in the pool, lake or sea.
In this way, you also get more colors in your image; the deeper you go, the less colors you see.
Try to get close to the object you are describing.
This is important advice when describing land, but even more importantly underwater, because the light conditions are scarce.
It is very important when using an action camera: these devices often have a fixed lens with a wide viewing angle, i.e. the viewer must be close to the object in order for the object to fill the entire picture with the frames.
China won’t let Hong Kong elect its leaders – protesters swear revenge
On Sunday, the Chinese parliament decided that Hong Kong voters should not be allowed to elect candidates for the 2017 election, despite the growing unrest that calls for democratic reform.
The decision is likely to give a glimpse of the long-awaited protests in the Hong Kong business district after activists began planning and implementing protests just hours after the decision was issued.
The decision of the People’s Congress of China gives the Communists the power to rule out all candidates who do not obey Beijing.
“This was expected, but it’s still outrageous,” said Democratic Party president Emily Lau, a lawmaker.
This is not what Beijing promised.
They've been lying to Hong Kongers.
It is clear that we are working with an autonomous government.
Li Fei, the deputy secretary-general of the People's Congress Committee, defended the Chinese government, saying that the general candidacy in choosing a Hong Kong leader would be too "chaotic".
Since 1997, when the United Kingdom surrendered Hong Kong to China, Beijing promised residents of the region that it would choose its own leader from 2017 onwards.
According to Chinese leaders, Sunday’s decision was a democratic breakthrough because it would allow Hong Kong to vote in direct elections, but the decision also makes it clear that China wants to tightly control the electoral process through a Beijing-run appointing committee.
According to the new clause, only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong" are accepted.
In the summer leading up to the decision, some of the region’s biggest and most prominent protests were held in Hong Kong over the years.
The democracy campaign was largely backed by the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to block the business district if Beijing does not grant Hong Kong a genuine universal suffrage.
On Sunday night, just hours after the decision was issued, hundreds of supporters of the Occupy Central movement gathered in front of Hong Kong’s main administration buildings.
In the demonstration, the organizers of the movement announced that the movement was moving into a new era of civil disobedience and they would create waves of protests in the coming weeks.
However, they apparently did not give details, fearing that it would lead to problems with the authorities.
In an online statement, the organizers said the movement "sees the Occupy Central tempo as a last resort that will only be implemented if there is no hope for dialogue and there is no other way."
We are very sorry to announce today that the last opportunity for dialogue has failed and the takeover of the centre will take place.
Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, and security measures were tight on Sunday near the government's main buildings, including police and barricades.
In Hong Kong, unrest is fueled by the feeling that residents are slowly losing power in their city.
The wave of arrivals from the continent has created competition for products and services.
In addition, there is fear that Hong Kong’s values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are disappearing under increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some have criticised the Occupy Central movement for threatening Hong Kong’s livelihood – the business world.
“The protest they’re talking about can lead to huge financial losses, depending on how many people take part in it and how long it lasts,” says lawmaker Regina Ip, who has long criticized the move.
We do not want to spread concern that Hong Kong is slipping away from our grasp.
Such a mental image would be bad for investing.
There have also been stories in the Chinese state media that Hong Kong’s democracy activists are the culprits of the Western powers that are fueling the revolution.”
This summer, activists held an informal referendum on voting rights, involving 780,000 people – more than a fifth of Hong Kong’s voters.
In July, tens of thousands took part in one of the region’s largest democracies.
U.S. Prom Tradition Hits British Universities: Private Jets for New Students
We are excited to meet the demand by establishing Britain’s first-class luxury travel mode for today’s students.
In addition to the private jet, the company also offers other vehicles, such as Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1, to ensure the most memorable arrival to the university.
According to Stewart, the service also has a security aspect.
The service is the best possible option for students who would otherwise scrape their property across the country in cars loaded with extremes.
When this is combined with many VIF features (VIP Friends), we are ready to provide today’s students with the easiest and highest-class transportation possible to the university.
According to the company's representative, reservations have not yet come, as the service has just been established, but added that "students will start making orders in the coming weeks."
The company believes that there is demand for the service, although most students pay a tuition fee of <0xC2><0xA3>9,000.
Today’s students are very different from those who started their studies 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago. Now it’s more important than ever to create a memorable first impression, and VIF is just the right way to do it.
However, the National Student Union criticised the service, which is not realistic.
According to Megan Dunn, vice president of the organization’s university department, “this service plan seems to be really far from the lives of the majority of students.”
This month, many of them are beginning to learn about the level of cost of living, when the financial support available in the form of loans and grants has been left behind by the tremendous increase in basic investment costs. Only then can we begin to think about what thousands of people would be able to use.
Ipswich "seahouse" for sale
Real estate agents removed the sale picture of a house for sale in Suffolk after noticing that the picture of the house in the living room lay a big pig.
A one-bedroom house with a price of <0xC2><0xA3>120,000 is located on a private road in Ipswich.
The announcement included a photo of the living room where the pig hung its head on the sofa.
According to real estate agent Connells, the image of the pig is the owner's pet.
"However, the image ended up in the notification accidentally, and it has since been deleted," the company's representative said.
In the announcement, Connells described the former meeting house as "a unique one-bedroom house".
Even though the real estate agency has removed the image from the website, it still appears in the ads.
The sale of the house has attracted interest on social media, where it is asked whether the pig is included in the price of the house.

Spanish striker Fernando Torres' departure from Chelsea was assured, but the substitute entered almost at the same time.
Chelsea announced that they had laundered a four-year deal with French quarterback Loic Remy's neighbor QPR.
According to the newspaper, the retail price is 13 million euros.

Bulgarian prison staff hold national protests <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Hundreds of prison workers all over Bulgaria showed their intentions in front of the Sofia Ministry of Justice.
In a peaceful demonstration, they declared their wish to return to the old working conditions, which were recently amended.

Members of the Trade Union of Employees of the Ministry of the Interior are expected to join the protest of the Prison Workers’ Association.
Basketball: Fans' encouragement almost too much: Sasu Salin had to turn to the field
Basketball Sasu Salin was today the embodiment of Finland’s victory.
He was able to forget his black-and-white U.S. fight and smeared the blood of the other half of Ukraine with his staggering solutions.
But Salin transferred all his honor to his relatives and did so in a way that:
I meant to turn around at the end of the field, that encouragement was so great.
In my eyes, fog, I couldn't do anything.
The noise and the white audience was almost too much for me.
The hall’s power moments included nine fast-paced surfaces, ballistics, plates, and craftsmanship wherever it took place.
I don't know how it went, but I got into a flow mode that made it all work out.
They come from somewhere, at some point, now in a very unintelligent place, Sasu glittered.
That's my role.
Do all of that.
It was great to see that the others got caught.
It caught up with the whole gang.
Salin is a lifeguard and lifeguard for the team, so it’s no wonder that his example raised the entire team to flight, which was too much for the big and hardcore Ukrainian five.
Finland in the World Cup after a 32-year hiatus: the previous one was remembered for a tough game
Heikki Montonen (or Heikki Montonen) was the head coach of Finland at the 1982 Argentine World Cup.
It has been 32 years since the Finnish men’s volleyball team last played in the World Cup finals.
Seppo Sirkka was the only Finnish photographer at the 1982 tournament in Argentina, where the legendary Reino Kosonen was Finland’s second coach and the current player agent Jouni Parkkali as a general player.
Kosonen and Parkkali remember one thing about the tournament as yesterday: it was the start of a heat match against France.
"In the ball of that match, the referee's game was brilliant," Kosonen recalled.
We had already won, and both teams were already on the back line.
All of a sudden, the game continued.
We lost it 2-3, and then the fuckers got more mixed up," Parkkali said.
Finland played under head coach Heikki Montosen and finished in 17th place.
Finland is now again among the world's most popular countries, with the World Cup in Poland being fast-tracked on Saturday.
Many things have changed drastically in international aviation over the past 32 years.
The strengths of the players are about the same class as before, but the quality and skill are now more.
The average length of the players has also increased.
The game is even faster,” Parkkali thought.
But how is it in Poland?
The Finnish player material has been expanded, and the burden can be shared.
I am looking forward to Finland moving forward from the start.
Then it can be tight," says Kosonen.
Seppo Sirkka
Olli Nenonen, Juuko Juvonen and Jukka Savio were in a winning match against Tunisia.
The current player agent Jouni Parkkali was a general player in the World Cup.
Let's hope we're going to get 17th now.
South Korea and Tunisia should go downhill,” Parkkali said.
Legendary Reino Kosonen was the second coach of the national team in Argentina.
Jukka Savio, Mauri Leppänen and Kari Körkkö won the Tunisia match.
The sauna and evening brisket at the Buenos Aires Seamen's Church were part of the national team's program at the 1982 World Cup.
Kari Kalin (ok.) stretched out with his teammates.

Finnish tourists rescued a Cita dog from a mountain in Norway: "These men deserve all thanks"
When Norwegian Merethe Mikkelsen and her dog fell into trouble in the mountains on Thursday, Antti and Tuomo Soini bravely offered to help.
Over the weekend, Mikkelsen was looking for "international heroes" on Facebook to thank his helpers once again.
Mikkelsen said in a public Facebook update that the Cita dog with him in the mountains on Thursday injured his pocket.
The injured dog was no longer able to walk in the steep terrain.
I tried to take it down myself, but I couldn't, so I had to let it go.
I tried many times to attract and pull it a little further, but its legs did not just carry, Mikkelsen writes in his update.
According to Mikkelsen, there was no help from the police, from a nearby hotel or from passers-by.
In the dark of the night, the situation was already beginning to look threatening.
Fortunately, there were two hikers who were ready to help: Antti Soini from Tampere and his father Tuomo.
The men had visited the highest mountain in Norway at Galdh<0xC3><0xB8>piggen and headed to their camp when they saw a woman and a dog in the middle of the mountain slope.
(Mikkelsen) was relatively calm in relation to the situation.
We offered to help him with the dog, Antti Soini tells Ilta-Sanom in a message sent to him.
There was also a German man who was carrying a tripod with him.
The Patja Cital received pairs of pairs on which the injured dog was attached.
The German came a moment after us, as we had thought about what to do with the dog and carried the dog in the arms for a moment down the slope, says Soini.
QUESTION: Tuomo Soini
The dog was carried down with a hiking pad.
According to the sound, the performance was not physically heavy, but in the difficult terrain the carrying took place slowly.
After about an hour and a half, however, the Cita was happily brought down.
After the event, Mikkelsen was still looking for "international heroes" on Facebook to thank them once again.
The bells answered him on Sunday, but the German is apparently still unreachable.
I don't know what I would have done without these heroes, Mikkelsen rejoices.
If they hadn't helped me, we wouldn't have come back.
I'd like to find these people because I feel like I didn't thank them enough.
I'm sure they don't know how much this means to me.
These men deserve all thanks and honor, I am eternally grateful to them.
On the night before Monday, the Soines were already on their way home.
They had received joyful messages from Mikkelsen: - Cita can already be better!

Genetic abnormality is often misdiagnosed
For years, a British woman was afraid of dying because of a false diagnosis.
Karin Rodgers thought most of her youth that she had only a few years of life left because she had been diagnosed with another disease.
In fact, he suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), which means a number of hereditary diseases that damage the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord.
According to the Charity CMT UK charity, misdiagnosis is a common problem in CMT cases because so little is known about them.
An estimated 23,000 people in the UK suffer from CMT, which causes motor symptoms, such as muscle weakness, difficulty walking and pain in the toes.
The disease can also cause numbness or pain, and it is incurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms worsen over time.
When Rodgers was 13, he thought he had Friedreich's ataxia (FA) with a very poor survival rate.
Rodgers believed he would be in a wheelchair before he turned 18 and died before he reached the age of 30.
Today, a 51-year-old mother of two says, “As a child, I knew I couldn’t do the same things as everyone else.
I got lost every day, and it took me longer than anyone else.
I was never able to skate or skate with other kids, and I was bullied at school because I walked and ran differently than the others.
When Rodgers was 13 years old, he underwent several ankle surgery to straighten his legs, and when he left the doctor’s room, he quickly looked at his research papers saying he was suffering from FA.
“I felt guilty because I was so curious, so I didn’t tell anyone, but when I came home I checked the information about the disease in the library and wrote to the FA,” he says.
When I heard from them, I was shocked and panicked.
I thought I would get into a wheelchair by the age of 18 and die before I turned 25, and in the meantime I would slowly lose all my ability to function.
I went through this for myself and designed my own funeral.
Rodgers says that by the age of 17, he said that his walk had not deteriorated as much as he had thought and asked his doctor about this.
The doctor just hugged me and said, “Girl, honey, I don’t think you have this disease because otherwise you’d already be in a wheelchair.”
I think you're suffering from a much less dangerous illness.
Based on some genetic tests, he was diagnosed with CMT.
“When I was told what CMT was, I thought I was delayed,” he says.
Charity CMT UK organizes a CMT month to pay attention to the disease.
Hundreds of migrants found in coal truck in Macedonia
Macedonian authorities have found more than a hundred illegal immigrants on a train transporting coal, the country’s interior ministry said on Monday.
The carriers were mostly Syrian and Iraqi refugees.
The train was coming from Greece.
The migrants were found late Sunday in Veles, Central Macedonia.
It was hard to communicate with most of them.
They didn’t know where they were, where they came from and where they were going,” Interior Ministry spokesman Ivo Koteski said.
According to the police, the migrants had paid about 3,000 euros each to get to Greece, and another 800-900 euros more to get to Serbia.
Illegal immigrants travel through Macedonia with a large number of millions of people on their way to Western Europe.
Three million people have already fled the bloody civil war in Syria.

Areva-Siemens: Olkiluodo’s three reactor to be completed in mid-2016
Areva has delivered an updated schedule for Olkiluoto 3 to TVO.

Nastola donated 1.4 hectares of beach to Bottax - worth about 60000 euros
The municipality of Nastola donated a 1.4-hectare beach to Valtteri Bottax from the shore of Kärkjärvi from Villekhte.
The municipal government demonstrated fairness in sport and was unanimous in its decision.
No sound was heard at the meeting when the plot was decided, says Mayor Pauli Syyrakki.
Bottas' gift store has farm buildings - a total of seven.
The city will still dismantle them this year, except for one.
Bottas has promised to build a free-time apartment on the plot within two years.
We are delighted that he is delighted with his birth certificate and wants to be here in the future.
Valtteri has visited the undergraduates every year to tell them about his sporting career and life.
And hopefully it will continue to happen, the mayor said.
The mayor calculates the monetary value of the beach tonnage of 40000-60000 euros.
The beach is low and child friendly.
The area has been owned by the municipality for ten years.
Throughout the decades, Nastola has been successful in sports with the help of gift certificates in the municipality.
World champion Aki Parviainen and world champion of aerobics, Tuuli Matinsalo, received self-contained tones from the municipality and built large self-contained houses.
However, they did not stay in Nastol but sold their property and moved away.
Parviainen and Matinsalon came to Nastola after the work and then changed the situation of life to change elsewhere.
Bottas is a native Nastola and his situation is different, Syyrakki's inch and believes Bottas will remain in his hometown.
Hull laundered the assailant with the Hernandez club's record amount
Hull invested the club's record in the acquisition of Uruguayan national team player Abel Hernandez.
Hernandez replaces Hull with an Italian coach from Palermo for <0xC2><0xA3>9.5 million, or about 12 million euros.
The contract is for three years.
Hernandez scored 14 goals last season as Palermo won the Serie B and made it to the Italian Premier League.
In the Uruguay national team, he has scored seven goals in 14 games.
At the World Cup final last summer, Hernandez came in two games from a change of field.
Abel is a fantastic acquisition and shows how far we’ve come in a short time,” said Hull head coach Steve Bruce.
On Monday, Hull said he had also acquired Senegalese national team captain Mohamed Diamen West Ham.
Russia's Space Experiment Failed - Geeks Sent on Sex Journey Died
Five small geckos sent to space by Russia have died, the Russian Federation’s Roscosmos space agency said in a statement.
The Gekots traveled on the Foton-M4 satellite for over a month and a half.
The satellite returned to Earth on Monday morning Finnish time.
The purpose of the experiment was to investigate the reproductive capacity and use of geckos in a weightless state.
One male and four females participated in the experiment.
Although the experiment sounds different, its purpose was serious.
Little is known about the effects of weightlessness, for example, on the development of gecko eggs.
Through the effects on geckos, one can seek to predict what effects weightlessness would have on a person while in a state similar to that of a stay for longer periods of time, the New Statesman said in July.
According to Roscosms, the time of death of geckos and the cause or causes of death are investigated.
According to the Interfax news agency, passengers who were baptized as "sex gays" were frozen.
Surprisingly, the fruit chips that travelled on the same Foton-M4 were able to survive the journey without difficulty, and also had a posterior growth.
France Arrests Terrorist Suspect at Nice Airport
France arrested a man suspected of terrorism at the airport of Nice on Saturday.
A 22-year-old man is suspected of working as a recruiter for a jihadist group operating in Syria.
The French authorities reported on the matter on Sunday.
Authorities traced the man after he had lured a 16-year-old girl to Syria with money.
The girl was supposed to fly to Turkey and cross the Syrian border.
The airline did not believe the girl’s explanation that she was going to visit her grandmother in Istanbul, but warned the authorities.
The authorities contacted the girl’s father, who was completely unaware of her daughter’s intentions, and told the authorities that the family had no relatives in Turkey.
According to the authorities, the man is from Chechnya, but he currently lives in France.
The French intelligence authorities had already monitored the man's actions.
In France, authorities have been concerned that the radicalised youth lured into the wars in Iraq or Syria pose a security risk to France as well.
Authorities estimate that some 800 French nationals or people in France who have been in books during the last conflict have travelled to, returned from, or are currently planning to leave for Syria.
Team: We have a good chance of winning
The hopes of the basketball team for a future are in play as Finland will face Ukraine in the second match of the World Cup today.
If the opening loss to the United States was expected, Ukraine is again one of the countries from which Finland should take the necessary profits.
Ukraine is a good team, but I believe we have a good chance of winning, Petrie Koponen predicts.
Ukraine defeated the Dominican Republic 72-62 in their first match of the tournament on Saturday.
The team is coached by NBA veteran Mike Fratello, who plays aggressive basketball in Ukraine.
The key player of Ukraine is the head of the game Eugene "Pooh" Jeter, whose sister Carmelita Jeter is the 100-metre world champion three years ago.
Jeter scored 16 points against the Dominican Republic.
“Pooh Jeter is a quick guy, but yes we’ve been played against them before and we need to get our normal defense in order,” Koponen said.
Hanno Möttölä promised that Finland would play better than yesterday’s loss to the United States.
We need to find our own strengths again.
I can guarantee that we will see a normal wolf in the field, Möttölä said.
Hollywood stars' alleged nudity spreads online - part assured to be true
There are a number of nude images on the Internet that are said to represent celebrities.
Among other things, actress Jennifer Lawrence has become the victim of a “picture campaign.”
Entertainment site TMZ has published an angry comment made by Lawrence's representatives, which appears to confirm the authenticity of the images.
This is a blatant violation of privacy.
The authorities have been contacted, and anyone who publishes (on the Internet) Jennifer Lawrence's stolen images will be put on trial, the representatives threaten.
According to TMZ, the actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead has confirmed that the images circulating about her are genuine.
She had taken these pictures years ago with her husband.
When I know that those pictures were destroyed a long time ago, I can only imagine what a grueling trouble was seen for this.
“I feel sorry for everyone who has been victimized by hacking,” he wrote on the website.
Instead, the actress Victoria Justice says the pictures that go by her own name are faked.
There are also real or fake nude pictures of Kate Upton, Kirsten Dunst, Ariana Grande, Hope Solo, Krysten Ritter, Yvonne Strahovski and Teresa Palmer.
The Honka goalkeeper criticised his own: "They don't do enough work to get out of here"
Football club FC Honka is currently in last place in the Veikkausliiga.
Goalkeeper Walter Viitala’s comments after Sunday’s VPS show the club’s confusing current situation.
I haven't had a goalkeeper in four months.
But everything has to be adjusted," Viitala said after the match ended with a 1-2 loss.
Honka made a lot of defensive head mistakes in the match, especially in the first half.
Goalkeeper Viitala did not like a bad defense game.
The player traffic in Hong Kong has been lively this summer, and that is why the defenders in front of Viitala have also changed at a tight pace.
With the gameplay tool, too, many young players have been given opportunities that they might not even deserve.
"Some people don't do enough work to get them out of here at some point," Viitala said without naming any individual players.
Hong Kong head coach Shefki Kuqi was somewhat in agreement with Viitala.
"I told certain players after the game that if you come to workouts and games to have fun and you think you're an amateur league player and you don't have to work, then you're probably in the wrong team," Kuqi said.
I've given a lot of young people time.
If they don't want to take that place and take advantage of the opportunity, it's not my fault.
However, Kuqi also reminded that players can’t expect immediate success as the teammates change constantly.
In this period, there have not been twice in a row the same composition.
Particularly in the field of defense, a lot has changed.
That’s the biggest reason why we’re in this place,” Kuqi said.
Honka is a series jumper after the VPS loss, with TPS second in the standings.
There are still seven rounds left in the cutting league, so there is still time for the forwards to avoid falling to the 1st.
I've never been on a team, and I'm not going to be on a team right now.
We're not really going to drop out of this series," goalkeeper Viitala threatened.
Lars von Trier is making a television series after decades of pause

Lars von Trier, 58, has been known in recent years for his horrifying media appearances and films such as Antichrist and Nymphomaniac.
He directed the television series Kingdom in the 1990s.

Britt Isabelle Roberts screamed so hard when ice cold water was poured on her that she damaged the skeleton of her face.
This Ice Bucket challenge ended painfully badly.
The woman has been taken to treatment after she screamed during the Ice Bucket challenge so tightly that her jaw went in place.
Isabelle Roberts screamed so hard when ice cold water was poured on her that she damaged the structure of her face.
“The water was so cold that I was just yelling, but when I was yelling, I felt like my lungs were starting to stiffen,” she told The Mirror.
Ice water is poured on a 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts just before the accident
I tried to shut my mouth, but I couldn't, my jaw was locked, and then I realized something was wrong.
Then my mother and sisters noticed the same thing, and they started to laugh, but I had to cheer for first aid.
A 20-year-old British man who took part in the super-popular challenge on Tuesday was taken to a hospital, where the lungs were put back in place.
The video has become an Internet sensation and has been shared thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
A view of the wolf’s lair (also): How can the increase in fan numbers be explained?
Today was a great day.
This was said by basketball player Sakari Pehkonen in 1995, when Finland had played in the final of the European Championship against France at the Athens Maroussi Ball Hall.
No exaggerated washing.
I remember the game when it was there.
There were also about a hundred Finns who shouted out to draw 20,000 spectators, otherwise in an empty hall of noise.
What would Pehkonen have said 19 years later after the Finnish-Ukraine World Cup?
In Bilbao, there are a hundred Finnish fans eighty times as many.
The 1995 European Championships were the highlights of Finnish basketball.
The men paved their way to the final tournament by winning, among other things, the Russian championship at the Helsinki Sports Hall of Fame.
That win would open the door to European cream.
Everything looked good.
There were promising young people, like Hanno Möttölä.
Head coach Henrik Dettmann took Möttölä to the final tournament team with limestone lines.
A solution that many disagreed with.
Now it can be said that Dettmann was far from wise, although not everything went according to the script.
After Athens, the basketball team dived deep.
In Athens, there were a total of a little over a hundred Finns.
It included journalists, relatives of the players, Finnish basketball coaches and a few fans.
Bilbao also has journalists, relatives and coaches, but there are also fans.
And there's a lot of them.
The phenomenon has grown to incomprehensible proportions.
I'm sure no one can tell the exact number of Finnish riders.
Estimates range from 7,500 to 10,000.
Whatever the number is in between is an incomprehensible number.
Here's an explanation for sports psychologists.
In a global economy, companies are moving across borders.
In sports, there is still a chance to see how we are doing internationally.
As mobility increases, we can see how our girls and boys succeed in the world,” says Hannu Itkonen, professor of exercise sociology.
Certainly both in Spain and in the World Airball Championships in Poland there are Finns who are looking for an experience.
A common experience.
Still, it doesn't explain everything.
In sports, too, there must be attraction.
Cultivating sports as part of popular culture.
There is a lower threshold to go to sports than to Berlin to watch art.
Without success, the masses cannot move.
Let's go back to 1995.
At the time, head coach Dettmann challenged the basketball association and the players to take on top sports professionally.
It took almost ten years.
Then the direction changed and the national team activity was lifted to the podium.
The Air Force made the same move a little earlier.
They both enjoy the fruits of the work.
As Itkonen says, both species have succeeded in producing their top sport, where the sacred trinity operates: sports-media-sponsors.
The public is also interested.
And the media has taught what such carnivalist support is, Itkonen recalls.
Can the types of ball transfer this massive interest to the home series as well?
Basketball and volleyball are played on average by hundreds or just over a thousand spectators.
Crying regards the question as a good one, and does not necessarily give an answer that would promise very good species.
The other school believes that interest is shifting.
The second is the one who does not want a sweet stomach full.
This bunch is ready for an experiential trip to the World Cup, but in their basic thinking, the series of the homeland is not of double interest.
It's a challenge for people in the middle of drugs.
Security for Bottax plot - almost 1.5 hectares from the lake beach
Nastola rewards formula driver Valtteri Bottax at the beachfront apartment.
At its meeting on Monday, the municipal government unanimously approved a 1.4-hectare plot of land.
In the future, there will be a holiday home.
The success of Botta has been monitored in Nastola since this time of karting.
He is considered a good ambassador to market Lahti, Lahti region and Nastola.
Lahjatonti is located in Koiskala, on the shore of Kärkjärvi.
It has become the property of the municipality of Nastola as part of a larger real estate trade.
The area has seven buildings in dismantling state, from which the municipality will dismantle at the cost of six by the end of this year.
Bottas won the Formula 1 competition in Belgium for his fourth prize this year.
He is fifth in the World Cup.
Bottas is a native of Nastola and lived in Villähte during his childhood.
He currently lives in England but visits Nastola whenever he is free of formulas.
Bottas has visited high schools and youth facilities.
Design smart clothes are coming - but hardly for the poor
It presents and tests them at the current U.S. Open tennis competition in New York.
The testers of Ralph Lauren’s smart shirts are the footballers on the field, but also amateur Marcus Giron, one of the top college players, likes it.
According to him, the shirt helps him to follow his own development and regulate his recovery.
The nylon shirt is woven with silver sensors, from which the information is transmitted to the jersey in the shirt and from there on to the smartphone or tablet computer.
Sensors measure heart rate, breathing rhythms, stress and steps.
The central unit is removed before the shirt is thrown into the washing machine.
The fashion house has not told the exact time for the sale of the shirt and has not even indicated its price, the Tech Times reported.
Raph Lauren is not the only company that invests in smart clothes.
Athos, a Californian, has brought on sale smart shirts and smart shorts.
They measure heart rate, breathing, and muscle work.
The clothes cost a hundred dollars a piece, and the thumb-sized central unit they demand costs two hundred dollars.
He also wrote about Red Orbit.
A wise way to save money in textbooks
The cost of university textbooks in America is more than $1,000 per student, so soon Matt Schroeder, starting his second year of study, came up with a clever way to save on costs.
He developed a system in which students of later years of courses borrow their books for nominal compensation instead of selling the books onwards at the same time.
“My math book would normally cost $180; I paid $10 for it for the entire semester and a thousand sandwiches,” says 19-year-old Schroeder, who studies at Covenant College in Georgia.
Schroeder says his last semester books would normally have cost $430.
Instead, he spent $120 on it.
According to the University’s Board of Directors, average students spend more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and school supplies, but students have many means at their disposal to reduce these costs.
Students increasingly end up using e-commerce and creative approaches like Schroeder’s idea.
An increasing number of students rent textbooks so that they can use the book throughout the semester and pay significantly less for it than students buying the book.
According to Neebo Inc, which has more than 250 campus bookstores, book rentals have doubled since 2011.
Statistics on the sector reveal that about a quarter of the books in university bookstores last spring were rental books, says Trevor Meyer, president of Neebo.
According to the National Association of College Stores, less than half of all books are purchased from campus bookstores.
Here are the simplest ways to save money.
Webshops
In online stores, you can get a new book for only a third of the price it would cost at a campus bookstore.
The ninth edition of Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards, and Robert Hostetler’s “Calculus” is almost $290, but the Chegg.com book is available for $239.99.
Buying used
Used books are a good option if the reader is not disturbed by the notes of others and worn out appearance.
For example, the “Calculus” book can be used from the Chegg.com online store for $93.49.
Brigham Young University final year student Matt Casaday, 25, says he bought the book “Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business” used on Amazon.com for just $0.42.
The new book would have cost $48.
Ingrid Bracey, director of Amherst’s College Without Walls at the University of Massachusetts, and other academics recommend that students ask their professors if previous editions can be used in the course.
Sometimes the reforms of the new edition are not essential for teaching.
In this case, the old edition can only be found at a fraction of the price that should be paid for the new one.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon bookstores, eBay Inc’s Half.com is a popular place to buy used books.
Renting
Renting textbooks is worth considering, if you take good care of them, remember to return them and do not need them after completing the course.
By renting, you can save more than 80% of the price of a new book.
For example, renting a "Calculus" book for the entire semester costs about $20.
Check the rules of the rental company, such as notes, use of the highlighter, and wear and tear for subsequent payments.
Tenant, be careful: if you forget to return the book, the delay fee may be higher than the purchase price of the book.
E-books
Obtaining e-books instead of ordinary paperwork can also come to the question.
Sometimes these books are rented and paid for the e-book’s access to its owner, such as Amazon.com, Chegg, or Barnes & Noble Inc.
The Chegg store gets Calculus as an e-book for six months for about $61.
According to Bracey, many literature students save the most because many classics can be downloaded for free today, while books in the science and technology field can be very expensive.
Comparing different vendors is worth it, whichever option you choose.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon start Pepperdinen's legal studies, recommends using the book ISBN number to find out the price, because it can help ensure that you are looking for the right book.
Before you order online, make sure that the book is definitely in stock, Gault says.
He himself learned this through the stick.
The publication of the book he bought was frozen for four weeks, and he eventually had to purchase the book at full cost from the university’s bookstore.

Nearly double the number of people killed in fires compared to last year
Fires have killed almost twice the number of people this year compared to last year.
According to the media monitoring agency of the Finnish Rescue Sector Central Organisation (Spek) so far, 55 people have already died in the fires in 49 different fires.
At the same time last year, there were 31 fire deaths.
The majority of those killed, 36, were men.
The 65-year-old has been 11 years old.
According to the organization's death toll, the worst situation was in 2009, when 64 people were killed in the fires by the end of August.
The majority of fire deaths occur in homes.
There have been 17 fire deaths in the ground floor houses, 21 in detached houses and seven in row and other small houses.
Spek reminds me of home fire safety.
At least the performance of all home fire alarms should be ensured according to Spek.
In addition, everyone should check that the initial extinguishing devices are easily deployable.
All premises must also have an unimpeded exit route.
Children should also be told which electrical appliances they can use when they are at home alone.
NATO summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
Protesters at the NATO summit protested in Newport last weekend.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the city center of Newport for a march against NATO.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered at the Cardiff City Hall for the so-called counter-top.
Stephen Fairclough followed the events over the weekend and spoke with protesters who had arrived from as far as Belgium.
Young people rescued by plane from the Australian Blue Mountains
SOME teenage hikers were raised to safety after being trapped overnight in the Blue Mountains in Australia’s New South Wales region.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man went for a walk after noon on Sunday for Govetts Leap in Blackhead.
The locals were worried about the young people who had not returned home and called the police at nine o’clock in the evening.
A search team consisting of local police and aides was sent to search for young people, and the pair were found around 11 p.m. near Bridal Veil Falls.
The girl had hurt her knee, and the man had fallen and hit his head.
The police spent the night with the couple, and they were taken to safety on Monday morning.
The hostages were taken by ambulance to Blue Mountains Hospital, and their condition was stable.
Ukrainian soldiers withdraw from Luhansk airport
Ukrainian troops have withdrawn from Luhansk airport.
According to the Ukrainian army, the soldiers were given a withdrawal order.
According to Ukraine, paratroopers have tightly tied up with Russian tanks on the ground.
According to the army representative, the fire on the opponent has been so severe that the shooter is likely to be Russian professional soldiers.
In the past few days, seven Ukrainian soldiers have been killed.
In the Asovan Sea, in front of southeastern Ukraine, a Ukrainian party ship that received artillery parts collapsed yesterday morning, the border guard said.
Eight Marines have been rescued and two are still missing.
The border guard was unsure of where the vessel was fired.
The separatists reported on social media that they shot the plane yesterday.
According to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Russia will not attack Ukraine.
However, Lavrov demanded that Ukrainian troops should immediately withdraw to positions from which they cannot shoot civilians.
According to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the negotiations in Minsk today between Russia, Ukraine and the OSCE should create an immediate ceasefire without conditions.
Lavrov also reminded that Russia will respond to possible new economic sanctions.
First, we will protect our own interests, our economy, the social sector, our businesses.
At the same time, we will also draw conclusions from the actions of our partners, Lavrov threatened.
Heavy rains flooded Malmö and Copenhagen.
Streets flooded in Malmö and Copenhagen on Sunday, as heavy rains hit southern Sweden and Denmark.
The floodwaters interrupted several roads, mixed traffic and buried cars alone.
Authorities on Sunday estimated that the flooding could take a while, even though the rains were forecast to stop by Monday.
The heavy rains came as a surprise to the Swedish authorities, and no warning of the rains was given in advance.
Meteorologist Ari Mustala, the Finnish Meteorological Institute of Finland, estimated that the saddling of the area was very local.
The rain zone looks narrow and in place permanent.
No wonder it was hard to predict.
French Socialists Should "Be Quiet and Help France", says Francois Hollande's main proponent
Valls called on the deeply divided left to "show its feelings" for a socialist president in difficulty, whose composition of the new government was not approved by the French majority.
The President deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, our support.
"Our mission is to stay with him," Valls said, earning his applause.
In a reassuring gesture, the prime minister urged the government to leave the government alone despite a controversial 35-hour week of work by France’s new finance minister Emmanuel Macron earlier this week, on the proposal that the rule should be relaxed.
On Saturday, Hollande asked the Socialists to work together with the government.
Justice Minister Christiane Taubira, however, sparked a divergence by appearing at a meeting of dissenting Socialist MPs and criticising the Socialist Party for allowing "France to give up hope for the future".
Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far-right nationalist front, mocked the Socialists’ continued dissent and said that I don’t believe Valls’ new government will last a few months longer.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande may have gone to war, but so has Manuel Valls, whose duty was to form a new government after the previous did not last even a summer.
"And the new government will not last until autumn or winter," Le Pen told reporters.
He reiterated his party’s proposal to dissolve the parliament and was confident that his party would win the election in the early elections and he himself would be ready to lead the party.
The French ruling party suffered a crushing defeat in the March municipal elections and the far-right held the top of the list in the May EU elections.
According to a poll by the Journal du Dimanche on Sunday, 76% of French people believe that the Socialist Party could split into several competing groups before the end of the Dutch season in 2017.
Po-University political scientist Pascal Perrineau warned that the French would soon lose their patience unless the new socialist government manages to improve the economy and record high unemployment.
“There is a small chance of success, but the public must quickly notice that change is happening,” he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get worse.
The Pokka Pokka of Finnish narrators Kirsi Alm-Siira, Nina Rahkola and meteorologist Pekka Pouda were very disappointed in the recorded part of the program.
Oomenta Finland published a fun video on its Facebook page last Thursday about the recordings made on Thursday.
With the video, narrators Kirsi Alm-Siira and Nina Rahkola as well as meteorologist Pekka Pouta try to record Huomenta Finland’s advertising puff from the next day’s broadcast, but the tape doesn’t go exactly into the tube.
Alm-Siira mixes up in her words as she tries to pronounce the word budget terms, and her mixing also causes Pouda and Rahkola to lose their punches over and over again.
And these heroes should be allowed to drag the live stream even tomorrow, Huomenta Finland’s Facebook update states.
The video has become very popular on Facebook and has been liked and shared on Facebook more than 10,000 times.
Jorma K. Pouta, 68, who worked at the photo agency of the magazine, finished third in the series of portraits in 1972.
The picture is taken by Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir.
On Fredrikinkatu in Helsinki, the Socialist International meeting was held at the House of Building Masters in May 1971.
There were a lot of heads of state at the meeting and the security measures were huge.
When Golda Meir went to the bathroom, seven bodyguards went with her.
At the beginning of the meeting, however, we had plenty of five minutes to film.
I took this picture four and a half feet away.
The light and the background were on.
I immediately realized that this time I succeeded.
From Meir’s perspective, we can see that the leaders of the Middle East have had difficulties in the past.
At that time, you were able to compete with famous people or images taken from events.
It’s great that you can succeed with other images these days, as long as you have an idea and a visual twist.
This is the second best picture I've ever taken.
The best is Lasse Virén's crash image of the Munich Olympics.
I didn't send it to the competition.
Statement: Aarnio investigation has already paid more than five million euros
Investigating the legality of the activities of the Helsinki police unit has already cost more than five million euros and required 30-50 years of work.
This was assessed by Jyri Rajamäki in his dissertation on information technology at the University of Jyväskylä.
Rajamäki proposes that the legality of police activities and the fight against crime in general could be significantly improved by combining investigation and judicial information systems.
According to Rajamäki, modern technology allows for multi-use of forensic material.
He points out that it is possible to build a system where the information collected for the purpose of detecting a crime is automatically electronic evidence that fills the chain of evidence, while at the same time allowing for comprehensive legality control.
The statement will be reviewed on Saturday.
The 1999 concept of vegetable food was forgotten on the school wall: "Fish and chicken are part of the vegetable diet"
A photo of a special bulletin on the wall of the Birkkala School of Women’s Journey caused food shortages on social media, Yle said on her website.
Vegetables!
Fish and chicken dishes are included in the vegetarian diet at school lunch.
Only when there is meat on the list, we make a vegetable alternative!
This is stated in a forgotten, 15-year-old newspaper on the school wall.
You can see the picture here.
The image circulated on social media has caused people to send angry feedback to the municipality of Pirkkala.
The head of the food and cleaning service Arja Vaarma tells Yle that the forgotten card on the wall is not correct and it should have been removed some time ago.
Apparently, before I came here, there has ever been such an idea that has been discussed with health care in its time.
Every student gets a meal according to his wishes, he says to Yle.
Today in Pirkkala schools, students are offered a vegetable food option only with the permission of their parents and with a certificate from a doctor or health care professional of the plant diet.
The danger justifies the solution to Yle because experiments in young vegetarian foods may leave the diet deficient, and the lack of meat or chicken may cause the parents of the students to wonder.
Norwegian Cruise closes to a $3 billion Prestige Cruise deal
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the world's third-largest cruise company, is in talks to buy its competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc for $3 billion.
With the deal, Norwegian Cruise, with a market value of $6.8 billion, will gain access to luxury cruisers and wealthy customers of Prestige Cruises as it continues to compete with Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
According to sources, information about a possible agreement may be published as early as this week, but it is also possible that the negotiations will not produce a result.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, a private equity company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20 percent of Norwegian Cruise.
The sources did not want their names to be made public because the negotiations were not held in public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comment and the representative of Apollo declined to comment.
Norwegian Cruise, based in Miami, has 13 cruise ships with a route map covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, the Mediterranean and the Caribbean.
Its turnover increased by 13 per cent from 2012 to 2013, with a turnover of $2.57 billion.
Prestige Cruises, which also operates from Miami, sails under the Oceania and Regent brand names, which include a total of eight cruise ships, and the itinerary covers Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
Its turnover in 2013 was $1.2 billion, which is six percent more than the previous year.
The $29 billion cruise industry is expected to benefit from the growth of emerging economies in the coming years, such as China and India.
Companies are competing to become the first choice for these new customers when they choose to cruise.
In January 2014, Prestige Cruises registered its first exchange of shares on the U.S. stock market.
Apollo owns most of the company's shares after trading in 2007, valued at $850 million.
Norwegian Cruise was founded in 2000 by its current composition with its merger with Genting Bhd (GENT.KL) cruise company, the latter being the entertainment and casino company of the Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thai.
Apollo invested a billion dollars in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise was listed as a public company in January 2013.
According to the published data, Genting was 28 per cent, Apollo 20 per cent and TPG Capital LP 8 per cent from the end of June.
The combined share of Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise companies in North America is 82 per cent, according to a registration document published by Prestige Cruise in connection with the transfer of shares.
The Tampere City Council is dealing with this today.
Animalia hopes the city government will strongly support the initiative.
According to Salla Tuomivaara, the Managing Director of Animalia, who is preparing a dissertation for the University of Tampere during the dolphinarium in Finland and around the world, it is time to end soon.
Luckily, in recent years, there has been a widespread perception around the world that the dolphin-like breeding of advanced mammals in dolphins is neither animal-protective nor ethically sustainable.
This view should also be taken into consideration in Tampere.
The abolition of the dolphinarium is not only a question of animal rights, but also a question of the image of Tampere as a tourist destination, Tuomivaara points out.
According to Tuomwara, the death of the Näsi dolphin reinforces the requirements of the dolphinarium downstream.
This death is a sad continuation of the dark history of the Särkänniemi dolphinarium.
It’s time to put a dead end, close the dolphin prison, and find out how dolphins could be transferred to Tampere to a restricted marine area, a kind of dolphin shelter, Tuomivaara demands.
It was not enough to experience a return to the original habitat of the dolphins, but hopefully the rest of the dolphins living in Särkänniemi were able to experience even more life than the inert concrete pool, Tuomivaara hopes.
The aim of Animalia is to prohibit the use of all wild animals in circuses in the overall reform of the Animal Conservation Act in preparations.
This includes dolphins as well.
In support of the request, Animalia CEO Tuomivaara will participate in the 1st of September on behalf of the dolphins.
The message from the Japanese Embassy in Helsinki will take a stand against the dolphin hunting season in Japan.
During the hunting season, about 2,300 dolphins are captured or brutally killed each year, either for the use of dolphins or for food.
Putin calls on Kyiv to open talks with eastern Ukraine on a new state
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday demanded that the Ukrainian government end the fighting against separatists in the eastern part of the country and immediately start negotiations on the "state of the territory that is separate," Russian news sources say.
His representative Dmitry Peskov later made it clear that Putin did not mean that the separatist-ruled territory of eastern Ukraine would become part of Russia, but that its position within Ukraine should be reconsidered in order to give the people of the Russian-speaking region power and defend their rights.
Putin’s demand for negotiations with the Russian-minded rebels as equal negotiating partners with the Kiev government corresponds to his obvious strategy, which he has followed since the violence began to militiate against Ukraine: he seeks to help the separatists to conquer this territory.
In an interview with State Channel 1 television, Putin condemned the Ukrainian army’s attempts to recapture the separatist-dominated eastern Donetsk and Luhansk territory, which the separatists seized in March and April of Moscow’s annexation of the Ukrainian Crimean peninsula on 18 March.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently baptized the region as “Novorossiysk”, “New Russia” – this term reminiscent of the days before the Russian revolutions.
According to the Russian news agency Itar-Tass, Putin said the planned peace talks were an “illusion” as long as Ukrainian politicians campaigned for the October 26 parliamentary elections and government forces attacked civilians in separatist-held areas.
"We need to start immediately wide-ranging negotiations, not only on the technical aspects, but also on the organization of society and the status of the state of South-Eastern Ukraine, taking into account the interests of the people living there," he said.
According to Peskov, Putin’s reference to “state property” is related to broader independence, which has been discussed for months with the Kiev leadership in trying to alleviate fears of Russian-speaking regions that their cultural and linguistic rights would be threatened.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the eastern regions the independence they need, Peskov says.
This issue cannot be discussed between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov says, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal conflict in Ukraine".
The Kremlin representative’s interlocutor’s remark aimed at correcting Putin’s “misinterpretation” of his comments emphasized that the Russian government is treating the rebellion of separatists in the eastern regions differently than in Crimea, in which case it practically dominated the territory, which is not the population of the Russians of 2 million.
It would be much more difficult for Moscow to join even the Donetsk or Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine, because the majority of the 6.5 million people living in the region are not ethnically Russian and because according to pre-conflict polls, the majority of the population was in favour of staying in Ukraine.
The independence, which Russian diplomats have discussed in international forums, would give the local authorities of Ukraine the right to agree on their own trade agreements and external relations, which would give the Kremlin virtually power in the territory that unites Russia with Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, which was connected to Russia five months ago, is home to the main Russian fleet, as well as commercial maritime port areas and historic coastal areas.
The Russian region between Rostov and Crimea also has mines, factories and metallurgical mills that produce vital products for the Russian army.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed in his resignation address on 7 June that Ukrainian legislators – after the new elections – consider constitutional changes in order to increase the decision-making power of regions outside the nuclear zone of Ukraine over their own economy and the status of languages.
However, his vision of independence seems to differ sharply from the view of the separatists, perhaps armed by the Kremlin and Moscow.
Putin has made his latest call on the Kiev government to negotiate with Russian-inspired rebels as equal partners after the rebels made more progress last week after Russian tanks and troops invaded eastern Ukraine from the peaceful Azo region.
The Ukrainian security authorities fear that the takeover of the Russian-backed city of Novoazovsky will be the beginning of a larger effort to conquer the entire strategically important coastal area up to the Crimea.
It has led to massive civilian and military personnel building the city of Mariupol, known as the steel-producing port city of half a million inhabitants, located between Novoazovsk and the narrow land area leading to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke to European Union leaders on Saturday in Brussels calling for further action to prevent Russia’s future insults in Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which has been independent for 23 years.
"We will soon reach a point from which there is no return," Poroshenko warned.
There are now thousands of foreign troops and tanks in the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take any decisions on direct action; the leaders suggested that additional sanctions should be introduced if the Ukraine crisis is re-emerged under unclear circumstances.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw their positions in the Ilovaisky region after the transfer of two Russian armored personnel and 1,000 soldiers to the Donetsk region last week in order to strengthen the separatists in difficulty, General Andriy Lysenko, a representative of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, told Kihova.
According to Lysenko, the first of 63 Ukrainian soldiers to be captured in Ilovaisk in Russia was replaced by 10 Russian paratroopers who were captured in the territory of Ukraine a week ago.
The opening paint of Milan was done by the Japanese rider Keisuke Honda already on the seventh game.
In the second half, Sulley Muntari was hit first and a little later by Jeremy Menez's penalty kick.
Lazio also scored the toughest goal in the final, but goalkeeper Diego Lopez resisted Antonio Candreva's shot.
Lopez moved to Milan for this season from Real Madrid.
The San Siro Stadium in the coaching debut of the former Milanese attacking icon Inzaghi was only halfway through.
A total of 39,000 spectators were announced for the match.
Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko in a nude scandal
Geoffrey Edelsten has announced he has been stabbed by hackers who may have stolen nude footage from his fiancée and Hollywood A-list star Gabi Grecko.
In the entertainment world, a series of nude pictures of Jennifer Lawrence were published on the Internet as a result of a widespread celebrity-picture scandal.
The hacker is said to have a total of 60 nude photos of Hunger Games star Lawrence and other superstars, such as top model Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singer Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Also, images of Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Melbourne resident Grecko have apparently been stolen in connection with the iCloud leak.
There are 101 celebrity names on the list.
Edelsten, who married Grecko last month, told the Confidential newspaper, “This is outrageous.”
All personal contacts and images should be kept private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and disseminated.
Grecko, who is in New York, said the case was "shameful" and said the victims "feel ashamed".
The hacker is believed to have 30 pictures of Palmer with his previous boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two samples of Palmer at the top of the pool.
Palmer's film credits include the film "Love and Honor" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck star Strahovski and Sucker Punch actor Browning did not comment on the hacked images yesterday.
A spokesperson for Lawrence told TMZ that “it’s a gross violation of privacy.”
In a tweet, actor Seth Rogen tweeted: "The release of stolen images from a mobile device is no different from the sale of a stolen product."
The publication of stolen images should not be made possible, already from a purely legal point of view.

According to STT, almost 2,000 Finnish buyers followed Finland’s winnings in the Spodek arena.
I felt like I was playing at home.
The fans had such an impact on our game, Finnish captain Antti Siltala told STT.
Finland were already in the match with a loss of 0-2, but came to a victory of 3-2.
In the fourth lap, Finland did a miracle behind six points.
Cuba led the draw already 16-10, but after that the Finns got the upper hand.
The Finnish fan, however, was disappointed when the charter plane was unable to land in Katowice due to the heavy fog.
So the fans who ended up in Warsaw were late for the match.
Finnish football fans have conquered Europe at a very fast pace in the last few days.
In Bilbao, Spain, there are more than 8,000 Finnish fans at the World Basketball Championships.
As if every Finnish basket had been the winner of the match, US star player Stephen Curry praised Finnish basket fans after Saturday’s game.
