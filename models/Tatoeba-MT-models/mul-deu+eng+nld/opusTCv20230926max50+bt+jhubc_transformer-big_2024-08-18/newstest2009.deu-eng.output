The Prague Stock Exchange is falling into the minus against business closure.
After the steep drop in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange was able to correct the losses.
Transactions with the shares of <0xC4><0x8C>EZ reached almost half of the normal day-to-day business.
At the beginning of Tuesday’s trades, the Prague Stock Exchange closed on Monday’s break-in as it fell another six percentage points.
This time the reason for the break-in was on Wall Street.
In the Czech Republic, too, the market’s reaction to the result of the US House of Representatives’ vote, which had refused to support a stabilisation plan for the financial sector there.
Fall of stocks in Asia
On Tuesday, stocks on stock exchanges in Asia experienced a dramatic fall, although the indices were able to offset some of the losses over the course of the day.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Stock Index lost almost four percentage points over the course of the business day, but was able to bet on some of the losses later, reducing the decline to around 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which observes the movement of Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, fell by 3.8 percent, while markets were closed in Shanghai.
Shares on the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but then reduced the losses to 4.3 percent.
The stock market in Taiwan fell by 3.6 percent after the index there.
“The timing of the rescue operation in the US is uncertain and will affect financial markets worldwide,” said Joseph Yam, the head of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.
Hong Kong, although it belongs to China, determines its monetary policy itself, i.e. independent of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are moving at the same level as those in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, U.S. lawmakers should return to the negotiating table as soon as possible and approve the draft support for the financial system.
Otherwise, the threat is that other countries will also be affected by the invasion.
A Bloodbath of American Stocks
The U.S. House of Representatives on Monday rejected the plan to support the financial system, for which up to $700 billion (almost 12 trillion K<0xC4><0x8D>) should be spent.
The lawmakers thus ignored President George W. Bush’s call to support the plan.
In Bush’s view, the plan would address the underlying causes of the financial crisis and thus help stabilize the entire economy.
U.S. stocks suffered a bloodbath on Monday, and major stock indices recorded the biggest break-in in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell by almost seven percent, a similar break-in it had last recorded in 1987.
The index had already dropped before the vote, but there were hardly any signs that the draft would not pass in the House of Representatives, the index experienced a free fall.
Congress Admits U.S. Government Can Pump $700 Billion Into Banks
The top representatives of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of agreement on financial aid to the American financial system.
This is to be voted on at the beginning of next week.
U.S. lawmakers reached a breakthrough in talks over the adoption of a bailout plan in the form of financial aid for the U.S. financial system in the amount of $700 billion (about 12 trillion kroner).
However, this does not mean a victory yet.
Members of Congress need to discuss some details of the agreement before they can publish the final version of the law and vote on it.
The plan to support the financial system will be negotiated in the U.S. Congress on Monday.
On Sunday, Barney Frank, chairman of the Banking and Financial Services Committee, told Reuters.
In the Senate, according to various reports, the plan could be voted on by Wednesday at the earliest.
According to economists, a communication that the plan will be adopted should be the first significant psychological factor for a revival of the financial markets.
After that, however, there will be a "nutrition" due to the complicated mechanisms, how to help the markets in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
“We have made a significant progress.
We have clarified our differing views on what a package to stabilize the market should look like,” Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
He said there could be a final vote on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislature met with U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Sunday night to give the government fund its final form.
It envisages the purchase of unsold mortgage assets by financial companies, which cause severe losses to financial firms and endanger the stability of the entire system.
“We are on the verge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and that must also be effective in the market.
We have to continue the recovery plan, but I think we’re on target,” Paulson said.
A signal for Asian businesses
The global financial crisis is also strikingly low in the stock markets, which are declining sharply.
According to the words of Democratic Senator Harry Reid, the legislators are trying to reach a final agreement in Congress before Sunday.
This is to reassure investors before trading in the Asian financial markets, which are in the first time zone where a congressional decision could influence Monday’s trade.
However, it is not yet clear when the two chambers of the American Congress will vote on the law, and there is also uncertainty as to whether negotiations at the last minute could still fail on a problem.
The legislature hopes that it will be adopted in the next few days.
However, the law will undergo some changes.
The total amount determined to assist the system is to be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion is to be made available as soon as possible, as President George Bush called for.
However, Congress can block the disbursement of the remaining money if it has the impression that the program is not fulfilling its function, for another $100 billion and later the final $350 billion.
Bush Appreciates Progress in Negotiations
While the president has a veto on this decision, Congress can vote against his veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program has remained based on obtaining finances for the purchase of bad mortgage securities, the value of which has fallen, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer able to repay their mortgages.
“We have worked out everything.
“The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday, the Senate on Monday,” Republican Senator Judd Gregg said.
The American President Bush was also pleased with the progress made.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, said Bush was satisfied with Saturday's progress and "appreciate the bilateral effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy."
Restriction of golden parachutes
The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Christopher Dodd, the lead negotiator, said the legislators had agreed on a responsibility for the money program, protecting taxpayers from losses, concluding benefits, and a timetable for financing the plan.
The new law is also intended to limit the so-called golden parachutes for directors of the companies involved in the programme and to set up a committee to supervise the fund.
This is to be led by the Ministry of Finance.
“We have worked very hard on this and have made great progress towards an agreement that works and is important for the market and for all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also expects help for homeowners who have problems with repaying their mortgage.
The government should negotiate new rates on mortgages it buys up, with the goal being to lower the monthly costs for debtors and allow them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological help
According to Patria Finance chief economist David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but implementation will be very difficult.
“And that’s because you don’t know by what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets are bought up.
This will be crucial for how the financial sector and the government divide the losses among each other,” Marek told the iHNed.cz server this week.
Whether the plan will be adopted now or early next week, in Marek’s view, is not decisive.
“More importantly, congressmen agree to support the plan and say goodbye to it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of the agreement on whether an adoption will take place is the most important thing at this time,” Marek said.
Duel on Knife: MP3 player against mobile phones.
We will advise you on your choice
While almost every cell phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can still call.
Therefore, of course, it looks like it is better to buy only one phone.
However, there are plenty of reasons why you should add a standalone player.
The choice depends entirely on the type of use and the claims of the future owners.
Surely you can hardly buy a great expensive record player for at home to listen to the latest album by Maxim Turbulenc.
Once such musical novelties do not appear on LPs, and from a qualitative point of view there is no objective reason for this.
However, if you have LPs with Art Rock, Jazz or Blues on the shelf, you’re probably dreaming at least of one.
This is also the case with music on the go, that is, with compressed music, simplified - music in MP3 format.
Here, too, there are price and quality categories.
For one, it may not be acceptable to spend eight thousand crowns for a player, but a pink floyd fan will probably have a hard time getting headphones for twenty crowns off the market.
Two extremes, between which there is enough space for everyone.
The selection is wide-ranging.
The lifespan of the batteries is also crucial.
Some good music players can play a lot more than just music, but what phones can, they don’t even make sense.
No modern device can be used as universally as the phone.
In addition to the primary functions, calling and sims, it can play music and videos, both record, it has a better, sometimes a worse camera, and maybe it can also navigate.
And if you still include the smartphones and communicators, you almost have a small computer in your pocket.
It’s a small miracle, because no refrigerator can grill and no TV can photograph.
However, the universality of mobile phones also brings disadvantages.
However, the more features you use on your phone, the more often you will need to recharge it.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy eaters.
Only a few phones can play music for more than ten to twelve hours, usually much less.
In this regard, music players (especially the simplest ones) are significantly more powerful.
That’s why you should expect the low-cost phones to not be able to play music for more than a few hours.
If you then call from time to time, you’d rather buy a charger for the office for safety – this also applies to more expensive devices.
With MP3 players you will not have this problem, even the less good ones will last at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation with one charge.
Another problem is if you want to play the music on your phone.
Unfortunately, only a small part of the devices has a USB connection, and not every cell phone can be connected directly to a PC without special software.
Of course, you can transfer the music directly to a memory medium, but only a few card readers will be finished without any reduction with the tiny memory cards used in mobile phones.
For players, you don’t need any special software, except for the exceptions (iPod).
You only need to feed the device via USB port with music from your PC.
Most mobile phones and players set up a music library themselves, sorted by the performer's name, the album's title, genre, or, for example, user rating.
Some devices only depict the tree structure of the address directory, similar to the Windows Explorer, some can both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Players are easier to use, mobile phones can do more
When choosing a specific device, you should in particular inquire about the battery life, the storage capacity, the quality and type of sound and of course also the comfort of operation.
If you have music above all, and listen to it every day just briefly, for example, in the tram, then any phone that plays MP3 files is enough.
What almost every cell phone can do.
You also don’t have to specifically control which music formats a phone or player can process.
MP3 works all, and most of the music you get will be right in this format.
The format is one of the most common, and most devices can also play music in WMA format.
Less common is AAC (a format that Apple and its iPods use).
Better mobile phones also make it possible to buy music online.
You only need to access the corresponding pages of a provider (or another provider) via the mobile internet, and you can already purchase a song or album.
This service can be a compelling argument in and of itself for why you should add a music handy.
Unfortunately, the offer of the providers is poor and is usually limited to fast radio hits.
The prices are not the lowest either.
In general, however, it is assumed that this kind of music sales (whether via GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people carry the phone with them.
If you want to listen to something, grab the phone in your jacket pocket while the player is at home forgotten.
However, it depends on whether you are always wearing headphones or at least one wireless free-phone device.
If not, you can use the built-in speaker that almost every phone has, but only the fewest MP3 players.
The biggest advantage of the music handsets will probably be in the price for many.
The cheapest usually cost less than three thousand crowns.
For three and four thousand crowns you already get a very decent walkman.
The biggest handicap will be for most people that there are no normal headphones.
The best and most technically mature phones with a 3.5mm opening for normal headphones cost up to fifteen thousand crowns.
The advantage of the player, in turn, lies in the easy operation.
The simplest - and not necessarily the cheapest (see selection) - player can really serve anyone.
A minimum of functions, the similarity in operation with the previously normal cassette recorder or, for example, the recorder is obvious.
There is no threat of collision in the form of a wrongly employed mobile Internet and a subsequent horrifying bill for data transmissions.
What device should you use now
Even the cheapest phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for removable storage media (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even if you buy a suitable ticket, two thousand crowns are enough.
But be careful.
In the case of basic models, only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are usually supported.
Only the most expensive ones can also read 8GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy an affordable MP3 player, then go to Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB) then you do not have to put more than 1100 crowns on the table.
If you are one of the more demanding listeners, prefer to take specialized phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some from Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have independent control buttons for MP3, and the user comfort is thus achieved at the individual MP3 player.
The widest is Sony Ericsson, whose phones from the Walkman series have the same user interface as the individual MP3 players sold.
The same services in the same price category of up to 4,000 crowns, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery life (usually 15 hours, up to a maximum of 35 hours) provide you with MP3 players from the above-mentioned manufacturers.
The first virtual provider is coming to the Czech Republic this year.
- Maybe.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite mature, the Czech providers offer virtually all services, as they are also offered by their partners in Western Europe.
Nevertheless, something is missing here - a virtual provider that forces the classics at lower prices.
Maybe he won't be waiting long.
We have often reported on Mobil.cz that the Czech mobile phone providers work among the most expensive in Europe.
This was also confirmed by the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> telecommunications authority, which pointed out that the price for an SMS here is higher than in the rest of the European Union.
After the European Commission's final steps in the area of regulation of roaming charges, there is so likely to be a paradoxical situation - for some customers of the Czech mobile phone providers SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
Why are prices in the Czech Republic so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, it lacks the competition that really makes a statement.
Perhaps it sounds paradoxical, but in the Czech Republic there are three mobile networks and a penetration of far more than 100%.
The mobile operators, on the other hand, like to brag about the fact that there is extremely much competition in the Czech market.
Pavel Dvo<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>k, Chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (<0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>), who has often stated in the past that there is no room for another provider in the Czech Republic, is often obliged to do so.
It is likely true that a classic provider with its own network will no longer have very many opportunities (by the way, he would probably hardly even find frequencies).
But there is one more option – a virtual provider.
Especially the entry of virtual providers into the mobile radio market brought with it a significant price reduction, to which the classic mobile phone providers had to respond.
There were similar voices in the UK before companies like Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile entered the market as in the Czech Republic.
However, it has been shown that there is room for such providers and that they can really be successful.
By the way, you don’t have to look for examples for long.
In February this year, we reported on the launch of the virtual provider Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, this provider managed to attract more than 100 thousand customers and thus to become the country’s fifth largest provider.
Behind Mobilking is the financial group Penta, which owns U:fon in the Czech Republic, among others.
The advantage of virtual providers is that you can focus on a much more specific target group.
In order to work effectively, virtual providers need far fewer customers than a classic provider.
They do not require relatively high costs for the construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network.
In the world, virtual providers typically profile themselves as low-cost firms – they offer cheap phone calls and SMS, which is often accompanied by a less extensive service offering.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half cheaper than its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be a pretty good move to bet on a non-cliché target group.
This service is specifically geared towards men.
“Real guys choose Mobilking – the provider they like and can trust,” said David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, the provider of this virtual provider.
It is difficult to say whether a similar concept as in Poland could be found in the Czech Republic.
Vodafone spokesperson Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> also doubts this: "The Czech market is relatively small for a market segment on which most virtual providers are based.
In addition, it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the service offer."
In the Czech Republic chancenlos, the mobile phone providers think
However, it is almost certain that if a virtual mobile provider conquers the Czech Republic, this will not be mobile.
"We are talking about an expansion of this successful project, but the negotiations in the Czech Republic do not look particularly hopeful.
It will be more likely to enter the market of mobile in other countries of our region," Jana Studni<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1>, spokeswoman for the financial group Penta, told Mobil.cz.
Indirectly, it confirmed that the current mobile operators in the Czech Republic are not particularly inclined to this idea.
On the contrary, they are trying to do everything to ensure that no potential competitor is created.
Their interest in starting a virtual mobile provider has long been demonstrated by the GTS Novera Group, which wants to take another step to become a real competitor of Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nica O2 in the field of corporate customers.
“We have a great interest in providing our customers not only fixed-line, but also mobile telecommunication services.
And the sooner, the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this option with all Czech mobile providers.
With some of them, we have already been able to make progress in the negotiations,” said Pavel Kaidl, Group spokesperson.
Maybe better times are coming now.
Unofficial information shows that the first virtual provider may be expected by the end of the year.
Until now, however, this is surrounded by an insurmountable wall of silence.
“At the moment, we do not assume that there is room for a full-fledged virtual provider in the Czech Republic.
The Czech market has a high specificity compared to other markets.
So far, no subject has addressed us with a complex and serious project in this area," says Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88> from the press department of Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nica O2 in his statement to Mobil.cz.
Other providers also point to the specifics of the Czech market.
T-Mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1> rarely adds in line with O2's statement: "So far, we have not found a viable and mutually beneficial project on which to build on."
And she adds: “On the network of T-Mobile, hardly a virtual provider will appear by the end of the year.
At this point, we would have to have a concrete offer in order to be able to think so short-term.”
Vodafone focuses its attention on meeting the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> said: “We are open to negotiations with potential virtual providers, especially in the area of cost sharing and infrastructure.
This is exactly what we consider the best from the customer’s point of view.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for a fast mobile internet.”
Responsible authorities - with the suppliers hand in hand
It is easy to understand the actions of the mobile providers, another provider would call more competition, which would lead to falling prices and thus also to a decrease in profits.
So why should such a competitor be allowed to enter the market?
The fact that providers can pull on a string when it comes to something also proves the long way around the emergence of U:fon.
Probably the strongest pressure in the direction of <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> came when U:fon came on the market, from the company T-Mobile.
This is also evidenced by the publicly available information from the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> websites.
But now U:fon is suitable as an argument why you should not allow a virtual provider.
Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1> commented: “The competitive environment of the mobile market has recently also been strengthened by the market entry of a fourth mobile provider.
Given the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that a new player in the market itself and in particular its services would make high demands."
In view of this approach, however, the mobile operator is amazed by the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory authorities.
This is not just about the attitude of <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, which unfortunately, unlike the UK and other highly developed countries, does not have the competence to intervene in economic competition in the Czech Republic.
It is owned exclusively by the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (<0xC3><0x9A>OHS).
This, however, relates to this whole problem, its very typical attitude.
“The entry into the market of a virtual mobile provider would be possible after a contract has been concluded between a mobile provider and a virtual provider through the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
So far, no such contract has been concluded, because the offer of potential stakeholders was probably not interesting enough for the classic providers," Kristi<0xC3><0xA1>n Chalupa of the Department of Foreign Relations of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS said in his response to our request.
Representatives of the providers would not be surprised by such a wording.
This is more than worrying, from an authority that represents consumer interests and, among other things, is to ensure that no one abuses its position in the market.
In particular, when Kristi<0xC3><0xA1>n Chalupa adds: "In abroad, where virtual providers work quite normally, it is to be observed that their market entry has contributed to a price reduction in mobile telephone services."
However, it is likely that pressure on the proper functioning of the market and a price reduction are not in the interests of <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
It is truly shocking in this case that the three mobile providers are almost already in agreement, which results from their reactions.
The question of whether this is really just a coincidence is obvious.
Just like the exact same gasoline price at the gas stations, it is certainly just a coincidence and the consequence of a tough competition.
“The Authority has not discovered any signs in this case that indicate an action directed against competition, and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way in the matter.
None of the providers has a dominant market position, so he also does not have the corresponding increased responsibility for his trading in the market.
The necessary tools for opening up the mobile market for virtual providers are probably also missing from the regulatory authority for telecommunications," Chalupa said in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of many controversial points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets, elaborated by <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, after telecommunications from the point of view of economic competition is a single market.
In such a market, of course, none of the Czech mobile operators has a dominant position.
Some legal experts, however, offer a different view - for the market entry of a virtual provider, the approval of the network operator is always necessary.
And the mobile provider has, logically, the monopoly for its network.
This means that it necessarily occupies a dominant position in a particular segment.
However, even if one does not agree with this argument, there should be at least one warning for the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS that three mobile providers are strikingly similar.
In doing so, complaints by a number of interested parties (including the aforementioned company GTS Novera) demonstrate that they encounter very similar obstacles in negotiations with all providers.
The transfer of responsibility to <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> is then a fairly common trick in telecommunications services, with which the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS distances itself from the whole matter.
This has already been observed in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, the recently adopted telecommunications law has not succeeded in enforcing <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>'s expansion of competences in the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although a number of experts have promised an improvement in the situation.
The representatives of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS need to know this all too well, but they probably have different interests.
It's okay when no one's looking
First of all, the functioning of any pseudo-virtual provider, of which there are several in the Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
They are companies that issue their own price lists for mobile telecommunications services, but only partially public.
Usually, these are companies that operate in the field of multilevel marketing.
Own mobile phone services include Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others.
The price lists of these companies usually only reach selected ones.
The joke of the matter is that the company appears to the operator as a classic company customer who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, he then receives special price offers (and other offers).
The problem is that the terms and conditions of all Czech mobile phone providers prohibit a similar kind of resale.
"If there are cases that you describe, then it can be a violation of the contractual conditions that we will then deal with, which can lead to an end to cooperation with the relevant society," Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1> replied to our question on this issue.
However, it is quite unlikely that something like this will not be talked about by the managers of the mobile service providers.
Especially in the case of the three mentioned companies, it can be thousands of customers.
However, no operator opposes such a procedure.
As a result of the activities of these companies, they do not receive negligible profits, but at the same time, unlike the actual virtual providers, they are not affected by the actual official marketing.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> draws attention to possible problems: "The law allows for such types of speculation, however, the services of these companies are only used by a very small percentage of customers.
They must also accept that the SIM card in their phone does not run on their name, so they cannot fully have it like the normal customers of the mobile providers."
This alone, however, should at least happen strangely.
In addition, another question opens up for the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
When mobile providers close their eyes to such an act, why do they lock themselves against a virtual provider?
It is added that the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS has quite strong competences to detect such activities, and if it does not want to, it does not have to satisfy itself with the declaration of the providers that they knew nothing about it and their terms and conditions would prohibit this.
When the Czech Republic is no longer the most expensive
As has been pointed out several times in the text, the market entry of virtual providers resulted in a significant price decline in the various services.
Virtually in all countries where virtual providers have originated, the classic providers have tried to prevent their emergence practically more or less.
The arguments they used were practically identical - a too small or too saturated market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
However, in the high-developed countries, the regulatory bodies are intervening at these very moments, which in no way tried to protect the interests of mobile providers, but those of their customers.
Whether through formal measures or non-formal pressure, they achieved that the first virtual operator was created, and this followed further.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators are throwing themselves all over the case like a hot potato.
On the basis of our experience, we cannot escape the impression that ambiguity in the competencies in these cases is more than beneficial.
But we do not throw the flint into the grain.
If the background information is correct and a virtual provider appears soon, the Czech mobile market may soon be back in motion.
If a provider allows the creation of a virtual mobile provider, the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS will not remain inactive when it comes to refusing (discriminating) other interested parties.
And then the Czechs will finally not be more expensive to call than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Find the best
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek presented the new recordings of the national anthem “Where Is My Homeland” on the occasion of the day of Czech nationality in a festive hour.
The anthem was re-recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> B<0xC4><0x9B>lohl<0xC3><0xA1>vek.
There are four versions available - with male or female solo singing, in chorus and in an instrumental version.
The song was composed by Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>nkov<0xC3><0xA1> and Adam Plachetka.
The hymn versions are edited by Otakar Jeremia<0xC5><0xA1> and Jaroslav Kr<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
On the server iHNed.cz you can listen to all four versions at once.
For B<0xC4><0x9B>lohl<0xC3><0xA1>vek, the Czech national anthem is one of the most beautiful anthems.
He had previously told Czech Broadcasting that he had selected singers with young, representative voices that are distinctive and popular for the solo variants.
“From the beginning, I tried to adhere to a clear dictation with both of them and then with the choir, so that one understands the text well, so that a harmonious sound is created,” said the conductor.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov m<0xC5><0xAF>j first sounded in 1834 on the stage of the Standing Theatre in the original Czech play Fidlova<0xC4><0x8D>ka by Josef Kajet<0xC3><0xA1>n Tyl, the music originated from Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek <0xC5><0xA0>kroup.
It became popular, and people accepted it spontaneously.
The first strophe of the song became an organic part of the national anthem after the establishment of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
It remained one of the seven state symbols even after the establishment of the independent Czech Republic.
How does the "new" hymn sound?
The Prague transport companies are also transporting on a chip for the first time on Wednesday
Wednesday, October 1, 2008, will enter the history of Prague transport companies as a date on which the first passengers to enter a subway, tram or bus will be carrying an electronic coupon in their pocket instead of a paper ticket.
These can currently be purchased by about one hundred thousand people who own the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can purchase a 30-day, 90-day or yearly voucher (valid from 1 January 2009) and play it on their chip card at the information centres and branches of the transport companies at the subway stations Muzeum, R<0xC3><0xB3>by<0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xA1>n and Lu<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1>ka, Ko<0xC5><0xA1>cerov, An<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>, N<0xC3><0xA1><0xC3><0xA1>dra<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>.
The coupons are also available via the Internet on the websites of the transport companies www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by over four hundred customers until the afternoon hours.
Those who use the internet sales can really forget the output window in the subway stations, where they had to wait regularly in long lines for their paper tickets.
You buy the coupon over the Internet, it is played on the Opencard in one of the thirteen branches of the city library.
“There is also a switch with trained staff available to travelers, who advises interested parties when buying online and also plays the coupon on the map,” said project spokesman Martin Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD>.
In addition to the libraries, the electronic coupons can also be played at self-service ATMs on the Opencard, which are installed in some subway tickets.
What do these machines look like?
They are red, remember ticket counters, the passengers may have already noticed them in the subway stations Roztyly, Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovick<0xC3><0xA1>, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavsk<0xC3><0xA1>.
"At the moment there are five of them in the city, but by the end of the year it should be eighty," Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD> adds.
The coupon is controlled by an automatic machine instead of the driver
The machines that will operate from tomorrow are easy to operate.
All you have to do is enter the chip card, and the previously purchased coupon plays on its own.
The electronic coupons will apply from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the surrounding area.
So in the suburban trains and on the bus lines with the numbers 300 to 499, with which mainly the inhabitants from municipalities of the region Central Bohemia get to the capital.
"In trains that are part of Prague's integrated traffic, the train attendants have reading devices with which they can check the validity of the coupons by time and zone," explains Filip Dr<0xC3><0xA1>pal of the organization Ropid the ticket control. This organization compiles the timetables for the Prague traffic.
The suburban buses have card readers at the checkout at the driver's desk.
On boarding, the chip card must not only be shown to the driver, but the Opencard must be placed in a marked place on the side of the box.
In this way, the driver checks the validity of the coupons played.
"If a passenger wants to verify the validity of the coupons played, nothing is easier than asking the driver to provide this information," Dr<0xC3><0xA1>pal said.
A passenger who does not ride on suburban buses and no longer knows when the voucher expires can in turn go to the self-service ATMs where the vouchers are played on the card.
Here information about the validity of its documents is displayed on the display of the device.
The Sudeten demanded a popular decision from the United States.
The Sudeten Germans had called in 1945 for the annexation of the Bohemian Forest to the United States.
This is evident from a letter that is stored in the collections of the South Bohemia Scientific Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, then we want to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
With such a wish, some groups of Sudeten Germans were supposed to have turned to the U.S. president in 1945.
This is evidenced, among other things, by a letter that has been preserved in a private archive and is now stored in the collections of the South Bohemia Scientific Library.
In the letter, the Germans of Krumau asked the American president not to allow the return of the "Sudetenhaus" - which was adopted on the basis of the Munich agreement by Hitler - to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly and want to be sure of the words that the American units do not enter German territory as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," the letter reads, "People whose hearts are at the heart of the fate of the Sudeten".
Since the accession of the Sudeten Germans to Czechoslovakia - in the knowledge of the Czech national character - makes them suspect that they would expect brutality, recklessness, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the Böhmers to take over the American president's office, for today.
"We cannot believe that without regard to the views of a quarter of a million inhabitants of this area, you are addressing a foreign state that is oppressing and trying to eliminate minorities and has contributed nothing at all to the victory of the Allies," the letter read.
The reason why the authors are not able to sign is supposedly the fear of reprisals of the "Czech oppressors".
If the U.S. president had high doubts about the Bohemian Walddeutsche’s attitude, it would suffice if he would initiate a popular decision in the Bohemian Waldgau on whether the inhabitants would become part of the United States or would live under the protection of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound somewhat na<0xC3><0xAF>ve in the knowledge of post-war history today, it, in the opinion of some contemporary witnesses, draws a good picture of the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at the time.
Although the Bohemian Germans had to at least guess that their expulsion from the republic would be negotiated, only a few of them admitted such a possibility at all.
Some waited for the United States and the United Kingdom to negotiate some kind of autonomy for the Sudeten.
Again, others believed that they could simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
It is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who is from Budweis.
He was employed in the war as Budweiser German at the navy on the Baltic Sea.
When he came into British captivity at the end of the war and was taken to a prisoner of war camp in Holstein, dozens of other Bohemian Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that if they came home, the Czech would come to their attention," Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners of war who had lived in Czechoslovakia before the war believed that he would be expelled from the republic on the basis of the Bene<0xC5><0xA1> decrees.
If you don't, then pay!
An emotionally charged campaign is aimed at motorists
The most expensive action on road safety in Czech history.
This is also how the emotionally charged media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport wants to launch on Wednesday, could be characterized.
Minister Ale<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0xA0>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek’s authority promises to remove drivers from dangerous behaviour behind the steering wheel.
The campaign for 150 million crowns will run on television, radio, cinema, the Internet, but also on flyers.
It is intended to reduce drivers from driving too fast and alcohol at the wheel.
And they also remember to buckle up before driving.
The campaign wants to talk to young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
And what is shown in the spots?
Especially stories of people who appeal to emotions.
This is also evidenced by the "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign:
If you don't, then pay!
The words "don't think" are in capital letters on a badge.
And in a blood vessel, the word "pay" is written.
This is supposed to mean that you can pay a moment of inattention with your own life.
The spots will “shock” viewers by 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where you can see pictures with dramatic footage of accident victims.
It promises that the number of accidents and the number of road fatalities on the Czech roads will decrease.
The spots were compiled by the Euro RSCG agency.
Sugar bread and peaches for motorists
"For the drivers, the motto applies to sugar bread and pie.
Sugar bread means that they save time, for example, when you drive in red.
The peitsche is then the threat of a punishment or an accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk," says transport psychologist at Na Homolce Martin Ko<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>n Hospital.
And that is why information campaigns in the press and above all negative advertising are necessary, the psychologist believes.
Even less effective are in his opinion according to boards, which make the drivers aware of a danger.
"If you set up a static board that warns of a danger, it will probably soon flow with the surroundings, and the drivers will no longer notice it," says Ko<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>n.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
The Chairman of the Provisional Israeli Government, Ehud Olmert, has advocated the return of virtually all the territories that were occupied in 1967, including Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, if peace can be made with Palestine and Syria in exchange for that.
He stressed this in an interview published Monday by the daily Jediot Achronot.
"We need to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all, if not all, of the (occupied) areas," Olmert told the newspaper.
“We will retain a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similarly high percentage (Israeli territories) because without this there will be no peace,” he added.
He admitted that any return would include East Jerusalem as well.
“Those who want security in Jerusalem and above all do not want tractors or bulldozers to roll over their legs, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up part of Jerusalem,” Olmert said in reference to two attacks in the city in July, in which several people were killed and dozens injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the Templars and sacred and historic places" located on the territory of the old town.
“Those who want to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It will not work,” he continued.
Departure from the Golan Heights
Olmert spoke in favour of Israel’s withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which he believes is an indispensable condition for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Syria.
But this would also require some efforts on the part of Damascus.
"My proposal is not to make peace with Syria alone on the basis of a withdrawal from the Golan Heights," Olmert said.
“The Syrians only know too well what they have to do to get back to the Golan Heights.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with the (Shiite) Hezbollah movement; they will have to give up the constant support they have given to the terrorism of the (Shiite) Hamas movement concretely, the Ira War network of the Al-Khaida and the Shiite Prime Minister.
Questions about the accident: Are Stewards on the bus illegal?
The law does not know her, in a long-distance bus is not allowed to walk around
In connection with the tragic accident of a bus of the Student Agency company near the Italian Padua, the question arises whether stewards and travelers are allowed to walk in and out of the bus while driving.
"If we wanted to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of a steward is in contradiction to the law on road traffic," said the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
The accident, which killed a twenty-two-year-old stewardess last week, was probably caused by the driver of the truck who crossed the bus.
At that moment, the young woman was sitting beside the driver with the least secure seat in the car, although she had two more seats at her disposal.
However, a bus can also have an accident or slow down sharply when the Steward carries coffee or newspapers.
It also matters whether the bus is equipped with parking spaces for the vehicle letter.
If this is not provided for in the bus, the passengers must sit.
The long-distance buses of Student Agency have no stops, as confirmed by the director of the company, Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, in relation to Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz.
“We discussed this with the Ministry, and this did not initially agree with the movement of travellers.
Later this has been taken back, and we have reached a consensus that travelers are allowed to go to the toilet while driving if they have their seat,” he said.
The law doesn't know a steward.
“There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of a steward – no legislation describes this role.
However, there is also no law prohibiting the carrier from providing services.
The law on road traffic only knows the concept of car attendants; however, it does not define their rights and obligations," the ministry's spokesman Hanzelka added.
The Director of the Department of Road Vehicles of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, on the other hand, believes that the law subsequently covers this problem.
"It depends on whether the bus also has stops in the product approval.
That's all," he emphasized.
Buses are divided into city buses where there are stops and the maximum speed is limited, buses with shorter stops and a higher permissible speed, and long-distance buses without stops with the highest permissible speed and seats with safety belts.
Just like on a plane, the expert says.
BESIP Traffic Safety Specialist Jaroslav Hor<0xC3><0xAD>n sees no fundamental problem in the movement of stewards on board a bus.
"In a fluid way of driving, there are not many dangers, the situation is comparable to the service on board an aircraft.
Even here, it’s not certain when turbulence will come, and the stewardess can bump her head.”
"But if a bus brakes sharply, then of course the laws of physics apply.
Just like in the city bus or in a tram.
The safety of the stewards must be clarified by internal regulations," he says, and also believes that this problem is not fully resolved from the point of view of the law.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura is ready to cancel the services
Student Agency is the only bus company that offers services from Stewards.
The company employs about two hundred people in this role.
The director does not consider his profession risky even after the accident.
“As soon as I get the impression that the job of the steward is risky, I will delete him.
Coffee and newspapers can be obtained upon boarding.
That would also reduce costs,” he said.
As an interest in safety, the director of Asiana Alexej Litvin justifies the absence of stewards in his buses, but his company operates only a fraction of the lines compared to Student Agency.
"We don't have any stewardesses, but we've been fighting since the beginning.
Sooner or later this ends with some fatal accident," he had not been speaking to T<0xC3><0xBD>den.cz a year ago.
It was an incredible tragedy.
In the accident of a bus to Naples, a young stewardess from the Pilsen region, who had worked for the company for two years, was unlucky.
The Slovenian truck was probably bent off the stand strip without blinking and had blocked the bus ride.
The bus driver tried to avoid a sharp maneuver, but collided with the right front with the truck.
That the two seats were sold for the stewards, Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura argues.
"These seats cannot be reserved for long distance connections, they are blocked."
The company will sue truck drivers.
With compensation for the young woman’s family, the agency will not wait for the court ruling, but it also expects financial compensation from the culprit.
A change of law?
Not in sight
A more precise regulation of the movement of Stewards aboard a bus could bring about a legal regulation on which a thirty-member expert team of the Department of Transportation has been working for over a year.
“But this has not yet come to a concrete conclusion.
Buses are also not necessarily on the agenda, rather the points system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile phones when driving," says expert Hor<0xC3><0xAD>n.
"The Ministry of Transport does not regard the activity of the stewards as something that could significantly jeopardize the safety of the passengers," said Hanzelka, with the control of the safety of buses within the competence of the police and the labour protection authorities.
Düsseldorf's hopes rest on Frankfurt
In large words, it is not lacking in the letter of the WestLB board to the employees of the house.
By merging units of the Düsseldorfer Finanzinstitut with the Frankfurter Deka-Bank, “the central capital market house of the Sparkasse-Finanzgruppe” could be created, the letter said.
WestLB introduced a "competence block" with sustainable profitability into such a business.
And at all, such a connection could be the decisive impetus to further consolidations in the national banking sector.
This is how it is read when a board of directors wants to demonstrate its ability to act in difficult times.
After all, the WestLB is still under enormous pressure.
Not only on the part of the EU Commission, but also by the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Authority, which the North Rhine-Westphalia government has only recently made it clear that it is time to find a future solution.
However, the WestLB has been talking about a connection between the Deka-Bank, who know savings customers because of their investment funds, and the WestLB for some time - also on the Frankfurt side.
Although Deka bank chief Franz Waas made it known at the presentation of the half-yearly figures at the end of August, in a merger of the house on the Mainzer Landstraße with a state bank, such as the Helaba or the WestLB, he sees no sense.
However, the Board of Directors of the Deka, which is each held in half by the state banks and savings banks, has commissioned the Board of Directors to conduct discussions with WestLB on joint business activities.
This could be the capital market business or parts of it.
The talks have just begun, as they say at the financial centre.
The Deka-Bank, which with its 3,000 employees is one of the most important employers at Finanzplatz Frankfurt, is not the first time when it comes to consolidation in the savings sector.
In 2003, it looked as if the Deka Bank could merge with the Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and the Helaba.
There was nothing out of this trinity.
The plans had barely been made public, the Hessian state government spoke out against Helaba’s involvement in it.
The other two houses did not find each other either.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz instead went to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
However, there have always been games of thought about the connection of the Deca-Bank with the state banks.
Lastly, however, Günther Merl, Chairman of the Board of Helaba, had spoken out against plan games about a merger with his house.
Regardless, however, the realization seems to mature that a collapse of the various houses of the public sector is not necessary.
Now that the national election in Bavaria is over, a connection between BayernLB and the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg could be the first.
For Helaba, this is not necessarily good news.
If the pressure for further mergers increases, the partners will gradually go out for it.
In the south, she would only be junior partners, although she has so far coped much better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
In a merger with West LB, the Hessen-Thüringen Sparkassen- und Giroverband, which has an 85 percent stake in Helaba, has pushed a barrier ahead at the beginning of the year.
At least it's the North Blvd.
However, such geostrategic considerations are only one side.
On the other hand, the question is how the different business models of the individual houses fit together.
In June, Merl stated that the crucial question with which business model the futures of the Landesbanken should be ensured had not yet been answered by the German Sparkassen- und Giroverband.
In the end, there could also be a breakdown of West LB, which, of course, is not desirable there.
In the letter of the board of directors there, there is also the talk about it, it is definitely aimed at an "all-inclusive solution" for the house.
How this can be brought under a hat with the merger of individual units with the Deca-Bank will still be shown.
The second weekend is known as "Italian Weekend"
For Elena it is the first time, for Luca it is the third or fourth time.
But this time Elena is his girlfriend, and so everything is different, he says.
Behind them, at the five-liter beer barrel of the Kaiser brand, stands a massively built bartender and proves the about 200 Oktoberfest travelers, which deep tones can produce his throat.
Elena gives Luca a hug, then a kiss.
From Bologna they came to Verona.
From here, the bus parking next to the train station Puorta Nuova, start this evening at 23.45 hours four buses, "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", arrival expected 6.30 hours.
Three buses are mainly reserved for Italians, in one bus travel exclusively Brazilians.
In a corner of the parking lot, the South Americans are singing next to their flag, they have already celebrated at night.
Marco Guarda says it’s not for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with fur lining and glasses with wide silver irons, belongs to the buses.
For five years they have been going to the Oktoberfest, three tours are alone this year.
At night, during the day on the Wiesn, back at 10.30 pm.
Staying overnight would only mean unnecessary expenses, Marco says.
The trip costs 75 euros, the welcome drink with Kaiser-Beer, brewed faithfully to the Bavarian cleanliness bill, the health insurance and the German-speaking travel guide - Marco has attended a language course in Frankfurt - including.
And already the buses roll into the night, on the motorway towards "Brennero".
There is no beer, not yet.
Quickly it will be quiet on the bus, travelers sleep.
All right, they're gonna need their powers.
It will be held in Brixen and in Holzkirchen, where several other buses with Italian signs on the motorway 8 just before Munich take a break.
When Marcos Group finally arrives at the parking lot near the Theresienwiese at 7:00 a.m., there are already 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco holds a final address, explains the attack plan.
First, put on the yellow cap.
On it is left "Octoberfest", in fracture, next to the Internet address of Marcos Reisebüro: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Secondly: "When the doors to the beer tent open, it's called running!", Marco calls in the morning.
"Run!" Run and occupy the places in the back of the tent.
"Not forward, otherwise we will block, and not distribute all the yellow hats on the same benches, in the room!"
The measure, Marco boasts, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget the drinking money.
"The security guards show that we're doing well!
As soon as you leave the places, they're gone!"
Thirdly, "Tonight we'll find a point half-eleven here again!" Understand?
And it's going to show up.
Along the way, a yellow cap binds to the trees, to signs and even to the electoral poster of a large Bavarian People’s Party.
They want to be armed for retreat.
It is known as the “Italian Weekend”.
There are no exact figures; there are 50,000 people on the way over the Alps and falling into the beer tents, ten percent of all visitors are expected to have arrived extra from Italy this weekend.
The Munich Police is reinforced by seven police officers from South Tyrol, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which leads a national statistic in which the Italians in front of the British (about 60 operations) and Austrians (about 80) with about 200 medical supplies take the first place.
Especially popular with Italians is the courtyard braut.
Sleepless nights for creditors of the Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück stressed only last week.
How good that the politician used the word "relatively" and also influencing that the German banking sector will not be spared from the crisis-ridden developments.
This is because it has already happened over the weekend.
The Munich real estate financier Hypo Real Estate (HRE), listed in the Dax, receives a billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to shield itself from the turbulence in the markets.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that the loan assistance amounted to up to 35 billion euros.
Hypo Real Estate only has to earn the part that it also takes in.
The money comes from both private and public-law banks.
The background is losses to the daughter Deppa.
The state financier had refinanced himself extremely short-term for long-term projects, according to a newspaper report, which is no longer possible due to market mistrust.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s cash reserve had shrunk by 95 percent to EUR 2.37 million, while its equity ratio had dropped slightly from 1.6 to 1.45 percent.
Current earnings and net earnings from financial transactions fell to zero compared to the previous year period, earnings from receivables and certain securities as well as from the liquidation of deposits in the credit business decreased by more than 70 percent to EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to higher earnings from reimbursements of downstream settlement costs from the restructuring of the former Defpa Group, as well as from the reimbursement of interest under the taxation order and from the business provision for group companies, had the revenue decrease by around 16% still failed moderately.
The former state financier had initially speculated with commercial real estate loans after its privatization in 1990, which had then been decommissioned into Aareal Bank.
Due to the lack of earnings in classical state funding, the Deffa had then become more involved in infrastructure projects and the financing of community projects of private investors and the state (Private-Public Partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally.
On the value of the daughter, the Hypo Real Estate must now make depreciations that will have a "substantial material effect" on the profit and loss account of the group, it is quite indeterminate.
The fact is that the dividend has been cancelled.
By 2007, it had already been cut by two-thirds.
Hypo Real Estate has been a major state and infrastructure financier since the acquisition of Deffa.
It is more reliant on refinancing in the interbank market than other institutions, as it has no customer deposits.
With the collapse of the U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, lending among the banks has again largely failed as the banks kept their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term refinancing for a portion of Deppa’s loan portfolio – around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50 billion per year.
According to the announcement by Hypo Real Estate, the group’s financing needs are met with the loan for the foreseeable time and the company is shielded “from the influence of the currently largely inoperable international money markets”.
It can be heard from other sources that thanks to the funds the refinancing was secured by the end of 2009.
HRE CEO Georg Funke said that the Hypo Real Estate Group will no longer have to use the money markets for the foreseeable future.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Authority (BaFin) assume that the market capacity of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now secured.
This is what the bank’s shareholders and creditors hope for.
But given the dynamics and uncertainties of the crisis, there is no certainty.
It is not even inconceivable that funding does not have to be fully utilized.
But also the opposite is not to be worn out.
After the late Sunday evening hearing after the bank still stood before the insolvency, even the at least preliminary rescue is not able to calm the mood.
The stock price breaks by 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
In contrast, the bond prices are quite good.
While the priority debt is hardly moving, the rates of post-rating bonds are more clearly indicated.
In particular, the bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and, understandably, the periods beyond 2009 are affected.
If hypo-real-state bonds used to appear to be a speculative investment alternative, their value must be regarded as dependent on the stability of the international financial system after the significant exacerbation of the banking crisis and of the institution itself, which had only entered the house with the acquisition of the Deffa.
As long as the central banks, governments and less affected commercial banks are still ready to support the system, so long as a timely withdrawal of pensions can be expected.
Or it comes in what hardly anyone at the moment dares to hope - that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, in view of the reports overlapping with the partial nationalization, the probability bordering on security has now become only a legitimate hope.
This is especially likely for long-term creditors to prepare some sleepless nights with the decision whether to separate themselves from their commitments.
Short-term investors can, after all, use a closing bar to form a loss levy for future repayment tax payments on future earnings.
Sylvana and the Secrets of the Bento Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, introduces herself on the first day of school at Tachibana High School, the girls start to joke: The German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas - in the new exchange log she tells of Japan.
"The first school day in Japan.
I was excited.
Before school, I had bammel.
I live on the edge of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and drive 40 minutes by train to Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way alone, fortunately I did not run.
The beginning of lessons at Tachibana does not seem to be as strictly defined as at our home in Lower Saxony.
From eight o'clock onwards, the students begin a short meeting with the teacher, the 'home room', until about twenty-nine.
But before the class started, it was my turn to introduce myself.
I’m not the type of person who likes to speak in front of people, even in front of a class of 40 students.
Because I didn’t have a school uniform yet, I wore an old skirt from my host mother, including blouses, blue knee socks and black leather shoes.
So in this elevator I put myself in front of the pult and tried to pronounce everything right: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and have my birthday in a week.
At that moment I was very happy that I had already started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class all shook, shook and waved, and I heard the word "kawaii" all the time.
I knew that from my manga.
It is part of the vital vocabulary of Japanese girls and means 'cute, sweet'.
Then I quickly got stuck in my place.
The girl next to me grinned quite wide, she found it an honor that the exchange student should sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was pretty quiet, but when the gong sounded, I was really stunned.
Everyone was talking to each other and chatting and asking for holes in my stomach - it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
During the break, everyone packed out their bentos.
My hostess had made me a lunchbox like that too - this is sometimes something different than the arid German pause bread.
I had rice with herbs, small sausages, salad of cucumbers and algae, fruit and a kind of meat in the tofu coat.
Most of the time I don’t have any blisters, which is exactly what I eat here in Japan.
The things look strange and taste completely new.
It is clear that everything is really delicious.
Well, up to the salty plums maybe, brrrr!
The Bentos are not just lunches at Japanese schools.
It sometimes happens that a girl gives a boy a self-prepared bento, which she then produces in a particularly artistic way - in the hope of getting to know the boy more closely during the break snack.
I read about it in my manga comics.
I wonder if I can watch it here too.
‘Why then calculated Japan?’ my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always said then:
“Because it fascinates me.”
After all, I have been reading my favorite manga for years.
And in order to better understand the comics and the culture in it, I also started learning a little Japanese at some point.
So for me it was completely clear that I had to travel here sometime.
Because I also have a weakness for tradition, customs and customs.
And these are of great value here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I haven’t felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I’ve ever seen.”
Even rats have feelings.
A rat or a goat flees in danger means that it also feels fear?
The neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
Just how could you check if they feel the same when they behave like us?
For several years, the online magazine Edge has published contributions of famous scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness, without me or anyone else being able to prove this until now where we can’t even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, we can at least hope, since all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we turn to other species and trim questions of feeling or consciousness in general, we enter immobile terrain because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same as many other animals: it faces dead, flees, or attacks.
People behave similarly, from which some scientists suggest a similar subjective experience.
I don't believe it, though.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to that of animals.
On the one hand, the circuits almost always associated with human consciousness include the lateral prefrontal cortex (because of its participation in short-term memory and the execution/control functions).
This broad region is much more developed in humans than in other primates and seems to be completely lacking in other creatures.
At least for those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including the knowledge of who we are and the ability to plan and decide, there is reason to assume that man is even different from the other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity may lie in the linguistic nature of man: since such a large part of his experience is connected with language, it is often said that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness did not depend on language, it would certainly influence it, so that animal consciousness, whatever its nature may be, is likely to be very different from most of our states of consciousness.
Therefore, it is difficult to determine what consciousness might look like in other animals.
If, as something internal and subjective, it can neither be measured nor analyzed on the basis of our own experience because of the special hardware, then its research presents us with great problems.
Most of my statements refer to the content of the conscious experience, but there is another aspect of the consciousness, which may be more scientifically accessible.
One could examine the processes of consciousness of animals without regard to their contents, and this is precisely what happens in studies on the short-term memory of primates, especially in the example of visualization.
But with this approach, followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, one relies more on the neural correlates of consciousness than on the causal mechanisms: both may or may not be identical.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of the prefrontal cortex for the attainment of visualization.
What is the result of the sensations?
I lead them back to the fact that an emotional system like that of fear is activated in a conscious brain of its own activity.
So what we call “fear” is the mental state in which we are when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) occupies memory.
In this way, sensations are closely linked to the regions of the cortex, which distinguish primates and in particular humans.
In connection with the linguistic nature, fine degrees of feeling arise, because with the help of words and grammar, we can differentiate and categorize states in order to attribute them to others besides ourselves.
Antonio Damasio, on the other hand, believes that sensations from more primitive activities in the body’s sensory regions of the cortex and the brain stem are similar to those of Jaak Pankseep, who, however, focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it could well be involved in intergenerational sensations.
In theory, I can’t argue with it, but I think it’s unproven.
Pankseep argues that what appears in rats and humans like fear probably feels like this in both cases: But how can one check whether rats and humans feel the same when they behave similarly?
A sheep flees in danger if it also feels fear?
In my eyes, mere behavioral similarity cannot yet prove equality of experience.
Although the neural comparison further helps: rats and humans have similar brain strains, but sheep do not even have a brain.
But is the brain stem responsible for sensations?
And even if you could prove it to humans, how would you prove it in rats?
I believe that rats and other mammals, maybe even sheep (who knows?), have feelings.
But I wouldn't know how to prove it.
And because their sensations are probably fundamentally different from ours (since human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore the emotional behavior rather than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, progress is gaining on the neural plane, as long as the same is measured in rats and humans.
As I do not explore language and consciousness in rats, nor do I explore sensations, I do not know if they exist.
You may think that’s short-sighted, but I’d rather go ahead than constantly running against a wall.
I am a practical emotionalist.
Uefa President Platini: Deadline for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Wasjunik said the preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and Prime Minister.
"The government sees the decision of Uefa in Bordeaux as proof of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to host the European Championship together with Poland," Wasjunik said.
“This is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still a lot to be done in both countries.”
In the schedule for the construction or reconstruction of the stadiums, roads, hotels and airports, the two hosts are behind.
Possibly even the number of EM stages will be reduced from eight to six.
“We can’t waste any more time.
We now have to work at the highest speed," said the president of the Ukrainian association Grigory Surkis.
"Uefa will keep an eye on us all the time."
An even more radical step has been decided in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish association PZPN has been suspended after numerous scandals by the National Olympic Committee and replaced by the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission had met at the request of Minister of Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is “the serious risk that the PZPN is not able to act according to the rules,” Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
"We have assured UEFA President Michel Platini in a letter that preparations for the 2012 European Championships will not suffer."
Several first-place finishers had been convicted in the past season alone for manipulation into forced relegation, eventually even the league start had to be postponed for the short term.
Dennis Quaid strikes back
She wanted to promote a new film, spoke in an interview about Privates - and now has trouble with the ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan outsmarted her estranged Dennis Quaid as a fiancé.
He shuddered and hits back.
Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors are now having an ugly fight with each other - in public.
In an interview with US magazine InStyle last week, Meg Ryan spoke for the first time about the reasons for the marriage's failure: "Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful."
The extent of the fraud was not known until after the divorce.
The occasion for the soul striptease was Ryan's press work for her new film "The Women" - told the story of a breakup.
Dennis Quaid’s reaction to his outing as an unfaithful husband clearly fell out: “Unfortunately,” the 54-year-old told the New York Daily News, “I have repeatedly repurchased and reconstructed the story of our relationship.”
It is also "unfortunate" that the joint 16-year-old son Jack is again "publicly reminded of the pain and the upheavals that mean a divorce for each child."
While Ryan has lived alone since the divorce, Quaid is remarried and recently became the father of twins.
And so his admissions conclude with the side-heel: "My life is going on anyway.
I’m happy to have a wonderful family that’s doing well.”
Prices for flights and hotels drop
In the first half of 2008, flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, flights were even up to 50% cheaper, according to a recent study.
Flights and overnight stays in hotels have become cheaper again - this is the result of a study by travel and financial services provider American Express.
The company analyzed its booking data from the first half of 2008 and, following a rise in prices in the first quarter, noted a significant breakthrough in the second quarter.
After prices have risen in the hotel market for years, overnight stays have already settled in many places.
From January to March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed rose by an average of 6.9 percent compared to 2007.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
The most obvious was the trend in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year ago.
The reason for this is that American Express sees the weak dollar rate that has led to a “declining travel appetite of American tourists”.
Financial centres such as Frankfurt or London are also more affected by the decline in hotel prices than industrial sites such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices rose by 26.3 percent and even held the record in Europe.
The trend in airfares in the first quarter also showed an upward trend:
Due to kerosene taxation, travelers in the economy class had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, fuel-intensive long-haul flights even became up to 29.2 percent more expensive.
Between April and June, prices for economy-class flights fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but in business and first-class, the price changes were much lower.
In Germany, prices broke even more than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices increased by 11.9 percent, while in the second quarter they fell by 23.6 percent.
On German domestic flights, according to the study, prices have even halved.
On the one hand, the reason for the price disruption is the slowing economic growth, the company explains.
Demand broke in many segments of the air travel market.
On the other hand, the Open Skies Agreement, which liberalises air traffic between the United States and Europe, gives rise to competitive pressure.
Signs of the strained situation were the cancellation of non-profit routes by airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that had filed for bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - in Europe alone, these were 24 airlines.
HSV beats Gladbach 1:0
With one goal and simple methods, the Hamburger SV becomes the table leader.
At Borussia, Luhukay still fails to find a working elf.
By Kristoffer Klein augmented break-landing for national player Marko Marin.
The Gladbacher came into the game only late and failed with a lever to the latte.
His message was precisely formulated, it went convincingly over his lips.
He simply knew that he was right.
"We need the second goal," said Hermann Rieger in the cabin entrance of the Hamburg Arena.
Much was not loose in the catacombs, the half-time break was over and most of them sat back in their places.
Rieger has been a HSV physiotherapist for nearly three decades, and he enjoys a higher reputation than some of his depraved actors.
And so his request was also heard in a responsible place.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and raised his thumb in agreement.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg's head coach Martin Jol.
Its command will be similar: Here with gate two!
Implementation was out.
"It wasn't nice to see everything today," Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhardt would have wished for more relaxation.
The 1-0 (1:0) hamburgers are due to Mladen Petric's header hit (11th); and the fact that very weak Gladbachers could not hurt the weak hamburgers.
“It was a dirty victory,” Martin Jol summed up.
The Hamburger SV will be 121 years old this Monday.
On Saturday afternoon, the spectators celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the flash table on the video wall, which presented their club as a class prime.
It will be a birthday without a real party.
“We know how to sort that,” said Marcell Jansen.
He assumes that the tabular interim stands more for the unpredictability of the league than for the dominance of his HSV.
The team with their late commitments - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goalkeeper Petric as well as the Jansen acquired by FC Bayern - is slow, but they are not yet able to shine.
"We need more flair and more dribblings," Jol said.
After the defeat of the vote
On Wall Street, there is fear.
Early news of the failure of the rescue package caused the Dow Jones to temporarily break by 700 points.
That was the biggest loss of points in a day in his history.
Later, the Dow caught something.
At 8:30 p.m., the world’s most important stock market barometer recorded a good five percent minus 10,579 counters.
The Nasdaq technology exchange was down by more than seven percent at 1548 points.
The biggest loser at the time was the Dow American Express, which broke almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of around twelve percent.
No titles could be added.
The shares of Bank Goldman Sachs declined by almost ten percent.
Just a few days ago, big investor Warren Buffett was involved in the company.
As part of the bailout plan, the funds for the purchase of so-called volatile mortgage securities are to be provided.
However, the sum should be paid out not in one stroke, but gradually.
In return, the state should receive stock option notes from financial companies that could be redeemed at appropriate price developments in order to reduce the burden on the state treasury.
Stock prices in Europe and the United States in the downside
The billion-dollar aid for banks in Europe and the US does not resolve investors’ doubts.
The stock price of the German big bank Hypo Real Estate is falling and tearing down the dax.
The U.S. Dow Jones Index is losing despite the planned bailout of the financial market by the state.
Spectacular price losses from Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have smashed the German Stock Index (Dax) into the minus.
Despite the rescue action of the federal government and private banks, the Munich real estate financier’s share temporarily lost three quarters of its value, which Commerzbank declined by more than 20 percent.
The Dax slipped clearly below the psychologically important 6000-point mark and scored with a minus 3.7 percent at 5,839 points.
All over the world, stock markets have fallen to their knees.
In New York, Wall Street opened with significant losses.
Investors feared that the US government’s $700 billion bailout package might not be enough to bring the financial markets back to life.
The Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent to 10,809.25 points in the first trading hour.
The U.S. House of Representatives wanted to vote on the bailout plan, which could be followed by a vote in the Senate on October 1.
The other European exchanges also knew only one direction: in London, the FTSE index initially declined by 3.2 percent, while the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, the Japanese leader index Nikkei fell by 1.26 percent to 11,743.61 counters after initial gains.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index slipped by 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the lead index Sensex lost 506.43 points or 3.9% and closed at 12,595.75.
In MDax, shares of Arcandor surrendered after the announcement of a capital increase.
The private bank Sal. Oppenheim has signed the 23 million new shares.
The commerce and tourism group also announced that the shares in Thomas Cook will not be sold.
Dark Matter Influences Spacecraft Flight
For years, a mysterious phenomenon in research has been causing confusion: Dark matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called swing-by maneuvers.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity might not be quite correct.
For nearly 18 years, the Ulysses spacecraft flew through space.
Due to soon freezing fuel lines, she is now in danger of cold death.
Among scientists, for years, a mysterious phenomenon has caused confusion - the swing-by-anomaly.
The Swing-by is an aerial maneuver of space probes in which they receive additional vibration in the gravitational field of a celestial body, such as the Earth.
This allows the probes to save a lot of fuel.
The European-American Cassini-Huygens research probe used this physical trick as well as the Ulysses solar probe.
However, what the researchers have been wondering about for years is that the airborne bodies do not behave 100% as one would expect under the ancient law of gravity.
Rather, there are irregularities in the velocity.
The probes become unexpectedly faster or slower.
So far, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
They dubbed him swing-by-anomaly.
Some experts fear that even Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity, which describes the attraction of matter through a curvature of space, might not be quite correct.
The American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton continues to firmly believe that Einstein was not mistaken, and tries to explain the swing-by anomaly using the so-called dark matter that astronomers have made out in the universe.
“The anomaly could be responsible for dark matter, which could also be very close to Earth,” he writes.
The existence of dark matter has only been known by space researchers for about ten years.
It is evident from you that there is a force of attraction, the effect of which on other celestial bodies can be observed.
It itself, on the other hand, is completely invisible, that is, it does not transmit and reflect any kind of electromagnetic radiation, especially not even visible light.
According to the calculations of the scientists, dark matter makes up well a fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their hijackers, the tourists smuggled into Egypt will be free again, as confirmed by the Italian Foreign Minister.
The kidnappers from Sudan had demanded several million euros of ransom money.
In a shooting before the release, six hostages were reportedly killed.
Five Germans have been kidnapped in southern Egypt.
The ransom-negotiations are already underway.
Over and over again, Germans are targeting kidnappers.
WORLD ONLINE describes the most important cases.
European tourists smuggled into the Sahara are apparently free.
This was reported by Egyptian state television, the Arab TV channel Al-Arabia and Italian media in agreement.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release, according to reports by Italian television broadcaster Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been released.
We are just checking their state of health," Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians and a Romanian, as well as their eight Egyptian escorts, were safe and secure, Egyptian state television reported.
The 19 participants of a desert expedition are expected to be on their way to Cairo.
The background of a shooting before the release of the hostages remains unclear: according to an Egyptian security official, the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping before the Sudanese army surprisingly killed six of the kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with a ransom," the official said.
It was "just about taking the hostages in," when suddenly "this surprise" came.
Sudanese soldiers shot six of the kidnappers and arrested two of them on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt.
The hostages had demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money was to be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom" reported, referring to a German intermediary, that the release of the hostages is delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the report, the abductors want to release the female hostages after paying the ransom.
The men should be held in custody until the hijackers have a safe fugitive.
The German embassy in Cairo rejected a statement on the report.
Abuse of stepfather "leads to suicide"
The years of abuse by her stepfather has led to a woman killing herself, was reported to a court.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians, Cornwall, received a six-year prison sentence after he had confessed to eight cases of sexual abuse.
The Truro Criminal Court found out that he regularly tied up his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession: "I feel responsible for her death."
The court found out that Ms. Randle died at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007 at the age of 34.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise had tied her up and her eyes closed before committing sexual acts while her mother was away to work in a inn.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s and he moved back to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, the court learned that Ms. Randle, who volunteered for the National Trust for a large part of her time, was being prosecuted for the abuse that had been inflicted on her twice a week.
Prosecutor Ramsay Quaife reported to the court that friends had said that Mrs Randle, who had been an avid surfer and cyclist, had been "emotionally dead" since 2006 and "had given up her life."
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
It is believed that she killed herself by suffocating herself by means of a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter’s stepfather, who wrote a letter of confession that ended with, “I used to tie her up and tie her eyes.”
“I didn’t force her sexually.
I feel responsible for her death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: "She's an extremely foreign fetishist and for her victim it must have been terrifying, especially since she was only seven.
This unfortunate story ends with the suicide of the victim.
Worse still is the fact that it is very unlikely that the case would have ended in court if she had not done so."
He added: "I take note of the effects, according to the description of Stephanie's father and mother, her act over the years had on her daughter.
Otherwise, she would have clearly been a promising, successful and happy young woman."
Officials responsible for lost data are indicted
The BBC has learned that the cabinet official, who had lost strictly confidential documents in a train in June, is being charged under the “Public Security Act.”
The man was assigned by the Department of Defense when he lost two extremely confidential documents in a train to Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It is the weakest charge within the law and there is no indication of criminal intent.
BBC defense correspondent Frank Gardner said the action was a surprise to many in Whitehall.
He said: “They would have thought that this would be an internal discussion with the Department of Defense and the Cabinet.”
The employee, whose name cannot be named, is indicted in accordance with clause 8.1 of the law, the clause dealing with the safe storage of information.
The Royal Prosecutor’s Office recommended that the official be charged by the Metropolitan Police because of the highly sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he translated included classified assessments of al-Quaida and the capabilities of the Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was taken from his home to a secret place.
Housing companies see B&B costs in the eye
After the rescue of Bradford and Bingley Bank, British housing companies could have cost more than <0xC2><0xA3>80 million.
The government has made <0xC2><0xA3>14 billion available to protect Bradford & Bingley’s 2.6 million customers.
The interest on this loan is paid by all companies that receive money from investors, including the 59 construction companies.
Adrian Coles, director general of the Association of Housing Companies (BSA), said it was “untolerable” that the companies and their members would have to pay.
The 14 billion loan will eventually be repaid if Bradford & Bingley’s loans are cancelled.
But the interest accrued in the meantime is counted every year to the 700 financial companies that accept deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Program confirmed to the BBC that the 59 housing companies were included in this number.
It is bitter that those institutions that have behaved prudently ... are now called upon to bear some of the costs of those institutions that were far less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It said that any company would have to pay in proportion to the deposits it would hold, and that the companies would have to pay about 18% of the costs together.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that interest on the loan will amount to <0xC2><0xA3>450 million in 2009.
This means that the companies have to acquire <0xC2><0xA3>81 million for the interest of the first year.
Adrian Coles, the director-general of the Association of Housing Companies, told the BBC that he believes this is unfair.
It is bitter that those institutions that have behaved prudently during the real estate boom will now be called upon to bear some of the costs of those institutions that were far less prudent.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since the existence of the records in 1945.
“We will be watching all aspects of this thing over the next few weeks to see what alternatives there are to protect housing companies and their members from potentially significant costs.”
The interest, due in 2009, covers the seven months from the end of September this year until the end of March.
In 2010, interest rates will be due for a full year and that could be almost twice as much.
Since construction companies are bilateral organizations without shareholders, their members will have to pay for the costs either through higher fees or lower interest on savings accounts.
Milk becomes five pence per liter more expensive
The people of Jersey are faced with having to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that it will raise the wholesale price of its milk by another five pence per litre from Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two-pence increase in February, and comes after investigations by a consulting firm were carried out.
Retailers have to decide for themselves whether they want to pass the price increase on to their customers.
Before the price increase in February, the wholesale market price of Jersey Milk last changed in 2002.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh is denied bail
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a bail application by former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, which means she could be arrested if she returns to the country.
Her defenders said the bail court refused to have a businessman blackmailed 50 million Taka ($729,700) in connection with the charge while she was prime minister.
The case is one of several floating charges of corruption against them.
Sheikh Hasina’s longtime political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is set to return to Bangladesh in the coming weeks, but her party, the Awami Alliance, called for the military-backed transitional government to grant her unrestricted freedom first.
The correspondents say that although their detention was granted in order to go abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear within the framework of their release whether they will be able to continue on foot when they return to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers indicate that she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Supreme Court.
“The Supreme Court has rejected Sheikh Hasina’s bail request because it says she does not need to be granted a bail as she is already on suspension of custody abroad to be treated abroad,” her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq said.
We will file a legal appeal against the Supreme Court.”
Their lawyers claim that they need bail to return from abroad to the country in order to prepare for the elections in December.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after October 17, an Awami coalition party chairman said on Sunday.
She was jailed last year after the army-backed transitional government took power, but was released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against each other.
Concerns about the anti-polio initiative in Afghanistan
In the latest anti-polio initiative in Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children have not been vaccinated because of the violence associated with the Taliban, according to the United Nations.
Last week, the United Nations conducted a vaccination program in six provinces.
However, they were unable to reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
According to a UN spokesperson, this was the case despite the Taliban’s promise not to attack or impede the thousands of vaccine workers.
BskyB loses case in ITV case
BskyB has lost its claim against the Competition Commission’s decision to reduce its share in the competing ITV channel.
The Competition Court has ordered BskyB to reduce its stake in ITV from 17.9% to below 7.5%.
The Commission had previously argued that the share of BskyBs distorts competition and allows it to have an unfair influence on ITV.
BskyB acquired its share in 2006 by successfully blocking the acquisition of ITV by NTL, now renamed Virgin Media.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that the purchase of the share of ITV by BskyB raised doubts about the independence of ITV, which prompted the Competition Commission to initiate an investigation.
Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and communications agency Ofcom have spoken out against the purchase.
BskyB argued that the pressure to reduce its share of ITV was an unreasonable and exaggerated measure, in particular because BskyB had announced that it wanted to give up its voting rights.
New Investigation in U.S. Attorney's Case
The U.S. Attorney General has commissioned a special prosecutor to deal with the dismissal of nine U.S. attorneys in 2006.
The occasion was a report by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Justice, which criticised the actions of the administrative staff.
The report drew criticism from White House officials, lawmakers and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was driven by fears that the lawyers had been suspended for political reasons.
Special Investigator Nora Danney will now clarify whether the officials interrogated during the investigation lied to the investigators to obstruct justice.
“Serious allegations including criminal conduct have not been fully investigated or clarified,” Inspector General Glenn Fine said in his report.
The appointment of a special prosecutor with the authority to compel the witnesses to testify was one of his main recommendations.
The conflict began when the Department of Justice removed nine U.S. attorneys from their offices in December 2006.
At that time, the Ministry argued that prosecutors would be fired due to poor work performance.
However, it was later found that the dismissed prosecutors had not been judged worse than many of their colleagues, which prompted many observers to consider the dismissals as politically motivated.
Some of these prosecutors were involved in the prosecution of high-ranking Republican members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate allegations of election fraud by Democrats.
U.S. prosecutors are tasked with investigating and pursuing legal cases for the government.
They may be dismissed at any time, but may not be dismissed for political reasons.
The then head of the Ministry of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, was fired because of the dismissals and eventually resigned.
A number of officials of the Ministry of Justice have also terminated.
In particular, the Inspector General's report has critically addressed Gonzales' role, having borne the "main responsibility" for the dismissals, "abandoned" his leadership role and "extraordinarily disinterested" in the process.
Other officials, including former chief adviser to President Bush Karl Rove, have been criticized for their lack of cooperation with the investigators.
Meat Loaf's Epic Song to Be Honored
The Rockstar Meat Loaf is to be honored during the music award "Q Award" for his epic anthem "Bat Out Of Hell".
The singer, who will accept his special gold award next week in London during the awards ceremony, said he was honored to be recognized.
The song, which lasted nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track to Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
"Coldplay" leads the nominations for this year's award after it came into the narrower selection in four categories.
The editor-in-chief of "Q Magazine" Paul Rees said there would be some songs that go beyond such topics as time and genre, and "Bat Out Of Hell" is certainly one of them.
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a strong voice delivered by Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental part that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was released as a single in the UK in 1979 and reached number 15 on the charts.
However, Meat Loaf's "Bat Out Of Hell" spent about nine years on the charts and sold more than 40 million times worldwide.
Meat Loaf, whose real name is Marvin Lee Aday, has suffered from serious health problems in recent years, one of which was an operation in 2003 due to an irregular heartbeat after he collapsed on stage.
In 2007, he had to cancel concerts due to acute throat inflammation.
It was later revealed that he had a cyst on his vocal cord.
Obscure street in town, often forgotten and possibly soon to sell
New York City has thousands of main roads, alleys, side roads and other bypass roads, some of which are famous and others are just convenient.
Nevertheless, it’s hard to tell even for experienced taxi drivers and long-time locals where Extra Place is, simply because most have never heard of it.
This tiny street is located in East Village and runs north from First Street between Bowery and Second Avenue without reaching Second Street.
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks more like a dusty alley than an actively used highway.
There are also no street signs.
It is practically impossible to find them on a standard road map.
This road, however, has its admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company that recently built luxury buildings on First Street.
It wants to repaint Extra Place to create a clean passage to the shops and boutiques expected in the new buildings.
Among the other admirers is the long-standing neighborhood that says she is fascinated by the short alley, simply because she is one of the remains of the house block’s past.
However, the city administration department, which is responsible for the protection and construction of residential buildings and is responsible for the street, has no interest in receiving them.
During a meeting of the Municipal Council’s Land Use Committee this month, representatives of the city administration and Avalon Bay have drafted a proposal for the purchase of the road by the construction company.
Nevertheless, the committee prefers that the road remain in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new plan to be submitted next month, according to Susan Stetzer, the district manager in the municipal council 3.
"Very little space has remained in the possession of the city and we want Extra Place to continue to belong to the city," she said.
"There could be offers on how to repair and operate the road, what could be done by Avalon, but we also want public access to be guaranteed."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that the small road will be repainted with paving and seating, which is designed for, among other things, a cafe to which the company wants to rent space.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was made public for the first time during the session this month.
Michele de Milly, an Avalon Bay spokeswoman, said the company wanted to use the road, but did not necessarily want to own it.
"The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renovate this decayed alley and make it a public meeting point," she said, adding that the city itself had proposed the sale.
Seth Donlin, spokesperson for the Department of Building Protection, said it was actually the city’s desire to sell the street and stressed that the department’s task was to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to its colorful neighborhood The Bowery, Extra Place has retained some of its historical impression.
Some believe that the street got its name in 1802, when a large farm that belonged to Philip Minthorne was divided between his numerous children and a narrow strip of land was claimed by no one.
The back door of the music club CBGB, the punk rock memorial, closed in 2006, opened to the Extra Place and the street is certainly best known as the backdrop for the photo on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
The patch was great, said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who took the photo in November 1976.
The road was full of scraps, lumps and parts of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes.
Some residents, including bloggers writing about the gentrification of East Village, have rejected the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that this public land, as modest as it is, should remain public.
Others have lauded Extra Place as a rarity – a virtually unchanged splitter of the city that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs the blog called "Jeremiah's Disappearing New York" (subtitled "The Book of Complaints: A Bitter Nostalgic View of the Extinct City"), has published part of the city history talk about Extra Place, which was published in the journal "The New York in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote at the time: “Extra Place is a small narrow dead-end street that stays dark even during the day and is characterized by rusted metal doors of warehouses, closed windows and weekly newspapers flying past raindrops.”
With a few exceptions, the street looked exactly like this recently on an evening.
A rat ran through the back of the road, not far from the door that used to lead to the CBGB, where today there is a more expensive clothing store.
Graffiti could be seen on the walls and an empty beer bottle lay on the floor not far from a fresh bundle of packed newspapers.
Some passers-by said they had rarely thought about Extra Place, but suggested that the road might be slightly polished.
Fields added that, in his opinion, some people underestimate the charm of the street in its current state.
The best years of my life, he said, were in the places that were dark, damp and ugly.
Debate on bilingual education: Education in an English-speaking environment
In this edition of "Education Watch", Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of candidates for bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, Senior Research Fellow in Caliphic Studies and Senior Director in Educational Sciences at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs a School Choice".
Addressing the Spanish electorate is a complicated task.
Barack Obama’s proposals on education are a typical example of this.
Obama’s election campaign mentions that “the probability of successful completion of school by African-American and Hispanic students is lower than by white students” – which is correct.
To close this performance gap, Obama’s education plan specifically recommends, among other things, a bilingual transition phase in education for those who first learn English.
Yet the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which places the emphasis on teaching in languages other than English, contradicts his interest in reducing the gap in school performance.
Take Sixth Street Prep, a primary school in eastern Los Angeles, for example.
The majority of students are Hispanic and come from low-income families.
More than a third of students, many of whom have recently been in the country, learn English.
Yet in 2008, astonishing 100 percent of fourth graders passed the state exam in Mathematics at a good level.
Also surprisingly, 93 percent of children from the fourth year of school were rated good in the English exam.
This astonishing success has been achieved by other methods than those preferred by Obama.
Sixth Street School places its emphasis on review and practice, constant control of knowledge and an attitude that does not tolerate exceptions.
In addition, the school practices the approach that the education takes place in an English-speaking environment, which is exactly the point that Obama should observe, according to the head of the school Linda Mikels.
This approach attaches importance to the almost exclusive use of the English language in professional education.
Ms. Mikels, who rejected the idea of bilingual education, told me that the school would have had a remarkable success with a student who had just come from Mexico, 12 months later they would enter the classroom and not be able to recognize him.
“It works,” she said, “it works for us.”
Would Obama take a school like the “Sixth Street Prep” as a model for other schools with a large share of Latin American and other English-learning students?
The school’s achievements would make the answer to this question easy, but the educational political positions within his own party (the national educational associations have long supported the idea of bilingual education) and his own consistent support of bilingual education make predictions about Obama’s unpredictability.
While he agrees with the point that immigrants should learn English, he has recently trivialized the issue by noting that people should stop worrying about the “English-only” legislation.
Instead, he said, "You should make sure that your child can speak Spanish."
If Obama wants to actually close the power gap, he should carefully consider educational models that work, rather than despise and trivialize them.
Oil prices are falling as a result of fears about the economy
The oil price on Monday fell sharply on fears that even the U.S. bailout plan for financial markets could not be enough to revive the economy.
Crude oil terminus trades on the New York Stock Exchange fell 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel in the morning session.
Since last Monday, the price has fallen by more than $20.
Over the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by financial turmoil on Wall Street as well as by strong turbulence in the Gulf of Mexico.
After prices peaked at $145.29 per barrel in July, they fell to nearly $90 per barrel this month to rise again, as a result of enormous uncertainty in the financial markets.
Investors have already expressed concern again on Monday, even though Congressional representatives had announced they would have agreed on a bailout plan over the weekend, which should be the largest in history.
This news was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis was far from over.
In the first last chapter of the growing crisis, according to a government statement on Monday, Citigroup is to acquire the banking business of Wachovia Corporation.
Meanwhile, Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial group Fortis.
According to analysts at Barclays Capital, despite the tense negotiations that took place over the weekend and led to a bailout plan, it has apparently failed to revive the mood in the markets.
As the economic situation continues to deteriorate, demand for goods, including oil, is expected to continue to decline.
Analysts at Deutsche Bank wrote in a statement to investors that forecasts for global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates had become extremely uncertain.
We believe, they continue to write, that the goods markets will also be affected.
“From the perspective of the commodity markets, we are most concerned about whether the U.S. American virus is spreading worldwide, especially to China.”
The bank’s analysts have adjusted their expectations for oil consumption downwards due to weak economic growth for the coming year, and lowered their forecasts for oil and gas prices for 2009 by 20%.
Team record set by series in the second quarter
Defender Shaun Ellis thought he’d seen it all after he’d been up more than anyone else in the jets for the past eight-and-a-half years.
Then on Sunday, he saw the second quarter in which the Jets turned an unsuccessful game into a triumph.
"I've never seen anything like this before," Ellis said.
After a sluggish game between the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals, which matched the bad weather, the second quarter began.
However, when quarterback Brett Favre’s Pass arrived at Lavernues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, it marked the perfect start to an afternoon when their evolving collaboration took a giant step forward.
Favre found Coles in this quarter for two more touchdowns, one time out as an outside defender and the other time 10 seconds before the end of the half-time.
“I wasn’t particularly nervous,” Coles says about the passports that went to Coles.
“He is a super player.
Our vote has voted no matter what people think."
While Favre and Coles were playing catches, the defense quarterback Kurt Warner took apart.
External defender Darrelle Revis caught an unlucky throw and turned it into a 32-yard touchdown.
Libero Erik Smith came to another pass and picked him up.
Linebacker David Bowens lost to Warner.
The last ball loss, forced at Bowens, was probably the craziest.
The Cardinals had captured the ball with 10 seconds left in the game when the Jets recaptured the ball and Jay Feely turned a 20-yard shot into 34 to 0 lead.
These were the most points the Jets had ever scored in a quarter.
When asked to describe the madness, Erik Mangini, the Jets' coach, replied "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
In response to both, as the Jets scored 21 points in the third quarter without scoring a single point, Mangini said: “Believe me, I enjoyed the second quarter more than the third.
A lot of points were scored in a short time."
Excited Gebrselassie breaks his world record
Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia has once again shown why some consider him the best long-distance runner of all time after breaking his own record at the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and becoming the first person to create the 42.2-kilometer race in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the victory on the flat course in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie improved his previous result of 2:04:26 by 27 seconds, which he had achieved in Berlin last year.
Gebrselassie, 35, has thus set his 26th world record in his versatile career, in which he has achieved at least one World Championship title or set a world record on every track from one kilometer to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie missed the Olympic marathon in Beijing, out of fear that air pollution could exacerbate his asthma problems.
Instead, he signed up for the competition in Berlin.
In almost ideal conditions – at sun and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees at the finish – Gebrselassie has won at an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since racers like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya have switched to long distances, the record time for marathon in the last 10 years has fallen by more than 2 minutes, since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won in Berlin in 1998 with the result 2:06:05.
After his victory on Sunday, Gebrselassie announced to the press that he had had cramps in his wade two weeks ago and could therefore not train for a week.
Apparently, he was refreshed after a break and not returned roasted.
"I'm so happy," he told reporters.
"Everything went perfectly.
I resumed the training a week ago and had some concerns today, but in the end everything was great."
He has been criticized – especially in Kenya, Ethiopia’s rivals from East Africa – for orchestrating his races excessively, generally avoiding many of the world’s best marathon stars, relying too much on the race leaders as if it were a track race, and setting world records over the competition.
However, this criticism hardly harms the size of gebrselassie as a long-distance runner.
Accompanied by four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie had reached the centre of the track in 1:02:04.
Two elite runners from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, have continued to challenge brisket after the pacemakers had slowed down.
Just over three miles before the finish, Gebrselassie made his last move to separate from Kwambai, who came second in 2:05:36 and improved his best time by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi became third in 2:07:48.
In women, Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now German, has completed a remarkable year by showing the seventh fastest result of all time with 2:19:19.
The world record of 2:15:25 holds Paul Radcliff from the United Kingdom.
Last spring, the 36-year-old Mikitenko had surprisingly won the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She missed the games in Beijing due to problems described as a back injury, however, she recovered to win in Berlin and improved her best time in her third marathon by five minutes.
She skilfully planned her run by ripping out a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners, but survived after 30 kilometers.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia came second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop from Kenya came third in 2:25:01.
The pride and endurance in the lives of the black population, in a city of a very special kind
Hidden between the expanses of amusement parks around Orlando, a few miles from the sparkling, loud and gigantic drive, lies a quiet city where pride and the complications of African-American culture emerge.
Eatonville, the first completely black town in the country and the hometown of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple to describe as Hurston did in 1935: "the city with 5 lakes, three croquettes, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, more than enough Guaven, 2 schools and no school."
Today it is a pilgrimage site.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to commemorate the most famous author of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet, the city she describes – and which made her a tourist destination by including her in the Florida travel guide produced by the Federal Writers Project at the time of the Depression – is and remains in many ways a place of a very special kind.
Eatonville is as independent, prosperous and private as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with the white man who "knows so little about us that he doesn't know what he's missing."
Even today, in a year in which a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, is calling for an open debate on race relations, many here continue to regret being watched by outsiders.
“We are very careful about how our story is told,” said Hortense Jones, 59, from birth to a resident of the city and a community member of the city’s oldest church.
It must be true."
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is both a historical example of the black movement and a community of nearly 2,400 inhabitants, in which the poverty rate is twice as high as the national average.
It is, on the one hand, a bulwark of literature and, on the other hand, an example of the – sometimes condemned, sometimes praised – black culture of the rural south, which has its roots in American slavery.
It is not surprising that residents here are both proud and on the hat.
And so rightly, the concerns about Eatonville's Image actually started with Zora, as everyone here calls Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world in books that came from the heart and were written in mouth, such as "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes were watching God" (1973).
Five paragraphs in the Florida travel guide changed the city, which is very close to Route 77, a road leading through Florida’s often-forgotten center, to the scenes of black history and human drama.
Freaky as Oskar both in real life and in literature, Hurston led readers to shop for Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then turned to more private affairs.
"Beyond the road to the left," she wrote, "is the brown-white-painted modern school, with its well-kept gardens and playgrounds that Howard Miller always takes care of, even though he can hardly read and write."
She also mentioned the new husband of widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of any kind and what-even-always fits in classrooms."
In just a few hundred words, Hurston thus connected Eatonville with self-government, but also with illiteracy, second marriage, and sex.
This was certainly not a travel guide.
In fact, this was not a portrait that was appreciated by everyone.
“Zora described things as they were,” said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson girls who perpetuated Hurston by quoting the men who sang songs about their beauty that were full of sexual appeal.
She added, "Some people don't like this."
Hurtson is still remembered here as a lively eccentric who regularly returned after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, remembered that when Hurston came to town in need, she did so mostly without warning, in a noisy Chevrolet, smoking and dressed in pants, in a city that even today imagines something about her worthy style of dress.
According to Mr. Franklin, most of the inhabitants were fascinated, while many despised them.
“People were always happy to see Zora,” Mr. Franklin said.
But "she never stayed too long," he added as he was swinging in his chair, on a rear-facing terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized.
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were wasted.
Together with most of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten them.
Although she was once a famous author, a contemporary Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an anonymous tomb in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived.
In Eatonville there was no big commemoration, no public reading in the big style.
"I don't think they understood their contribution to the world or their heritage at all," said Valerie Boyd, author of Wrapped in Rainbows, a biography about Hurston published in 2003.
The turn came in the 1980s.
Orange County authorities wanted to lay a five-lane highway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the slow two-lane main road of the community.
Orlando's suburbs had already pushed Highway 4 through the western outskirts of the city.
The proposal was put forward when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult phase in his history.
Compulsory integration, among other things, had put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the fight against racial mixing brought hatred into the community.
“At that time, a bunch of white boys often came in and they threw oranges and stuff at the people sitting away,” Franklin said.
“There was even a woman who was killed.
They threw a watermelon out of the car.”
In 1955, in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's demand to enforce integration by calling its decision in the Brown case against the school council "disrespectful rather than respecting my race."
Residents today say that while the abolition of racial segregation was positive in some respects, it weakened group cohesion in Eatonville and the self-confidence of its teens.
"Black children were used to being hugged - I remember it - they hugged his teacher in the morning and they hugged his teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and managing director of the Ea's non-profit group.
This could be maintained for so long, she added, until teachers and students no longer came from the same place.
"You didn't embrace his white teacher because he was a white teacher - I mean there's a cultural divide," Ms Nathiri said.
However, civil rights have contributed to the creation of space for further Zora Neale Hurstons – black writers, actors and artists who set out on prejudices, as they did, with positive self-confidence and statements such as: “How can anyone’s conscience become someone’s stranger?
I don't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker set out for Hurston's unnamed tomb and began to fight for the revival of her fame.
Five years later, a much-loved Hurston biography of Robert E. Hemenway was found in the bookshelves, making it a part of the American literary canon.
The long-distance project came at a time when Eatonville’s most famous daughter once again stood in the public eye.
And this time Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a rescuer.
The community began planning a Hurston festival in 1988 to show what the district could destroy with the construction of the highway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and every January many return for the celebration.
A few years later, the district turned away from its road construction plans.
"The plans of a five-lane highway revived the city, accelerated the whole thing with peak speed, arouse real citizen pride," Nathiri said.
Mrs. Boyd put it a little simpler: "Zora saved Eatonville."
Victory against the highway project has contributed to a change in the city’s self-image.
There were more and more train travel, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been going to church here since 1993, and locals began to re-evaluate the past.
Eatonville was included in the nationwide historical register in 1998.
A new one-story library (named after Hurston) opened in 2006 on the newly paved and beautified Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville is still a special feature in Florida: just 6 miles from downtown Orlando, it can sometimes feel like a backstreet in the summer rain, as small as it was when it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(It is 90% black these days.)
Outsiders in search of the history of Eatonville and its significance are often still treated with caution.
For most interviews, prior approval is necessary and certain things — such as the mural of Eatonville’s oldest church, painted by a white man and depicting black men at field work — must not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Mrs. Jones, a bold, confident teacher with a preference for dark red, still fear that their shielded community will be misunderstood.
And yet, at the same time that the Hurston Festival grew larger, an increased degree of home pride was also born.
Young people in particular tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw its entire race: beautiful, with all its problems, neither bad nor better, and as proud, creative and hard-working, stupid and mixed up as any other race and ethnic group in America.
It is the sincere love of this city that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin’s nephew, the 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who intends to return to Eatonville after college to work in the city administration or the police, who he says may need some help.
And even the youngsters, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, have learned to properly describe Eatonville.
“Most people who just walk through here will think, ‘Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others,’” said Alondra Kenon recently on a Sunday after the church.
“But if you actually stop and look at its history for a moment, it’s a very beautiful city.”
Here in New York we speak fluently financially.
At first glance, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the newspaper stands and the huge TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn’t even notice that they are in the middle of a debacle.
They would never believe that over their heads, in the shoe-shaded offices with the glass facades, bankers and hedge fund managers who have the monopoly in New York, every day have had the worst day of horror work since the stock market crash of 1929.
The suppliers are still pushing the metal tea carts along the ramps with loud clappers and transporting tablets loaded with muffins for breakfast sessions.
Latinos are still sneaking around between apartments, like human pack animals loaded with the 50 ironed T-shirts hanging on a yoke-like rod lying on their shoulders.
Office workers are still waiting for their breakfast bag at the dining stalls on the public street, and it is still impossible to get a yellow taxi on a weekday between 4pm and 7pm.
It didn’t feel like a crisis at all until I decided on Thursday afternoon to open a new savings account due to all the global downturn.
Although I had decided to put my duty timely on the quiet late afternoon in my JP Morgan Chase branch, about 20 people were already standing in line.
Not at the cash desks to withdraw or deposit money, but at the customer service desk where regular customers order checkbooks, ask tourists for the way to Macy's mall, and where new customers open accounts.
Most of them, I later learned from Starr, my “personal banker with license,” stood before me for the same reason as I was a snake.
However, unlike me, they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks, in places where they commuted from, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They had withdrawn money from so-called Thrifts (a bit like a construction savings fund), cooperative banks and those local savings banks that only have branches in one state, saying they treat their customers like family.
Last year, 15 of these banks went silently.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with investments in the amount of $327 billion, went into bankruptcy administration and when last Friday New Yorkers drove home over the weekend, Wachovia, another bank that owns savings in the value of $440 billion, was looking for a cashier.
Fearing another crash, the office and store employees who stood in front of me brought their bars to a bank that is considered a safe port, a bank that is responsible for most rescue purchases on Wall Street.
Quite normal New Yorkers have adapted to the flow of financial latin over the past few weeks.
A woman who telephoned in my Chinese tribal supermarket with so much familiarity referred to Lehman Brothers, the bank that went bank, and their shabby-looking CEO Dick Full, as if she were gossiping about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the 50-year-old uniformed concierge of my apartment block, has come down from our usual entertainment topics about Brad and Angelina and my food delivery.
"I now have all my savings in money market funds," she told me after my visit to the bank.
"I've changed, I don't take any more risks."
Muslim graves damaged during right sliding in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, a left-wing leader of the Austrian right-wing Liberal Party of Austria, and Filip Dewinter, a member of the Belgian right-wing Vlaams Belang Party, are taking part in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008, in order to demonstrate against Islam.
They carry signs in the style of traffic signs on which a mosque is depicted, crossed with a red line.
The police accuse right-wing extremists of the grave damage at a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same weekend at which extreme right-wing parties recorded significant gains in the country’s parliamentary election.
In the night from Friday to this morning, more than 90 graves in the cemetery in Traun near Linz were severely damaged in an organized action, according to police.
The perpetrators sprayed Jewish symbols like the David Stern on some of the graves, but criminal officials consider this an attempt to conceal the motive of the extremists driven by hatred for Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is in any way related to the elections.
A spokesperson for the local Islamic community said she was "deeply shocked" by the news of the burial that took place as the religious month of Muslim Ramadan nears its end.
At the same time, a round of conscience research is underway in Austria after the country slipped to the right in yesterday’s parliamentary election.
The FP<0xC3><0x96> and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, the two far-right parties that received almost 30% of the vote, campaigned for a strict anti-immigrant law and some of their electoral claims were criticised by opponents as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, chairman of the FP<0xC3><0x96>, which won 18% of the vote, advocated a ban on headgear and burkas, and even expressed his reluctance to food that is commonly associated with Islam.
In his last address in Vienna, he spoke of a “European brotherhood” to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties want to ban the construction of mosques and minarets with the argument that these political symbols are a continuous Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses, carried out immediately after the election and stating that the far right is the strongest political bloc in the country, indicate that this new development is based on young voters who are worried about their future in the European Union.
Foreign travel barrier for Gary Glitter
Gary Glitter, the glam rock star who has been convicted of child sexual abuse, has been banned from travelling to France and Spain.
Judges imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after informing the controlling authorities that he wants to travel to Spain via France.
The Kent police were granted last Thursday to hang a travel ban after filing evidence to judges of Glitter's pretrial sentences for sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford County Courthouse in Kent, but was represented by the law firm Corker Binning.
A court spokesperson reported: "On Thursday, September 25, the Kent Police in Ashford County Court requested permission to prevent Mr. Paul Glad from travelling abroad to France and Spain until March 25.
Paul Gadd was not present in person."
According to the Register of Sexual Offenders, Glitter, 64, had informed authorities that he wanted to travel abroad.
He must notify the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also notify the police 7 days before his scheduled departure.
Failure to notify the authorities could result in a prison sentence of 5 years.
Kent police said they would not discuss individual cases or glitter’s possible residence in the country.
A spokeswoman for the Kent Police Unit said: “The police in Kent will do whatever it takes to protect children in this country and abroad.”
"In our view, it is easier to control someone who is in the UK because we have a comprehensive system to effectively prevent any potential risks."
“It is Kent Police’s highest concern to protect the people of Kent, and we are working closely together to monitor the behavior of registered sex offenders in the country to minimize any risk that could be posed to the population.
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing 2 girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he was scheduled to take a flight to London.
But he said he didn't feel well and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not let him through passport control and he flew after some and back to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also denied him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and border officials insisted that he return to the UK.
Finally, he arrived at Terminal 3 in Heathrow on 22 August and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge District Court in West London, as Scotland Yard had successfully asked for permission to request that he register as a sex offender.
Glitter had previously been incarcerated in the UK for four months in 1999 for possession of images of child abuse.
According to the Interior Ministry, Interior Minister Jacqui Smith was calmed and satisfied that Glitter was prevented from travelling to France and Spain.
'I welcome the master behind the stage to retain his character', Günter Brauer, photographer.
No paragraphs, no ruffles, no costumes for the performance.
The nature of the great flamenco dancers who give up concentration and dedicate themselves to interpreting to get a relaxed look as a woman or as a man.
On the one hand, artists
On the other hand, personality
I look into private life, into those moments that are foreign to the audience, I know when I can find typical gestures for the personality, the depths of a stolen look or the strength of the hands that are concerned because they are not going to enter the stage.
In his project <0x60>Flamenco-people', the German photographer Günter Bauer presents varied theatrical performances on stage with singers, dancers and guitarists, from which he was little known to the artists.
With this proposal, the photographer creates a special iconography of the flamenco display at different levels.
The exhibition, which is part of the program of the month of photography of Flamenco, <0x60>reflects the international importance of Flamenco, which is becoming increasingly important from day to day', explains the artist and makes it clear that <0x60>Flamenco-people' <0x60>can't be the type of any person who merchs on it, but if you like the photo.
Very normal people on the portraits are artists who are able on stage to convey passion, sadness, joy and thus to move the audience.
In order to capture the personality of these artists, you don’t have to take photos on stage.
Her personality and character is in her heart.
What I was interested in was creating a personal atmosphere that would allow me to capture the characters of the greatest flamenco comedians with the camera.
Inspired by the Cante de las Minas festival, Bauer embarked on a long journey in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a digital camera.
Thanks to the image sorting function of the camera and the existing material, images were created that resemble classical photography.
The use of various stylistic means destroys the classical basis of the image, giving the image the modernity and the idea as the farmer understands Flamenco: 'Music with traditional roots that changes and surprises every day'.
These are not just the dance, the singing or the instrumental play itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, which seduces the audience with his art.
The search for the essential, for a certain thing that becomes visible in the form of hearing, of being, was and was the firm goal of this work, which will be presented in the next time in the gallery of El Fotomata.
Famous figures in Flamenco including Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others belong to the close selection of nearly seventy artists who have been photographed.
The project became an anthology of Flamenco and will soon be published as a book, with all the portraits from the exhibition.
Bauer’s passion for portraits led him to take up this idea two years ago and to realize it as a ‘portrait of the veterans of sport’ (‘SportARTproject’).
Although the concepts of the Flamenco-people project are different, the photographer says I like to photograph people, get to know them and put myself in their state of life, whether for a short moment or a longer time.
I think that in the field of photography, portraiture is the most difficult genre.
You meet or encounter people, people you sometimes don’t even know, or they leave you alone for a few minutes to be able to take a photo.
Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas.'
The collection of the portraits of the flamenco of today entitled <0x60>Flamenco-people' is on display in the gallery of the El Fotomata, which is located in the street called la calle de la Mata and runs parallel to the street la Alameda de Hercules.
Vargas Llosa admits that the Roma he’s writing about is “a decency of customs.”
He does not yet know where the novel takes place and what it is about, but Mario Vargas Llosa is persistently trying to advance the project he is currently working on, a novel with the protagonist Roger Casemant, a nationalist from Ireland who lived in the Congo for twenty years and so on in the Amazon.
Yesterday, during his presence at the festival Hay Festival Segovia, the preferred Nobel laureate admitted that the project he is dealing with is a “collection of customs” and “everything indicates that he should not write the novel”.
“If I were concerned, I wouldn’t have done it, but I will do it and hope to end the novel sometime,” he concluded his participation in the festival, where the ideas, thoughts and words were exchanged. Within the four days he has seen hundreds of writers, people, historians, and journalists.
The author of <0x60>La ciudad y los perros' was one of the most outstanding personalities at the third festival and made predictions.
Vargas Llosa, who won the premium of the festival Hay Festival and gave her voice to most attendees, is compared to the old edition of <0x60>Our mutual friend' and can be seen in the theater Juan Bravo.
He was presented by Félix Romeo and found that he had an audience in front of him, who noticed that the Peruvian, who has a wonderful memory and a great sense of humor, had not been given enough time to go through everything else, and to read it again, as his vocation to the literature, which was unusual.
The Hispanic novelist admitted that there is <0x60>no way' to measure and how to know if books change life, but I refuse to believe that literature is more about mere conversation, more about it than about it, more about it, more about it, more about it, more about it, more about it, more about it.
At the festival in Pozoblanco the weather did not match: bullfighting horses fell out in part.
After the announced bullfighters found that the ground of the square was in poor condition, the bullfighting event, with which the party was to be concluded in Pozoblanco, was moved to yesterday morning.
Thus, with the agreement of Ferm<0xC3><0xAD>n Boh<0xC3><0xB3>rquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, the organizer decided to postpone the bullfighting festival.
Thus, the celebration of the unstable weather was suspended, which is why two of the three celebrations could not take place.
On Saturday it was raining, which is why the second bullfighting event could not be celebrated.
The Matadore group consisted of José Luis Moreno, Curro D<0xC3><0xAD>as and Juan Bautista, who gradually entered the bullfighting parade.
There was only one celebration on Friday.
The winner was Daniel Luque, who cut off three ears and triumphed, after which he had left the passage with pleasure and aesthetics.
On the same evening, Alejandro Talavante met two horns and one ear of the bull, which he had succeeded more by galloping than by his art of bullfighting.
And even worse was El Juli, who passed through the Arena de Los Llanos without difficulty, but also without fame.
After having fought so badly, a large part of the audience reacted to his second fight with Buh calls.
In <0xC3><0x81>lava, two people wanted to escape control of their car, which was loaded with two thousand kilos of hashish.
Morning: five minutes before ten.
Traffic controls in Ertzaintza, in the city area of Armi<0xC3><0xB1>on (<0xC3><0x81>lava).
Two police officers asked the drivers of the car to stop, after which they took the escape.
It seemed as if they would not have to stop with the load of more than two thousand kilos of hashish.
The police chased her and arrested one of the drivers, the 28-year-old man known as A.A.J., as the Basque State Interior Ministry reported.
The arrested person has been charged with drug trafficking and falsification of official documents.
The incident occurred when the traffic police officers of the <0xC3><0x81>lava region had already completed traffic control on the N-1 and drove past the city of Armi<0xC3><0xB1>on.
They decided to stop a car to carry out the route control. The driver did not follow the instructions, suddenly increased the speed and tried to escape the control.
The police started the chase until the car stopped at the edge of the strip after a few kilometers. At that moment the drivers got out of the car to escape over a country road to a forest area.
In the car, an Iveco Daily, the drug dealers transported 2,178 kilos of hashish, which was confiscated by the police.
The front part of the car was loaded with hashish bundles, which were later led to accurate laboratory analysis and weighing the bundle to other police stations.
The officials also noted that the badge was ‘double’, so that it did not match the badge indicated in the car papers, which is why an arrest was also made for the falsification of official documents.
The police of the city of Ertzaintza are continuing the investigations to make the arrest of the second suspect, who, as already mentioned, was able to escape, but also to determine the origin of the seized drugs.
The arrested 28-year-old A.A.J. was brought to a police station for questioning and will be presented to the arresting judge in the next hours.
Actress Heather Locklear was arrested for driving under the influence of an unknown drug.
Actress Heather Locklear, who is known for playing the role of Amanda from the series "Melrose Place", was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California, for driving under the influence of an unknown drug.
A witness watched as she tried to get out of her parking lot in Montecito in a rather strange way, a spokesman for the California traffic police told People magazine.
The witness told in detail that Locklear “pressed through the gas pedal after 4:30 p.m. and made a lot of noise by trying to move her car backwards or forwards from the parking gap, and as she drove backwards, she grabbed her sunglasses several times.”
A little later the witness saw the actress probably didn’t realize at first that Locklear was stopping on a nearby road and getting out of the car.
The witness was the person who notified the emergency service because she had ‘fear of living around Locklears.’
When the police arrived, they found the actress sitting in her car, which stood across the street, blocking traffic.
“They seemed to be unorientated,” they said, so they took the police to a special drug and alcohol center to do a test.
According to a police spokesperson, the actress appeared to be cooperative, excessive alcohol enjoyment was excluded from the first moment. <0x60>As a result of the first observations of officials, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of an unknown drug,' the spokesperson said.
Locklear was arrested under suspicion of driving under the influence of an indeterminate substance that could not be determined and brought to a local detention facility at 7 p.m.
Two months ago, Locklaer was discharged from a clinic in Arizona, where she was treated for anxiety and depression.
Llamazares insists that the Andalusian Association of the United Left be responsible for the Silva case.
Gaspar Llamazares, the chief coordinator of the VL and member of the United Left, has today assured that the regional association for education will be the one who will meet the decision in the case of the former city council for youth and sports of the family house in Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, after meeting with him, was heard back last week.
“In such cases, I am a great federalist, and the Andalusian organization will be the one to take responsibility for it,” said Llamazares, pointing out the party’s approach to the one who so far sits as a city council in the municipality of Seville.
Nevertheless, the chairman of the VL defended the need for ‘transparency’ in the possible investigations of violations of the rules that Silva might have started: ‘The VL always insisted that such cases receive maximum transparency’.
With regard to this issue, he stressed that education <0x60>has a strict ethical code for all public offices'.
<0x60>Sangre de Mayo': Hero Book by Garci
Inspired by <0x60>Episodios Nacionales' by Benito Pérez Gald<0xC3><0xB3>s, José Luis Carci in <0x60>Sangre de Mayo' represents the revised version of the famous Spanish uprising against the French. This is an admirable film in filmography, with about 15 million euros in investment for the film.
In this way, the Cineast has tried <0x60>a lot of personalities and social analysis', which he has always admired on the works of the famous novelist, Carci said today at the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarr<0xC3><0xAD>a at the beginning of a long list of Dar.
<0x60>Sangre de mayo' with a film length of more than two and a half hours, will be presented in cinemas this Friday and later shown on the channel Telemadrid as a four-hour miniseries.
José Luis Garci, a great fan of literature of Gald<0xC3><0xB3>s, assures that thanks to this filming his <0x60>childhood dream' went into fulfillment. This he owes to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago from the Autonomous Community of Madrid.
The total contribution of 15 million, which was given by the Autonomous Community of Madrid for filming, Garci, as he added, offers the <0x60>unique possibility' with the help of decorations and corresponding clothing the image of the <0x60>confused Spain, which was to become the master of brahmanship in the struggle of retaliation VI.
However, the Cineast regrets that one could not count on the funding as with <0x60>Alatriste' or <0x60>Los fantasmas de Goya' (twice as high as with <0x60>Sangre de mayo'), so some scenes from the screenplay with Horacio Valc<0xC3><0xA1>rcel, with whom Garci almost did not collaborated his entire career.
For this reason, Garci, who was also film director in <0x60>Volver a Empezar', was involved in his usual way of working: he put himself on stage with the actors with whom one must first rehearse before one starts to film in the industry and to do in the film, in the part of the one who did not cast.
Many actors he encounters in <0x60>Sangre de Mayo' have to repeat in front of his camera, as in the case of Miguel Rell<0xC3><0xA1>n, Carlos Larra<0xC3><0xB1>aga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, Oscar nominee in four nominations (of which he has won one), is of the opinion and assured that none of the three candidates representing Spain in front of the Academy of Hollywood this year represents a young generation of Spanish filmography <0x60>sirahl' neither <0x60>Sangsole de mayo' nor <0x60>Siete de mesa'.
Garci is not expecting any awards for this film.
“At first you think you’re working for the offspring, later you realize that it’s just for the sake of thriving, and now you’re satisfied if you’ve produced another film,” Garci explains after more than 30 years of professional activity.
Isabel Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n recalls the memory of the dancer from Seville T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Valencia
A flamenco dancer from Seville worships a dancer who is also from Seville.
Carmen T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Valencia: Her father was Catalan (Floren<0xC3><0xA7> T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Ferrer) and her mother Andalusian (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), she was born in the Triana neighborhood and when she was three years old, her family moved to London.
She was a dancer and an expert on oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, she was one of the first women to fight for the emancipation of the woman, such as Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist, vegetarian, and advocated the abolition of the corset, which restricted the free movement of women.
The life of this woman, who left her traces in the dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe in the time between the wars, fascinated Isabel Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n.
“I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested this role to me, which seemed impossible to me.
“We are not trying to tell about her life, but to preserve her spirit,” the flamenco dancer said.
Your dance backgrounds have helped me a lot in Flamenco.
For example, <0x60>The Butterfly Dance' appeared to me as Guajira, or <0x60>The Snake Dance' as Tango.
Her dance was sensual and I’ve been told that my dance is also in this aesthetic area,” she claims.
The stage is expected to have two extraordinary collaborations: with Miguel Poveda, who will sing for Isabel at one of her performances, as he did in <0x60>La puerta abierta'; and with Flamenco master Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to work with one of her ex-students.
Matilde plays T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola, a very mature personality.
I’m happy because she agreed to participate in my work, and I feel very honored.”
The stage also counts on musical composition and the guitarists Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the singing of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Mor<0xC3><0xB3>n; with the percussion of El P<0xC3><0xA1>jaro, as well as the viola of Rafa el Viola and the collaboration with the actor Juanfra J<0xC3><0xBA>arez, he <0x60>always takes on the role of the accompler.
This work also tells in a certain way about the life of this woman, who became known in such far-flung places as India, the United States or Russia and also throughout Europe, although she usually lived in London.
“I wanted to recall her, because I think she is one of the women who have a huge influence on a particular era and whose works today no one knows to appreciate her any less,” Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n said.
The performance will take place today at 8:30 p.m. at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
The publication of the book <0x60>Diario de un poeta icién casado' also includes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of <0x60>Diario de un poeta icién casado' in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), in a place where Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez married Zenobia in 1916, offers a suitable atmosphere to carry out planned activities of the andalusian Council of Culture to the Juleizen.
Thus, <0x60>the Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n' is concluded with the new edition of this work, with the international congress taking place in New York, with the restoration of the house museum of Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez-Zenobia is now international.
The Andalusian Council for Culture has also received eight hundred copies of <0x60>Diario de un poeta recien casado', published by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Pacobo Pérez-Enciso, to make the person and the work of the Andalusian world poet more famous.
The U.S. can't imagine itself without Paul Newman.
“Sometimes God creates perfect personalities.
Paul Newman was one of them.”
This sentence comes from actress Sally Field, who collaborated with him in ‘Sensation Reporter’, and from the then-dominant notion of American cinema, which was left behind, from all of America to Newman with his exciting notion and followed her.
Look at how much it cost him to win the Oscar.
When he retired in 2007.
And he knew he was very sick.
Nevertheless, it was a big hit for everyone.
“What one feels sometimes is much more than an expression, and now I have lost a great friend,” said Robert Redford, crying, “my life and my country were the greatest atrocities of his life.”
No one was afraid of being ridiculed or exaggerated.
As the ‘father’ of cinema and the homeland, he has died in a sad moment, in which fear of terrorists and the collapse of the market reigns, in which the low self-esteem of Americans is on the hopeless quest for reasons to retain dignity.
If there are only a few people who can be admired in this hard time without virtue, you don’t necessarily have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he embodied almost a platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official enemy of Richard Nixon and suffered as well as various losses: from the foundation dedicated to the fight against drugs and in honor of his son from the first marriage, who died of overdose, was founded up to his own brand of homemade and organic products.
All of this is a gift for the country where it took a lot of effort to push against a deadly dietary culture.
A broad wave of wonder strikes hoarsely over Hollywood without regard to nationalities and nationality.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, confirmed that not just one person has died, but the entire era.
The Englishman Sam Mendes, film director and Oscar winner, said that working with Newman was no more or no less than the pinnacle of his career.
Russell Crowe, the evil boy who came from Australia, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
<0x60>And the greatest of us has left,' confirmed George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who dare today to try to live the way Paul Newman lived: getting high demands on justice, leading a responsible private life, far away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even not possible in today’s media jungle.
But there’s someone who’s trying, and Paul Newman was an example of that.
He got divorced once and was married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, whom he was faithful to, although there certainly were many opportunities not to be.
“Why should I eat a hamburger on the street when I have fillet at home?” he joked.
In heaven, he will be proud that his daughters have the same opinion on earth as his fans, which is not necessarily common in America.
“Of all the great roles he played, to none he was as proud as that of the faithful husband, the loving father, the attentive grandfather and the philanthropist,” they say.
For the Olympic Games, the streets in Madrid are lacking.
Yes, the dream of many of us is to host some Olympic disciplines in Madrid, after the failure of 2012, it might be 2016.
But I ask myself, ‘Are we prepared for this?’
Yes, we follow the example of the old streets, I say it's not right!
It was described as the perfect street, and in my judgment, it was the worst street with everything around and on it that there was.
Of course, this is a lot of nonsense, if you were to observe the assessment and I could check it, something like this clearly would not have happened.
But let’s go through everything from the beginning.
The nonsense starts with the ticket pickup, which allows you to go first.
It doesn’t seem bad to me either, but if they already let you go, then they should give you everything (including chip to avoid traffic jams).
Well, no, no.
Here they only let you get the ticket (the first nonsense that consists in just going there) and (after an infinite queue) there is the surprise! The T-shirt was only in size <0x60>S' (a second nonsense because I need size XL)
Where do we actually live?
Or is it so that after the crisis it was decided to buy only small, much cheaper shirts made of less fabric?
So good, things like this are a little bit small compared to the days on the street.
Apart from the fact that you have to go very early to get the chip, there is already a queue of at least 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave the backpack.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible in the case of a road where 11,000 people are expected.
Finally, as expected, the road started and we had not left our backpacks in front of it, even if it had once succeeded, but it would have been harder to get them back.
It also looked like waiting for rain in those 40 minutes, so it was tempting to organize a popular uprising and attack the hut.
I think some 500 people will definitely have pneumonia tomorrow and some like me will not even appear in time for the classification because of this chip I got, I can already think that the output was wrongly stamped.
Of course, if you were to ask me about a perfect street, this street would never come to me.
So I think we’ll be dreaming of a city that’s well prepared for the Olympics for a long time.
Microsoft looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the <0x60>Emerging Technology Conference', hosted by MIT, Microsoft presented the progress of the new imaging system and human interaction, a being of artificial intelligence without much intelligence, which, however, is capable of doing some primitive tasks to the company, such as planning to order a taxi from the system, or in the case of Microsoft.
Thanks to a camera and a form and face recognition system, this ‘receptionist’ can recognize how many people are in the room, who they are, and even remember how they were dressed, listen and understand the keywords of their conversation.
It can also arrange the attendees after the conversations into the groups.
In the presentation video, the receptionist notices a third person, but she understands that this person is not part of the group she is talking to, and that she is also not a company employee.
She asks if the person wants to visit someone here and responds that she will listen soon.
All without the blue screenshot.
Impressive
This is certainly the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, such as the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week, we talked very superficially about Microsoft’s strategy change.
Windows 7 will be faster and not have as many built-in programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if the computers were equipped with the most necessary, instead of filling them with the commercial garbage, they would run five times faster. Man, Steven, that will only be for the few.
It’s all just a setup when you consider that Microsoft added some feature and <0x60>Extras' in Windows versions.
The change of direction is worth it
Microsoft is right, the operating system is gradually losing importance, just like the software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the web, that was part of the theory that it was Google’s first step to competing with Windows.
Many wisely point out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system, as an indispensable part, will always be necessary for hardware and software to work at the same time.
The operating system fulfills the function that can be compared to the function of his wife or husband when it comes to communicating something to his mother-in-law.
That's right.
The system will never disappear, but one must think of its ‘death’, not as an absolute but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is confirmation of this idea.
People pay less attention to the operating system each time, more to the web browser.
The computer is only started to run Firefox, Explorer or Chrome, and every day we spend more time surfing than around the <0x60>windows'.
What is half the use of existing applications in the computer?
Less is more
And Windows 7 needs to be more compact, much more compact than Vista.
Lighter, not so exaggerated, less complicated.
Microsoft’s interest is more about integrating its online services, which can eventually become the alternative to Google.
In reality, they need that, no doubt. I'll give a little example.
I took the photo of this place in Redmond, in one of the recreation rooms for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month.
A sign is attached on the refreshment drink machine: 'Your search. Our future'. It prints a request to use our own online search tool.
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of employees at Microsoft, Google, used the Internet for research.
By the way, last week it was also confirmed that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 has been delayed.
It will not appear at the beginning, but at the end of 2009, rather even in 2010.
Microsoft is looking for a way to bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 to the market at the same time.
Every day, the phone turns into a computer.
The Android and the iPhone are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso had it in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio had this brand in <0x60>Blood Diamond' by Edward Zwick, just like Al Pacino in <0x60>Der Pate' by Francis Ford Coppola. At the same time, it belongs to the clothing of a well-built priest.
When we begin to count the countless star appearances, we can go back to the image of a very powerful man, with a pointed beard that had elevated weights in a walking circus.
Basically, this is a typical male t-shirt made of cotton, sleeveless and waisted.
The English call it 'tank', but Lle Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles outperforms all other brands.
First, because of his great name, although it is called in a narrow circle <0x60>Marcel'. Legend has it that the origin of the name is associated with sport and came from the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
<0x60>La Marcel' stands out all for its excellent cotton, for its distinctive unisex cut and is characterized by a small Belgian flag (almost recognizable) that these t-shirts have as a detail on the neckline.
And note, the Belgian company is not only focused on the production of <0x60>tanks'.
You also have College Sweatshirts, Boxers Retro, Cardigans and Cashmere, Cotton Pants, T-Shirts with Stripes, Babies, Mini Shorts
Modeled and comfortable underwear.
However, it is a shame to use them as underwear.
They are very charming.
“I want to be a young mother; I don’t worry about the candidate.”
Her great appearance with her sister, did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
M<0xC3><0xB3>nica Cruz is beautiful, but full of life.
Currently, the Gruz brothers take their new activity in fashion very seriously.
For M<0xC3><0xB3>nica, this means much more than for some pretty and rich girls who retain their reputation.
She was in Paris at the promotion of the company Mango, relocating her residence there and also makes the presentation of the main prizes in fashion, sponsored by the Spanish fashion house.
Compassionate and shy, winner on the short distances.
Tell us what you are doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection for this fall/winter season, which my sister Penélope and I designed for mango, also I attended the presentation of the second edition of <0x60>Mango Fashion Awards' and took part in the dinner in honor of Valentinos.
A very intense work time that is exciting at the same time.
You work for the Spanish house, what is the basis of your new collection for the fourth season for mango?
My sister, both I am fascinated by the cinema of the 50s and 60s; there we find many ideas.
I like to walk through a city and watch women dress up as they combine their clothes, which I do often.
Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, but in the end, everything meets in one and these areas have a lot in common.
Ever since I was little, I’ve been fascinated by the clothes; I always wanted to go to my grandmother to wrap around in my aunt’s closets and see her clothes.
It was great, almost better than going to an amusement park.
Even later, as a dancer, I always tried to pay attention to the clothes.
You know, we dancers like it so much to have our own style in class and at the rehearsals, to look in the mirror and feel good about it.
As an actress, when you get the costume, you move into the real acting role.
Finally, everything is connected to each other, it is so much respect for the costume designer and their professionalism.
You’ve recently turned 30, haven’t you fallen into a crisis?
- Oh, what?
I feel better than ever, as a 30-year-old I feel good.
I think the woman gets mature, has experience and can enjoy life with fewer mistakes.
I’m not afraid of my biological clock.
I’ve done the things I’ve wanted to do since I was little, and that has given me a lot of inner joy.
So, you're thinking about becoming a mother, aren't you?
I’ve known for a long time that I’m going to be a mother because that’s what my body demands, and I want to be a young mother; I don’t want to miss that.
As for the candidate, I'm not worried.
I will give my child a great sense of happiness and raise him with a lot of love.
As far as film art is concerned, you keep an eye on the works you participated in and the last year was filmed.
That’s exactly what it is and I really want it to be presented to the public.
I, as a woman who comes from the theater, am very impatient and restless and want to have everything at once, which of course cannot be immediately.
I very much wish that ‘La ultima hora’ and ‘En busca de la tumba de Cristo’ would be performed for the first time.
Let's see how you like them
A few days ago, you showed up on the runway with Naomi Campbell, right?
All right, don't say anything like that.
It's not like I went on the treadmill to model.
Naomi Campbell, who I have known for some time, just called and invited me to London to attend a parade for the charity event of her organization <0x60>Women for a Better World' and the clothes we show Nao. I know that two pieces of clothing have been added to our collection for NGommel.
People do not know Naomi’s good heart.
A lot of things are being told about her, and I, as the one she knows, would tell you they're not right.
Nevertheless, I will support this good thing in which she is involved.
She asked me to participate in the parade for this generous thing, but if she comes and asks me to make a handstand, I will do that too.
To support women in the Third World, whatever is needed.
Drivers who may be retarded due to alcohol levels will have to install the ‘Alcolock’.
The authority orders that the driver, who had three official penalties for the alcohol level, install in his car this system, which forbids him to start the car in a drunken state. If he is alcoholic, then the car does not jump on.
The initiative was announced last month in June and is already part of the report of the Attorney General. According to them, it is a pilot project, which will last for a year.
The purpose is the resocialization of the driver, which is why he gets a course for the retraining of traffic behaviour.
In addition to the Attorney General's Office, according to experience, the Ministry of Transport and the foundation of the Technical Institute for Automobile Safety will also participate.
According to statistics, between 30-75% of motorists who were shown to be under the influence of alcohol more than once again took the lead.
The ‘alcolock’ would prevent this because it is a system connected to the car, it measures the alcohol content in the exhausted air and prevents auto-starting when the driver has done an alcohol test; or when an alcohol concentration is detected that is higher than allowed.
It costs more than 1,000 euros, the costs are borne by the person who imposes the sanction.
In this context, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 has shown that cars equipped with these devices prevent up to 65% of violations in the first year after its introduction.
In Spain, it is estimated that 115 lives could be saved each year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to attack this behaviour before it becomes a criminal offence.
And to facilitate their implementation, a legislative reform can be implemented in the usual way, and yet a reform of the basic law is required, which is necessary for the prosecution process.
The device is still available in the Spanish markets, not available in any store, although it has already been installed in some commercial vehicles and public transport vehicles.
Tomorrow, the House of Representatives will vote because of the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, which proposes to install this system in school buses. This has already been done in France.
In Mexico and without <0x60>peep-toes'
With British punctuality, at 5:40 p.m., at the time provided by the program, next to the presidential hangar of Benito Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez de México Airport DF, the plane landed by the Spanish Air Force, with the Prince and Prince of Asturias travelling.
The sun went down, but her rays still forced her to use her hand as a parasol to see the royal couple stepping out of the plane.
Directly on the Gangway: the Spanish Ambassador and other authorities
A few hours before, I had asked a taxi driver on the road if he knew that the prince and princess of Asturias were visiting the city to formalize the official trip.
- Ah, very good, so you can't take people to the airport at this time you're from here or something
No, she's a Spaniard, but she's lived here for a couple of years.
-Oh, very good.
But the Mexican press knows exactly who the prince and princess of Asturias is and knows the importance of the journey.
There are many who are waiting in the airport hangar and on the red carpet, including military protection from 27 naval soldiers, who give the honor salve.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in navy blue, and she, the princess, with long wind-armed hair, without the usual <0x60>peep-toes', may have been told that a storm is expected in DF.
Before entering the hall, they smile and are prepared for the photographers waiting for the official sequence.
At the door of the hotel where they will be housed, one of the four largest in the city, a reporter from Mexican television who likes to make jokes is waiting for them.
The best premium of fashion
There was probably no more suitable place in the world than Paris to present a premium of fashion and there was probably no significantly excellent fashion designer and bonvivant than Valentino.
Mango presents the second edition of the fashion competition <0x60>el B<0xC3><0xB3>ton-Mango Fashion Adwards' to promote and increase international young fashion talent.
This is awarded with a cash prize of 300,000 euros.
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, saw her drawings yesterday in the Mango store window on Boulevard Haussmann No. 54 in Paris and almost wept over the emotional excitement.
By the way, this is the second largest business of the company in Europe and was recently opened. It offers a sales area of 1,335 m2.
The largest store is located in London.
There have been so many events associated with thanking fashion designer Valentino for his jury chairmanship at the competition, which ended with a luxurious dinner at the Opera National de Paris.
In the surroundings of many famous people, the board of directors organized by Mango seemed to be spectacular.
Nati, with his heavy heart broken by the pain of his brother's death, broke down. He wore the suit from the fashion house and put on some jewellery from ELAH, which was breathtaking. He held on to the arm of his son Luis, who is nearly two meters tall and has E.
Andik, the owner and master of the mango house, welcomed the guests and was so a cavalier that he ended up with the Baron von Rotschild without jackets, because jackets they borrowed from the ladies.

1001 Advice against Stress
There is no 1000 more, but a way to forget the chaotic everyday life we are accelerating.
And although there are few, they are all collected in a book that says how to relax. The book comes into the bookstores on September 30.
The alarm clock is a punishment if it rings at 7 a.m., but even worse, the idea of getting back into the hectic rhythm that life demands.
The office is called the tension and the computer that leads to the back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are not one and not two methods to combat the daily exhaustion and the problems of how to turn off from the working world.
However, the number is increasing, no more and no less than 1001.
In addition to yoga poses, classic massages or spa treatments, in the book, Susannah Marriott presents the entire list of options that are tailored to the taste and time of each individual.
The work against stress is called <0x60>1001 Ways to Relax' and so the peace that the book conveys comes into the bookstores of the publishers Pearson Alhambra and DK.
Anyone who believes that it is impossible to achieve peace of mind in areas such as the workplace with the help of personal contacts, this manual refutes such belief.
In addition, the methods are offered, how to stay in contact with nature or the 100% natural recipes that lead to relaxation.
If the adrenaline in your veins no longer rises to restore body balance and stress has become a problem, then the time has come to sit on the couch, turn off the brain and focus on reading.
Talking in sleep
Some kids talk at night
I do not mean those who wake up and tell us something about what happened the day before, but the children who talk during sleep.
When it happens to you for the first time, at best you will be scared, but in reality it doesn’t matter.
This is a positive sleep disorder called speaking in sleep.
It is quite common, especially among children and adolescents.
Surely, more than one of you has been told that you spoke at night.
This phenomenon can occasionally occur (once in life, for example, as during high fever), or regularly (every day, once a week, once a month), the next day the child can remember nothing.
There is not a single reason that causes this phenomenon.
Often, associations are sought with other phenomena in sleep, such as nightmares, panic anxiety at night, enuresis noctura (bedwetting at night), speech in sleep, but there is no reason for this.
As we mentioned earlier, it can be due to very high fiber, stressful situations or overload.
In any case, this is a little researched phenomenon.
The frequency with which it occurs is very variable.
It can be that one speaks quietly in single words, whispers, or it can be quite the opposite (crying, crying, long discussions).
In cases where the expression is very intense, it is recommended to observe the child and consult with a specialist to check if there is a problem that causes fear and occurs in this way.
We have said that it is a positive disorder, so it is not treated, whether it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, with sleep apnoea or with stress).
What you can do is to carry out a series of simple preventative measures:
Do not try to wake the child before going to bed.
So, choose quiet game for the child and avoid stressful TV shows that are terrible and a little too wild.
In the case of nervous children who are advised to relax, relaxation methods can be used to help them get some inner peace of mind.
This helps the child to sleep calmly.
When talking occurs once in sleep, try to keep the calm.
Remember that it is harmless to the child and the next day it will not be able to remember anything that happened.
Useful Advice
Don't wake it up.
This is useless, because the child is unconscious, so you will tear it out of sleep.
Even though the child speaks, it sleeps, so it rests.
Remember, if it turns out to be scary after a couple of appearances, then it is recommended to get advice or find out what the child is afraid of.
If they understand what it says (which is not so usual), the child does not put pressure on them to conduct an interrogation and get more information out.
This way you will not be able to achieve anything, because when the child is asleep, he is unconscious and cannot think about it.
Also, you will hear what it says, but you will not know what it dreams and why it says it, so be careful with the interpretation of the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Maybe, it doesn’t tell the child that you hear that at night and know his secrets.
Not even as a joke.
It causes a lot of fear.
So, don’t worry, it’s nothing bad, it’s a moment that only lasts a few minutes.
Illhouses ... finally
After a long period of thirst, Illhäuser on the playing field is finally on track again.
Without much effort, the Yellow Blacks played numerous goal chances and managed to implement one of them and thus win the game.
The pace of this encounter, at which the attackers struggled to show their ability, was not very high.
After a first attack by the host captain Kauffmann, whose shot just past the corner, Illhäuser should easily dominate the game, and it was possible to alternately only funder flick with a telephoto shot, then brain with a high pass, and romaine with a shot with a shot of A.
The enemy team blocked in the middle of the field and only allowed the lively Riahi to pass at the top of the storm.
The start of the second half should be decisive with first two goal chances fought by Riahi and Temporale, and immediately thereafter with the first goal for the Illhouses by Marais, who was just right to pick up a ball that had been repelled by Diebold in a first attempt.
But the ill-fated goalkeeper should not be able to enjoy his luck for long and be sent to the bank about twelve minutes later, so his teammates had to continue to play numerically inferior.
Denmark, however, did not know how to exploit this, and faced no major problems with an illhaeous elf, who only retreated a little to ‘compress’ their defense, except in the very last seconds of the game, in which the ball passed very close to the latte after a major breakdown.
Sarkozy Meets Angry Fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make another trip to Brittany.
Given the determined attitude of the fishermen, who blocked access to several Breton and Norman ports on Monday, the French President decided to meet at the port of Guilvinec in the Finist<0xC3><0xA8>re on Tuesday morning to meet with their representatives there.
The latter promised to welcome him <0x60>with a constructive spirit', and hoped that he would come up with <0x60>concrete proposals'.
The President’s visit is at the same time as a general meeting of the Crisis Committee, which was set up by the Breton fishermen to implement measures in view of the extreme increase in the price of diesel, which has reached an average value of over 1.14 euros per litre.
According to Elysée Palace spokesman David Martinon, “The president will discuss with them possible solutions to help their businesses become competitive again, and to secure working conditions and the pay of seafarers.”
Sarkozy is eagerly awaited by the fishermen.
On Tuesday morning, they led protest marches in Morbihan and Calvados, causing the quake of almost ten kilometers in length.
The port of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-<0xC3><0x8E>le did not stop.
The Quiberon peninsula was delimited by a barrier.
Already on Monday, sailors expressed their resolve by burning tires and pallets in front of the fuel depots of the ports of Brest and Lorient from the early morning, while demonstrations were held in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement extended to other ports of the Atlantic coast and the Channel, such as Sables d'Olonnes, in Vendée, where the fishermen did not export, or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the manoeuvres of the merchant ships.
The fishermen of Turballe and Croisic in Loire-Atlantique in the evening dissolved the blockade of the significant total refinery in Donges.
Those from Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the course of the meeting at the Ministry on Wednesday before deciding on possible measures.
In fact, the Guilvinec Crisis Committee has to decide on the responses to the movement and its participation in the discussion planned in the Paris Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the leaders of the National Fisheries Committee, which did not support their movement.
'The strike will continue', because 'the fishermen will not give up at any point' and 'do not want to go to Paris', said Liliane Cariou, chairman of Lorient's Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen who do not pay taxes on diesel currently cost around 50 cents per litre, but they believe that the profitability limit of a boat can only be reached with diesel for less than 30 cents per litre.
Paul Newman the Wonderful
The memorable actor from ‘Butch Cassidy and the Kid’ died of cancer at his home in Connecticut at the age of 83.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford or even Sam Mendes said goodbye to film legend and committed actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer keeps its delivery forecasts for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer expects 215 aircraft delivered this year, despite the imminent recession, as a threat to the world economy.
Embraer, the world's fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer, keeps its delivery forecast for 2008 with 215 aircraft delivered, its president Fredrico Fleury Curado confirmed.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer expects a lot from the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft of the order of 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 machines to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider giving away more than 15% of its assets
According to the Financial Times Sunday issue, the insurer American International Group, which has been financially supported by the U.S. Monetary Authority, is considering issuing more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion it has been allocated.
AIG is willing to tax the sale of a large part of its business, beyond its life insurance on an international level, and its retirement provision in the United States.
According to the FT, the AIG Board of Directors met on Sunday evening to check possible sales.
No confirmation could be obtained from the AIG.
The assets that AIG could potentially separate from include its aircraft lease subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in the reinsurer Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate assets and investments in private equity, FT continues.
As regards these sales, no final decision was taken, FT continues.
AIG must make the sales as quickly as possible to repay the loans over $85 billion it has been granted by the Federal Reserve, including the risk that the U.S. authorities will receive 80% of their capital and lose current shareholders to the same extent.
Analysis Historical Paris of the Session Historical Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange reported on Monday after the House rejected Paulson’s plan to save the banks, a historic fall in prices: The Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a loss that had never been there of nearly 800 points, and Tuesday’s 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) fell by 777.68 points to 10.365.45 points.
In terms of points, it was the strongest case in its history (684.81 points) recorded earlier on September 17, 2001, the day of the trade decline following the September 11 terrorist attacks.
According to the final release figures, the Nasdag index, mainly technology, fell by 199.61 points to 1,983.73, and the widely distributed Standard&Poors 500 index by 8.81% (106.85 points) to 1,106.55 points.
After the unexpected rejection of the bank bailout plan by the Chamber of Deputies, which was to allow some stability in the markets again, Wall Street collapsed, which had already been hit at the beginning of the quarter.
With 228 votes in favour and 205 in favour, MEPs refused Secretary of Finance Henry Paulson the funds he had requested.
Nearly two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
“Here is a bad picture being circulated that shows Congress is unable to accept a plan,” said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
“This shows how much the market counted on this plan,” she added, and fears that a project adopted in several days will be “too late.”
“If the project is actually doomed to fail (...), it will quickly be the task of the Fed (the U.S. Central Bank, n.d.) and other central banks to get the crisis under control, which would further limit credit conditions,” warned Brian Bethune, Global’s chief economic officer.
And Miss Piegza emphasized, emphasizing the feeling of extreme urgency even more, “that every day that lapses, the ruin of a financial company” in the United States “brings itself with it.”
Following the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, the U.S. authorities planned to acquire Wachovia’s banking business through its competitor Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis suddenly accelerated, leading to emergency measures for banks in the United Kingdom, Benelux countries, Iceland and Germany, a sign that the markets are facing ‘not just an American but a global crisis’.
The market for commodities has grown strongly.
Revenues from the Treasury decreased from 3.632% on Friday evening to 3.827%, and revenues from 4.161% on Friday evening to 4.357% on 30 years.
Obama wins by points in first TV duel
The first debate of the two candidates for the White House on Friday followed another to find out who emerged as the winner, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As expected, the QGs for election both Republicans and Democrats announced their own victory in this television duel, which should be pursued by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen estimates that John McCain’s performance, although quite apparent, was not “brilliant” enough to allow him to stop his decline in election issues five weeks before the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, which published a poll on Saturday, which according to Obama is ahead with five points (49% to 44% for McCain), is of the opinion that the Democrat clearly makes the better figure.
With the still undecided voters, that is, those on whom it now comes, Obama emerged with 39% as the winner from the polls, while according to a CBS poll, 25% of them see McCain as the winner.
Obama should confirm his lead on Thursday with the good performance expected of his competitor Joseph Biden in the first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin.
“It would be a mistake to underestimate them.
She’s got good instincts,” Bill Clinton warned this weekend.
The seventy-year-old McCain did not stop putting his unquestionable experience in the field of foreign policy at the forefront, clearly emphasizing his opponent’s ‘na<0xC3><0xAF>veness’ regarding these issues that were the focus of this first television duel.
“Senator Obama doesn’t seem to understand that...,” he said several times.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and the knowledge to become president," he said.
A point of attack that has been preached in the Republican election campaigns since yesterday.
Obama himself stressed that he represents the future.
He expressed himself briefly and accurately, without letting himself be taken out of the text.
He put his ability in the foreground to make good decisions and to renew the image the world has of the United States.
“McCain still didn’t understand Obama, on the other hand,” he protested this weekend in a democratic election campaign, accusing Republicans of not grasping the full extent of the crisis that is loading the “American off the street.”
“During the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot of things to say about me, but nothing about you,” Obama said in front of 20,000 people who had gathered in flowing rain at an election in North Carolina.
He didn't even mention the words 'middle-sized' or 'workers'. ' The financial crisis gives Obama, who Americans think is most fit to save the economy even on the brink of the abyss, a clear advantage.
“The coming week could be a decisive turning point,” said influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama’s “good economic instincts” to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current crisis is “the final verdict of an eight-year bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and backed by Senator McCain.”
After re-emphasizing that he would probably even manage to lower taxes for 95% of Americans despite the fluctuations on Wall Street, the Illinois senator pointed out that creating a possible energy independence of the country and promoting a system of renewable energies would entail him, along with the introduction of a crane.
McCain, meanwhile, wanted to build a plant of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
The two candidates carefully address the questions raised on the plan to save the financial market over $700 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>470 billion), which was passed by Congress last night and is extremely unpopular with the people.
“Did you notice that an election took place in Minsk?”
On Sunday evening, youth and opposition protesters demonstrated on the main square of the Belarusian capital, in order to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
Several hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening since the closure of the polling stations in Minsk square to protest the fraudulent nature of the parliamentary elections.
Although no result had yet been announced, numerous young people had come to demonstrate against the power of Alexander Lukashenko: ‘The dictator should step down’.
Some admit that they didn’t even choose: ‘What good is it if they do with my voice what they want,’ says one teenager.
They do not believe that the regime, which has shown itself to foreign observers in the best light in order to resume negotiations with the European Union, is ready to take a democratic turn.
The sanctions, including the non-sharing of visas for 40 leading Belarusian personalities and the abolition of certain assets, could be lifted if those elections were judged clean by observers.
According to the opposition, they were not.
“We were excluded from the electoral commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the counting,” said Juri Potemkin, spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous coalition of twelve parties.
This is a cosmetic change, emphasizes Alexander Milinkiewitsch, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-Europe movement, because it is important who counts the votes, and that is the executive.
If members of the opposition enter parliament, then because they were appointed, and not elected.
But their entry into parliament can mean broadcast time on television, meetings in the regions and legislative proposals.'
The opposition is therefore guilty of meddling in the political game, because <0x60>dialogue with the European Union must be opened.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, falls into a crisis and we are not reforming ourselves, we run the risk of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
Well, we want to be independent."
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which has pursued the electoral process, will not recognise the election as valid.
She stresses that the voter turnout figures seem too high, and that the expansion of the voter turnout in advance (26% of the voters of Minsk) has paved the way for any kind of manipulation.
“Did you notice that an election has taken place?” asked the leader of the Social Democrats Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners to be released in August this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five members of the opposition in parliament, namely those who most likely correspond to the government’s ideas.
The silence of the night falls again over the October square.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Election Commission congratulate themselves on their success.
Underwear - From the blood that was back safe
Hema-Quebec celebrated the 10th anniversary of its founding yesterday, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to rejoice, because Hema-Quebec has become one of the safest and most efficient blood banks in the world.
And above all, it has regained public confidence, which had been severely shaken by the scandal of contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As you know, the national blood reserves administered by the Canadian Red Cross blood donation service were infected with HIV and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In view of this drama and public dissatisfaction, in February 1994, the Government of Canada launched a public investigation, initiated by Judge Horace Krever, aimed at bringing light to the circumstances that had led to such a tragedy, and drafting guidelines for such a catastrophic event.
While Judge Krever was still hesitant to submit his report, several provinces at the time set up a committee whose goal was to develop a new system for managing blood cans in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee carried out this task.
According to reports by Gélineau and Krever, two blood banks were established in Canada: Hema-Quebec, which is responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian blood company to supply the other provinces and the two territories.
When Hema-Quebec started work in 1998, only 38% of people had confidence in Quebec’s blood-conserving system, Dr. Décary recalls.
The situation was discouraging.
Through the enormous efforts to improve the safety of blood cans and through work in this area over the following years, we have regained public trust," she says, before proudly stressing that by the beginning of 2008, almost 94% of the population of Quebec had confidence in Hema-Quebec.
However, Dr. Décary keeps in mind that ‘trust is something extremely fragile’.
Since its founding on 28 September 1998, Hema-Quebec has been acting on the precautionary principle.
At that time, we experienced the occurrence of numerous cases of the human form of cattle disease in Europe, a new type of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, says this woman, who has been in charge since its founding in 1998.
And we had no idea if this disease could be transmitted through the blood.
So we consulted one of the main guidelines of the reports of Kreber and Gélineau, according to which one applies exclusion measures if one does not know this and if a disease only progresses slowly, as is evident in the case of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is the case by way of a degeneration of the brain.
So in April 1999, no blood was taken from people who had been in the UK for more than a month since 1980.
Well, a few years ago, there was no doubt that this disease was transmitted through the blood.
So this event has shown us that the principle of caution that we applied makes sense.
In 1999, a much more accurate technique for detecting HIV appeared on the market: the nucleic acid tests (NST), which make it possible to detect the presence of the virus itself directly in the blood of the donor, and not that of the antibodies against the virus, as was the case in the tests used so far.
The NSTs made it possible to shorten the incubation time that occurs between the time the person was infected and when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, the specialist explains.
This time could be reduced to a duration of less than a week.
Thus, the risk that certain donors could be infected without knowing it, and one could not recognize this, was significantly reduced.
These improvements made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of transmitting AIDS via a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of getting HIV-infected blood.
“In other words, this means that you would have to distribute 12 million blood cans before someone would be infected with HIV.
Since Hema-Quebec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood cans each year, it would take more than 24 years for a case to occur where HIV was transmitted through a blood can.
I believe that you can feel comfortable with it these days if you get a blood transfusion or prescribe it to restore your health," says the head of management of Hema-Quebec.
“Our challenge for the next ten years is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogen can get into the system.
It was not until last year that the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the Westnil virus, is transmitted through insects through the blood.
We need to constantly monitor," Dr. Décary continues, before stressing that Hema-Quebec must provide adequate supplies in addition to a secure supply.
“The demand is increasing because the population is aging.
Because cancer-fighting treatments are more aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also affects the blood donor network, which, on average, only 3% of Quebec's eligible blood donors belong to.
Every healthy person who is 18 years of age or older and meets the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, that is, six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who provide their blood are not accepted because, for example, they are sick with AIDS or malaria, and anyone who has traveled to a country where malaria is common is excluded from blood donation for one year.
With these 3%, we are able to get an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Lack of supplies is very rare.
But you have to renew the members of this donor network as they get older and can no longer donate blood.
It’s hard to convince people to donate blood, but most importantly, to keep them and make them become regular donors.
Life is so hectic these days that you rarely find the time to spend an hour donating blood,” says Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Quebec delivers not only blood conserves but also human tissue, including bone transplants, heart flaps, eyeballs and skin, which is used almost exclusively for severe burns.
These tissues are examined, processed and frozen before being interspersed at Hema-Quebec, which also manages Quebec’s only public umbilical cord blood bank.
The umbilical cord, formerly considered biomedical waste, contains blood-rich stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
A few weeks ago, we celebrated the deposition of our thousandth umbilical cord blood sample, and we plan to take away more than a thousand each year.
“We should probably start making it available for transplantation at the beginning of next year,” Dr. Décary continues, describing this program of umbilical cord blood loss as very popular.
“Many mothers are convinced they don’t have access to it, because Hema-Quebec lacks the means to offer this complex and costly program in all Quebec hospitals.
Soccer - Impact in the semi-final
Montreal’s Impact took place yesterday, thanks to a 3 to 1 win (4 to 3 with all goals) against the Seattle Sounders in the second and final game of the quarter-final series at Saputo Stadium, where the total death ratio counted, for the semi-final round of the qualifying games of the first U-League.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After a first half without a goal for either side, midfielders David Testo and Rocco Plancentino scored the other goals for the Montreals.
Roger Levesque was the only one to stand in the way of Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Remember that in the first game of the pre- and replay series on Friday impact the Starfire Complex in Tukwila in a suburb of Seattle had a 2 to 1 defeat.
In the semi-final, impact will be measured with the Whitecaps from Vancouver.
On Saturday night, Thunder was able to offset a 3 to 1 deficit by a 4 to 3 victory, but the Whitecaps moved into the semi-finals with a total death ratio of 5 to 4 yet.
Impact will probably face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the game series will be determined today.
In short - Victor by Kovalev
The Canadian team’s number one trio is ready to start the season.
Last night, the unit formed from Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrej Kostitsyn advanced the attack on the Florida Panthers with a storm fire, resulting in a 3-2 victory.
Kostitsyn, the star of the encounter, shot a goal, Plekanec delivered two templates and Kovalev transformed a pass in this victory game, the fourth of the tricolore in six preparatory games.
Kovalev achieved victory by shooting the only goal of the entire shooting range.
“I’m not ready yet,” the Russian warned.
I need another game to make me feel comfortable."
“In the first half, he was too attached to it,” said Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he liked the end of the game.
He received stormy applause.'
Charest bets on the north
The Prime Minister does not rule out initiating elections before the end of the year.
As soon as the general meeting of the Liberal Party was over, Jean Charest went to Jean-Talon in Quebec yesterday, where the new health minister Yves Bolduc (linke) is trying to be elected in today’s by-election.
<0x60>Delivering the course of our last great border in the north': This is the long-term goal that Jean Charest presented yesterday by visual means at the General Assembly of the Liberal Party of Quebec in Levis, fully following the guidelines.
During his lecture, a kind of picture mill was projected behind him.
On three huge screens were shot spectacular images of hydropower plants, mines, viewed from Quebec in <0x60>Google Maps', maps, etc.
A lot of money, like during the election period.
Speaking to the press, the prime minister refused to rule out holding the elections this fall, even though he let his schedule be very full.
The 'Plan Nord' is the fourth element of a 'vision' that the Prime Minister allegedly has for Quebec, namely that of a 'new economic space' that provides for an agreement with France on labour, an agreement between Canada and Europe, and agreements with Ontario.
Although it has recently been frequently mentioned in the Prime Minister’s speeches, the opening of the North – the northern area on the 49th latitude – has never been the subject of a presentation.
The prime minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North is “a jewel of enormous potential”, but did not name a date, no investment sums or precise priorities for the upcoming projects.
At the very least, there are some perspectives on what could be more worked on: especially on hydropower, forestry, but especially in the mining sector, favoured by the growth of emerging economies and the renewal of public infrastructures.
According to Mr. Charests' listing, the North possesses 'nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds'.
This <0x60>area twice as large as France' <0x60>is near us, is in Quebec.
It's not just close to us, it's in us," he stressed, as he clearly shows that he is looking to realize a national founder's dream.
Quebec has grown greatly through its connection to the north, he emphasized: the road to gold in Abitibi, the technique of Quebec, the James Bay.
“It’s ours, it’s our future,” he added after taking a theatrical break to look at the huge map behind him.
The north, 70% of Quebec’s territory, includes part of Labrador, which Quebec has always called for, the prime minister told the press.
“This is a traditional attitude that all governments have pursued.
There is a boundary line on which there has been no agreement for a very long time, if the opportunity arises, I will take that position again on behalf of the government," he said.
“With climate change, we need to rethink our vision from the north,” he said, speaking of the Northwest Passage, which will be accessible all year round due to the melting of ice.
Against this new geopolitical background, the Prime Minister believes that it is almost an obligation to occupy this area.
And the inhabitants of the land, the natives and the Inuit?
The prime minister said the Quebec government would handle them very carefully, and that they would benefit from this project, especially the boys.
Two former ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pecist MP of Ungava) have already initiated discussions in some thirty communities.
A ministerial committee led by Beno<0xC3><0xAE>t Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Land Treasures) occupies an important place, has taken up the work.
The Prime Minister does not rule out a large assembly, ‘not necessarily a summit’, but an opportunity to ‘create a common vision’.
The development of the North will, by the way, be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The plan North will be ‘discussed, regulated and environmentally friendly’, he promised.
Jean Charest described this ‘vision’ as a continuation of those of the Liberal Prime Ministers who were in office before him.
“Like the liberals who were in office before us, we have rethinked to turn the challenges into new ways of growth and development.
This was, by the way, one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which opened on Friday with a large cocktail party to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage’s takeover of the party leadership.
One of the decisions adopted provides for the renaming of the Beauharnois power plant in Adélard-Godbout-Staudamm.
“From Godbout, who created Hydro-Quebec, to Lesage, who achieved the silent revolution and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, to Bourassa, who made the James Bay, our party always knew how to determine the future,” said Jean Charest.
In contrast to the press, he referred to another, this time conservative project, namely the program <0x60>Roads to the North' by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
With regard to the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydropower dam project, Mr Charest stresses that its commissioning is planned for 2012.
“This remains among us, but I intend to be there,” he confided to his party members, which caused those storms.
The prime minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and certainly also in 2009, does not have the opportunity to hold an election this fall, which is possible for him by law.
However, he stresses that his timetable is full, especially because of a Community Council mission in China and a summit between Quebec and New York.
The general assembly of the weekend provided the Liberal Party leader with a platform of nationalist plans, especially from the <0x60>Constitution Goals', which were adopted without further ado: the PLQ particularly calls for the recognition of the <0x60>special Québecs' in the Constitution.
It also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Council of Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunication, and that they have a veto over the decisions made in Quebec.
From the opposition side, the guidelines of the plan Nord were met with scepticism.
The head of the Québécois Party, Pauline Marois, has re-emphasized the policy for the development of North Quebec, which was introduced by the Landry government in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, refused to apply it.
If she had done so, ‘we would have gone much further today,’ Ms. Marois, along with her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election is taking place today), condemned Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Mercure.
The ADQ has voiced support for the adoption of a plan to the north by the government.
"But what we want is that this will not just be a big idea," party leader Sébastien Proulx said in representation for Mario Dumont, who is returning from the holiday today.
Letters - A Destroyed Country
Mr. Vic Toews, former Justice Minister (which is irony) in the Harper Cabinet, was the one who allowed herself to say last summer about Louise Arbour that she was a disgrace to Canada.
This woman, who has waged a never-ending fight for justice and deserves all our admiration to cover with shame, says as much about the people around the Prime Minister as about Stephen Parker himself.
We are dealing here with a government that, as the only one from all the countries concerned, has not brought home its fellow countryman who was captured in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that doesn’t even take into account that Omar Khadr was still a teenager when things suited him.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, breaks its word and lets a child soldier enter it under inhuman conditions.
The only one who goes down to a judicial parody to assess the guilt of the accused.
Let us remind ourselves that especially UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Association of Canadian Lawyers are advocating to bring Omar Khadr home so that he can get a fair trial in Canada.
It is precisely this government that also closes its eyes to torture: it is of little interest that a young adult, after so many years of suffering, will surely be mentally broken forever.
We are not yet aware of it, but here we are experiencing a secrecy of cutting off our rights, our freedom and our ‘democracy’, this word which Harper constantly carries before him like a flag, and which sounds so unspeakable from his mouth.
The time has come, therefore, when there is no morality at all: one may arbitrarily abuse, torture and imprison a Canadian citizen, entirely at the benevolence of a head of government who is still supported only by the minority (may he belong entirely to the minority after October 14th...).
Many voters believe that they will find their salvation in a party that preaches virtue, law and order, but they do not see that this government has given up on what made our country’s reputation and dignity.
The shame, Mr Toews, lies in this statement, and nowhere else.
Free Opinion - The Orwellian Speech by Barrick Gold
In its September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter from Patrick J. Garver, Deputy Director General of the Canadian Gold Mine Barrick Gold.
This confirms, and pursues an Orwellian logic, that the world’s largest gold-winning company sought a six-million-dollar vilification lawsuit against three authors and a small, mediocre publishing house, with the aim of opening a ‘public transparent debate’.
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, then they do not judge on the truth, especially not in the case of libel lawsuits, but on the law.
As expected, this fundamental difference was completely concealed by Mr Garver.
Because for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate is to bring everyone into ruin who dares to represent one of their opposite opinions.
No matter how the trial proceeds, the authors and publishers of Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defense and fight with very unequal weapons against an army of lawyers who are paid out of the almost inexhaustible pockets of the gold mines.
The tactic of these unequal struggles, by the way, is often to ruin the defenders in order to force a consensus arrangement that will make the other side dead and also deter anyone who dares to deal with the issue again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she should have presented her view of things to the public.
Contrary to what is going on and going on in many of the countries where Barrick Gold works, debates in Canada are usually conducted through the exchange of ideas and not through clutter.
So it would have been enough if the gold mines had disclosed their books and files and opened up a real debate, through the newspapers, media, publications and funding of independent test teams that could have brought light to this question.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to have any confidence in public opinion and wipes out the petitions and letters to support the authors of Noir Canada with a hand movement.
Could Mr Garver perhaps explain how he can ask for a 'public' debate at the same time, but at the same time misrepresent the views of this public?
Apparently, in the Vice-President's world, this word covers only the generously paid lawyers, and not the community of all Canadians; a very narrow view of the term.
In a democracy, even offenders have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold doesn’t understand – or doesn’t want to understand – is that the public supporting Noir Canada’s authors and publishers does this mainly because they reject the brutal stance of the gold mines.
This public is ready to listen to and judge Barrick, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not within a framework that many perceive as a snail suit (in the course of the <0x60>public debate' more... Barrick Gold has just made a request to the authors of Noir Canada, not to address them).
Apart from Mr. Garver’s surreal speech, Barrick Gold’s lawsuit is a direct attack on the freedom of academic research and truth-finding that are fundamental to any democratic society.
It completely denies the right to cite credible sources and to discuss facts and interpretations that form the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible in a country like Canada to explore and discuss issues that do not please the rich companies of the world, then who else can do that?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, he could lead it by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has a right to answer.
The university environment to which we belong has long been known to get hold of debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold’s disproportionate lawsuit clearly shows that she, contrary to what she pretends, has no desire for a transparent debate.
This is a loss to the university world, as well as to the public debate, and it will be time for governments to take action to curb these kinds of unjustified lawsuits.
Wall Street Rescue - Democrats and Republicans understand each other
The Bush administration and the top congressmen, Republicans and Democrats alike, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the most comprehensive economic recovery plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan, which aims to stop the financial crisis that has rocked Wall Street for months, has yet to be adopted by the two chambers of Congress.
The main contents are: better control of MPs over the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms to secure the repayment of the public funds used, new provisions to reduce the number of houses seized due to the company's payment residuals, as well as the right to overpay the salaries.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies Nancy Pelosi, and the Republican representative present at the negotiations, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news yesterday, minutes after midnight, after a two-day negotiation marathon.
“We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be market-effective,” Bush administration spokesman Henry Paulson said in a statement.
“Everything was done to protect the real economy and the American people from the Wall Street price crisis,” she said.
“This is the fundamental point: if we don’t do that, the trauma, the chaos and the unrest in the daily lives of Americans will be enormous,” Republican Judd Gregg said.
Negotiations had accelerated over the last two hours, out of fear of the effect that a relapse would have had on the mood of investors.
The deadline that had been agreed was the market opening this morning.
The two U.S. presidential candidates, who only took part in the negotiations lately, were more likely to be in favour of the agreement, but without failing to express their dissatisfaction with the need to meet them in this extreme way.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama insisted on the addition of certain provisions for agreement, especially those that would allow owners to keep their homes, and those that concern the salaries of the executives of the state-saved companies.
“If you ask taxpayers to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of certain people, that is nothing to be congratulated on.
But these measures are necessary," he said on U.S. television.
When asked on another channel if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent John McCain replied: “I would like to know the details first, but I hope so.
“The guidelines I have read [show] that this is a thing that we will all have to digest, and with which we will be able to move forward.
The option of doing nothing is simply not acceptable," he said.
The $700 billion plan is geared towards using taxpayers’ money
It comes 14 months after a crisis, triggered by the placement of a real estate bubble that initially led to the collapse of high-risk mortgage loans (subprime) before expanding to other forms of widespread debt (PCAA), and finally to freeze the financial power and ruin the bank.
It was a group of Republican MPs who last week failed the first attempt at a settlement.
Since the Democrats have accepted that certain “toxic” assets of the oppressed companies should only be secured by the government and not bought, one believes to escape the dead end.
To round out the perspective for everyone in Congress, a provision has also been added that if the government were to make losses with this program within five years, it would then be able to raise new taxes to recover its capital employed.
The new plan envisages the payment of a first sum of $250 billion, to which another $100 billion can be added if the president deems it necessary.
The payment of another $350 billion has to be passed by Congress in a re-vote.
In return for his help, Washington receives shares in the backed companies that make dividends in the event of earnings, and that can sell it again when the storm has passed.
The Federal Government will have the option of suspending the confiscation procedures in respect of the flats linked to the real estate loans affected by this plan, and also of setting deadlines for repayment and settlements to be paid to the executive employees of the undertakings concerned.
The developers of the plan would like the Chamber of Deputies to vote on it today, and the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will get the green light.
In fact, there were more votes against this project yesterday, both on the part of the Republicans and the Democrats.
“Obviously Washington doesn’t understand us,” Republican Scott Garett, a member of the House Finance Commission, told his constituents.
“Yes, we have a big financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one that consists in asking the taxpayers for cash."
Democratic MP Brad Sherman, head of a group in Congress called “the Caucasus of the Skeptics,” represents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred excellent economics professors, including three Nobel laureates, wrote to us to let us know: We ask Congress not to be put under pressure and to carefully consider which path to take," he said.
At the same time, we were once again given proof in Europe that this is a global crisis.
At an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros ($16.3 billion).
The entry of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it would refrain from buying up its competitor, who is in great difficulty, since it has risked 2 billion euros in impounds of the US$2.9 billion.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and ten largest insurers.
"This is not a lost money," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
In order to compensate, we get a right to vote and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what savers and households appreciate now that uncertain times are being announced.”
During this time, on the other side of the canal, the British government was in the process of nationalizing another bank, which was put under pressure by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all current loans from the Bank Bradford and Bringley, of which more than 41 billion (US$75.5 billion) from real estate loans.
Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy up the UK bank’s branches and customer accounts.
After Northern Rock, Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank to be nationalized by the British government since the start of the financial crisis.
Paul Newman (19252008) - Death of an engaged icon
His beauty with the azure eyes was his trump for a long time, no one would say his weakness.
Did the American actor get rid of the narcissistic mirror with the charming smile?
Yes and no.
His sense of refinement, sensitivity and obvious talent have probably kept him away from a position of power that brings the truly terrifying monster to life.
But what a great runner!
Paul Newman, who died on Friday at the age of 83 from lung cancer on his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last American cinema icons of his golden years.
He was less monumental than Brando, whom he resembled and for whom he was a kind of rival on the canvas for a long time, more careful in his acting, certainly even more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the sprung of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often produces wonderful children.
He was born in 1925 in Ohio, the son of a German Jew and a Hungarian-born mother.
From its European roots, one of the glorious faces of the American dream should emerge.
Without excessive ego, extreme quality trait.
For in him a whole country, in love with the self-made man, in the fighter who was injured in the Pacific War, studied acting in Yale in the early 1950s, and then visited the actor's studio in New York, before he also saw success in the theater, in the bathing and in the television.
This man, who fought for civil rights, was also the driver who became Man's second in the 1979 24-hour race, and also a sex symbol, although he lived in a show relationship with actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With him, the unknown facets of this mysterious, restrained, committed and supersensible star, whose mystery will never be completely solved, disappear.
A decent man, in the purest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newmans put movie lovers in taumel this weekend, while all his great roles were played on the dark screen of memories.
More than half a century of ever-changing American film art is going by.
There, the charming cowboy from "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) comes to mind, and the young man who turns his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) back into The Cat on the Hot Roof, which was filmed by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
A much shorter recollection (1990) is evoked to his sensitive Mr. Bridge, who is disturbed in his old age by a wedding that did not fulfill all her promises.
There have been so many other Paul Newmans throughout history.
This criminal, stormy, violent and memorable boxer Rocky Graziano from Somebody Up There Likes Me by Robert Wise, a role that was intended for James Dean, was re-recorded after his death and made Newman famous in 1956.
This sympathetic Ganove in the outstanding The Sting (The Clou), which was awarded the Oscar for Best Film in 1973.
As a bitter and vengeful billiard player in Robert Rossen's wonderful The Hustler (1961),
This face through the ages, that was him.
He's still there.
In his life, epochs come together.
He is best known for his 1977 cult film Slap Shot by George Roy Hill as Reggie Dunlop, the unorthodox coach of an ice hockey team.
His fans found him in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen Brothers in 1994.
With a final role in 2003 as Pat of the Irish Mafia in Sam Mendes' Road to Perdition, the circle closed.
Unlike several film legends who have retired from the film world early enough, Newman should stay in the saddle for a long time, betraying Hollywood, his fortune, his punk, and his concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without humor, as a living challenge to underplaying when he judged his overly expressive performances.
The butterfly was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the roles flown for a long time.
However, he rarely played Sunnyboys as outsiders: neurotics, alcoholics, fairies, or desperates, with whose perfect representation he reflected his sliding and his rebellion.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown pages of his true subtle sensitivity.
His 1968 Rachel (after the novel by the Canadian Margaret Laurence) with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, drew a fine portrait of women full of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott to an overdose, dedicated his 1984 film Harry and Son, a work full of feeling and sadness.
In the flood of honors that swept over Newman yesterday, his close friend and former gunman Robert Redford (who had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, “His presence has improved my life and this country.”
Generousness and joy of life were essential characteristics of the deceased actor.
Apart from his legendary career, a great defender of civil rights, environmental protection and independent cinema, an opponent of Hollywood’s drift, is now going there.
We have probably often seen him standing with his foot in bowls full of vinaigrette, in sauces, pastries or other foods, and this seemed rather tasteless, although we still found it funny at first.
However, the profits from his revenues were in need of his children’s foundation.
Instead of resting on his myth, Newman committed himself to the shot.
He left a letter to his five daughters with these sentences: ‘Always and to the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was an honor to be here.”
And for us it was an honor to be able to pursue the life of such an intelligent and generous American actor.
An exemplary citizen, in the narrowest and broadest sense.
What was produced in the invoice factory of Zuschlag &amp; Co.?
On 8 October, the criminal proceedings against J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Zuschlag and his accomplices will begin.
In particular, the accused is accused of involvement in organised crime, as well as gross negligence and business fraud, and other criminal acts - including forgery of documents.
According to the Public Prosecutor’s Office, the funds lucrative from the tenders were used for their own purposes, while the services provided were often evidenced by counterfeit invoices.
State funds and grants from the self-government - a total of HUF 65 million - are to be partly transferred to the funds of the organization Fiatal Balloldal, partly to the private funds of individuals.
As the investigative authorities announced, fictitious invoices were presented when the tender money was collected, and the associations are also not expected to have complied with their obligations.
According to the indictment, most of the invoices were forged.
The bill blocks were bought at the market by J<0xC3><0xB3>zsefv<0xC3><0xA1>ros, the round seals were made in Kiskunhalas.
The decision on which companies to issue the invoices was decided on that tour north of Lake Constance, to which Istv<0xC3><0xA1>n Lados was sent by J<0xC3><0xA1>nos.
In the course of this "exploration tour" Lados should find pensions and restaurants.
He asked for bills of consumption in order to be able to issue bills for the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the self-government of Budapest, based on these templates.
These invoices are said to have been mostly manipulated by Istv<0xC3><0xA1>n Lados and his accomplice, Andr<0xC3><0xA1>s <0xC5><0x90>ri, the latter being, according to our information, responsible for compiling the relevant reports.
One of the destinations of Lados' "exploration tour" was a beer shop.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and Co in 2003, the catering company is said to have formed the ninety-member group of the Biztos Pont Egyesület association.
But now the head of the company says that such a large group would not have fit into the premises at once.
Another bill, issued in the summer of 2002 to the Jobb Jöv<0xC3><0xB5>ért Foundation, later known as Együtt a Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért, also showed serious form and content errors.
In a guest house in Badacsonytomaj, which has only three rooms and can accommodate no more than ten people at the same time, 130 guests are said to have stayed according to the bill.
The imagination of the accountants was apparently not set any limits as it was about Pigal Kft., a catering company, in whose accounting documents of the customers Jobb Jöv<0xC3><0xB8>ért and Hopp<0xC3><0xA1> do not even appear, according to the prosecution.
As CEO Gy<0xC5><0x91>z<0xC5><0x91> Farkas told hvg.hu, it was immediately clear to him that these were fake documents when documents were submitted to him by the Public Prosecutor’s Office during an interrogation.
"Our company name and tax number were wrongly affixed to the stamp".
In addition to form errors, it was also wrong that the company should have accommodated a hundred people after having a total of eleven rooms that could not accommodate as many people as possible.
Also, the food was listed on the invoice, while the restaurant was no longer in operation for a long time.
The fraudulent invoicers also failed to verify that the Budapest travel agency targeted by them only offers trips abroad, and so they indicated Hungary travel on the cash payment invoice, which is also contrary to the company’s accounting practice.
As the investigations have revealed, they have also included VAT on the invoices, although travel agency services relating to a country outside the EU are VAT-free.
The amount of VAT was incorrect on four invoices issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. to the Jobb Jöv<0xC3><0xB5>ért Foundation, since the company charges only 15 percent VAT instead of 25, but in addition, the employees are issued exclusively machine invoices.
Another mistake that had gone under the "accountants" was that in a case they had indicated "goods transport" as a service provided, although this is not offered by the firm specializing in investment consulting, the public prosecutor's office said.
Further form errors - false invoice format, false stamp - were due to the fact that the invoices issued to Együtt a Thirmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredérdét Foundation, as well as to XXI. Sz<0xC3><0xA1>zadi Kultur<0xC3><0xA1>l<0xC3><0xA1>s Egyesület and Biztos Pont could be exposed as counterfeits.
Likewise, in the case of Ravenna Bt. and the sports camp Kunfehért<0xC3><0xB3>, the managing directors of which advised that the invoices had never been issued.
Another "error" is the falsifiers at the HIB Kft. from Ny<0xC3><0xAD>regyh<0xC3><0xA1>za: This company was at the time (2001) just in dissolving, when the group of the Fiatal V<0xC3><0xA1>rosért Egyesület was supposed to have eaten there - therefore the mass administrator himself stated that the invoices did not.
Deliberately Fake
The other group of accountants are people who were quite aware that they had to lay fictitious bills.
At the request of the Young Left - Ifj<0xC3><0xBA> Szocialist<0xC3><0xA1>k Foundation, the Esély Budapestért Foundation has issued invoices for the Foundation Együtt a Thirmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért, amounting to approximately HUF 4 million.
According to the indictment, the managing director of Collab Kft. was persuaded by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, to issue the fictitious invoices.
Biogate Kft., which is currently also in liquidation, is also supposed to have collaborated with Zuschlag and Co.: In 2003, the GmbH is supposed to have the foundation Jobb Jöv<0xC3><0xB8>ért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny, as well as the associations Atlasz Egyesület and Vörösfeny<0xC5><0x91> Egyesület have not received false invoices.
However, there was also little payment traffic, as the invoices were cancelled immediately after their issuance, which, however, the parties concerned forgot to note in their documents.
The third group of accountants includes persons who are directly contacted by the defendants.
One of them is Ivan Kubatov, the postman of the Ukrainian managing director of Delta Tri<0xC3><0xB3> Ltd., a fuel and vehicle trading company located in Budapest, but not found there.
In the period from October to December 2005, the company is expected to have issued several invoices for the sale of EDV components in the total value of approximately HUF 18 million.
According to the Investigative Authority, Cash Investment Kft., which has been in liquidation since 14 September 2005, has acted as the buyer of these invoices.
The director of this company was a Romanian, to whom the company documents were also to be delivered by Ivan Kubatov, between 2002 and 2005.
According to our information, during the investigations, Kubatov was able to issue invoices on behalf of GmbH. to the associations Atlasz and Hopp<0xC3><0xA1>, as well as to Együtt a Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny and to have cashed their own value.
The companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. are said to have been founded by Romanian masons at Ivan Kubatov’s express wish.
In reality, however, none of these companies were active, which, according to the accused, was due to lack of orders.
Nevertheless, he was able to benefit from the companies: at the request of his accomplice, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who was in charge of preparing the company’s founding documents, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to the associations associated with the grant, such as Atlasz and Y-Generaci<0xC3><0xB3>.
Kubatov is said to have issued 15 invoices totaling HUF 14.2 million on behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Tri<0xC3><0xB3>, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade to the organizations.
The prosecutor’s office assumes that Kubatov could have collected 10% of the invoice amount and VAT in each case.
Kubatov is even said to have abused the company Szi-Beri Bt. for issuing fictitious invoices - in this case, the invoices were attached to the applications of Biztos Pont.
In January 2006, Y-Generaci<0xC3><0xB3>n and Szövetség a Modern Hungary submitted their applications to the non-profit organization of the Socialist Party, T<0xC3><0xA1>ncsics Mih<0xC3><0xA1>ly Foundation (“TMA”).
Both received 500,000 forints each, but these amounts have been used for purposesforeign.
To cover this up, they presented five fictitious invoices of Works Team Kft. to the TMA.
By the way, these invoices were secured during the search of the office of <0xC3><0x81>rp<0xC3><0xA1>d Kemecsei in the Ministry of Education.
At the hearings, some defendants are now counting with a confession on the procedure of the forgery, as they have already been filed before the Public Prosecutor's Office.
A sensation could be if the main defendant J<0xC3><0xA1>nos decides to grant a comprehensive confession.
His previous statements were less detailed, and although he had already pledged to report on everything in detail on several occasions, his confession still stands.
The question remains, then, whether it is in his interest, whether the Socialists have concluded a pact with him regarding the reimbursement of the bulk of the damage caused by HUF 50 million, and whether the surcharge in return is willing to take responsibility.
It is quite possible, however, that supplement is now playing the "injured" after his attempts to alleviate detention and house arrest had been met with deaf ears.
While other criminals who have inflicted far greater damage with economic offenses and have not compensated for them are on foot, or at least under house arrest, surcharges remain denied this possibility.
The Psychology of Overcoming - or Why We're Ready to Pay More
In the case of auctions, buyers tend to spend more and thus overestimate the error message.
Neurologists and economic researchers at the University of New York have now managed to discover the neurological-economic basis of this known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to a study published in the "Science" magazine, people in a competition, such as an auction on eBay, do not want to be beaten and are therefore willing to pay even excessive prices.
The researchers have tried to explore the neurological scheme of this "game" with experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers should play lottery while the other participated in a playful action – in both cases, the active brain regions of the subjects were examined using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
In both games, the participants were able to win money, however, an increased activity of the striatum, a complex below the cerebral cortex, was measured in the losers of the auction, in which overcoming the opponent plays an essential role.
In addition to many other functions, this brain region is responsible for the "self-reward" of the nervous system.
The researchers therefore thought that the price increase could be explained by avoiding an overreaction of the striatum.
In order to support their thesis, the economists in the research group have also undertaken research to track the money.
In this case, three groups should compete against one partner under different conditions.
The control group was informed of the true value of the product, after which they made their efforts.
Another group was also promised a $15 reward in case they emerged as the winner of the game.
The third group received $15 before the auction, which was also lost in the event of a lost game.
So the difference between the two groups was just that the emphasis on one was on winning, while the other was on losing.
However, as evidence of the hypothesis expressed by neurologists, the members of the “against the loss” group were willing to make higher bets than those in the control or the “win” group.
“These results cannot be deduced from any previous economic theory.
This is because they have justified the behaviors observed at auctions so far only with the joy of winning or avoiding risk.
The contradiction between these two theories was resolved thanks to the imaging neurological processes, so we now have a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, professor of economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When should I see a doctor?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary, this chronic liver disease is among the leading causes of death.
The number of infected is estimated to be one hundred thousand in this country, but only seven thousand are being treated, which is because the patients often do not know that they are infected.
Hepatitis is the collective term for infectious liver diseases triggered by various viruses.
The symptoms are often similar - inflammation of the liver and jaundice are common, but the pathogens and diseases differ from each other.
Depending on the pathogen, the hepatitis viruses are spread in two different ways: in hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (for example, through contaminated food or water), in hepatitis B, C and D, the viruses can be transmitted through blood and other body fluids (such as sperm, vaginal secretions or saliva).
Travelers are advised to get vaccinated against viruses A and B, there is no vaccine against virus C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear about two to three weeks after eating the contaminated food and are generally accompanied by discomfort, weakness, abdominal pain, and vomiting.
After that, yellowing occurs on the skin and in the eyes, the stool becomes light, the urine darkens, and the recovery can last up to two to three weeks.
Worldwide, about 1 million people die annually from hepatitis B-induced, far more serious diseases such as liver cancer and cirrhosis of the liver.
The main reason for this is that, according to estimates, only one in ten infected is in drug treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: untreated it can lead to liver cirrhosis and liver cancer.
Most infected do not even know about their disease, since the pathogen secretly destroys the liver cells - in many cases, the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years.
Therefore, timely prevention, such as regular inspections, is essential.
There are three groups in which this disease is more common: those who underwent a blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts, and tattooed.
Currently, the number of people with chronic hepatitis C is estimated to be 200 million worldwide.
Since the disease is already detectable with a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to visit the doctor at the first signs of unknown origin.
Timely detected, the disease is curable, the virus can be eradicated, thereby curing the risk of infection and preventing the development of cancer.
September 30th is the World Hepatitis Day, which was held for the first time by patient representations worldwide in 2004.
The aim of the action is to strengthen awareness of these chronic liver inflammation caused by viruses, their emergence and the importance of early detection.
Do believers have less pain?
As recent research results prove, religious faith acts as a kind of “pain remedy” that is already supposed to have facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University conducted an interesting experiment: It was investigated to what extent faith in God influences human pain, the British newspaper "Telegraph" reported.
In the course of the rather bizarre investigation, 12 believers and atheists each received electric shocks while studying a painting of the Mother of God.
As the results showed, the believers were able to turn off most of the pain.
Using brain scanning technology, it was even possible to prove that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for regulating pain.
The study was the first in a research project, in which, in addition to scientists, philosophers and theologians from various departments of the University participate.
During the test, a flashing device was attached to the left hand, which gave off the electric shocks.
Participants were asked to focus heavily on two paintings: on the one hand an image of the Mother of God, painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and on the other Leonardo da Vinci's "Lady with the Hermelin".
The researchers hoped that the appearance of the Virgin Mary among the faithful would evoke some sort of religious trance, while choosing da Vinci’s image because it was hardly different from the other paintings and was felt as reassuring.
The subjects each spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and during that time received a total of 20 electric shocks in four stages, while they were supposed to look at either the religious or the other painting.
The Catholics reported that they felt “safe” in the presence of the Mother of God, as if they were “saved” and felt “peace and peace.”
While viewing the religious painting, they reported 12% less pain than when they had Leonardo’s work in front of their eyes.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also took part in the experiment, said that similar effects could also be elicited with other, highly effective images also in the atheists, you just had to find the corresponding photo.
“We would have to find an image that triggers very positive feelings, such as a mother or a father,” he said.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
“Practicing faith should change our personality, and it does in many cases,” Wright said.
After these excellent results, only the question remains, what effect would a Madonna image of Leonardo or another comparable painter have on the pain regulation of believers.
Would the high-quality Virgin Mary achieve even better results?
You are what you communicate about yourself
On the occasion of her tenth birthday, Google can rightly claim that she can be found in people’s pockets just as well as over their heads in the sky: she knows where people have spent their vacations, what specialists they go to, and what moves her.
And that’s still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of Google’s CEOs.
Towards skeptics who are plagued by Orwellian horror visions, he points out that these would overlook the very essence of Web 2.0.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Schmidt recently said that Google’s main goal is to collect even more personal data about users and thus get closer to the company’s original goal of “sorting all the information in this world.”
According to Schmidt, after ten years of world-changing work, Google is still only at the beginning of information gathering.
Asked about the status quo in five years, Schmidt said he wished that Google would be able to answer questions like “What should I do tomorrow?” or “What job really suits me?”, but software programs were still not able to do so because they didn’t know enough about the users.
Not all Internet users are aware that in the course of their Internet searches the search terms would be registered, as well as the IP addresses from which they were searched and the pages visited.
For example, the "Personalized Search", which was introduced two years ago, allows the visitor to save his own search history and to access it later, so that the results can be generated much more precisely later, and on the same logic are also based on the so-called "recommendations" and services of the so-called "recommendations" based on the same product.
However, users are wondering what happens in the event of a data misuse – “When you look at what I’m doing” – some are concerned about the Google data monopoly.
In most cases, however, it is rather the potential power represented by the company that excites fear, and less the feeling of guilt or fear of punishment, the pursuit of freedom, or the desire against the power that is repulsed by many Internet users.
However, it is a proven fact that the search terms are not only stored, but also passed on to third parties when the occasion arises, and in these legal cases there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user.
A parade example of this was recently the action against paedophilia in Brazil, in the course of which Google provided the Brazilian government with information collected from the community site called "Orkut" and also made it possible to identify the paedophilia.
However, users concerned about personal rights were still able to breathe in May, when Google successfully sued the FBI together with the civil rights organization EFF: accordingly, Google can be forced to release information to the FBI on a secret request in the future with no point in the Constitution.
(However, the Federal Government has successfully achieved the publication of 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms with reference to the Youth Protection Act passed years ago, however, it has been able to keep the list of individual users, or their web and search terms list on two months.)
So Google’s image remains controversial: Those who do not want to disclose their personal data because they fear the loss of their privacy and privacy through the use of Google’s services, the company grapples with the outrage owed to the conservative companies.
Meanwhile, the American “geek culture” that is present in many countries and enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users alike sees the next generation of “cool entrepreneurs” in them, unlike Microsoft, which is market leader thanks to Windows, although both are struggling for the same goal.
One possible reason for this is that Google does not demand identification codes from its users, unlike Microsoft, and provides its services for free, making an open, constantly updated source code and program package seem far more attractive, youthful and cooler than the official software practices.
On the other hand, the geeks are looking at the problematic relationship between personal rights and the Internet knife-sharp - a relationship that has been put at the centre, especially in recent years, thanks to the term "Web 2.0".
Web 2.0 is about nothing but collaboration, that is to say, the users deliberately leave traces and use the available communication channels, and even if the dimensions are individually different, the main thing remains the same, namely to show itself publicly.
An average teenager can manage his profile on several community portals at the same time - from Facebook via Xanga, he can connect with other services such as Twitter, or music services such as last.fm, and can finally put all this photo into a tracking system.
And a number of other exemplary cases proves: When looking at the party photos of last night, the girlfriend soon finds out who her unfaithful friend has enjoyed it with, or the employee is fired because he has been misled in his blog with all too frankly interfering with his anger.
Those who lead an online life are what they give of themselves – so, for example, one could formulate the basic idea behind the behavior of today’s youth.
And anyone who tries to keep something secret, or even bypass Google’s monopoly, likes to do so – such as with Scrooge, a tool that, while accessing Google’s search engine, deliberately leaves no traces.
Not many people deliberately do not register on community sites so that they are not found, but also the online applications of Google, such as text processing and graphical tools and RSS feeds, can be avoided with alternative versions that are not bound to huge server parks and therefore not the best.
The public, however, is anxiously waiting for Google to show its true face.
With its current value of USD 156 billion, the company is even ahead of IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion), the advertising space of AdWords/AdSense threatens the revenues of the advertising agencies, and the more and more other software companies, the more quickly introduced services of Microsoft.
Critical viewers, however, also find the disturbing counter-pole: for example, the management completely rejected a protest of the employees, after the fees of the company’s own kindergarten were doubled, in addition, the management thought that it would be too expensive to deal with the multiple meals of the employees in 2006, and that Google had to deal with everything in 2006.
The internal regulation of the group is that there is no new service being advertised in advance, but only if it is already available. Nevertheless, the events of the coming months and years could again strongly revolve: while some of the companies, some of them, are concerned with the system of Google's books and magazines, some of them are concerned with the idea of taking out the archive project.
And the fact that Google is building a genetic database, the next generation of Sci-Fi authors is already delivering the substance — for example, “Scroogled,” Cory Doctorow’s famous novel describes in the best Orwellian way a future in which a person becomes appallingly close thanks to Google-related data.
Two teenagers help <0xC3><0x93>zd’s double-murderer remove traces
In connection with the double murder of <0xC3><0x93>zd, the police have now questioned two young people who are suspected of helping to remove the traces, a spokesman for the police commissioner Borsod said on Tuesday.
The young people were conscientious, they are currently being accused of aid.
According to the news agency MTI, they are two girls who defend themselves on their own.
Aid is threatened with a prison sentence of up to five years.
The suspect in the double murder of <0xC3><0x93>zd, a 23-year-old local man, was arrested on Sunday.
The man is under urgent suspicion of intentionally murdering several people out of greed for money.
In the course of the investigation, it turned out that the 23-year-old owed a 53-year-old a larger amount of money.
The suspect, however, refused to pay his debts, so he lured his creditor to a plot in <0xC3><0x93>zd last Wednesday, where he and his nine-year-old daughter were murdered.
According to the MTI, the man planned the act from a long time ago - this also proves the fact that he committed the murders with a weapon hidden at the scene.
Together with experts, the police are now investigating the murder weapon and the circumstances of its use.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange makes a bid for the Prague Stock Exchange
About 200 million euros, or 5 billion Czech crowns, the Warsaw Stock Exchange has offered for the 100% purchase of the shares of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer that Poland had made despite the fact that they were previously excluded from the Czechs as potential owners of their stock exchanges.
The reason for this is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange belongs entirely to the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which, however, wants to sell more than 60% of the papers in the coming months.
According to reports by the Czech daily E15, the offer from Poland includes the highest purchase price ever offered for the Prague Stock Exchange.
As the newspaper reports, so far the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the German Stock Exchange have placed offers.
Petr Koblic, the head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that of all the stakeholders, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would probably be the worst new owners, and he also did not rule out that this could even lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange to be 5-10 billion kroner.
According to the shareholder agreement, 90% of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the Patria Finance Investment Bank with a 25 percent stake, followed by Cesk<0xC3><0xA1> Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the point of view of European newspapers
In their comments on the growing international financial crisis on Tuesday, some leading European newspapers already spoke about "Second September 11".
We owe the global financial disaster to the American president, for example, said "La Repubblica" - the president was not even able to put his own party behind the bill to one that should bring some relief to the frightening situation...
Instead of a “new Pearl Harbor,” as billionaire investor Warren Buffett called it, it would be more appropriate to speak of a “second September 11th.”
Parts of the press in Madrid also located the sin bock in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of political leadership is due to the fact that the world economy is now on the brink of collapse.
The U.S. financial system is in danger of collapsing more and more, and the whole world will suffer from it.
Bush’s plan was not perfect, but now, after the vote in Congress, there is a risk that Washington has no political means to manage the crisis.
The world economy hangs in the air at a time when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism takes place.
One can no longer ignore the threat, for example, the Geneva "Day Indicator" means.
While some states might still be able to provide bailout packages to their bankrupt financial institutions, and save the banks with taxpayers’ money from bankruptcy.
However, if a domino effect is triggered and more banks are complaining, then no further financial injections or other immediate measures will help.
In the long run, EU Member States would have to jump over their shadows and centralise control over the money markets.
More than 100 billion euros were paid out to weakening financial institutions on Monday alone, Vienna’s “The Standard” recalls. Moreover, according to the newspaper, the concerns are increasingly realistic that, according to the Americans, European taxpayers now have to go a little deeper into their pockets in order to get out of the crisis.
So far, the EU has not dealt seriously with the crisis that is now sweeping over the old continents like a tsunami.
While the “rescuers” would not have to immediately “switch” with several hundred billion euros, it would be advisable to note in which case it would be reasonable to touch the taxpayers’ money in order to mitigate even greater damage.
Intelligent car mimics the flight of the Hummels
What would be the best way to develop new technologies to prevent accidents if not to imitate the obstacle sensors from nature?
For example, those of the bees.
At CEATEC in Japan, an astonishing project was presented, in which Nissan engineers from Hummeln were inspired to create new accident-preventing systems.
In collaboration with Tokyo University, Nissan has built the BR23C autorobot-driven biomimetic system, a mini car equipped with the characteristics of the bees, with the aim of supporting the development of a system that avoids any collisions.
In flight, each bee forms its own, oval "private area", which is very similar to our own "protection shield", said Kazuhhiro Doi, Product Manager for Technology PR and Research Development, at the exhibition.
The bee’s composite eye, which can see in any direction and at an angle of over 300 degrees, plays an important role in this.
In order to imitate the function of the composite eye, the researchers came up with the idea of a laser-controlled distance meter.
It identifies obstacles in front of the BR23C in a 180-degree field of view within 2 meters, calculates their distances and sends signals to the microprocessor to the board, which immediately initiates the collision prevention process.
The obstacle is recorded in fractions of a second, and the autorobot immediately changes course, similar to the movement of the bees by rotating the tires at the appropriate angle.
Unlike previous systems, this maneuver takes place purely instinctively.
“If it wasn’t, the autorobot could not react quickly enough to avoid the obstacles,” said Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the autorobot project.
The system must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the innermost and most vulnerable part of the shield – a layer that is still considered inevitable within the accidents currently.
The whole process must reflect the behavior of the bees when they avoid other bees.
And that has to happen in a fraction of a second.
However, the avoidance, unlike the bees, can not take place up, down, or even diagonally - it can only be two-dimensional, and that is only in the direction of the reversibility of the tires.
While the bees here are endlessly open to avoiding other bees, the researchers were only able to use the rotary motion, or acceleration and braking, in the autorobot.
The BR23C contains lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and more energy efficient, and therefore have a longer service life than conventional lithium ion batteries.
Andoh explained that it depends on the instinctive, intelligent response, and less on the processing of the data, and even less on the ability to store it.
This device only needs to process a few inputs per second and respond accordingly.
It does not need to store them, or produce an intuitive, logical response using earlier manoeuvres, so that it constantly requires only a handful of KB memory.
It does not require any gigabytes and megabytes of hard memory.
This is the first step in the development of immediate collision avoidance technology, which Nissan estimates will be in production as standard within the next ten years.
Another application could find the technology in GPS satellite navigation by consciously steering the driver around obstacles and thus leading him to the destination.
A name for the inexpensive child
Now there is a written version of the $700 billion heavy bailout law, which will be applied in several stages and aimed at buying bad loans from banks.
In the first passage, half of the money is to be spent.
In a meeting that ended on Saturday after midnight local time on the east coast, lawmakers came to an agreement on the $700-billion-dollar bailout after several days of debate, Reuters reported.
“We’ve made substantial progress,” said Nancy Pelosi, a Democratic president in the U.S. House of Representatives, and said the deal only needs to be put on paper.
The compromise reached on the bailout package was supported by both presidential candidates - Barack Obama and John McCain.
According to Pelosi, it was not about saving Wall Street, it was about tearing down the ruder of the economy, it was about saving Wall Street.
The written version of the package was released before the opening of the Asian markets, i.e., Washington time Sunday evening at 8 a.m. (Central European time Monday 2 a.m.), but has not triggered a high-altitude flight on the stock exchanges.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will first vote on the bill to stabilize the economy from 2008, then the Senate is in line.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi on Saturday night, and the White House also welcomed the news of the deal.
“We are satisfied with the progress made overnight and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our markets and protect our economy,” White House spokesman Tony Fratto said in a statement.
However, the program deviates from the Bush administration’s original recommendation that the $700 billion should be spent on the purchase of looser, credit-intensive securities at once.
In a first tranche, a maximum of half of the $700 billion amount is to be spent, with $250 billion being immediately available after Congress is expected to vote on the cause on Monday. This amount is to be spent on the purchase of credit-intensive, bad PRAs, and further over $100.
The program is reviewed by its own committee, which also belongs to the President of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the $700 billion depends on another decision by Congress.
Under the law, the Ministry of Finance can also apply a combined tactic: it can simultaneously buy bad loans, mortgages, and mortgage-laden securities, or also other "toxic" loans.
As reported by competent persons of the Ministry, the purchase can be made both in an auction and directly.
The law allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance program in which the Ministry of Finance guarantees the worrying funds, and the companies pay the corresponding fees for the damages to be expected.
Henry Paulsen said: “The law defines the necessary funds so that up to $700 billion can be made available as emergency aid to the American financial system, whether it is for the large-scale purchase of bad funds, their insurance, or the avoidance of a system risk caused by the collapse of a larger trust.”
“We are taking the necessary steps to be ready to introduce the law as soon as it has been signed,” Paulson said.
However, the chiefs of the banks in trouble and now dependent on state aid can expect that their settlements, called in the overseas salopp "Golden Handshake", will be shortened by the government.
Salaries will only be reduced in certain cases, and these reductions will depend on how the Ministry of Finance assists in each case.
The reduction essentially means that if the Ministry purchases within the framework of an auction, the “Golden Handshake” will be taxed, unless the bank manager is deferred to retirement.
In the event of a direct purchase of the weak loans, the government will turn on aggressively to ensure that the manager’s salaries are not exaggerated.
The picture also includes that the existing Golden Handshake contracts are not changed - the restrictions only relate to new agreements, so that even more people participate in the program.
This is the first time in American history that cuts in manager salaries are regulated by law, said Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the Finance Committee, of the measure.
The state gains ownership rights in the participating banks, so the risk for taxpayers decreases, as they can also participate as soon as the economy and thus the saved bank improves.
The bill provides for the president to submit a proposal to Congress over the next five years on how taxpayers should get their lost money back from the financial sector.
However, there were skeptics on both sides who expressed their doubts about the plan.
That’s not what American citizens expect of us, the plan doesn’t protect taxpayers’ money at all, says California Republican Darrell Issa.
His Ohio-based colleague, Mary Kaptur, said the measures were pushed forward by the same people who are also responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continue to rise
Like the Central Statistical Office, domestic sales prices rose by 0.1 percent in August 2008 compared to the previous month, and by 12.9 percent compared to August 2007.
Export prices were 1.1 per cent higher than in July 2008 and decreased by 3.9 per cent compared to the previous year’s prices.
Due to price changes in the domestic and export sector, production prices were 0.7% higher than the previous month, and 3.2 percent higher than in 2007.
Domestic sales prices have risen only slightly compared to the previous month, i.e. by 0.1 percent.
Sales prices of the manufacturing industry have also increased little - 0.1 percent - since July.
The biggest price increase in August 2008 was for leather goods (2.8 percent) - primarily for bags and belts - where the increase was 4.6 percent, while for shoes prices rose by 2.5 percent.
Higher prices for plastics and chemical raw materials drove prices for chemicals and production to a high level (1.6 per cent).
A decrease in prices was recorded in crude oil processing (1.4 percent), in electrical and technical equipment (0.9 percent), as well as in wood processing (0.1 percent).
The prices in the paper production, as well as in the publishers and in the printing industry remained unchanged.
In other branches of the manufacturing industry, a price increase was measured between 0.2 and 0.9 percent.
In the major domestic markets of the industry, such as electricity, gas, steam and water supply, prices rose by 0.3 percent in August, primarily as a result of the increase in gas prices introduced on 1 July.
Considering the domestic sales markets of the manufacturing industry in comparison with the previous year, prices in crude oil processing have risen the most (32.4%).
In the metalworking sector, a 13.2% increase was observed, while the increase in the production of food, beverages, and tobacco was 11%.
A drop in prices was observed in the textile industry (2.5 percent) and in electrical and technical equipment (0.3 percent).
The level of taxation in the other manufacturing industries was between 0.6 and 9.1 percent.
In total, prices in the manufacturing industry rose by 10.2 per cent last year.
Prices for electricity, gas, steam and water increased by 18.7 percent compared to the previous year.
In August, the highest price increase was recorded on the domestic retail market in the investment goods sector (0.7 percent).
In the production sectors for consumer goods, prices rose by 0.3 per cent, while they remained the same in the energy and reprocessing sectors compared to the previous month.
The largest increase in prices in August 2008 was observed in the energy and re-use sector (16.8 per cent) compared to the comparison period of 2007.
In the consumer goods manufacturing sectors, a price increase of 6.8 per cent was recorded, with investment goods experiencing a price decrease of 1.4 per cent.
Industry export prices measured in Forint increased by 1.1 percent in August compared to the previous month, but there was a decrease of 3.9 percent in year-on-year.
The domestic currency was 1.7% weaker compared to the euro, 7.1% weaker compared to the dollar, and 7.5% weaker compared to the August 2007 price, even 15.9% stronger compared to the euro.
No more visas to the United States from 2009?
Kinga Göncz sees a good chance that the U.S.-Hungarian visa agreement will enter into force on January 12, the foreign minister told representatives of the Hungarian community in Chicago.
In her view, “it all depends now on whether the electronic immigration or control system is introduced overseas in a timely manner.”
However, she also stressed that there will be no entry permit in the new system, but tourists would have to register in advance.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy is conducting negotiations in Washington from today.
She meets Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, who will hand her the "Middle Cross of Merit with Star" of the Republic of Hungary, and she also holds talks with the foreign policy advisers of Democrat Barack Obama and Republican presidential candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support bailout for banks
Barack Obama and John McCain, the two presidential candidates of the major American parties, pledged their support for the $700 billion bailout package for banks on Sunday, but there are also politicians who demand the resignation of the finance minister.
Congress and government officials announced after days of marathon talks on Sunday morning that they had reached an agreement on the banking bailout package.
The Wall Street crisis, as well as the meltdown of the frozen credit market, have become central issues of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain – both claim to be better suited than their respective opponents to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
After recent polls, Obama was able to further expand his lead thanks to economic issues, while McCain’s high, which has given him the presentation of Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin after the Republican convention, has melted away.
At an election campaign event in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed hope that Congress would quickly pass the $700 billion package bill.
He stressed that the plan also includes those passages of consumer protection that he has supported.
“We need to act now, and responsibly (...) – your jobs, your savings, entire industries, and the stability of the entire economy are threatened,” he said in front of 35,000 spectators.
He has not failed to describe McCain’s economic visions as “obsolete.”
In an interview with ABC, McCain said: “We’ll all have a hard time tackling it ... but doing nothing is definitely not an alternative.”
The Republican senator said the plan also required the setting up of a control commission for the finance minister, as well as restricting settlements for top managers — something he insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain would not have played a definitive role in the negotiations, whereas he, Obama, was in contact with the minister.
On Sunday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that the House of Representatives is likely to vote on the bill as early as Monday.
Press view of the German-speaking area
The right camp is intact, only the voters became more confident within the camp - so commented "Der Spiegel" the weak performance of the CSU in Bavaria.
In Austria, Haider and Co are ready to rule to prevent a red-black coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the online edition of the left-wing German news magazine, Franz Walter analyzes the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article "Bavarian Revolution destroys its fathers".
According to the renowned political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took office.
The Christian socialists have renewed Bavaria for decades – now the modern citizens are turning away from them.
The epoch break is at the same time a problem of Christian democracy, as it is for Angela Merkel.
Surprisingly, the CSU disaster did not come to an end, but on Sunday something came to an end, which, however, was already quite exactly ten years ago: the undoubted hegemony of a state party.
For ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU landed at 47.7 percent, falling below the fifty percent mark for the first time since the fifties.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, i.e. still in the much-quoted Stoiber era.
The modernization carried out by the CSU in the Federal State has finally destroyed their own mothers and fathers.
Sociologists had already predicted this 40 years ago, but it was estimated at a high rate, but without impact, the secularization, the success of education, the influx of East and North Germans into the prosperous regions of Bavaria could not remain faithful to the CSU voters.
Modernization always goes hand in hand with an increase in options, and that has political consequences.
The right camp is intact - only the voters within the camp became more critical and voluntary.
It is striking that in recent weeks, it is precisely the classical citizen groups who have expressed the greatest distance from the CSU: the free professions, the commercial citizenship and voters with a bachelor’s degree such as university degree.
Here, CSU’s support fell to less than 40 percent.
The press (diepresse.com)
The conservative Wiener Tageszeitung reports in its "Who with whom? Party leaders restrained in coalition questions" articles on the chaotic domestic political situation in Austria after the new elections.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to negotiate with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The <0xC3><0x96>VP prohibits the interference of the SP<0xC3><0x96>s in internal affairs.
The BZ<0xC3><0x96> is open to talks in all directions, while the Greens do not yet want to establish themselves in terms of a coalition.
The new elections are over, and now it’s all about the coalition; in the debates on public television, the party leaders barely allowed their cards to be looked at.
SP<0xC3><0x96> Chairman Werner Faymann confirmed his desire to negotiate with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is very likely - in some federal states and in the social partnership, this is already the case.
The question of whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current <0xC3><0x96>VP chief as vice chancellor, opened Faymann.
As he said, voters would have voted down the bowl-molter course.
A repetition of this direction is not in question.
Molterer, on the other hand, has reacted cautiously to red offers.
The cooperation could not be fruitful, he said, when Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
Whether his party is going to the opposition, or to the coalition, is currently completely open, and these issues should be discussed internally.
BZ<0xC3><0x96>-Chef Jörg Haider was open in all directions.
“To prevent red and black, we are ready to take on government responsibility,” Haider said.
J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka: The devil’s circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, in Paris, the European Summit on Equal Opportunities started, which is being organised today by the EU Presidency of the Council of France.
In her speech to the plenary, L<0xC3><0xAD>via J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka, the Fidesz MP of the European People's Party, drew attention, in particular to the segregation of education, as this is one of the most serious violations of the law that Roma children are facing, and this is also the biggest obstacle to their suffering.
The high-level conference was opened by the French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, Xavier Bertrand, on behalf of the French Presidency of the Council, and Vladimir Spidla, EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
The participants included representatives of governments, the European social partners, as well as the most important European law enforcement and civil society organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka pointed out that, in addition to discrimination in job search, Roma would be driven out of the labour market, mainly because of their low level of education.
"The vast majority of Roma youths do not have secondary education, and thanks to poor primary education, only a small proportion of them can achieve a higher education degree."
J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka also stressed that education is a fundamental human right, which has a key role to play in asserting other human rights.
Investments in the early education of Roma children could strengthen the economy of the EU Member States.
In the view of the MEPs, it is important that this relationship becomes aware of a widest possible circle - that is, Roma and non-Roma.
For the sooner a Roma student starts school, the more his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market increase; and through income and turnover taxes they contribute to national expenditure.
"As citizens of the Union, Roma must be guaranteed the right to quality education - bad and segregated education must be stopped," said L<0xC3><0xAD>via J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka.
As the honourable Member has stated, a common, objective and action-oriented approach by the European Union is necessary to speed up the process of de-segregation in the education sector, and it is essential that the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives be properly complied with.
"We must break the cycle of poverty, segregation, and unemployment and give Roma children the democratic opportunity to contribute to the future of Europe as fully-fledged citizens," J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka said.
Since the Congress in Berlin last year, the summit has been held annually with the aim of creating a unique forum for advancing the goals of equality of opportunity and freedom of discrimination at European but also national level, in the sense of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities".
CSU: Grace on time
At the end of October, the fate of the fallen duo Huber-Beckstein will be decided
Despite the election debate, there are no heads at times, at the head of the Bavarian CSU, the personnel debates were delayed.
Party leader Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Beckstein remain in office, the question is just how long this grace will last.
The fate of the tandem after the disastrous 17 percent loss of vote will be decided at the extraordinary party day last weekend.
But the much-formed duo already made it clear that it does not want to stick to her armchairs.
With this, they want to appease the angry faction and the party base, which demanded personal consequences a day after the “Bavarian tsunami” in view of the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - admittedly, under the leadership of his career climax Edmund Stoiber - the Christian-Social Union still reached 60.7 percent, but now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, they were able to secure only 43.4 percent of the vote.
For 46 years, the CSU was a “single ruler” in Bavaria, which generates 18 percent of German GDP.
Although the Conservatives remain the dominant force in the southern federal state, which is also important for the Hungarian economy, they will have to rule in a coalition in the future.
As the first sign of the party’s internal restructuring, the potential successor of Hubers, Vice-President and Federal Minister Horst Seehofer will also be included in the investigation team, which is with the liberal FDP, or the right-wing “Free Voters” in question.
An irony of fate is that with the "Free Voters" list, Gabriele Pauli enters the legislature, whose anti-dusters first exploited the Huber-Beckstein Duo, then relentlessly disentangle the aspiring politician.
The CSU leadership is now concentrating all its forces on the stabilization of Beckstein.
In this transitional process, Stoiber, who has so far pulled the threads out of the background, is taking an active role.The former prime minister and CSU chairman called September 28 the "bittest day of his political career".
On Monday, Huber made some toxic remarks towards the CDU - in his opinion the CSU would have deserved much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a signal to the CDU and thus also to Angela Merkel.
If the CSU, which also contributed a lot to success at the national level in 2005, is not re-established with a joint act of force, Merkel cannot become chancellor again after the September 2009 Bundestag elections.
Merkel, who has not made a fool of her disappointment about the fiasco, believes that the CSU’s loss of ground will not have a negative impact on the big coalition in Berlin.
What is relative, however, is that the injured CSU will not be easier to govern, and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
With 18.6 percent, the SPD achieved its best result in Bavaria since 1946.
Lukashenko opposition: 110-0
In the elections on Sunday, no member of the opposition managed to enter the Ukrainian parliament.
Russian observers believe that this is due to the prosperity and stability in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but the OECD suspects legal contradictions in counting the votes.
The OECD, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the elections.
Although the legislature of the 10-million-strong resident state has come out without opposition for decades, the opposition party, called the "United Democratic Forces" (ODS), gathered before yesterday's elections, "seriously hoped" that in the 2006 elections, the "seriously changed the four times" would be the "thank you, the unsuccessful Lukashenko.
Therefore, the ODS has even withdrawn from the previously planned boycotts.
Ukraine is becoming more and more dependent on the EU, thanks to the rising prices of natural gas imports from Russia. To ease the price increases, even loans were taken up, and the country has also agreed to the sale of Beltransgas, the owner of the country's leading gas pipeline, after which the other parties agreed with the EU as the political leader of the country.
Temporary relaxation was provided by the OECD Election Evaluation Report, in which the emphasis was on the positive movements rather than on the shortcomings - such as the exclusion of one third of opposition candidates from the elections.
However, the OECD Quick Report already on Monday criticized the campaign - according to which opposition parties are not expected to appear in the press - and in particular the fact that the opposition was not allowed to be present in the counting of the votes.
Despite this, the opposition is able to recognize an improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been set free, for example, and Minsk is ready for even smaller confrontations with Moscow, by continuing to recognize the independence of the Aboriginal provinces of Ukraine as one of the most affluent of Ftrah, the Ossetians and the Abkhazians.
“We have taken two steps forward and one step backwards, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun,” Alexander Milinkevich said.
In the opinion of the opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election, a continuation is desirable, although "the powerful have been afraid to let only one opposition candidate into parliament".
The opposition does not plan protest measures in view of the results, but rather tries to clarify the need for economic reform to voters.
"We have to fight with many problems here - the opposition newspapers have to be printed in Russia, the local authorities put us in the way of the sale of stones, but yet I see that more and more people support the change, even the older ones" - said Hertz, with the exception of the Schmied, with the exception of the fact that not even the Penkaist is one.
"Thanks to the debt of the country and the rise of the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before the "social security" that is fueled by the silence of a cemetery begins to crumble," Milinkevich said.
Unlike the opposition politicians, Russian observers have described the elections as democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, Head of Mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the news agency Ria Novosti: "The people believe the facts, not the words". The absence of the opposition is therefore proof of the maturity of the Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on, breakfast will be served before work"
For the first time in the history of the Palazzo Chigi, there are rotating doors for the entrances and exits of the officials.
From now on, the measure will take effect against those eggs that first stamp and then go to coffee drinks during working hours.
The new "Anti-Faupelz Act" was introduced today by Renato Brunetta, Minister of Public Administration and Mauro Masi, Secretary General of the Presidium of the Council of Ministers.
<0x3E><0x3E>"Swivel doors are a means to increase the efficiency of work through a higher attendance rate and more services," said Minister Brunetta.
“Now a new era of responsibility and transparency begins.
This is reformism,” Brunetta stresses once again.
With the Palazzo Chigi, the establishment ends in all the buildings of the Presidium of the Council of Ministers.
Masi says: “The choice of rotatable doors is also of great symbolic value.”
On the part of the officials, there was no resistance, the Secretary-General assured: "This process was supported by all, cooperation came from all sides".
All in all, so now there is no more breakfast during working hours; end with coffee or croissant.
Brunettas advises with a smile: "A good cappuccino at 7 o'clock works wonders".
During a meeting of the Upper Committee of Public Administration (Scuola Superiore della Pubblica Amministrazione)
In Rome, the minister announced that "within three months, the absences of officials have reduced to 50%, that is, 60,000 more people a year are present at work".
He adds that it is necessary to strengthen the efficiency of Italy's public administration.
"Their pay dynamics - according to the minister - have been twice as large in the last 8-10 years as the private sector and far above the inflation rate".
Meanwhile, thousands of officials have come together to counteract the Brunetta Decree as part of the appeal supported by Codacons.
"While the Ministers of Public Service profile themselves with numbers of fewer absences at work - writes the Consumer Center - the people of the 'active slums' are growing uninterruptedly.
In fact, thousands of correct and valuable public service officials have come together to declare war on the illegal norms of the decree."
In particular, the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) is fighting for additional financial compensation for work-related illness, as well as the planned extension of the mandatory home arrest of the sick worker, during which inspection visits can be carried out and other aspects of the new ministries.
Napolitano: "Prevention of work accidents is crucial"
Every day, 2,500 work accidents occur in Italy, three people die and 27 remain disabled for life.
For the year 2007, the Istituto Nazionale contra gli infortuni sul lavoro (Istituto Nazionale contra gli infortuni sul lavoro) confirms that the fatal accidents at work amounted to about 1,200.
These figures demonstrate the seriousness of a phenomenon that almost doubles the number of deaths caused by murder.
Today, the Anmil (Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) in all the provinces of Italy will celebrate the 58th National Day for the Victims of Work Accidents, in order to draw the attention of social institutions and the media to this dramatic situation.
"The worrying data spread by Anmil and the tragic news of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention in the workplace is," President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano confirmed in his communication to the President of the Amil (Associazione nazionale Piegliande mutilati ed in ed.
The head of state expresses his "great appreciation for the constant commitment to prevention in the workplace, to the protection of injured workers, to aiding the families of the victims and to raising public awareness".
"A well-known 'Basta' has risen to this point; understandably in tragedies that, measured in their order of magnitude, trigger some turmoil in the media and public participation. But everyday reality often confronts us with dramatic events, which are thus again in their own dynamism.
Napolitano does not hide that "there is definitely a resource problem: it must be invested decisively in education and information."
The numerous initiatives for a more direct awareness-raising in the school environment by young people who are nurturing themselves in the working world are of particular importance.
It is our duty to pay attention to this phenomenon and not to divert it from its social seriousness; one must put in place and improve a legislative norm.
For his part, the President of the Chamber Gianfranco Fini stressed "how the phenomenon of occupational deaths constitutes an urgent social emergency, which offends the conscience of all of us and forces all institutions to work towards decisive rules that aim to end the problem".
“The data on work-related accidents seem to signal a slight improvement, but this does not rule out that the number of work-related deaths is far too high,” said Pietro Mercandelli, president of Anmil.
"We don't want this 'positive trend' to mean less attention, which is what ultimately causes the tragedy."
"How do you believe that you are basically doing too little to cope with the phenomenon of accidents? You can fight against it through various actions.
In our opinion, stronger controls and inspections are necessary – says Mercandelli; but also stronger measures to educate workers who are already starting in school".
"Another effort is needed," he adds, "in terms of communication and sensitization of public opinion.
But above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers towards a phenomenon that is a social emergency is required.
Mercandelli also spoke of "the progressive deterioration of protection for victims of accidents at work" and advocated the "abolition of the social system against which we have been fighting in recent years".
"The aim is therefore to provide the employee with a guarantee of insurance so that the fate of the victim of a work accident does not depend on voluntary or random donations, which are decided from time to time by a legislator."
Mp3 Player Accused: Risk of Hearing Damage
Listening to loud music over a longer period of time with portable music devices, such as Mp3 players, can lead to permanent hearing loss.
This is reported by the European Commission, which cited the opinion of the Csrseri (Scientific Committee on current and recently identified health risks) of the EU in a report circulated today in Brussels.
“The report shows that 5-10% of those who listen to loud music with portable music devices for at least five years a week for more than an hour per day risk lasting hearing loss.”
“I am concerned that such a large number of young people, who usually put portable music devices and mobile phones at a high volume, irreparably damage their hearing without knowing it,” said Kuneva.
"From the scientific findings, the European Union says, there is a clear risk that pushes for too fast action.
What really matters is to sensitize consumers and make this information a community asset.
In view of these scientific findings, we need to re-examine the existing control systems so that they are fully effective and keep up with the new technology."
In view of the widespread use of portable musical instruments among young people, Brussels had commissioned the independent scientific committee.
"Scientists confirm that they are rightly concerned and that the European Commission, together with the other EU members and those concerned, will now investigate the necessary measures to make children and young people better able to cope with the noise caused by portable musical instruments and hearing aids.
There is already a European standard at the moment that limits the noise level of portable music devices to 100 dB, worrying about the damage that could come from an excessive noise load.
These damages can be very limited, in which solutions such as the reduction of the volume and the length of the noise exposure are addressed.
In its report, the Scientific Committee of the European Union points out that if users of portable musical instruments listened to music for only five hours a week (more than 89 decibels) so that the legal limits already exceeded, which apply with regard to the maximum noise level of the work.
Those who exceed this limit risk the complete loss of hearing within five years.
This represents 5-10% of the users of such devices, the number of which can be estimated to be between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Roma, Alemanno gives the start-up to the "Commission for the Future of the Capital"
We start today, it should be over in March, in June the balance sheet will be drawn up.
This is the course of the work of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome" as set out by the capitol, and the Commission met this morning at the new headquarters behind the Caracalla Thermal Baths.
In six months, President Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will draw up the guidelines for Rome.
Once the project is completed, the City Council and the Municipal Council will evaluate the analyses and projects to be able to present the strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and the mayor Gianni Alemanno in June.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural opinions are represented in it," - emphasizes Alemanno. "It will produce proposals for a development plan for Rome, whose political leaders remain the city and municipal councils.
There is no redistribution of responsibilities, only the will to have a place where one can develop a great project for Rome.
Their task will be completed in March and the Commission will dissolve once again, as such a project must have a timely endpoint.
In June, the mayor announced, we will present the strategic plan in which we will make use of the work carried out by the Commission."
Those who question the Commission's competence because they lack commitment, Alemanno replies: "It all depends on the work that the Commission will do and on the quality of its proposals.
If she, like the Attali Commission in France, delivers quality results – and this will certainly be the case in Rome – then her contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics deals with the everyday problems and emergencies that occur from time to time.
We, on the other hand, want to have a longer period of time in view to work seriously on the development of Rome and the future of the city in a deeper perspective".
The mayor of Rome attaches great importance to clarifying the following: "This Commission is neither a useless institution, nor a wreck: it is absolutely free, it will not cost the Roman citizens a cent and it will make us think; it will employ the best minds of the capital".
According to Alemanno "it is necessary to have a strategic plan that is neither hermetic nor static in order to enable our city to make a quality leap - which it really needs - and thus to take a joint step into the future".
A future, according to the mayor of Rome, which "will not only confine itself to the current municipal boundaries, but will look much further," not only in terms of the role of Rome as the metropolis and political capital of Italy, but also as the future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama – the first anti-American president? Here a statement
A well-known U.S. politician, who is much to be considered independent, wrote: “Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, through his decisions, decimated the U.S. economy and maintained relations with hostile Islam (and still does so today as a privateer)".
The attacks on Obama are getting more and more violent, right now that the elections are approaching.
A lady from Miami wrote in a website: "This person is full of ambition.
Obama is very freaky: he thinks he will get the highest office in a nation that has seen a total of two black governors and five black senators!"
But these attacks don’t really have much to say; they are racist attacks and they don’t answer the voters’ question: will he be a good president? And then there are the polls; everyone says Obama will win with a big lead.
Even in this case, there are people who speak with the heart and not with the head.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deepest south of the United States, wrote in its editorial: Only in the polling booth will we know who the real American patriot will vote for.
Here comes a U.S. mentality that was kept hidden until the very end.
“If you say what you want, then we will decide who we’re going to do our crutches for, whether for Obama or for McCain.”
There are people here who swear that if Obama wins, we will immigrate from America.
Something you’ve never heard of before – only now that the success of the black candidate seems so certain.
In any case, despite all these considerations, the ultimate weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
1,500 people were asked: What mistakes did Bush make during his tenure? 89% answered: the war in Iraq.
America is changing.
The nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent home with a kick in the ass.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack.
However, Iraq remains for the majority of Bush’s weakness.
The one who will take his place is facing a huge task.
The financial collapse also leaves its mark on journalists: in the newspapers you can already feel the cuts. And many accuse the Internet, the "killer" of the press.
Five hundred American journalists were interviewed by the PEW Research Center about their situation and their mental control regarding the future.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, they did not express any genuine concern about the credibility of the information on the competent authorities.
You don’t feel as alone as before.
The problem for American journalists is the money.
For these journalists, the crisis of 2008 is a crisis of an economic model that has been destroyed.
In addition, the big problems are caused by the cuts to the Newsroom, i.e. the space in which the editors work to compose the newspaper.
This is a problem that needs to be solved, according to the interviewed journalists, if you want to prevent traditional journalism, as the general public understands, from shrinking substantially.
A clear but complicated pessimism meets the American journalist today.
Six out of ten journalists and executives of the press believe that journalism is on the wrong track at the national level.
In the local area, it is even 65% for executives.
Printed vs. broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to imagine which direction the web is going.
The main publishing groups pave the way for the Internet, which is considered by many to be the "killer" of the press.
The "economic pressure" felt by journalists has increased by up to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists have admitted to joining the new technology in the hope of "bringing something good to journalism."
The biggest crack in American journalism today is between the editors-in-chief of the newsroom and the reporters who work for them.
56% of editor-in-chiefs at national level are confident that their reporters share their values with them, while only 23% at local level.
Some think it has to do with "safety at work."
Managers who are afraid to lose their jobs within three years amount to 47% at national level.
For journalists, it is 30%.
The topic of "safe work" in the team (our "editors", etc.) is always a topic in the United States.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation like the U.S., with 300 million residents and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and TV stations and internet operators, employers offer as it is popular to them and so it will be a matter of take it or leave it.
The editors-in-chief often get very high wages, while the editor-in-chief can sometimes only get 10,000 euros per month, plus pension and insurance funds.
As for the holiday, the thing becomes complicated: a certain amount of days in the first year, so and so many after the third, to finally reach 15 holiday days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, as they themselves admit, will often "sick" throughout the year.
It is a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: GERICHT IN ROM: DANILO COPPOLA BLEIBT IN GROTTAFERRATA
The President of the Second Criminal Chamber of the Court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the request of the real estate agent, who had requested to be moved from Grottaferrata to Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy in the context of the investigation into the counter-agreement in the case of the acquisition of Unipol-Bnl.
In the course of the trial against him during the last week, his dismissal from house arrest was converted into a duty of residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had asked to allow the real estate agent to be moved from the provincial city to an apartment in the capital.
According to the court, such moves (against which the public prosecutor’s office had ruled) could give him the opportunity to influence his company and obtain evidence accusing him.
The Elite Is in Danger
The phenomenon had already been revealed a few days ago when the House of Representatives voted against the $700 billion savings package of the White House: A large part of Americans were and are more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This is confirmed by yesterday’s New York Times issue, which reports on how the crisis is unfolding in the run-up to the Republican Party, which is increasingly splitting into its old and moderate East Coast soul, which always favors the state institutions and the business community in the face of the world and favors the zen.
This part of the party owes its rise to the voice of the one I mentioned above.
This example just mentioned, however, is only a small part of the major changes that the current economic earthquake announces or even represents: not only in the United States, but also in the whole of the West, and perhaps beyond, will be affected by these.
Both in the countries and in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the long-awaited events that are finally taking shape and coming to light under these new conditions.
The first of these phenomena is the rediscovery, the unheard-of renaissance of the state in connection with a kind of renationalization of the economy.
In fact, the crisis means a decline in banking and financial institutions, which have close ties to foreign countries and at the same time manage an enormous amount of the wealth of private households living in a single state.
This means an immediate political problem for governments: namely, how to behave towards the families concerned, who are also a huge mass of voters.
So the crisis appears economically global, politically it is almost purely national.
Political internationalism in itself seems to have fallen apart and lost its right to speak: the EU has given the illuminating proof of this, which, due to its duplication in various national and international conflicts, knows no common path.
Therefore, everyone now expects the intervention of their own state; rescue plans, new rules, and above all the distribution of relief funds: Since the crisis has become increasingly serious, only the United States is in an economic position to save itself without foreign aid.
And in addition to the means, they also have the legitimacy to use these: thus, two conditions not to be overestimated – under certain circumstances – that no other international organization and no market can rely on in a similar way.
The new emphasis placed on the state-national element is, by the way, in perfect harmony with the ever-increasing importance that has recently been associated in the economy with a closely related sector: territoriality.
Paradoxically, right now, when we were so convinced that we had long since entered a networked whole realm, into an realm of increasingly differentiated technologies, of immaterials, that we had to find out at once how our future would depend more and more on the essential material things.
While they can all be transported from one place to the other in the world, they are still connected to a narrowly defined piece of earth – a territory.
Therefore, one who possesses such a territory is more advantageous than another who lives in a harvest-free, waterless or oil-free area.
Now I come to the second novelty, which, however, requires a short introduction.
Who’s territory, who’s government, who’s politics, says leadership.
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to generate two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, there is the knowledge of the need for perceived leadership, i.e. the need for someone who knows how to manage things.
On the other hand, there is now a wave of disarray over the existing guides, namely those of the economy, which have emerged as inadequate and full of shadow zones.
Finally, there is a deeper richness and, in a certain sense, an even more disturbing aspect: a loss of trust, an intolerance, an image of the pointlessness, a sense of distance, all of which focuses on a whole class of managers in the Western countries.
It seems so that the conviction among large parts of the population is paving the way for the fact that it is not only the actions of the social elite, but already their world of ideas, their Way of Life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, whose salaries the majority represents as always foreign and superior.
The demand for leadership thus feeds underground a branched but powerful movement of the detachment of the leading class and the traditional political establishment. This manifests itself in the unforeseen "revolts" of the voters and in the immediacy of the upheavals of the collective and the upheavals of the contemporaries of the last period of Italy.
One gains the impression that the old elite, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, magazines, intellectual creditors, some would say their format, more and more problems of understanding and therefore less representative of what is going on in financial terms and what is going on in the lower parts of society today.
Given all this, it would be simply exaggerated to speak of a “mass rebellion.”
But keeping your eyes wide open is certainly not.
The super adhesive that lets go up on walls
To defeat the forces of gravity thanks to an adhesive and to be able to climb walls like Superman.
This is the subject of four American research centers, one of which has now apparently almost reached the target.
Using an adhesive applied to an area of only 2.5 sqcm, the researchers were able to fix a 100 kg heavy body on a vertical wall.
The STUDIO – an American journal has published the results of researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the research team is a further development of the adhesives already used, which use a special carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
“The glue principle can be imagined as a series of spaghetti-arranged tubes,” explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the feet of geckos, which are covered with microscopic hares that give the animal a perfect hold.
Tests carried out with various materials such as glass teflon and sanding paper have shown that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the holding capacity of the feet of the reptiles and at the same time "removes seamlessly from the wall," says Liming Dai, a researcher at the Faculty of Tone Engineering Sciences of the Day Universe.
"This material could be used as a transient adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Perhaps already, but researchers are more likely to think of a less fascinating benefit, such as the connection of electrical appliances, because the nanotubes are also conductors of heat and electricity.
Other areas of application could fall within the area of space travel.
So for now, the superheroes have to wait.
THE OTHER ART OF DEVELOPMENT – also the University of Berkeley, California, is dedicated to a new type of adhesive.
In an article by the American Chemical Society, California scientists present an adhesive made of microfibers that clean themselves from the dust by moving on a surface like hair and thus always maintain a perfect adhesion.
Medications: Never take with fruit juice
Be careful of grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, which are consumed primarily in summer due to their refreshing quality and vitamin richness, can cause serious health damage when taken at the same time as certain vital medications, as they can have an extreme effect on the body’s intake.
David Bailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, repeatedly points out the risk of packed fruit juices as well as fresh fruit juices associated with drug intake. During the 236th meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he again suggested that eminent and so-called medicated beef beef beef beef beef.
Grapefruit juice has already been suspected to be responsible for increasing the effects of some drugs such as antibiotics, anti-asthmatics, cardiovascular drugs, anxiolytic and neurological agents, up to toxic levels.
MEDICINAL PRODUCTS – In a report two years ago, the same agency of the drug had warned doctors and patients of the dangers of this mixture, emphasizing that care should be taken in conjunction with drugs such as diazepan or methadone.
It’s not just Grapefruit – according to experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that can inhibit the drugs.
The list of active ingredients inhibited by the fruit juices is long.
Michele Carruba, director of the Universit<0xC3><0xA0> Statale di Milano, said: "Such results are usually immediately forwarded to the various international manufacturers, who are thus free to change consumer information.
Therefore, it is advisable to always read the package leaflet and, if there is still ambiguity, not to be shy to ask a pharmacist or doctor," the expert of the Ansa agency emphasizes.
Nobel Prize in Economics goes to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize in Economics is given to the American Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and the settlement of economic activities.
The 55-year-old Krugman is a Neokeynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is known for his regular articles for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration’s economic and foreign policy.
A few months after the September 11, 2001 attacks, during the days of the Enron collapse, Krugman had claimed in a New York Times headline that this second event was more decisive for U.S. history than the assassinations.
A prediction that received quite a bit of controversy in response and was kept to the economist years later, but today turns out to be quite correct.
“I am surprised and shocked at how quickly the memory of the scandals as part of the collapses of Enron or Worldcom has disappeared from the public eye,” Krugman said in a statement.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a “great economist”, but also a banalizer with a “very aggressive style, especially against the excessive liberalism of the Bush administration.”
Open Office, the third version of the "Anti-Microsoft" package
The day of release of OpenOffice.org 3.0 has come; the open source software is gaining as a free replacement for Microsoft Office an increasing number of users, both at home and in the office, both among freelancers and in the public administration.
After a year of intensive work by the volunteer developers, which is monitored by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office now presents itself to the public with some novelties: besides a revised and now more spartanly designed start menu, the new OS is now finally the new OS for guaranteed and the new OS for Mac OS OS.
Attention was also paid to the compatibility with Microsoft Office 2007, whose new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) can be read by OpenOffice.
Interesting are also some new features, such as those that allow you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, which for example makes sending via email easier. This also includes the possibility to import PDF files into graphics editing modules and at the same time the original appearance of the page.
Thus, you can now also generate "hybrid" PDF files, which extend the typical graphics of the Adobe format by the elements of a table and a word processing system.
Collaboration is one of the most improved elements of the applications: tables can now be edited by different users in multiple hands, avoiding conflicts in the event of changes; in the case of the word processing system, each editor is assigned a query to ensure a better correction procedure.
Some companies are about to publish various features of OpenOffice on the Internet (on the cloud), while in the coming weeks the final result is to be made public.
The Italian version is available for download at the following link: http://en.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html, so it follows the English version, which has been on the mirrors since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the program is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, you can send the installation CD to your home or office.
While free will can be an incentive for the spread of the program in private households, it is also in the business area where OpenOffice could succeed: after all, various public administration institutions and schools have already switched to OpenOffice.
In fact, it does not even lack a training offer, which means an optimal help for small and medium-sized enterprises, and thus even opens up business prospects.
OpenOffice consists of five main components: Writer, the Word corresponding text creation program; Calc, the spreadsheet program that aims to displace Excel; Impress, to create presentations such as with PowerPoint; Dbase to run databases instead of the more familiar Access; and finally, Gramow.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads – a goal that can easily exceed 3 million and 600 thousand already reached.
Coal tested positive and thus the fourth doping case
A new doping case opens within the framework of the past Tour de France: it is the Austrian athlete Bernhard Kohl of the team Gerolsteiner, who is ranked third and winner of the shirt of the best climber.
The news was published by the newspaper L'Equipe on its website.
The 26-year-old Kohl from the Gerolsteiner team is the fourth driver tested positive for Cera, the third generation epoch, which previously happened with Italians Riccardo Ricc<0xC3><0xB2> and Leonardo Piepoli as well as German Stefan Schumacher.
The analyses from Kohl’s blood samples are among those carried out in recent weeks by the laboratories Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the tests confirm the positive results on Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place and will be excluded from the race for two years.
The head of the French anti-doping commission, Pierre Bordry, confirmed the positive epithet, and also the Austrian authorities, according to the Associated Press.
The 26-year-old Austrian climbed the podium behind Spanish Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans and also claimed the shirt of the best climber for himself.
THEMA EMPLOYMENT: THE NEW YORK TIMES QUESTION: IS ITALY RACISTIC?
Italy, "the former country of immigrants has recently become one of the preferred countries for immigrants", which are only welcomed with reluctance.
This is what the New York Times asked in a long article devoted entirely to the subject of racism in Italy and based on the case of the young Burkina Faso native Abdul William Guibre, who was murdered in Milan a month ago after he stole a package of cookies.
The case testifies to what the Times calls the "Paradox of the North": the northern regions are those where "most integration and employment opportunities" exist, and yet "the highest degree of anti-immigration sentiment and the greatest support of the Lega Nord is to be noted".
As a confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the Times refers to further episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And not just this.
The new legislation introduced by the Lega against immigration and for the faster expulsion of illegal immigrants is also cited as a sign of climate change in Italy.
A movement that the pope and the president also emphasized: "Giorgio Napolitano asked the pope at a meeting at the Quirinal for cooperation between church and state to combat racism."
Students victims of up to 900 euros per room high rental prices
The housing market for students is not in crisis.
According to the latest survey by Sunia, the tenant union, a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"This phenomenon has already taken on very serious traits. Whole groups of students lose their right to study so effectively, because their families are not able to support them at this level" - says the head of the Sunia, Laura Mariani - "in these cities, the other one has also led to the great demand of the student.
In addition, most rental offers include a number of violations: free contracts, missing registrations, without rental price limit, unauthorized rentals.
For Sunia there is a need for exceptional measures, which lead to a revision of the taxation to lower rental prices.
A closer look at the survey shows that in Milan a sleeping area in the Brianza district will be needed about 450 euros; a single room starts at 650 euros (in the Nere district) and ends with 800 euros in the Lambiate, Udine and Fiera district or even 900 euros in the Vitttoria district.
In Florence, a bed costs an average of 350/400 euros, a room 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in the neighborhoods around the university, 250/280 euros for a sleeping place of need, 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, the prices in the neighborhoods around the university are around 600 euros for a single room, 450 euros for a bedroom in a double room.
Just a little deeper are the rents in the neighborhoods around the other universities of Rome: 550 euros in Ostiense and Cinecitt<0xC3><0xA0>.
Only those avoiding outdoor areas can save money: 300 euros for a sleeping place and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar quarters.
In Naples you need 300-450 euros for a bed, for a room the price is between 400 and 600 euros in the most expensive neighborhoods, the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari a bed costs 250-350 euros, a single room at least 350.
In the smallest cities, prices are lower, but they have a greater weight in the urban economy.
In cities where the phenomenon of renting to non-European students is more common, such as in Perugia, there is even another anomaly: a rent, which is 25-30% above average, is demanded by foreign students.
Farewell to the old cinema Paradiso – the cities close their historic cinemas
The historic cinemas close due to the favoured multiplex cinemas.
“A city without cinemas is a blind city, like a face without eyes.”
This image of director Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect what is currently happening in the great urban centres of Italy, and also in the provinces.
The process of exclusion of cinemas, which began with the birth of the large multi-room complexes in the periphery, means in the long run the death for the one-room cinema in the center. A process that not only appears inevitable and irreversible, but also the traits of a cultural crime.
"It's like losing a friend with whom you've left a street full of emotions," says the director of the film "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso", who presented him with an Oscar and the Grand Prix of Cannes 20 years ago, for which he won a prize for Cannes.
The figures provided by the Anec, the central trade association, speak a clear language: in the last five years, the huge amount of 316 traditional cinemas have had to close; these signs mostly paid for the cinemas in the major cities: 10 in Florence and 5 in Pamoin and 5 in Milan, 9 in Bologna, Naples.
The most affected regions include the Emilia-Romagna with 82 cinemas lost, followed by Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41.
This shows that the main culprits are the multiplex cinemas, because it is these three regions in which the largest number of these modern cinemas has been recorded: with 195 in the last 5 years Lombardy leads the lists, 81 are in both Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
"The business has evolved in an irrational way," says Paolo Protti, the president of the Anec, "it is useful that new structures also arise, but in the first place is the preservation of the already existing, because a hall in the city closes to a multi-storey, not all its regular customers are ready to arrive.
And here the lack of budget for the trade union fund remains out of consideration: the debt burden recorded by the state is about 10 million euros.
It is a disgrace from the ethical-moral point of view that the government does not comply with existing laws.
To maintain the sector, between 16 and 18 million euros a year would be needed".
Interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city to decide, because of fears about the old cinemas, to protect them through an agreement between the community and the Anec; it is the first agreement of its kind in Italy, which aims to protect and support the traditional cinemas as a perriel in the Zen, and so on.
The measures envisaged also include tax advantages for cinema operators as well as benefits for the public in terms of local transport: it will be allowed to drive to the traffic-restricted areas of the centre and also to park at cheaper parking fees.
“It’s an exciting initiative,” says Giuseppe Tornatore, “I hope other cities will follow our example and also design new concepts.
Of course, we also need better audio and video equipment to be able to align something against the superpower of multiplex rooms, because after all, today’s audience is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema has always been an important topic for me: the closure of the "supercinema" of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the decisive point that led me to found the "Nuovo cinema Paradiso", even though I have been playing it for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years; when I pass the Rialto or the Quirinale in the Via Nazionale, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn to the side to not have to see the dusty posters.
The links between politics and 'Ndrangheta lead to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was ready to adapt the decisions of the municipality to the interests of the Piramalli Mafia group.
The accusations made by the Anti-Mafia authority of Calabria against Mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his deputy Rosario Schiavone of the municipality of Gioia Tauro, who were arrested this morning for involvement in Mafia businesses, are serious.
Gioacchino Piromalli, the senior intermediary between the clan and the public administration, as well as his nephew: the lawyer, who bears the same name as the boss of the clan, had already been convicted of involvement in criminal associations of the Mafia by 10 euros.
"Disregarding any kind of moral and legal norm," the lawyers write, "the two local administrations had decided to pay the lawyer Piromalli money for counseling activities."
"This made it possible for the mafia group to formally enter the council houses and agree on public administration policy," the judge said.
The president of the regional committee of Calabria Agazio Loiero does not deny that in his region "it is anything but an exception to encounter connections of local administrations and organized crime." "There are places where the concentration of the Mafia is greater than in others, where such connections are practically impractical.
But there are also local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'Ndrangheta: heroes who get a white vest."
The arrests of this morning follow those of last July, with which according to the police of the Piramalli clan was beheaded.
Since the end of last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, but as early as 1991 – and also then due to alleged links between organized crime and local administration – local politicians had been evicted from their municipal offices.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then mayor of the Udc, was elected head of the centre-right coalition after the May 2006 general election.
He cried scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He asked Deputy Interior Minister Marco Minniti, whom he referred to as having invented everything for political and strategic reasons, but the judges explain in connection with the arrest warrant this morning that the Piramalli clan had even dared to request an amendment to the A3 project.
A hearing in connection with the investigations into the Dal Torrione case showed the willingness to meet the wishes of an entrepreneur who is known to be a representative of the large group around the Piromalli – thus making the public administration’s actions identical to the interests of this clan.”
When the energy comes out of the waves, suddenly the big ones run up.
It is a non-successful source of money that covers over 70% of the planet’s surface, and only now do the big energy companies of the world seem to understand this.
Waves, currents and tides are the new renewable sources of energy that everyone is now looking at, and also looking to occupy, such as giants like Chevron.
The possibility of extracting energy from the movements of the sea has been considered and studied for 70 years; not by chance, these studies have intensified considerably since the first oil crisis.
When the price of oil broke down around 1980, the idea of marine energy was forgotten, but now environmental organizations and the rising price of oil are pushing for new impulses in this sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of the world’s energy needs could be covered by the energy generated by ocean waves.
This is equivalent to twice the energy currently produced by nuclear power plants.
In addition, the currents and tides are also added.
Giants in attack.
The first company to focus on marine energy is Enersis, which signed a contract in 2005 to build a power plant in the north of Portugal.
When this message was published, it appeared to be a revolutionary step.
Two years later, more and more companies from the traditional energy industry are relying on marine energy production.
“Chevron is investigating these technologies,” said a spokesman for a company known to the US giant in the Wall Street Journal, “and weighs the possibility of working with us.”
This is about obtaining an approval from the American Energy Commission, which is necessary to start a project off the coast of Alaska.
This is a sign not to be underestimated, especially given the fact that oil is still being promoted by the United States in Alaska, and President Bush recently launched plans for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, the companies Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey are also investing in the new industry; even the details are not known, as observers say of an increasing interest.
Techniques worthy of improvement.
Experts are talking about a technology that is still in its infancy, not least because the last doubts have not yet been clarified by environmentalists.
So far, projects such as those in Portugal and Scotland are rather small and do not seem to be causing serious ecological problems.
However, in order to produce energy on a large scale, it requires technologies with far greater impact on the environment.
There are several ways: for example, Ocean Power uses a system of interconnected bojens.
The thrust of the shafts, which moves the bojens up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure within the float via pistons and cylinders.
This drives a turbine, which in turn drives a generator.
The current is then sent to the coast via underwater lines.
So far, there are four planned installations of this type, which are only waiting for state approval, some of which could also be used for military installations.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces energy for a department store and a parking lot using underwater turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movements during the tides drive the turbines, which feeds the generator through the resulting rotational movement.
According to Verdant, a long line of potential clients are already waiting for the necessary authorizations to use these energy sources.
First the waves, then the tides.
According to the Institute for Electricity Extraction Research, the potential that is presently in the tides is of particular interest.
Although this is also an irregular phenomenon, the tides are better predictable than wind currents, solar radiation and also waves, and therefore a more reliable source of electricity.
It is precisely the tidal energy that led states such as New York, Maine and Alaska as well as other coastal states to invest $7.5 million in 2008 – up to $35 million is already planned for 2009.
