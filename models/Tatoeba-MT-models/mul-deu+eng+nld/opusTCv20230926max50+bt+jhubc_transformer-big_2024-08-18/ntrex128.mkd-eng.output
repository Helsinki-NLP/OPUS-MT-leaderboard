Members of the National Assembly of Wales worried that they "look like maps"
Some of the members of the assembly were astonished by the proposal to change their name to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This stems from plans to change the name of the assembly in the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Assembly from all over the political spectrum are concerned that it may be the subject of ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party's assembly said his party was concerned that "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For those who don’t speak Welsh: in Welsh twp means “stupid/crazy”, and pwp means “how”.
A member of Plaid said the party as a whole was "not happy" and proposed alternatives.
A Conservative party member said his party's work was "freedom-minded" about the name change, but noted that the similarity between the words MWP and Muppet was great.
In this context, the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similar to the Yorkshire-English pronunciation of the letter "u".
The Committee of the National Assembly, which is currently preparing a law to introduce changes to the name, stated: "The final decision on which any words by which the members of the Assembly will be appointed will, of course, be made by the members themselves."
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the commission published the results of the public consultations on the proposals that indicated great support for the appointment of the assembly as the Welsh Parliament.
On the question of the name of the Members of the Assembly, the committee prefers Members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but the MWP option has received the greatest support from public consultations.
MEPs are proposing alternative options, but the struggle to reach a consensus could cause headaches for the Speaker of the House, Ellen Jones, who is expected to submit a draft law on the changes within a few weeks.
The Reform Act will include other changes to the way the assembly works, including rules for disqualification of members of the assembly and the design of the committee system.
The members of the Assembly shall give the final vote on the question of their name when they discuss the law.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum to change the country’s name.
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change the name of their country to “Republic of North Macedonia”.
The popular vote was put in an effort to resolve the decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor represents a right to its territory and has consistently opposed the country’s attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President George Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite to change the name, said he would not consider the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the name change is simply the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin’s bells are ringing as churches in Harlem face problems
“Historically, the old people I talked to say there was a bar and a church on every corner,” Adams said.
“Today, there is neither one nor the other.”
He said the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
“People are socializing in a different way today,” he said.
“Bars are no longer living rooms in the neighborhoods where people go on a regular basis.”
And for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of the property will not last as long as the leaders think, “and sooner or later, they will return to the same place they started.”
The churches, he added, could be replaced by residential buildings filled with type of people who will not help the remaining shrines in the settlement.
“Most of the people who buy apartments in these buildings are white,” he said, “and so the day will soon be when these churches will shut down completely because it’s unlikely that the majority of the people who live in these apartments will be there.”
The two churches were built by Congregations of Whites before Harlem became a metropolis of Negroes – the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin a decade later.
The original Congregation of White Methodists relocated in the 1930s.
The Congregation of Negroes Practising Their Faith Nearby Takes Ownership of the Building.
St. Martin was taken from the Congregation of Negroes during the reign of Priest John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott of the vendors on 125th Street, Harlem's main shopping street, who refused to employ or advance the canteen.
The building was heavily damaged in a fire in 1939, but because members of Father Johnson's parish had plans to rebuild it, they bought the carillon.
Priest David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin, proudly called the carillon "the bell of the poor".
The expert who played the carillon in July called it a different way: “cultural wealth” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument.”
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who moved to the larger carillon in Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merivetter said St. Martin didn't replace him.
What has happened in St. Martin over the past few months is a complicated story of architects and entrepreneurs, some brought by the inexperienced leaders of the church, and some by the episcopal diocese.
The church board – the church’s governing body, made up of inexperienced leaders – wrote to the diocese in July with concern that the diocese “will ask for the cost to be transferred” to the church board as the result of the overhaul, although the church board was not included.
Some members of the parish complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark Injured 13-Year-Old Child In California Jaw Diving
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday as he snorkeled for lobsters in California on the day of the opening of the lobster season, authorities said.
The attack occurred just before 7:00 a.m. near Bicon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Chameleon told KSWB television in San Diego that he snorkeled with friends about an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy cry for help and then rowed to the group to help get him out of the water.
Hamel stated that at first he thought it was the excitement of catching a lobster, but then "he realized that he was shouting, 'I'm late!
I'm late!'
His entire key bone was being looked at,” Hamel said, noting that he had noticed when he reached the boy.
“I called everyone out of the water, ‘There’s a shark in the water!’”
The boy was transported by helicopter to the Radi Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was brought into critical condition.
It is not known what type of shark was responsible for the attack.
The beach rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, told a news conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but they decided the shark was not of a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim had sustained traumatic injuries to the upper torso.
Authorities closed the beach on the side of Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami in Encinitas for 48 hours due to investigation and security.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK's beauty market
Sainsbury's takes Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty shelves in the style of warehouses filled with professional assistants.
As part of a significant surge in the UK beauty market weighing <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion, which continues to grow as sales in the fashion and households continue to decline as the year-on-year declines, the large beauty shelves will be tested in 11 sales.
The investment in beauty came after supermarkets began looking for ways to take advantage of the shelves space that was once intended for televisions, microwaves, and household appliances.
Sainsbury's said it would for the first time double the range of beauty products to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing brands L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also gain more space with branded areas similar to those in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is also restarting its makeup boutique series, so most of the products are suitable for vegans, something that is increasingly in demand from younger consumers.
Fragrance Shop will test concessions at two Sainsbury stores, the first of which opened in Creedon, South London, last week, and the second one opened in Cely Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Buying online and the tendency to buy smaller amounts of food on a daily basis in local stores means that supermarkets need to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coop, the director of Sainsbury's, said stores will increasingly look like department stores because chain supermarkets are trying to fight off the Aldi and Lidl discounts with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's began placing Argos stores in hundreds of stores, and also introduced numerous Habitat stores after buying both chains two years ago, which they said increased grocery sales and made purchases more profitable.
The previous attempt at the supermarket to reorganize its beauty and pharmacy departments ended unsuccessfully.
Sainsbury's tested joint venture with Boots shortly after 2000, but the collaboration ended after disagreement over how to split profits from chemicals stores in supermarkets.
The new strategy emerged after Sainsbury's sold 281 of its pharmaceutical stores to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
Lloyds was said to play a role in the plan, adding a series of luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s Commercial Director, said: “We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty shelves to improve the environment for our consumers.
Also, we have invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to offer advice.
Our range of brands is designed to suit every need, and the attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now a must-have destination for beauty that is challenged by the old way of buying.”
Peter Jones 'angry' after Holly Willowby withdraws from <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones has left “angry” after TV host Holly Willowby pulled out of a <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal with his branded lifestyle business to focus on her new contracts with Marks & TV I and Spencer.
Willowby doesn’t have time for their Truly brand for household products and accessories.
The couple's business is linked to the Goop brand of Guinette Paltrow.
This 37-year-old morning program manager told Instagram she is leaving.
Holly Willowby left Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Den, withdrawing from their profitable lifestyle branded business at the last minute to focus on her new big deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "angry" when the television gold girl admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, that her new deals for Trudeau were up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million worth of time.
The business is linked to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was said to double Willowby's wealth by <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
As Willowby, 37, said on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones quickly left the UK on one of his weekends.
One source said: “Truely has always been at the top of Holly’s priorities.
It was supposed to be her long-term future that would follow her in the next two decades.
Her decision to withdraw all those affected has made her absolutely unprepared.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, it was so close to the opening.
At Marlow's headquarters there is a warehouse full of ready-to-sell products."
Experts believe the departure of this morning program leader, who is one of Britain’s highest-paid stars, could make the firm millions because of large investments in products from pillows and candles, to clothing and household products, and because of the potential.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willowby, the mother of three, and husband Dan Boldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Cap for ten years.
Willowby founded Truly with Cape in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined them as president in March.
The couple go on vacation together and Jones has a 40% stake in Boldwin's television production company.
Willowby is set to become the brand's ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the host of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said yesterday, “We don’t comment on his business exploits.”
“We fell in love and then we fell in love.”
He was joking about the criticism he would receive from the media for making a comment that some would consider "non-presidential" and because he is so positive for the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give up so many things to do?
Trump has said his voice was disguised as a “news presenter.”
“I didn’t give up on anything.”
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump assessed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
The denuclearization negotiations have been postponed.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that the North does not see an "appropriate response" from the United States for North Korea's early moves to dissolve.
Instead, he said, the United States continues with sanctions aimed at maintaining the pressures.
Trump takes a much more optimistic look at his speech at the rally.
“We have a very good deal with North Korea,” he said.
“We should have been at war with North Korea.
Millions of people will be killed.
We now have this great collaboration.’
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had brought positive results – they ended missile tests, helped free hostages, and the remaining U.S. troops returned home.
And he defended his unusual approach in the conversation about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded arena, we’ll have 200 people standing right here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroyed the island and killed hundreds of people
In the aftermath of the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population was displaced, no elemental weather was declared, which is a prerequisite for international aid.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear that they were not seeking international help, so it is a challenge,” Mr. Sumbung said.
Although “Save the Children” is a team that will travel to Palu, it is not yet certain that foreign personnel will be able to work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the relief efforts.
Because of the earthquakes that are constantly affecting Indonesia, the country remains desperately unprepared for the anger of nature.
Although tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, they are not a common sight on other coasts.
The apparent lack of sirens for a tsunami warning in Palu, although a warning was issued, probably contributed to the loss of lives.
In the best of times, traveling through many islands in Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters have made it even more difficult for logistics.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake is headed to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
The main point in President Yoko Vidodo’s election campaign was the improvement of Indonesia’s old infrastructure and he spent a lot of money on roads and rails.
But the lack of funds covered Mr. Yoko's administration in the eyes of the re-election next year.
Mr. Yoko is also facing pressure from sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets, using machetes, lances and arrows and other old weapons.
Watch: Daniel Starigh of the Liverpool team equals against Chelsea
Daniel Starridge saved Liverpool from a loss to the Premier League with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Xerdan Shakiri handed the ball to Starridge about 30 yards away from Chelsea's goal, while his team lost 1–0.
He moved the ball to the left before pointing it to the far-off pole.
The ball was moving high above the hexagon as it turned to the right corner of the net.
The ball finally passed through the jumping Kepa Arizabalaga and fell into the net.
“I was just trying to get into that position, get to the ball, and players like Shack always give as much as possible, so I just tried to create as much time as possible,” Starridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante coming up and I just touched her and I didn’t think much about it and I was just joking.”
Chelsea led 1-0 in the semi-finals after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The striker of the "blue" handed back the fifth to Mateo Kovacic in that attack, before kicking the ball almost to half a field, and then with a sprint passed in Liverpool's half.
They quickly surrendered with Kovacic in the middle of the field.
He then directed a projectile, leading Hazard into the sixteenth century.
Hazard passed the defense and finished in the net of the long-distance stand with a left-footed kick beside Allison Becker of Liverpool.
Liverpool will face Naples in the group stage of the Champions League at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo Stadium in Nepal, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832.
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said early on Sunday.
It was reported that many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings that fell in the 7.5-magnitude earthquake that struck on Friday and caused waves at a height of 20 feet, the agency's spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nugroho said.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was hit by gunfire from the collapsed buildings.
Police Arrest 32-Year-Old Man Suspected of Murder After Woman Was Punished to Death
A murder investigation has begun after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Mercisyside, this morning.
The forty-four-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with stab wounds to Grayson Mows on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police have asked people in the area who have seen or heard something to make statements.
Detective Inspector Brian Ohgen said: “The investigation is in its infancy, but I would ask people who were near John Street in Birkenhead, who saw or heard something suspicious to contact us.
“I also want to ask people, especially taxi drivers, who may have taken something on the cameras of the cars to contact us because they may have information that is important to our investigation.”
A police spokesman said the woman whose body was found was a local resident of Birkenhead and that she had been found in the building.
In the afternoon, friends who think they know the woman arrived at the scene of the crime to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and, as police say, they will inform the victim’s close relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mows just tried to return to his apartment, but police told him it was not allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
The tenants were now informed that it would be hours before they could return.
Someone heard a policeman tell a man that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
There was a woman dressed in tears.
She kept saying, “It’s so horrible.”
At 2 p.m., two police vans were at the border, and another one was outside.
A number of police officers were standing at the border and watching the apartments.
Anyone with information is asked to send a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Anonymous Crime Fighters at 0800 555 111 citing a Sept. 30 record 247.
Cromwell's statue in parliament has become the latest memorable hit in the struggle to "write history"
Her persecution would be poetic justice for his "Taliban" destruction of a large number of cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But Cromwell's Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "crazy" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the current debate on removing statues, it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell in front of Westminster Palace would become a target.
The iconoclast of the English Civil War was neither commissioned nor produced by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would sacrifice himself for the works of his ancestor, Thomas, in the previous century.
Cromwell's beautiful presentation of Sir William Hamo Tornaicroft is evidence of 19th-century thinking and part of the historiography of a figure that many believe is still worth celebrating.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Many consider, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, that Cromwell is a defender of parliament from external pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether this is a fully accurate representation is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the mid-17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure that represents one side of that division.
His achievements as a Lord-Protector are also worthy of praise and mention."
Pig-killer unravels and kills Chinese farmer
The pig attacked and killed a farmer on a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his surname “Yuan,” was found dead with a skin artery, blood-stained near a market bracket in Liupanshui in Gicou province, South China, the Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to vaccinate pigs on a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xinjiang, Kinghai Province, China.
He apparently traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door from the neighbouring pig cage.
He said there was a big squirrel in the wagon with the blood of the squirrel.
A forensic investigation has confirmed that a 550-pound hoodie ripped off the farmer and killed him, according to the report.
“My cousin’s leg was bloody and torn,” said the cousin, nicknamed Wu, according to a quote in Guayang’s evening news.
A security camera footage showed Juan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to either Juan or his cousin.
A market manager told the evening news that the pigs had been locked up to prevent attacking other people, while the police were gathering evidence on the spot.
Yuan's family and market officials are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, and previously reported cases of pigs that have been attacked by humans have been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing critical injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound pig attached a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife threw the animal out.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as an “activator.”
“They’re just playing.”
They want to scream, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone intentionally.
You just have to give them enough respect,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy rain to the southwestern part of the United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves through the cold waters of Mexico’s northern coast.
However, Rosa will bring floods of rain to the northern part of Mexico and the southwestern part of the United States in the next few days.
Rose brought winds of 85 mph, a Category 1 hurricane from 5:00 a.m. eastern time on Sunday and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rose is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depression begins to form over the Pacific Ocean and moves eastward to the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the peninsula of Lower California on Monday as a tropical storm will begin to bring in a large tropical rainfall northwards.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical moisture with the depression approaching will create heavy rainfall in the southeast over the next few days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause sharp floods, streams of ruins and possible landslides in the desert.
The heavy rainfall will cause rainfall that in some places will be about 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
A maximum of 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in part of the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Sudden flooding is possible due to the rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rainfall.
It is especially recommended not to walk in the desert in case of tropical rains.
Several rains can cause the canyons to become stormy rivers, and thunderstorms will bring locally strong winds and dust.
The impending depression will bring locally porous rain to parts of the coast of Southern California.
It can rain more than half an inch in total, which can cause rivers of rubble and slippery paths.
This would be the first rainfall in the region since their wet season.
Occasional tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early in the morning on Monday, before the rains will spread later on Monday and Tuesday.
Several rains will spread to the “four corners” on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
In October, intense changes in temperature are expected throughout the United States due to the cooling of the Arctic, but the tropical regions remain at high temperatures.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
An excellent example of a dramatic difference in temperatures will be in the central parts of the United States on Sunday.
There is a nearly 20-degree difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and De Moyne, Iowa.
In the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to recreate and expand.
Most of the central and eastern parts of the United States are expected to have a hot start in October with high temperatures at 80 degrees from the southern plains to the southeast.
New York City can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term forecast indicates the possibility of above-average temperatures for the eastern parts of the United States, all until the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brad Kavanaugh’s audition.
More than 20 million people watched the thrilling testimony on Thursday of the nominated Supreme Court candidate, Bret Cavano, and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that allegedly occurred in the 1980s, Christina Blasey Ford, on six televisions.
Meanwhile, the impasse of the political situation continued, with speakers interrupting the regular reversal programs at the last minute of Friday: Jeff Flake, an Arizona senator, signed an agreement with the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure that Cavano had picked up the piano and tried to grab the jigsaws for a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in his passionate testimony, stated that he was 100 percent sure that it did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people, as reported by Nielsen, watched it on Friday.
The company counted average views on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available for the other networks they featured, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble measuring people who look in the office.
In order to perform better, it is an audience of a size similar to that of a playoff game in football or the awards of the film academy.
Fox News, whose leaders strongly attacked Kavanaugh’s appointment, led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the full-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was a central figure in the fifth drama.
After the Republican office moderately announced that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras rallied as protesters yelled at him on Friday morning as he tried to get in the elevator for a hearing by the Judiciary Committee.
He was standing with his eyes closed for a few minutes as they overtook him, and all of this was broadcast live on CNN.
“They’re standing here in front of you,” said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the earth?"
He was told, “You have power, and so many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator door was closed, that there would be more to say during the committee hearing.
Cable and radio networks all covered hours later, when the Judiciary Committee was to vote to advance Kavanaugh's nomination to the ballot box.
But Flake said he would only do so if there was an agreement with the FBI that they would consider the charges against the nominee next week, which was demanded by a minority of Democrats.
Flake was convinced in part of the conversation with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Kuns.
After a conversation with Kuns and a few senators thereafter, Flake made the decision.
Flick's choice was of great importance, as it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of ‘playing politics’ about Brexit <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with Britain's future and undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom on September 29, 2018.
In another interview immediately before her on the newspaper's homepage, her former Foreign Minister, Boris Johnson, attacked her so-called "Checkers" plan for Brexit, saying the proposal that Britain and the EU should be able to accommodate them.
Wade Sims Shooting: Police Arrest Suspect Dieton Simpson for the Death of an Athlete at Louisiana State University <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University.
20-year-old Deteon Simpson has been arrested and jailed on second-degree murder charges, the Baton Rouge police department said.
Authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said that Sims had lost his glasses during the collision.
Police found the glasses at the scene of the crime and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, the WAFB partner told CBS.
After Simpson was interrogated, police said he confessed to shooting Wade and killing him.
His bail is set at $350,000, the lawyer said.
The office of the pathologist of the parish of eastern Baton Rouge published the preliminary report on Friday, where the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head to the neck.
The department thanks the Louisiana State Police Refugee Unit, the state police forensic laboratory, the Southern University police and the citizens of the area for the help they have given in the investigation that led to the arrest.
The athletic director at the State University of Louisiana thanked the police for her “activity in search of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6.6-foot bacon grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for Louisiana State University.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 catches per game in the last season.
On Friday morning, the coach of the Louisiana State University basketball team, Will Wade, said the team was "devastated" and "in shock" by Sims' death.
"That's what you're always looking out for," the coach said.
Volcano spills ash over Mexico City
The ejection of ash from the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern settlements of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Sunday not to go to the volcano after it began activity in the crater and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded in a 24-hour period.
The center was followed by more tattoos and shakes.
Social media footage shows a thin layer of ash on cars in Mexico City's towns and villages, such as Socimilco.
Geophysicists noted increased activity of the volcano located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital after a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence protesters clashed with police for public order and peace, and after thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarizing vote of cleavage.
A group of masked supporters of the separatists detained by police for public order and peace threw eggs and paint powder, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that would normally be packed with tourists.
Later in the day, sticks also erupted, and the police used sticks to crush the sticks.
For more than a few hours, the independence groups chanted "There is no forgetting, no forgiveness", and on the other hand, union protesters chanted "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained in the protests, the local press said.
Tensions remain high in the region that wants independence, a year after Madrid characterized the October 1 referendum as illegal, but the same was celebrated by the separatist Catalans.
The majority of voters voted in favour of independence, although the outcome was small due to boycott by people who were against secession.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police forcefully tried to stop the vote at polling stations in the region.
The independence groups camped overnight on Friday to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police force.
The demonstrations took place, but they had to change the route.
The sixty-eight-year-old electrician, Narcissus Termes, who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hoped that Catalonia would have a chance of gaining independence.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
“I saw my parents cry out for joy because they can vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite winning a vital but narrow victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan independence parties struggled to keep the momentum this year with many of their most well-known devise leaders, either in the aftermath of a self-chosen exile or in jail awaiting trial.
Forty-two-year-old mechanic Juan Puig, filming a protest in support of the police, said the conflict was supported by politicians on both sides.
“It’s getting all sorts of potential,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Hunkeras, one of nine Catalan leaders who are in jail before a trial last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament elections next year.
“To be a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government,” he said.
LONDON: Men arrested after car crashed into house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after repeatedly crashing a car into a house in Londonbury.
The incident took place in Balingard Crescent on Thursday at around 19.30 BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemings said the damage was caused to the gate and the building itself.
At one point, he could be shot with an arrow shot at the car.
Menga's hit brought Livingston a 1–0 win against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingstone secures victory
The advanced Livingston beat the Rangers by signing Steven Gerard, with his only two losses in 18 games, as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's weather proved significant as Gerry Hold's side climbed by one level with Hibernian in second place.
Gerard's side remained without a guest win in the championship this season and will face the Harts leaders next week, behind them by eight points.
Before that, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston have continued to remain undefeated in the division in six games, and coach Holt has yet to face a defeat since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses the chance against the harsh guests
Holt's team was to lead a long time before giving the goal, and their directness caused many problems to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson tried, but pulled the attack around the goal, then Alan Litgov could only direct his efforts from a distance after sliding played the head-butt of Craig Halket over the goal.
Guests were pleased to let Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could create problems with the posted actions.
And that’s how the judgmental goal came.
The Rangers missed a free kick, and Livingstone got an opening, Declan Galeger and Robinson put Menga together, who with just a touch scored from the center of the 1960s.
Until then, the Rangers dominated possession of the ball, but could not break through the home defending, so goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not play for the most part.
That scheme continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos seems to be saving from Kelly.
Scott Pittman failed to score due to the skill of Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor, and Litgov took the ball away from another set action at Livingstone.
Livingston's sixties were constantly passing by and he was constantly defended, while two demands for a penal—after Chalket's dispute over Glenn Middleton's replacement and one for a hand game—were rejected.
“Phenomenal” by Livingstone – analysis
Alesder Lamont on BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal game and result for Livingstone
They were excellent, continuing to exceed the expectations of this upward path.
Their style and character of playing hardly changed after their return to the top, but much of the credit goes to Holt for the way he galvanized the team since his arrival.
He's had so many heroes.
Captain Chalket was outstanding, managing a super organized defense, but Menga still kept Conor Goldson and Joe Voral ready.
The Rangers, however, were inspired.
As good as they once were under Gerard's leadership, they are now lagging behind by the same standards.
Their last game was weak – they only managed to open the hosts once – and that’s a little bit of awareness of the Rangers, who found themselves in the middle of the table.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an receives mixed reception in Colonia
There was a smile and a blue sky on Sunday (September 29) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which is geared towards improving relations between NATO allies.
They have worsened due to problems including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an then headed for the Colony to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest population of Turks outside of Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters came to the vicinity to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, many of them Kurds, have also spoken out, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to wish him well in the country.
Opposition protesters portray the visitor's divisiveness as a hero of some German Turks and criticised as an autocrat of others.
Road Crash in Deptford: Bicyclist Died in Car Crash
A cyclist died in a car crash in London.
The collision occurred near the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn Streets, a traffic jam in Deptford, in the southeastern part of the city at around 10.15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and an ambulance arrived, but the man died at the scene of the accident.
The collision occurred months after the death of another cyclist in a road accident on Childers Street where the driver escaped, about a mile from the collision on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said the officers were working on identifying the man and informing his family of the incident.
Roadblocks are placed and buses are rerouted and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Police Officers Injured in Disturbance
Six prison police officers were injured in riots in a male prison with a high level of security, the prison's office said.
The riots erupted at HMP Long Martin in Worcestershire at around 9.30 BST on Sunday and are still ongoing.
Specialists from the Tornado unit were brought to resolve the riots, which included eight prisoners and were confined to one wing.
Officers were treated for minor injuries at the scene.
A prison spokesman said: “Specially trained prison personnel were instructed to deal with the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six of the staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and those responsible will be handed over to the police and may spend extra time behind bars.”
HMP Long Lartin has 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous interceptors in the country.
In June, it was announced that the governor of the prison had received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, police for public order and peace were called to prison to deal with serious unrest in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (may be useful for dry areas)
Tropical depression is rare to hit Arizona, but it is likely to happen early next week when the remaining force of Hurricane Rosa will pass through the desert southwest region, bringing a risk of sudden flooding.
The state weather station has already issued warnings for possible sudden flooding on Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, all to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, including the cities of Wexford, Phoenix, and Phoenix.
Rosa is expected to move on a direct path through the Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late on Monday with rain.
The Phoenix State Meteorological Station tweeted that “only ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status within the 200-mile range of the Phoenix since 1950!
"Catarina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border."
The latest models of the State Hurricane Center predict 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches in the outskirts of Mongol in Arizona.
Other areas of the desert southwest region, including the central parts of the Carpathian Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to have 1 to 2 inches, with isolated places up to 4 inches of rain.
For those who are out of risk areas for sudden flooding, Rose’s rain can be a blessing because the region is hit by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, part of this rainfall is likely to be beneficial because the southwestern region is hit by drought.
“According to the U.S. Dry Tracking Authority, nearly 40 percent of Arizona is facing extreme drought, the second-highest category,” weather.com said in a statement.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa led to landslides all over the Lower California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, still at the intensity of a hurricane on a Sunday morning with winds of a maximum of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and is moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm comes into contact with colder waters in the Pacific Ocean and is decreasing.
Therefore, rainfall in Mexico is expected with the intensity of a tropical storm in the late afternoon or evening hours on Monday.
The rains in parts of Mexico can be intense and pose a significant risk of flooding.
“It is expected to rain 3 to 6 inches from Lower California to northwestern Sonora, with a maximum possible 10 inches of rain,” weather.com said in a statement.
Rosa would then move north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning hours on Tuesday as a tropical depression, which would then move up through Arizona and into southern Jutland until late evening hours.
“The main danger expected from Rosa or her remains is the heavy rainfall in Lower California, southwestern Sonora and the desert southwestern region of the United States,” the state hurricane center said in a statement.
These rains are expected to bring life-threatening floods and streams of ruins, as well as landslides in mountainous regions.
Midsummer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Assassination
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old man was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in Midsummer Northton's Execution Terrace area around 4.00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital and was in “stable” condition.
One 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and one 20-year-old were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset police said.
The police asked if anyone had the cell phone footage of the incident, to appear.
Trump said Kavanaugh had “suffered the greatest anger and anger” of the Democratic Party.
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party’s most cruel and scandalous tactics,” Trump said at a meeting in Willing, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had “suffered the greatest anger and anger” of the Democratic Party during his nomination.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying the accusations of Christina Blasey Ford that he had committed a sexual assault on her a few decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford testified at the hearing, as well, about her accusations.
The president said on Saturday that “Americans saw the brilliance, quality, and courage” of Cavano that day.
“The positive vote for Judge Cavano is a vote for confirmation of one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a lawyer with impeccable records of public service,” he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly mentioned Kavanaugh's nomination while talking about the significance of the Republicans' exit from the early elections.
“Five more weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
“I’m not running, but I’m really fighting,” he said.
“That’s why I’m everywhere and I’m fighting for great candidates.”
Trump said the Democrats had a mission to “give resistance and hinder.”
The first key vote on Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate is expected no later than Friday, a senior GOP executive told CNN.
Hundreds of dead in Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, and the total number of victims is increasing
At least 384 people have been killed, many of them from the huge waves hitting the beaches when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday when waves measuring 6 meters (18 feet) hit the shores of the sunset, leading many to safe death and destroying everything on their way.
After the earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5, a tsunami struck.
“When the tsunami threat emerged yesterday, people were still carrying out their activities on the beach and did not flee immediately, so they became victims,” said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, spokesman for BNPB’s Indonesia Disaster Mediation Agency.
“The tsunami did not come alone, it dragged cars, trees, houses, hit everything on the land,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled through the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h (497 miles/h) before it hit the coast.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and to survive, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The aerial photographs published by the disaster agency showed many destroyed buildings and shops, curved and demolished bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Subsequent tremors continued to shake the coastal city on Sunday.
A series of earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said the energy released from the massive earthquake on Friday was about 200 times greater than the energy released by the Hiroshima atomic bomb in World War II.
The geographic location of the city, which lies at the end of a long, narrow coastline, is likely to boost the size of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "widespread" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the shot of the collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could increase along the coast 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, in an area called Dongala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications “were completely damaged without any information” from Dongala, Nugroho said.
“There are more than 300,000 people living there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers were referring to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse,” they said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not informing that the tsunami hit Palu, although authorities said the dams came around the same time the warning was issued.
In an amateur photo shared on social media, a man on the upper floors of a building can be heard shouting out loud, warning people down the street of the approaching tsunami.
In a few minutes, a wall of water collapses on the shore, carrying buildings and cars.
Reuters couldn't confirm the photo right away.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a power outage that cut off communications around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue activities.
The military has begun to send cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the evacuated people still desperately need food and other basic needs.
The city's airport was reopened for assistance only and will remain closed until October.
President Yoko Vidodo planned to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The total number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia has increased to over 800.
It's really bad.
While World Vision staff from Dongala arrived safely in the city of Palu, where employees sheltered in shelters from cedar trees in their office yard, they walked their way through desert scenes, Mr. Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses that were destroyed,” he said.
It's very bad.
Even as aid groups began dark attempts to start aid for the disaster, some complained that foreign aid experts had been barred from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, financial support, supplies and personnel from abroad can only begin to arrive if the site of the disaster has been declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Ariani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“If the government says, ‘All right, this is a national disaster,’ we can receive international aid, but it still has no status.”
As the second night in Palu fell after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and families of the missing still hoped that their loved ones would be the miracle that would ease the black story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a small boy was taken out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who was stuck under the gun for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the head coach of the Indonesian state paragliding team, coached two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
The others who were trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, Mr. Mandagi added, were his students.
“As a senior in the paragliding field, I have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon said that when she began to circulate the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel in the paragliding community, he was desperate to send WhatsApp messages to competitors from Palu, who participated in the beach festival.
But his messages ended up only with a gray ticking sign, instead of a son.
“I think that means the messages have not been delivered,” he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 when charging an ATM at Newport on the Key
Thieves on Friday morning stole $26,750 from an employee at Brink's who supplemented an ATM at Newport on the Key, according to a press release from the Newport police station.
The driver of the car emptied the ATM in the amusement complex and was preparing to supplement it with money, Detective Denis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
While he was busy, another man "runned from behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money that was meant for delivery.
Witnesses noted several suspects fleeing the scene of the crime, according to the statement, but police did not give a specific number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone who has any information about their identities should contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changed his name to She
The rapper Kanye West changed his name to She.
The change was posted on Twitter on Saturday. He wrote: "Society formerly known as Kanye West."
The forty-one-year-old West wore the cover of The One for a while and used the cover for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change occurred just before his visit to Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album "Yandhi".
He will replace singer Ariana Grande on the show, who had to give up for "emotional reasons," the show's creator said.
Although he uses it as an abbreviation for his current professional name, West has previously said that the word has a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'he' is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means 'you'," West said earlier this year, discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
“It’s me, it’s me, it’s me.
He left Kanye, which means the only one, to Him alone, a reflection of our good, our evil, our confused, everything.
The album is more of a show of who we are.”
He is one of the many famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs is known as Pope Dedi, P. Didi or Didi, but this year he announced his preference for the names Hunter and Brother Hunter (Love and Brother Love).
Former West's co-worker, Jay Z, also uses his name with or without a punctuation and all capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use the military against civilians
Mexico's Vice President Andrés Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed that he will never use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody repression of students.
Lopez Obrador vowed on Saturday in Tlatelolco Plaza that “he will never use the military to repress the Mexican people.”
The military fired at peaceful demonstrators in the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people at a time when leftist student movements took root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by giving monthly assistance to those who are studying and by opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities are attracting young people to criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its funding for artificial intelligence.
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double its research resources in the field, said AI investor and practitioner Kai-Fu Li, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments came after various parts of the U.S. government made statements about artificial intelligence, even though the U.S. does not have a formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, China introduced its plan last year: it aims to be the number one in AI innovations by 2030.
“Doubling the artificial intelligence budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are so far ahead of the United States, and we are looking for the next discovery in artificial intelligence,” Lee said.
Doubling the funds could double the chances that the next big AI achievement would make the United States, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" (Superpowers in Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order) was released a month ago by Houghton<0x2B>Fafflin Harcourt's company. He is the CEO of Innovation Ventures.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Melon University, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that beat the highest-ranked American body player, and later was director of Microsoft Research and president of the Google branch in China.
Lee thanked the U.S. government’s previous technology competitions as a challenge in the robotics of the Agency for Advanced Defense Research Projects and asked when the next competition would be, in order to help identify the following visionaries.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to get state grants, Lee said.
“It’s not China that takes academic leaders, it’s corporations,” Li said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired experts from universities to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. improve its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I think green cards should be automatically offered to doctors of artificial intelligence,” he said.
The State Council of China released its Plan for the Development of the Future Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
China’s state-run foundation for natural sciences is funding people in academic institutions similar to the way the foundation for natural sciences and other governmental organizations donate money to researchers from the United States, but the quality of work is low in China, Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which should include industry and academia partners, and the White House announced the creation of an Authorized Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment for the initiative called “AI Next”.
As far as the NSF is concerned, they are currently investing more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation calling for the creation of a National Commission on the Safety of Artificial Intelligence has not been in place for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on whether to change the name of the country
People in Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change her name to “Republic of North Macedonia”, a move that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that blocked her requests for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor represents a right to its territory and vetoes its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will undermine the ethnic identity of most of Macedonia's Orthodox population.
President George Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and the boycott campaign cast doubt on whether the exit would meet the minimum 50 percent required for the validity of the referendum.
The question of the referendum leaflet was: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece".
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price is worth paying to allow entry into bodies such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the collapse of Yugoslavia.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us,” said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough members of parliament said they would respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
A two-thirds majority in parliament is required to change the name.
The state election commission said there were no reports of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, the turnout stood at 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters cast their vote.
“I came out to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe,” said 62-year-old Jo<0xC5><0xA1>e Tanevski, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko gave their voice to the referendum in Macedonia on a change of the name of the country, which will pave the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union, on September 30, 2018.
Before the Skopje parliament, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavadarkov was preparing a small stage and chairs in front of tents set by people who would boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to get in with our heads high, not from the back entrance,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we still have dignity.
If they don’t want us to be treated like Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
"I believe that the majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after the vote.
He said the “yes” result would be “confirmation of our future.”
The poll, which was published last Monday by the Institute for Political Research in Macedonia, showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum, which is under the necessary exit.
Another poll conducted by the Macedonian televised Telma showed that 57 percent of voters plan to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent will vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the exit rate should be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failed referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since it came to power in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passed all of Brighton's defense for the goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling quickly beat Brighton's defense in a 2–0 win over Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his bet look so simple in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a midfielder submission at the start of the sequence.
He quickly passed between three of Brighton's defending players, before entering the open field.
Aguero was then found surrounded by four "greens".
Round one defensive player before racing several others on the edge of Brighton's sixteenth century.
He then turned left of him, to Sterling.
The English striker used his first come-to-sixties to return the ball to Aguero, who with his right foot defeated Brighton's goalkeeper, Matthew Ryan, with a single hit on the right side of the net.
"Aguero has a leg problem," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We talked about playing 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky to have scored at the time.”
But the initial advantage of the "heavenly blues" gave Sterling in the fight for the Premier League.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got a long ball in Brighton's territory in that game.
He sent a beautiful straight ball along the left side to Leroy Shane.
Shane touched her a few times before taking Sterling to the remote stall.
The attack of the "heavenly blues" brought the ball into the net before coming out.
City will fight Hofenheim in a Champions League group game at 12.55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar Arena, Germany.
Chercer wants to play spoiler against Rokis
Because the Nashnells were eliminated from the fight for the playoffs, there was no reason to force another start.
But the ever-competitive Shercer hopes to stand in the central square on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockies team, who lead a match before the Los Angeles Dodgers in the West.
Rokis' team had at least a "joker" for a 5–2 win over the Nashnells on Friday night, but are still struggling to establish their place in the first division.
“Although we’re not playing for anything, at least we’ll be able to throw away knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team is likely to be playing at the highest level of any moment I’m going to face this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to compete in that?”
The Nesnells still have to announce the starter for the week, but are reportedly inclined to allow Scherzer to throw in such a situation.
Shercer, who will start for the 34th time, coached throwing on Thursday and would throw normally on Sunday.
Washington's right is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeout points in 220 2/3 innings of the season.
Trump rallies in West Virginia <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The president indirectly mentioned the situation surrounding his election of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court as he spoke about the importance of Republicans' exit in the early elections.
“Everything we’ve done so far will be put on a stake in November.
Five more weeks to one of the most important choices of our time.
“This is one of the big, big ones – I don’t run, but I’m really fighting, so I’m fighting everywhere for great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, “You look at these terrible, terrible groups of Democrats, you look at what’s going on right now.
And they are determined to regain their power using all the means at their disposal, you see the evil, the ruthlessness.
“It doesn’t matter who they’re hurting, when they have to beat up in order to get power and control, that’s what they want power and control, but we won’t give it to them.”
The Democrats, he said, have a mission to “give resistance and hinder.”
“And you’ve seen that in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “angerous, evil, ugly and untruthful.”
He mentioned Senator Diana Feinstein of the Democratic Orders, set by the Senate Judiciary Committee, on behalf of which the public responded with calls for remorse.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you publish the document?
Oh, oh, what.
No, no, wait a minute—it was a very bad body speech—the worst body speech I’ve ever seen.”
Laborists no longer accept differing opinions, however.
There is no tolerance for those who express their opinions.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted against me, it was almost no surprise.
However, I am only the last in the line of members of parliament from the Labor Party who has been told that we are not welcome – just because he is expressing his opinion.
My fellow Member of Parliament, Joan Ryan, has received a similar treatment because he takes a firm stand against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship movement was criticizing me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
For the importance of responsible economic policy, for national security, for Europe, ironically similar issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement of the meeting of the Eastern Labor Party of Nottingham stated that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
In most of my eight years as a member of the Labor Party’s parliament, the council meetings on Friday night were just like that.
Unfortunately today, that’s not the tone of most meetings, and the promise of a “moderate, gentle” policy has long been forgotten, if indeed, ever started.
It is becoming increasingly obvious that different opinions are not tolerated in the Labor Party, and each opinion is judged whether it is acceptable to the party leaders.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues with whom I thought we had previously shared a similar political opinion began to expect me to completely change my thinking and take positions for the sake of the nation that would otherwise never have taken over, regardless of whether it was going to happen.
Whenever I speak in public, and it really doesn’t matter what I say, there follows a critical abuse of social media that calls for condemnation, a renunciation of the center’s policies, telling me that I shouldn’t be in the Labor Party.
And I'm not the only one with that experience.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments that are directed at me are usually political.
I have a great fear of the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face numerous sexist or racist harassment every day, but never withdraw.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era in politics is how levels of abuse have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labor Party should practice a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer accept different opinions, and with every demand for “lack of trust” or a change in the rules of selection, the party becomes more restrictive.
I’ve been given a lot of advice over the past two years telling me to keep my head down, not to be so loud, and then “everything’s going to be okay.”
But that’s not the reason I came into politics.
Even 32 years ago, when I joined the Labor Party as a student, provoked by the carelessness of the Thatcher government that literally left my classroom to collapse, I struggled to improve public services for those who needed it most, whether as a local souvenir.
I've never had my politics hidden, including in the last election.
No one in East Nottingham could in any way be confused about my political views and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who supported Friday’s demand, all I want to say is that when the country goes down to Brexit that will hurt households, businesses and our public services, I don’t understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader.
But I have a message that is not for Nottingham Moment, but for my constituents, whether they are members of the Labor Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no matter how condemnable the threats or political opportunism I am about to make, I have nothing to do with it.

Ear 38 – 17 Melrose: The undefeated Ear goes to the top
The two late points may have changed the final score somewhere, but there is no doubt that Ear deserved the triumph in this wonderfully entertaining match on the day of the Scottish Rugby Championship.
They are now at the top of the table, the only undefeated side of the ten.
In the end, it’s all due to their superior defense, as well as their better-built chances, which the home team brought, and coach Peter Murchi has the right to be satisfied.
“We’ve been tested through our games so far and we’re still undefeated, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robin Christy of Melrose said: “Thanks to Ear, they used their chances better than us.”
Grant Anderson's point in 14 minutes, converted by Fraser Climo, gave Ear an advantage, but the yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, given for the Warriors' game, allowed Melranee to improve the scores, and Jason Negroe.
Klimo extended the lead of the Ear with a penal, previously, exactly at half time, he scored a point, so he converted a solo point to reach 17 – 5 for the Ear in the rescue.
But Melrose started well in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's point, converted by Bagot, reduced the lead by five points.
He then had a lengthy detention due to a serious injury to Ruarid Not, who was carried on the carrier, and from the restart, Ear continued to wrestle with the point of Stafford McDowell, converted by Climate.
Air's VD captain, Blair McPherson, then received a yellow card and again, Melrose charged for the additional man with an unconverted Bruce Colvin point at the end of the day with ruthless pressure.
But the home team recovered, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card to crush Klimo without the ball, McPherson pulled a punctuation from the penalty line on the back by a sharp attack on Ear.
Klimo converted, as he did almost from the start again, after Kyle Rowe took the hit of David Armstrong and sent winger Gregor Henry to the fifth point for the home team.
“Still Game” star looks ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star, Ford Kiran, appears ready to move into the hospitality industry after it is revealed that he has been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
Fifty-six-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in the BBC's popular series, on which he is a screenwriter and co-starring with longtime comedy partner Greg Hemfield.
The duo announced that the next ninth season would be the last and it looks like Kirnan is planning for life after Craigleng.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source told Scottish Sun that Kirnan was trying to get involved in Glasgow's "successful restaurant trade".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia surrounded by land hopes that the court will reopen the path to the Pacific
Marines are patrolling at a covert-legged naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings have set up a blue flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are plastered with the motto: “The sea is ours rightfully.
It is our duty to return.”
Throughout mainland Bolivia, the memory of the coast lost in favor of Chile in a bloody 19th-century resource conflict is still fresh, as is the desire to sail again across the Pacific Ocean.
Those hopes may now be the biggest in decades, as Bolivia awaits a decision from the international court on October 1 after five years of debate.
“Bolivia has the momentum, the spirit of unity and tranquility, and of course a positive outcome is expected,” said Roberto Calsad<0xC3><0xAD>a, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decision of the international court on the big screens all over the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will judge in favor of Bolivia's lawsuit that, after decades of volatile talks, Chile is obliged to negotiate until the end.
Here’s Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic president of indigenous origin, who faces a controversial re-election battle next year, is also heavily dependent on Monday’s verdict.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is not likely to judge in favor of Bolivia and that it will not change much even to judge in their favor.
The Netherlands-based UN body will not have the power to assign territory to Chile and said it will not decide on the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the judgement of the international court comes only six months after the final arguments indicate that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Zarate, an expert in international law from Chile.
And the last four years may have brought back the cause of Bolivia instead of improving it.
“The current Bolivian administration is using the problem of access to the sea for its own purposes,” Zarate said.
Morales's military rhetoric undermined Chile's remaining goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Velce, the Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision was unusually fast.
Monday will bring Bolivia “an incredible opportunity to open an era of good relations with Chile” and an opportunity to “end 139 years of mutually beneficial disagreements,” he said.
Calsadia also denied that Morales, still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, used the problem of the sea as political support.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The decision is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome the past.”
North Korea Says It Won't Come to Nuclear Disarmament Unless It Can Trust The U.S.
North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, says his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if it can't trust Washington.
Ree was speaking on Saturday before the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States of America to keep its promises made during a summit in Singapore between rival leaders in the country.
His comments came at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is on the brink of restarting blocked nuclear diplomacy more than three months after Singapore with North Korean Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was a "fiction" to think that the continued sanctions and U.S. objections to a declarative end to the Korean War would bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is wary of agreeing to the declaration without Pyongyang first taking significant disarmament measures.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is great skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up the arsenal that the country most likely sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion magazines reveal the latest line of massive hats on the way to the biggest stores near you
If you want to improve the size of your drop collection or completely block the sun, then look no further.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown discovered a series of crazy oversized hats for their SS19 collection on the track that dazzled the style set at Fashion Week in Paris.
Ultimately impractical hats launched Instagram this summer and these designers sent their creations falling in the eye on the track.
The piece that was highlighted by Valentino was a huge beige hat decorated with a wide rim in the form of feathers that flooded the head of the model.
Other oversized accessories included snails with zirconia, a magic hat, and even pineapple, but they’re not designed to warm your head.
Tom Brown also discovered a selection of bizarre masks, and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and resembled Hannibal Lector more than high fashion.
One creation resembled diving gear entirely with sunglasses and a diving tube, and the other looked like melted cornet ice cream.
And if you continue with the huge fashion statement, you're lucky.
Followers of the style predict that the huge hats can come to the stores near you.
The oversized hats came very quickly after "La Bomba", the two-legged straw hat with a rim that carries everyone from Rihanna to Emily Rataykovsky.
The iconic fashion house that stands behind the too impractical hat that spreads through social media sent another big creation along the runway, a straw bag for the beach nearly equal in size to the height of the model that dragged it.
The dark orange raffle bag, with a raffle embroidery and a white leather handle, was the piece featured in Jacques's La Riviera SS19 collection at Fashion Week in Paris.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see the big hats and beach bags in the stores next summer, because the designer caused such a big impact that it would be hard to ignore the over-the-counter demand.
John Edward: Language Skills are Necessary for Global Citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain academic excellence and this continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding exam results, which is only amplified by the individual and group success in sport, art, music and other achievements of the community.
With more than 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best service to their pupils and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their pupils for further and higher education, the career they have chosen, and their place as global citizens. -
As an educational center that can design and implement customized school programs, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and desired as an elective subject in schools.
Nelson Mendela said, “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it will make him imaginary.
If you speak with him in his tongue, it will strike him in the soul.”
This is a strong reminder that we can’t rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year’s recent test results, we can see that languages outperform all other subjects with the highest success rate in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages achieved a higher score of “5<0x2B>”.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS schools, showed that 72 percent of students achieved a higher score of "5<0x2B>" in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied French, and 63 percent of those who studied French.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will no doubt acquire in the future.
Languages now, as an elective subject, are viewed at the same level as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in programs at independent schools, as well as elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the OK Employment and Skills Commission found that 17 percent of the reasons employers failed to fill jobs were due to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly obligatory in order to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more jobs in search of languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
No matter what career someone chooses, if they learn a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future having such life skills.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically give preference to the polyglot over the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults from OK in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to speak, and French was the only language they spoke more than ten percent, i.e. 15 percent of the population.
Therefore, investing in language learning is now important for today’s children.
Having more languages, especially those of the developing economies, will equip children with better chances of finding a significant job.
In Scotland, each school will be different according to the languages it teaches.
Some schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important at OK when viewed in the future by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what your child’s interests are, there will always be a number of languages from which to choose in independent schools, with professors who are specialists in this area.
Scotland’s independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future brings.
At the moment, it cannot be denied, in the global business environment, that languages will continue to be vital to the future of the country, so this has to be repainted in schools.
In fact, modern languages really need to be considered as “international communication skills.”
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity, and excellence to the young people of Scotland.
"Il faut bien le faire" (it has to be done).
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will lead Lakers to debut in San Diego on Sunday
The wait is almost over for fans who wanted to see LeBron James start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the first game of the pre-season this week against the Denver Nights in San Diego.
But the number of minutes he'll play is still not decided.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudeau tweeted that James would most likely play for a limited time.
After training at the start of the week, James was asked about his plans for a six-match schedule ahead of the Lakers season.
“I don’t need pre-season games at this stage of my career to prepare,” he said.
Youtube channel for Trump’s rally in West Virginia <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
President Donald Trump began a series of rallies as part of the campaign, tonight in Willing, West Virginia.
It will be Trump’s first of five scheduled rallies in the coming week, including visits to places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote to confirm his election to fill the vacancy in the Supreme Court is at a standstill, Trump is trying to build support for the upcoming mid-term elections because Republicans may lose control of Congress by the vote.
What time is Trump’s rally tonight in West Virginia and how do you watch it over the internet?
Trump's rally in Willing, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. Time zone on the east coast tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s rally in West Virginia via the Internet with a live stream on YouTube.
This week it is likely that Trump will appeal to the hearing of the man who nominated him to the Supreme Court, Bret Cavanaugh, who has become tense over allegations of sexual misconduct by a long-term and expected delay of the vote in the Senate.
The primary goal of the rallies series is to help Republicans win a bid for the November elections.
From President Trump's campaign, they said that these five rallies next week were aimed at "incentivizing volunteers and supporters because Republicans are trying to protect and broaden the majority they hold in the Senate and the Senate."
“Congress control is so important in his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible with the start of the tough campaign season,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters, who declined to be named.
Ordered at the Wesbanko Arena in Willing, the evening's rally could attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media from Pittsburgh, according to the West Virginia Metro news.
It was Trump’s second visit to West Virginia last month, a state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind the polls.
“It’s not good for Morrissey that the president has to come to improve the popularity of the polls,” said Simon Hyder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Cup Rider 2018: The U.S. team showed courage in the fight to keep the hopes alive at the start of the individual matches on Sunday
After three one-sided seasons, the four on Saturday afternoon may have been exactly what the Ryder Cup needed.
The twist of luck is a completely fictional sporting concept, but the players really believe in it, and most of all in such games.
Who would have thought that happiness is now?
“They had a six-point lead, and now they’re four, so we’re a little lucky, I guess,” Jordan Spit said after the end of today’s race.
The Europeans have an advantage, of course, a four-point lead and twelve more games.
The Americans, according to Sleep, feel that they have a weak wind in the air although they have enough incentive, if nothing else then the form of Sleep and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each scored three points out of four.
Sleep was excellent and led by example.
These strong celebration calls became more and more powerful during his game, with a key blow that led to a four-four equalization when he and Thomas had two misses after two rounds.
His hit with which he won the match at 15 was interrupted by a similar call, which tells you that he believes the American team is not out of the game.
“You just have to get deep and take care of your game,” said Sleep.
That’s all that’s left for every player.
18 holes to achieve a point.
The only players with more points than Spit and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of the Rider Cup.
The strange but wonderful duo of Europe is four out of four and can't be wrong.
Mollywood were the only couple without bad punches on Saturday afternoon, but they avoided bad punches on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the previous nine on Friday morning.
That series and the way their energy seems to flow to and from this noisy group ensures that they are the players who will win on Sunday and that there will be no other popular players who will provide a potential European victory when the sun sets behind Le Golf Nacional.
I prefer the two at the same time in different places.
However, talks about European fame remain unwarranted.
Buba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly cope with Sergio Garcia, the morning hero of the doubles, when he teamed up with Alex Noren.
A missed blow and two doubles of the top nine buried the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole from which they never managed to get out.
On Sundays, however, there is no one who can help you get out of the hole.
The pairs and the four are so fascinating to watch closely due to the interaction between the partners, the advice they give themselves, the advice they don’t listen to, and the way in which the strategy can be changed at once.
The Europeans played better as a team and thus achieved a significant lead in the last day, but the four-time season also showed that the U.S. team could fight even though some, especially Americans, were skeptical.
The Europeans led by 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will enter with a solid lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup after Saturday's lead in doubles and fours 10-6 ahead of the United States.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two victories while Tiger Woods struggled to take the lead so far at Le Golf National on four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, which struggled to retain the trophy he lost at Hazeltin two years ago, dominated the American team, which had a lot of failures in the morning doubles and won the series 3-1.
The Americans gave more resistance in the fours, winning two games, but were unable to reach the lead.
Jim Furrick's team needs eight points out of 12 individual matches a week to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European starter to win four points in a row, while he and Mollynaire, dubbed "Mollywood" after the sensational weekend, are the second pair overall to win four points in the first four games in Ryder Cup history.
After smacking Woods and Patrick Reed into doubles, they played great and beat the wasted Woods and U.S. rookie Brayson Dashambu with an even more pronounced 5&4 score.
Woods, who went through two matches on Saturday, played well at times, but now lost 19 of 29 doubles and fours and seven times in a row.
Justin Rose, resting while the morning doubles lasted, returned as Henry Stanson's partner in Dustin Johnson's 2&1 and Brooks Coepca's four-seeded defeats - ranked first and third in the world.
However, the Europeans didn’t like that pleasant, windy day southwest of Paris after them.
Three-time dominant winners Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas set a goal for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They achieved a decisive 2&1 victory over the Spaniards John Rahm and Ian Pulter in the doubles and later returned to beat Pulter and Rory McLaren with 4&3 in the fours, but lost to the original, two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup a particular team has recovered from a lack of four points in an individual game, although as holders of the title, the team of Fourick was satisfied with an equal result to retain the trophy.
After the second two days, however, the Sunday counterattack seems to remain over them.
North Korea says there is "no chance" to disarm unilaterally without confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the extended sanctions deepened distrust in the United States and that there was no chance the country would give up nuclear weapons unilaterally in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the World Body that North Korea had taken “significant measures of goodwill” last year, such as the shutdown of nuclear missile tests, the dismantling of nuclear-powered nuclear-powered missiles, and the dismantling of nuclear-powered missiles.
"However, we do not see an appropriate response from the United States," he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and under such conditions there will be no way to unilaterally disarm first.”
Although Ri reiterated North Korea’s well-known complaints of Washington’s resistance to nuclear disarmament “in stages,” according to which North Korea would be gradually rewarded for its steps taken as a step forward, Pence’s remark seemed significant because it did not go away.
Ri alluded to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit of the current U.S. president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work towards "nuclear disarmament" at the summit.
North Korea is calling for a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also refused to let go of stringent international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'nuclear disarmament first and foremost' and increases the level of pressure by sanctions to achieve its goal by force, and even opposes the 'declaration of an end to the war,' Ree said.
“The perception that sanctions can’t kneel is a delusional dream of people who don’t know us.
But the problem is that the existing sanctions deepen our distrust.”
Ri did not mention the plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader stressed at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister underlined the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: “If the other side in this nuclear disarmament problem is concerned, then the nuclear deal was more South Korea than the United States, rather than the United States.”
Moreover, the tone of Ri’s speech was significantly different from last year’s, when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting North Korea’s missiles to the U.S. mainland was inevitable since the “Mr. Evil President”’s “Self-Defense” speech.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who threatened last year with "total destruction" of North Korea, praised Kim much for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said that he remained to do a lot of work and that sanctions had to remain.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for it, stating “Whether it takes two years, three years or five months – it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps he has taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that “the Security Council’s sanctions must continue in full and without exceptions until they are fully, finally, confirmed.”
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in order to prevent the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the O.N. General Assembly, and then stated that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last time did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July with a statement that progress had been made, but was denied by North Korea only a few hours later due to "gangster demands".
North Korea is committed to a meeting with Moon this month over the disarmament of a missile facility as well as a nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
He said Kim told him that the “appropriate measures” he was seeking were the security guarantees Trump had given in Singapore, as well as moves toward normalizing relations with Washington.
<0xE2><0x86><0x90> Harvard Students Visit Courses to Get Enough Rest
The University of Harvard’s new course this year aims to teach all graduates to more sleep in order to combat the growing cat-culture of learning by staying awake all night with the help of caffeine.
One researcher found that students at the world’s leading university often don’t know anything when it comes to basic self-care.
Charles Chaisler, a professor of dream medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Women's Hospital Brigham, designed the course he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after holding a speech about the impact of insufficient sleep on learning.
“At the end of the lecture, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why are you telling me this now, in the last year?’
She said that no one ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," he told the Telegraph.
The course, which was offered for the first time this year, explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits help in academic and athletic outcomes, and also improve overall well-being.
Paul Barrera, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the university's executive director of health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after they discovered that students had a serious lack of sleep during the course.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one part there is a picture of a student’s home where students press coffee cups, curtains, slides and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how poor sleep affects athletic performance and the importance of bedtime routine.
In another part, participants learn about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes, depression, and cancer.
The map of the campus, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know it won’t change the behavior of the students right away.
But we believe they have a right to know – just as you have a right to know about the health effects when you choose to smoke cigarettes.”
A culture of pride with “work all night” still exists, he said, and in addition, modern technology and increasing pressure on students mean that lack of sleep is a growing problem.
To have enough sleep, with good quality, should be the student's "secret weapon" in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even to avoid obesity rather than fatigue, because a lack of sleep causes a brain injury.
Raymond Sow, a 19-year-old student of chemistry and physical biology from California, helped Professor Chaisler design the course after attending one of his classes last year, in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to act as a course throughout the student city.
He hopes that the next step is to ask all postgraduates to complete a similar program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Chaisler recommends that students think about setting an alarm on when to go to bed, as well as when to wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of the “blue light” emitted by the light emitted by the electronic screens and the LED light emitted by the light emitted by the light.
Livingstone 1 - 0 Rangers: Manga's goal draws Gerard's men
The Rangers suffered another shocking, sad day when Dolly Menga's blow sent Steven Gerard's team to a 1–0 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to record their first win after a 4–1 victory in St. Johnston in February, but Gerry Holt's team brought a second defeat to Gerard's team in 18 games as a team-league manager who left their team with eight points behind.
Menga scored seven minutes before half-time and Rangers' position lost inspiration and chances of aligning.
Now the Rangers have fallen to sixth place, and Livingston have climbed to third and are only behind Hibernian according to the difference in goals.
There may be additional problems awaiting Rangers after line judge Kalum Spence had to receive medical help because of a head injury after he was apparently hit with an object from a distance.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that passed Air in the semi-finals of the Bethfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, was playing with the same 11 of Livingston who scored a point with the Harts last week and would have been happy with the way his well-trained settling down the opponents at every opportunity.
Rangers may have dominated the possession of the ball, but Livingston did more with the ball than they did.
They were supposed to score a point, two minutes after Menga's first loss smashed Scott Pittman to Alan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed the chance.
Then a long-distance strike by Kihan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halket, but his defense partner Alan Litgow could only play openly in the defense.
Rangers managed to control the game, but it seemed that there was more hope than faith in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should get a penalty in the fifteenth minute when he and Steven Lawles clashed, but Judge Steven Thomson gave no sign of the Colombian's appeal.
The Rangers managed to score only two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not shy away from Lasana Kulibali's head-to-head and Ovi Edaria's weak hit.
Although the start of the 34th minute of Livingston may have been opposite during the game, no one can deny that they deserved according to their game.
Again, the Rangers were unable to cope with the Jacobs strike.
Scott Alfred did not respond when Declan Gallagher added the ball to Scott Robinson, who with a cool head chose Menga for a simple end.
Gerard reacted during the halftime when he replaced Kulabali with Ryan Kent, and the replacement had a quick impact when the winger passed Morelos, but the impressive Kelly reacted from his line with a blockade.
But Livingstone managed to attract guest players to play the type of game they enjoyed, with Litgow and Hackett catching many of the long additions.
Holt's team could have extended the lead towards the end of the game, but McGregor was well positioned and prevented Jacobs from playing head-to-head in front of Litgow.
Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton had another request for a penal after colliding with Jacobs, but Thomson did not approve again.
Almanac: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now one side of our almanac "On a Sunday in the Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and WE WANT ... the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, discoveries that led to the creation of a device known as a Geiger counter.
Since then it has become a major backbone of science, the Geiger counter has become a major backbone of popular culture, as in the 1950 film The Bell of Colorado, in which these seemingly inconclusive, cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans perform:
Man: “What’s that again?”
Rogers: “It’s a geiger counter, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
“When you put your headphones on, you can hear the effects of atoms that release radioactivity into the minerals.”
Evans: “Say, it must jump now!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the discovery that bears his name continues to exist.
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach the Immune System to ‘Look’ at Removed Cells
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach the Immune System to ‘Look’ at Removed Cells and Kill Them
Vaccine Teaches the Immune System to Recognize Removed Cells as Part of Treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and their modification in the laboratory.
You can "see" the protein frequency in many types of cancer, and then be returned to the body
The test vaccine gives promising results in patients with multiple types of cancer.
In a woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize the cells removed, ovarian cancer disappeared in 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein frequency in many types of cancer called HER2, and then returning them to the body.
Professor Jay Berzoffski, from the American National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that we have a vaccine that promises a lot.”
HER2 “incites the growth of several types of cancer,” including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, Professor Berzofski explained.
A similar approach by extracting immune cells from patients and their "learning" how to target cancer cells functions in the treatment of a particular type of leukemia.
Kanye West made a pro-Trump outing, wearing a drop with his motto, after a live performance on Saturday night.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was spotted in the studio during a live show on Saturday night, after a useless performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
After performing the third song that night, called City of Ghosts, in which he wore a drop of Let's Make America Glorious Again, he began to criticize the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“When I talk to a white man, they often say, ‘How do you like Trump, he’s a racist?’”
“If I was concerned about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago,” he said.
The Saturday night live show began with a satire with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star laughed at Bret Cavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Legal Affairs Commission in connection with allegations of sexual assault of Christine Blaise Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the video of West's demise was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to make fun of West with the announcement.
West also complained to the audience that it was difficult to get behind the scenes because of his drop.
“I was laughed at behind the scenes.
They told me, "Don't show up with that drop."
They made fun of me!
“Then they told me I was in the spotlight,” he said, according to Washington Exeminer.
Vest went on, “You want to see the last place?” he said, “He’s going to put his superman-drop, because that means you can’t tell me what to do. You want the world to move on?
Treat yourself with love.”
His comments attracted outrage from the audience at least twice, and the team on the evening show seemed embarrassed, Varajeti reported, one man told the publisher: “The whole studio is busy.”
The news was brought as a last-minute replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper McMiller, died a few days ago.
Vest surprised many with the performance of the song "I Love It", dressed as Perrier's bottle.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPSAD, Kendis Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "For one of the bravest ghosts: YOU HAVE GOT WHAT YOU HAVE SELL ON TOLPAT."
But the show's host Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West "was her own and that's absolutely wonderful."
“But I chose NOT to reward someone (by buying his music or housing or supporting his ‘art’) whom I believe he accepts and spreads an ideology that is detrimental to my community.
He's free.
“So are we,” she added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, making him now "formally known as Caine West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Didy, also known as Pap Dedy, Pap and P Didy.
The rapper's colleague, Snoop Dog, has the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the late musical legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol, and then to the artist formerly known as Prince.
Accused of Assassination at Belfast Restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after beating a man in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Balihakmor, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before a high court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be dealt with by the public prosecutor.
Game of Thrones star, Keith Harington, has attacked toxic masculinity.
Keith Harington is known for his role as a wizard in the violent, medieval, fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, attacked the stereotype of a cat-hero, when he stated that such on-screen roles mean that young boys often feel they have to be tough to be respected.
In a statement for the Sunday Times cultural section, Keith said he believed "something is wrong" and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the <0x23>SegaCauve era.
Keith, who recently married Game of Thrones star Rosie Leslie, also 31, admits he has “strong feelings” about it.
“Personally I have strong feelings at the moment – where did we go wrong with masculinity?” he said.
“What do we teach men when they grow up about the problems we see now?”
Keith believes that television may be partly responsible for the growth of toxic masculinity, thanks to strong male characters.
He continued: “What is born, and what is learned?
What does TV teach, and what on the street, make young boys feel that they must have a certain side of masculinity?
I think that’s one of the big questions of our time – how do we change that?
Because it's obvious that something's wrong with young men."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in a sequel to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, saying it "ends with battles and horses".
From November, Keith will perform in Sam Shepard's True West revival, a story about a film producer and his brother who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he thinks that what he met his wife Rose is the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife in this series, so in a way she gave me the future family and my life in the future,” he said.
Rose played Game, a character who had a love interest with Keith's character, John Snow, in the fantastic series that won Amy's awards.
The couple married in June 2018 on the estate of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% jump in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people live in the country, according to health authorities.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The majority of new cases have been transmitted through sex, which is a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly across some parts of China as a result of transfusions with infected blood.
But the number of people suffering from HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
From year to year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has grown by 100,000 people.
Transmission of HIV through sex is an urgent issue for the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against people from the LGBT community is high.
Because of the conservative values of the country, research shows that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will ever marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the disease are due to inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies data provided by a staff member related to a Republican party senator as “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday dismissed allegations that a member of her staff had posted the personal information of three U.S. Republican senators on Wikipedia's lawmakers' pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat assured that the claims were made by "ultra-right" sympathizers and web sites.
“Lies, lies, and even more nasty lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information reportedly includes the home address and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsay Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hach of Utah.
The information came online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person in Capitol Hill as the Senate hearing panel on allegations of sexual misconduct against Bret Cavanaugh, a Supreme Court judge, last week.
The information was released shortly after Kavanaugh’s interrogation by three senators.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pandit and Redstone have announced that the IP address that identifies the source of the announcement is linked to the Waters office and information about a member of the Waters staff has been released, Hill said.
“These unfortunate accusations are completely false and represent an absolute lie,” Waters said.
“The member of my staff – whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these false and false accusations – is in no way responsible for the information conveyed.
The unfortunate accusations are completely false and are an absolute lie.”
Waters' statement quickly attracted criticism on the Internet, including former White House press secretary Ari Flysher, who was also a member of the White House.
“These denials are nerve-wracking,” Flieger wrote.
“This shows that she doesn’t have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he has not done, he should not be angry.
It can't be challenged.
He is not allowed to question the motives of the defendant.
He has to be calm and calm.”
Fletcher seems to have compared Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navaro, a Republican candidate who is running to replace Waters in the mid-term elections, was also announced on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's a big deal," he wrote on Twitter.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had notified “the relevant institutions and the police of the false claims.
“We will allow the perpetrators to be identified,” she continued, “and that they will be legally responsible for all their actions that are harmful and dangerous to some and all members of my staff.”
The thought of Johnny English Attacks Again – Undercuts Rowan Atkinson’s Espionage Fraud
Now it is traditional to look for elements of Brexit in every new British-related film, and that seems to be the case for this remake of the fraudulent, action comedy franchise Johnny English - which began in 2003 with Innocent Johnny English and repeated in 2011 with J.
Is the careful self-measurement of the subject of how obvious we are to nowhere will be the new export opportunity that the nation has?
Despite this, the face with big eyes and a lot of grime on the incompetent Johnny English got a license to "fry" things a second time - his name above all means that he is a comic creation with a wide scope, made for the viewers in the cinema in no place.
He is certainly a sketch of a secret agent who, despite his bizarre efforts for careful glamour after a little resemblance to Clouseau, has drawings of Mr. Bin and part of the boy playing a note of the song Lodon Cochii on fire from the 2012 opening ceremony of the painting Ollym.
Its basis is the traveler and mysterious international man Atkinson who once performed in Barclays' now-forgotten TV commercial, leaving chaos behind.
There are one or two moments in Johnny English's latest edition.
I like it a lot when Johnny English approaches a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor, and the wings of the rotor hit his helmet.
Atkinson's obsession with physical comedy can be seen, but the humor seems weak and somewhat superficial, especially since "serious" film brands such as 007 and Impossible Mission themselves contain elements of comedy.
Humor seems to be meant for children rather than adults, and for me Johnny English’s crazy accidents are not as inventive and focused as the non-sticks on Atkinson’s character, Bean.
The theme that has been going on all the time is that the UK is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated a super-secret network of spies in Britain, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground, to the disappointment of the agent on duty - a disappointing little role for Kevin Eldon.
In the last chance for a prime minister who is a pompous and combative figure and already suffers from a complete meltdown of political unpopularity: Emma Thomson gives herself this kind of quasi-Theresa-May, but there is nothing special in the script that would work.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that since every active spy is compromised, she will have to activate one of the retired.
And that means calling himself Johnny English who now works as a private school teacher, but "on black" gives classes for secret agents: there are a few good guys here, when English offers a school of espionage that resembles a rock academy.
English was quickly summoned to Whitehall for an instant briefing and reunited with former co-worker Bow, played by Ben Miller.
Bow is now a married man, in connection with a submarine commander, a comic role in which Vicky Pepperdine is not well used.
Well, Batman and Robin, for the hilarity of all things in the Royal Secret Service, return to action and meet the fatally beautiful Ophelia Bulletova, a character played by Olga Kirilenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls under the dangerous influence of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain’s computer problems: the vicious Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacey.
English and Bowe begin their odyssey of absurd procedures: disguised as waiters they set a French restaurant on fire; they make a desert after they smuggle themselves into the luxury yacht of the Volta; and the so-called Dahlia in the Valley of the Dahlias.
All the brakes have been removed for the last sequence, but as polite and noisy as it is, there are quite a lot of children's TVs throughout the film.
Nice moderate stuff.
And like other Johnny English movies, I can’t help but think: Can’t the British film industry give him the role of Rowan Atkinson who will use his talent?
Labour denies cutting plans for the British to work four days a week, but to be paid for five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will consider a radical plan that would allow the British to work four days a week - but be paid for five.
The party is said to want company leaders to take advantage of the savings they make with artificial intelligence to give workers another day off.
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend - but would take the same salary.
According to the sources, the idea "fits" with the economic agenda of the party and plans for the country to be more inclined to the workers.
The transition to a four-day working week has been backed by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to benefit from the changes in the economy.
A senior member of the party told the Sunday Times: “The revision of the strategy should be announced before the end of the year.
“It’s not going to happen overnight, but a four-day working week is a pursuit that is consistent with the party’s approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of the workers, as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labor Party won’t be the first to accept such an idea, the Green Party campaigned for a four-day working week during the 2017 parliamentary election campaign.
However, the aspiration is not accepted by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “The four-day working week is not a party strategy and the party is not considering such an idea.”
Shadow Chancellor John MacDonald took advantage of last week’s Labour conference to present his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to seize the power of “faceless directors” and “profits” in utilities.
The shadow chancellor’s plans also mean that current shareholders in water supply companies may not get the whole share back because the Labour government could make “deductions” because of unethical behavior.
He also confirmed plans for workers to become part of the company’s boards and create Inclusive-Owned Funds with 10 percent of private company capital to be owned by employees, who will be able to take an annual dividend of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John F. Kennedy Gives ‘60 Minutes’ Statement on whether FBI Investigation of Cavanaugh May Rethink
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Bret Kavanaugh postponed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week and updated the question of whether the Bureau's findings could rethink some Republican senators' submissions.
In an interview published on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelly asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could find something that would make them think.
Kennedy was more open-minded than his fellow South Carolinas.
“I think so,” Kennedy said.
“I said when I went to the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the charges were made, and I said, "Did you do that?"
He was strong, determined, unequivocal.”
Graham’s voice, however, appears to be swollen in stone.
“My decision has been made for Brett Kavanaugh and a shocking charge is needed,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett was vigorously denying it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blaise Ford.
“All of the things he said he couldn’t confirm.
That's 36 years old.
I don’t see anything new to change.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty? <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
This Saturday in New York City will be held the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event featuring celebrities and having an impressive mission; the end of poverty.
Now held for the seventh time, and the Global Citizen Festival will be attended by tens of thousands of people who will come to the big lawn in the central park, not only to enjoy the cradle of the dachshund, but also to perform under names such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B. and Sean Manson.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is a continuation of the project against global poverty, an international activist group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
In order to get a free ticket for the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), participants must perform several tasks or "actions" such as volunteering, sending a postal mail to us for you to submit an e-mail to a global leader, a phone call, or some other course.
But how successful is a Global Citizen because there are 12 years left to achieve the whole thing?
Is the idea of a free concert a real way to convince people to ask to take something or just another case of “click-activism” – people who feel they are making a real difference by signing a petition on the Internet or sending a message?
As of 2011, Global Citizens have claimed to have registered more than 19 million "activities" from supporters, which acted for many different purposes.
They say these activities have helped motivate world leaders to deliver commitments and strategies that have raised more than $37 billion and will impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 promises and announcements resulting from their activities, of which $10 billion has already been sent or collected.
The group estimates that the funds raised have a direct influence on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key pledges are the Food Power, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers, dedicated to “helping children to exploit their potential”, which promises to provide more than $35 million to Rwanda for help around the world.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens alike, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a note in history,” Ambassador Tracy Ulman of the Food Power said in a 2018 address to the people gathered at the end.
The group also said more than 5,000 activities were taken related to calls to improve nutrition for mothers and children in the UK, the government announced funding for the project, The Power of Nutrition, which will include 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on their website, “Why do you think you can put an end to extreme poverty?”
From a Global Citizen they replied: “It will be a long and difficult road – we will never succeed.
But, like the big civil and anti-apartheid movements in front of us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mona are some of the artists who will perform at this year’s event in New York, hosted by Deborah-Lee Furnes and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the navy for a “blockade” in order to prevent Russian energy exports - Interior Ministry
Washington may "if necessary" use the Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching the market, including the Middle East, said U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinki, as quoted by Washington Exeminer.
According to Zinki, Russia’s intervention in Syria – namely, where it operates at the invitation of a legitimate government – is paramount to explore new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is because of the energy market, just like they are in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe,” he said.
And according to the government, there are ways to deal with it.
“The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that the seaways remain open and if necessary by blockade to prevent their energy from reaching the market,” he said.
Zinki addressed the attendees of an event organized by the Energy Consumers Alliance, a non-profit group that presents itself as the “voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He continued to compare Washington’s approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that he is effectively the same.
“The economic option of Iran and Russia is, more or less, raising the deposit and replacing the fuel,” he said, while talking about Russia as “one more uncomfortable pony” with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statement came after the Trump administration began a mission to boost exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To that end, officials in the Trump administration, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to step down from the “inappropriate” North Tech 2 gas pipeline project, which, according to Trump, has made a “prisoner” of Berlin.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Tech 2 pipeline, which is worth $11 billion, should double the current capacity of the 110 billion cubic meters pipeline, is only an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s firm opposition to the project is for economic reasons only and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that customers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow.
The U.S. position was met with resistance from Germany, which confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States not to interfere in Europe’s energy policy and in bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third party interferes in our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, the first person in the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will “carefully consider” whether to run for president in 2020, Massachusetts Senator said.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would “carefully consider” whether to run for president after the mid-term elections.
During a meeting at the city assembly in Holiok, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering running.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix our dysfunctional government, which means a woman at the head,” she said.
“After November 6th, I will carefully consider whether I should run for president.”
Warren assessed President Donald Trump’s work during the city council meeting and said he “led the state in the wrong direction.
“I’m too worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren is open in her criticisms of Trump and the man he nominates as a Supreme Court judge, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "it is clear that we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that a large number of voters in its constituency think it should not be running in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts' "probable" voters said the senator should not run, according to a poll by the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe Center for Political Research.
Thirty-two percent support such a candidacy.
The poll showed more support for the nomination of former governor Dewal Patrick, with 38 percent supporting a potential nomination, while 48 percent opposed it.
Other well-known names from the Democratic Party that are being discussed for nomination in 2020 are former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Payline talks about track payline's post-traumatic syndrome at Donald Trump rally
Track Paylin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enrolling in September.
He was arrested and charged in an incident of domestic violence on Monday evening.
“What my son goes through, what he goes through after he returns, I know how other families feel that have been torn apart because of the post-traumatic syndrome and the wounds that our soldiers are returning with,” she said in front of audiences at a rally for Donald Trump in Trump.
Peylin called the arrest "an elephant in the room" and said that her son and other military veterans "return a little different, they come back fortified, they come back for the coyote and ask whether there is respect for what they and their fellow trains do."
He was arrested on Monday in Basil, Alaska and charged with domestic violence by assaulting a woman, along with a report of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the influence of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Basil police.
18 U.S. States and the City of Washington Support Debating New Asylum Policy
Eighteen states and the city of Washington support the challenge of a new U.S. policy that prevents the granting of asylum to victims fleeing domestic or gang violence.
Representatives of 18 states and the city of Washington filed a petition to the court (amicus curiae) on Friday in Washington in support of an asylum seeker who is challenging the policy, the NBC News reported.
The full name of the prosecutor in the Grace v. Parliament case, which the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy, has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and the violent members of his gang" abused her, but U.S. authorities rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was locked up in Texas.
The state attorney representing Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, where a large number of U.S. asylum claims originate, as nations with ongoing problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturns a 2014 decision by the Immigration Complaints Board that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Carl Rasin said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of enactment of laws at the federal and international levels."
“Federal law requires all asylum requests to be adapted to certain facts and circumstances of the request and such a provision violates that principle,” according to the petition to the court (amicus curiae).
In addition, advocates in the letter argue that the policy that prevents immigrants from entering is detrimental to the U.S. economy because they are likely to become entrepreneurs “to offer the necessary workforce.”
Attorney General Jeff Seshns ordered immigration judges to refrain from granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June, according to Reuters.
“There is asylum for those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in a June 11 political presentation.
Asylum has never been conceived as a solution to all the problems -- not even all the serious problems -- that people around the world face every day.
There are desperate rescue efforts being made in Palu as the number of victims doubled in the race to find themselves survivors.
For the survivors, the situation is unbelievably serious.
"It's very tense," 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma said as she nursed her male baby in an evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
“Every minute, the ambulances carry the bodies.
There is no clean water.”
Residents return to their destroyed homes and choose from their guided items in order to save something they can.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Duy Harris, who has broken back and shoulder, rested in front of the Military Hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside, due to frequent minor earthquakes.
The tears came to his eyes when he described the strong earthquake in the hotel room on the fifth floor in which he was with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to save ourselves.
I was pushed into the ruins of the wall, so I think," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in the city for a wedding.
“I heard my wife asking for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and the child.
I hope they’re safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of “Maltreatment” with “Propaganda”
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in a U.S. daily listing the mutual benefit of trade between the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. media.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday talked about a paid supplement to China's De Moyne Register - the best-selling newspaper in Iowa - after accusing China of meddling in the U.S. congressional election on Nov. 6.
Trump's accusations that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US election marked a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China, along with the US news agency Reuters.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to publish advertisements for trade promotion, Beijing and Washington are currently in a trade war in which import tariffs are leveled against each other.
China's retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were aimed at exporters from states such as Iowa, which support Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and American experts confirmed.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, the main exporter of agricultural products in China, said Beijing was hurting U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, writes Brandt in a column in the Sunday edition of the De Moin Register, “is now doubling the abuse with propaganda ads in our free press.”
“In the de-semination of propaganda, the Chinese government abuses the cherished American tradition of free speech and free media by placing advertisements in the De Moin Register,” wrote Branstad.
“Conversely, in the nearby newspaper stand, here in Beijing, you can find only a limited number of opinions and you won’t see a real reflection of the desperate opinions that the Chinese people may have about China’s problematic economic trajectory,” he said.
He added that "one of the most read newspapers in China has declined his offer to publish" the column, although he did not say which newspaper is concerned.
Republicans are moving away from women's votes ahead of mid-term elections because of debate with Kavanaugh, analysts warn
Since many Republicans do not observe or defend Bret Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court despite several allegations of sexual assault, analysts warn that there will be negative consequences, especially from women in the upcoming elections.
The emotions surrounding the case are extremely strong, and most Republicans have already made it clear that they want to proceed with the vote.
There is no turning back from such things," wrote Grant Richer, a professor of political science at the Maxwell University School of Syracuse, for Hill, in a column published on Saturday.
Richard said he doubted that pressure on the FBI's investigation into Senator Jeff Flick (Republican of Arizona) would be enough to calm the angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday — they will not forget tomorrow, nor in November,” Karin Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, told the Washington D.C. newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, the protesters shouted "November is coming!" at a protest in the Senate hallway, when the Republicans, who have control of the Legal Affairs Commission, decided to continue with the appointment of Mr. Myopyon, despite the testimony of Dr. Klester.
“The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be high,” Stu Rotenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, told the news site.
“People are saying they’re tall; that’s right.
But they can be higher, especially among independent women voters in the suburbs and young voters, aged 18 to 29, who, although they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford's public testimony, which detailed her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggest that there could be negative consequences if Republicans continue to vote. (more...)
“This has become a big mess for the Republican Party,” Michael Styl, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier this week, according to NBC news.
“It’s not just about the vote on the committee or the last vote or whether Cavanaugh will go to a hearing, it’s also about the way Republicans deal with this and how they treated it,” said Guy Cécile, director of U.S. Priorities.
However, the Americans are divided about who to trust after Ford and Cavanaugh's testimony, although more people accept the first-mentioned side.
A new survey by Yu-Gov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitively or likely believe in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitively or likely believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh was probably or definitely a liar at the testimony, while only 30 percent thought the same about Ford.
Following Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one more, of Deborah Ramirez, according to the Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh had attacked her in a drunken state when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez accuses the Supreme Court referee of showing her genitals at a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The World Network's fan is planning to launch a new Internet to challenge Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the fan of the World Network, starts a startup business that claims to be a rival to Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrapt, is a company built on the open-source Solid platform of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and which people have access to what information they have.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's intention was "world domination".
“We have to do it now,” he said of the start-up business.
“It’s a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid's technology to enable people to create their own "internet data warehouse" or short POD.
It can contain contact lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available on one browser at a time.
What is unique about the personal data warehouse on the Internet is that it only depends on the user who has access to a certain type of information.
The company calls this “personal reinforcement through data.”
Inrapt’s idea, according to the company’s CEO John Bruce, is to provide the company with the resources, process, and appropriate skills for Solid to be accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several development developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer encoders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on Inrapt’s website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether to make a complete change where their business models are completely turned upside down overnight.
“We’re not asking for their permission.”
In a statement to Media, published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that “Inrapt’s mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that will help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on the basis of Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet with the founding of the Consortium of the World Network of the Institute of Technology in Massachusetts.
Recently, Berners-Lee has been an influential speaker in the debate over internet neutrality.
Even at the start of Inrapt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Network Consortium, the Internet Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m very optimistic about the new era of the Internet,” Berners-Lee said.
Bernard Van: Famous Victorian Cross Carrier of the First World War
The only priest of the Anglican Church to receive the Victorian Cross during World War I as a fighter has been celebrated in his hometown for 100 years.
Colonel, Honorable Bernard Van was admitted on 29 September 1918 in an attack on Belengles and Lechaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he received the highest British military award.
A commemorative stone was discovered by his two grandsons at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said it was "an incredible symbol" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather received the award.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Colonel Van led his battalion through the Canal de Saint-Quentin "Under a very thick fog and under a strong fire of bullets and machine guns".
He later ran to the spot from where he was shot and "with the greatest courage" drove forward, before attacking a ballast and disabling three of the servicemen.
Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 – almost a month before the war ended.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather’s work was “something I know I’ll never be able to do, but it’s something that doesn’t make me humble.”
He and his brother Dr. James Van also placed a wreath after the parade led by the Young Imperial Band of Brentwood.
Michael Van said he was "very honoured to be part of the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that many people will give".
Fans of the combined martial arts remained awake all night to watch the White House 206, instead they got Pepa Pigs
Imagine, you've been up all night to watch the White House 206, not having the opportunity to watch the main event.
The San Jose list contained 13 fights, including six with the main card that was shown live all night in Britain on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gerard Musassi and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in Britain were stunned when the channel switched to Pepa Pigs.
Some were not impressed after they stayed awake until the early hours of the fight.
One of Twitter's fans described the transfer of a children's cartoon as "some sick joke."
“The law is such that at 6 a.m. that content was inappropriate, so it had to be transferred to a children’s program,” said Dave Schwarz, vice president of the White House of Marketing and Communications, when asked about the transmission.
"A pig's ass, yeah."
Belator Scott Cooker, president of the company, said it would work on a schedule that would involve viewers from the UK in the future.
“I think when I think about relaunching, I think we can probably find a solution,” Cooker said.
“But it’s six o’clock in the morning on a Sunday and we won’t be able to find a solution on a week at our own time and on a Monday at their own time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, we got a lot of messages during the transfer, and none of them were benevolent.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical mistake.
But it wasn't, it was a legal matter.
I can promise you it won't happen again.
“We’re going to limit the number of fights to five, instead of six – as we usually do – we tried to deliver more because of the fans and we exaggerated.
It's an unfortunate situation.
Discs on a deserted island: Tom Daley felt “inferior” over sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality — but that motivated him to be successful.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize until he went to high school that "everyone's not like me"
Speaking on Radio 4's first show Disco on a deserted island, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that becoming a parent was forcing him to worry less about winning the Olympics.
The regular presenter of the long-running show Kirsty Young, took a month-long break from illness.
Appearing as a comparator on Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "less" than everyone else as he grew up because "it wasn't socially acceptable to have sympathies for boys and girls."
He said, “Until this day, those feelings of inferior value and diversity were the things that gave me the power and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “something,” he said, so that he wouldn’t disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-bronze medalist became a well-known supporter of the LGBT campaigns and used his performance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke in public because he felt happy that he could live openly without division and wanted to give “hope” to others.
The three-time world champion said of falling in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who met him in 2013 - "surprised me".
Daley got married to the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but said the age difference was never a problem.
"When you go through so much at an early age" - he went to the first Olympics at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar heights and heights.
The two became parents in June to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that "all his looks" had changed.
“If you asked me last year, it was all about ‘I have to win a gold medal,’” he said.
“You know what, there are more important things than an Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
His son is named after his father Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40, after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Dale said his father did not agree to die and one of the last things he asked was if they had tickets to London 2012 - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘You’re not going to be here to be first,’” he said.
“I held my hand when he stopped breathing and when he actually stopped breathing and died, I finally realized he was invincible,” he said.
The following year Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“I just knew that this is what I’ve been dreaming about all my life – jumping in front of the home audience at the Olympics, there’s no better feeling,” he said.
It also inspired his first choice of a song - Heder Small's Pride - that turned his head in preparation for the Olympics and from which he still struggled.
Discs on a deserted island on BBC Radio 4 is on Sunday at 11:15 British Summer Time.
Michaelson, a horse not in shape, was at the club during the Rider Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Michaelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays in the 47th Ryder Cup, but will have to change his form to avoid an unfortunate turnaround.
Michaelson, who played at the biennial event, a record 12th time, was sent to the club by captain Jim Furrick during Saturday's doubles and fours.
Instead of being at the center of attention, as the United States often represents, the five-time winner, he split the time to continue and practice his game, on the scale, in the hopes of fixing what silenced him.
He has never been the best leader, not even at the top of his career, the 48-year-old is not an ideal choice for the narrow Le Golf National, where far-flung rough hits are a regular penalty for inattention.
And if the field itself isn't scary enough, Michelson, in the ninth game of the week, is faced with the precise British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who plays in pairs with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four.
If the Americans, who are missing four points in front of 12 individual matches, start hard, Michaelson’s game could be crucial.
Furick expressed confidence in his man, not that he could see anything else.
“He fully understands the role he played today, touches me on my back and puts his hand around me and says he’ll be ready tomorrow,” Furick said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He’s been a part of the celebrities and has given a lot for these teams in the past and this week.
I didn’t know how to play two games.
I thought more, but that's what we thought we had to do.
He likes to play, just like everyone else.”
Mikelson will break Nick Faldo's record for the most-played Ryder Cup games of the week.
It could be the end of a career in the Ryder Cup where he has never achieved the best results in his individual career.
Michaelson has 18 wins, 20 games lost and seven halves, although Furick said his presence carries something intangible in the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's sensitive, he wants to joke with people and he's a great guy at team meetings," he said.
“I think the younger players were having fun playing with him, just like this week, which was fun to watch.
He has a lot more to offer than just a game.”
European captain Thomas Byorn knows that the great leadership may soon disappear.
Thomas Byorn, the European captain, knows from experience that significant lead ahead of individual matches on the final day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a noncompetitive position.
The Dane made his debut at a game in Valderama in 1997, when the guy led by Steve Balesteros had a five-point lead ahead of the Americans, but "I crossed the finish line only with the goalkeepers", with a minimum lead of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“I remind myself that we had a big lead in Valderama; we had a big lead in Brooklyn, when we lost in Valderama, when we won for a little while,” Bjorn said, pictorially, after watching the Goa’s Goa’s Goa’s 2018 class win 5–3 in Friday.
Well, history will show me and everyone on the team that this is not over.
You're ready for tomorrow.
Go out and play it right.
It’s not over as long as the game lasts.
We have a goal, and that is to try to win the trophy and the focus remains on that.
All the time I say, I focus on 12 players in our team, but we are fully aware of the opposing side - the best players in the world."
Bjorn said: “I don’t want to give an early grade on that issue. I’m happy with the results of his players on a difficult golf course.
Tomorrow's game is a different beast.
Tomorrow we are going to have individual games, and that’s a different thing.
It’s great to play with a partner when things go well, but when you play individually, then all skills are tested as a golfer.
That's the message that should be sent to the players, to give themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner and he has to give his best."
Unlike Bjorn, opponent Jim Furick will ask players to play better individually than they played in pairs, with the exceptions of Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Fourick himself was on both ends of the changes on the last day, as he was part of the winning team at Brooklyn before finishing as a loser when Europe performed "The Miracle in Medina".
“I remember every word there,” he said when asked about how Ben Cranshaw, the captain of 1999, united the players before the last day.
“We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we want to start like at the last start we saw in Brooklyn, as we saw in Medina.
When the momentum moves in a certain direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle matches.
We put the line up right and the order of the team is according to how we feel, you know, we want to make magic tomorrow.”
Thomas was given the task of opposing first and facing Rory McLaren's most important match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Polter with the other Europeans in the most important half of the order.
“I decided to act like this with the guys because I think we’re going to cover it all,” Bjorn said of the choice in the individual games.
The new German warship has been rescheduled.
The latest German naval frigate was due to be delivered in 2014 to replace outdated warships from the Cold War era, but that won’t happen until at least next year due to incorrect systems and rising prices, local media reported.
The delivery of Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the new frigate Baden-Wittenberg class, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper DiCity, referring to a spokesman for the military.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but the problematic issues after delivery hampered the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wittenberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will be a replacement for the outdated Bremen-class frigates.
It is known that they will contain a powerful top, a large number of anti-aircraft weapons and naval missiles, as well as some stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic trace.
Among other important features is the rare maintenance - it should be possible, the latest frigates, to be absent for up to two years from home ports.
However, the constant delays mean that modern warships — which are supposed to enable Germany to have power over the oceans — will already be outdated by the time they enter service, DiCity notes.
The unfortunate F125 frigate reached the headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to accept the ship and returned it to the Bloom and Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media cited a number of key "software and hardware defects" that made the warship useless if sent on a combat mission.
The software shortcomings were particularly important because the Baden-Wittenberg-class ships would have a crew of about 120 sailors - only half of the crew of the older Bremen-class frigates.
It also turned out that the ship is drastically above the planned weight which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add upgrades in the future.
The Rheinland-Pfalz weighs 7,000 tons and is believed to be twice as heavy as similar-class ships used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to the problematic hardware, the cost of the entire project - including the training of the crew - also became a problem.
It is said to have reached an incredible <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.6 billion) – an increase from the initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems faced by the newest frigates are particularly important due to warnings of Germany's reduced naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee of the German parliament, confirmed that the navy "is missing ships that can be deployed".
The spokesman said the problem worsened over time, as the old ships were withdrawn from service, but no replacement ships were provided.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wittenberg class could join the navy.
The National Trust Listens to the Secret Life of the Lilies
A new survey of property in the Scottish mountain ranges is underway to discover how lilies use the range in search of food.
There is hope that the findings will provide answers to the behavior of unique flying mammals and will help in carrying out protection activities in the future.
The study of scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will follow the common and soprano lilies, as well as the coffee lilies with long ears and the goldenton lilies in Inverou Gardens, Wester Ross.
Special shooters will be placed in key locations around the property to track the activities of the lilies during the season.
An-Ace staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile research using handheld detectors.
Expert analysis of the sounds of all the images will determine the frequency depending on the type of lily.
A map of the habitats will then be drawn up to create a detailed picture of their behaviour in the area.
Rob Devar, an advisor on nature conservation at N-T-ES, hopes the results will reveal which habitats are most important for lizards and how each species uses them.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of meadows and how forests for lizards and other related species are best maintained.
The lily population in Scotland and Britain has declined significantly in the last century.
They are endangered by the construction and development that affect the beds and the loss of housing.
Windmills and lights also pose a risk, as well as adhesive tapes for flies and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks on domestic cats.
The lilies aren't really blind.
However, because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching a prey.
They use sophisticated eco-location techniques to find insects and obstacles in the flight pathway.
An-T-Es, which takes care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes lilies very seriously.
There are ten trained experts, who regularly carry out surveys, bed inspections, and sometimes rescues.
The organization even established the first and only lily reserve in Scotland on the Trive estate in Damfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species living in Scotland.
Property manager David Thomson says the property is an ideal territory for them.
“We have a great area for lily trees here in Triv,” he said.
“We have old buildings, very old two and very good housing.
But there’s a lot of unknown stuff about lily trees, so the work we do here and on other properties will help us learn more about what they need to progress.”
He stresses that it is important to check for lilies before real estate renovations are carried out because the unintentional destruction of beds can destroy up to 400 women and babies, and destroy an entire local population.
Lynxes are protected and it is illegal to kill, torture or disturb or destroy their beds.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish clerk in the Lily Protection Trust, encourages the public to help.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about lilies and our other species, we just don’t know how they live.”
Ronaldo dismisses rape charges, and lawyers will sue the German magazine <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Cristiano Ronaldo called the accusations of raping "fake news," adding that people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the indictments.
Portugal and Juventus have been accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Majorga in a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He then reportedly paid her $375,000 to avoid talking about the incident, Der Spiegel said on Friday.
Speaking on a live Instagram video of its 142 million followers, a few hours after the charges were made, Ronaldo, 33, dismissed the reports as “fake news.”
“No, no, no, no, no.
What was reported today is fake news,” the five-time winner of the gold ball said in front of his camera.
“They want to promote themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by mentioning my name, but that's part of the job.
"I'm a happy man and everything's fine," the player added laughing.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the charges, which they call “inadmissible transfer of suspicions from private life,” according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek damages for "moral damages in addition to the amount corresponding to the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
Reportedly, the incident that was the subject of the charges occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga went back to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to documents filed in the Clark District Court in Nevada.
Majorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99 percent" "a good boy", but dropped below that "one percent".
According to the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that they had sex, but that there was agreement.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and photographs of her injuries were taken in the hospital, but later agreed to a no-judicial agreement because she was afraid of retaliation "and was worried "that she would be publicly embarrassed".
The 34-year-old says she is now seeking to change the deal because she has trauma from the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on his way to join Real Madrid from Manchester United when the alleged attack occurred and this summer he moved to Italian giant Juventus with a deal worth 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain will "always regret" the loss of car makers
Britain will "always regret" if it loses its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, Business Minister Greg Clarke said on Monday.
He added that it was “concerning” what Britain had reported to the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at the plant in Burnastton, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of border stoppages in the event of a no-deal Brexit would cost jobs.
The factory in Burnastone - which produces Toyota Auris and Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“In my opinion, if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, there will be a stoppage of production at our factory,” said Marvin Cook, managing director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other carmakers in the UK have expressed concern about how cross-border trade, including Honda, Be-Em-We and Jaguar Land Rover, will function if they leave the EU without a deal.
Be-Em-We, for example, says it will close its mini-factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what car manufacturers call risks to the logistics chain in the case of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line operates on an "exactly time" system, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU, for cars according to orders.
If Britain leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be a break at the border, which the industry says could cause delays and parts shortages.
It will be impossible for Toyota to store more than a day’s supply of inventory at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, and production will stop.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's plan for future relations with the EU was "exactly designed to avoid such border checks".
“We need to have a deal. We need to have the best deal that will enable us not only to enjoy the success we are going to enjoy in the present, but to seize this opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4 today.
“The evidence not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers is that we need to be able to continue what is a very successful set of logistics chains.”
Toyota could not say how long production would have been halted, but warned in the long run that additional costs would reduce the factory’s competitiveness and cost jobs.
Peter Cuvalaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is a representative of the union in the factory, said that its members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, once they take those jobs away, they will never come back.
According to a government spokesperson, “We have drawn up a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, the White House said.
Donald Trump’s important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed for another week” as the fight over Bret Kavanaugh’s appointment to the Supreme Court as a judge continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump and Russia's aides, and the potential violation of laws by the president.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy public defender and thereby endanger Miller's independence, he said, prompting talks in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was considering wearing a camera to record talks with Trump and the possibility of the removal of the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report, however.
But with the release of the reports last Monday, he went to the White House with the intention of resigning.
Instead, the meeting with Trump was scheduled for Thursday because he was at the United Nations in New York at the time.
Trump said he "wouldn't like" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was then postponed in order to avoid a clash with the Senate Judiciary Committee's hearing in which both Mr. Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of having sex.
On Friday, Trump issued an order to conduct a one-week FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, which will further delay the vote in the Senate.
Trump’s press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she replied: "The date for the meeting is still not fixed, it could be held this week, and it could be postponed for another week in view of all the things that are happening in the Supreme Court.
But we’ll see how things go, and I’m always trying to keep the press informed.”
Some journalists dispute the claim that Sanders has not held a briefing for journalists in the White House since September 10.
The driver, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said the small number of briefings was not due to the inclination to the "big influence" of television journalists, although he added: "I would agree with the fact that they have a big influence."
She then suggested that the direct contact between Trump and the media would be increased.
“The president organizes more sessions of questions and answers than any president before him,” she said, adding without giving any evidence: “We’ve looked at those numbers.”
There will still be briefings, Sanders said, but “if the press has the opportunity to directly ask questions to the President of the United States, it’s far better than talking to me.
We try to do it more often and you are witnesses that we have done it constantly over the last few weeks, and talks with the President of the United States will replace briefings for journalists."
Trump regularly responds to questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in open sessions or press conferences when visiting senior officials.
He seldom participates in independent press conferences.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why this is so with his uncontrollable and sometimes bizarre appearance in front of assembled journalists.
The Secretary of Health wrote a letter to EU workers employed in Scotland’s national health system in connection with fears of Brexit
The health secretary wrote a letter to EU workers employed in Scotland’s national health system in which he expressed the country’s gratitude and desire to remain after Brexit.
Gene Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent the letter less than six months before the UK's withdrawal from the EU.
The Scottish government has already pledged to cover the costs of resolved status applications for EU citizens who work in lower-level public services.
Ms. Freeman wrote in her letter: “Negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on withdrawal continued during the summer, with a view to making the expected decisions this autumn.
But the UK government has also stepped up preparations for the possibility of a no-deal deal.
I know this period is very disturbing for all of you.
That’s why I wanted to stress how much I appreciate the contribution of every member of the workforce, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and more broadly share valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and are of benefit to the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home, and we really want you to stay here.”
Cristion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Christian Abercromby, the defensive linebacker of the Tennessee State Tigers, was undergoing emergency surgery after suffering a head injury on Saturday when the team lost 31-27 to the Vanderbilt Commodores, reports Mike O'Neill.
Rod Reed, the head coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the injury occurred just before halftime.
“He came to the sidelines of the playground and just tripped to the ground,” Reid said.
The coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen outside the playground, then put him in the carrier and took him to a further evaluation.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been out of surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no information on the type/degree of the injury" and "Tennessee State" is trying to find out when the injury actually occurred.
Abekrombi was a second-year student and played his first season in a red shirt at Tennessee State after his transfer from Illinois.
He made a total of five knockouts on Saturday before coming out of the game, resulting in a total of 18 knockouts this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when buying a property in the UK.
According to Tory’s new plans, foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when buying property in the UK, and these additional funds will be used to help the homeless.
This move will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s attempt to attract young voters
A higher administrative fee will be imposed on those who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom.
The ministry expects this move to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year, funds that will be used to help the homeless.
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when buying property in the United Kingdom, and these additional funds will be used to help the homeless.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s attempt to attract young voters with his promises to provide affordable housing and to focus on high-income people.
A higher administrative fee will be imposed on individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, with additional funds will intensify the government’s efforts to improve the situation with the homeless.
The additional amount that, in addition to the current administrative fee, includes the higher levels that were introduced two years ago for a second home and the purchase of the property with the intention of renting the same can reach up to three percent.
The ministry expects this move to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of newly built properties in London are purchased by persons who are not residents of the United Kingdom, which has led to a rise in prices and caused difficulties for persons who buy the property after first getting involved in this process of buying.
Many rich areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become “spirit cities” due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy was announced just a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked to cut the administrative fee to help young people buy their first home, the report said.
He accused large construction firms of offering high prices for the properties they hold the land with, but did not use it, and asked Ms May to change the quotas for access homes in order to rectify Britain’s “shameful housing situation.”
Mr. Corbyn announced a series of attractive housing reforms, including controls on the rent and ending evictions without a legitimate reason.
He also wants the councils to give them greater powers to build new homes.
Ms May said: “Last year I said I would dedicate my prime minister to returning to the British dream, that is, to make life better for every new generation.
And that means repairing our broken housing market.
“Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build life here.
However, it is not okay for people who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies, to be able to buy homes in as easy a way as valuable British residents.
The dream of owning one’s own home for many people has become too distant, and the humiliation of the homeless is too real.”
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to run Scotland'
Jack Ross, the head of Sunderland, said his "final ambition" is in the future to become the manager of the Scottish national club.
The 42-year-old enjoys the challenge of reviving the Northeastern club that is currently in third place in the first league with only three points less than the club at the top.
This summer he moved to the Stadium of Lights after returning St. Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and that's it," Ross told BBC's Scottish Sportssound.
“But I grew up constantly watching Scotland in ‘Hampden’ with my dad, and something always dragged me back.
"However, I could only get such an opportunity if I was successful in managing the club."
Some of Ross' predecessors as manager of Sunderland include Dick Lawyer, David Moyes, Sam Allardice, Martin O'Neill, Roy Kin, Gas Poet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic says he did not feel any concern knowing that he should follow such established names in such a large club after previously rejecting offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“My success at the moment is being evaluated by, ‘Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?’
Given the structure and facilities of this club, he is undoubtedly part of the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not an easy task for this club to get there, but I’m probably going to think I’ve achieved success here only if I bring the club back there.”
Ross worked as a manager for only three years, in which he entered a career after working as an assistant to the boss at Dumbarton and after a 15-month engagement as part of the Hearts coaching staff.
He then helped "Alloa" recover from falling into the third league and returned "St. Mirren" from the edge of losing to the Championship the following season.
Ross says he now feels more comfortable than when he played in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“It was probably a real crusade for me,” he recalls from the takeover of Alloa.
“I honestly believed that a career as a manager was the right choice for me, a better choice than a career as a player.
It sounds strange because I did well, I made enough of it and enjoyed certain high privileges.
But building a career as a player can be really difficult.
There are a lot of things you need to go through on a weekly basis.
I’m still going through certain things in terms of stress and work pressure, but I just feel good in the role of a manager.
I’ve always wanted to be a manager and now I’m doing it, in this role I feel more comfortable than ever in my entire adult life.”

According to one study, the perfect time for beer is at 5:30 p.m. on Saturday.
The summer heat wave has led to an increase in the profits of British pubs that are currently in a very difficult situation, but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
The figures show that pubs and bars saw sales increase by 2.7 percent in July, but restaurant profits fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of CGA’s Business Consulting Company, said: “The sunshine and longer than expected England’s participation in the World Cup meant that the July events were very similar to those of the July 2, when the profits went up.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant sales in June further deteriorated during the course of July.
The pubs and bars in which drinks are mostly sold saw a much larger increase compared to previous years, as opposed to the restaurants where the decline was observed.
The pubs in which food is mostly sold were also badly affected by the sunny periods, albeit not as dramatic as the restaurant owners.
It seems that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In successful pubs and bars, sales of beverages increased by 6.6 percent over the course of the month, and food sales by only three percent.
Paul Newman, a vacation and hospitality analyst at RSM, said: “These results follow the trend we saw at the end of April.
The timing and impact of major social and sporting events remain the most important factors when it comes to selling the market away from home.
It’s no surprise that restaurants are still in a difficult situation, although the 4.8 percent drop in sales over a one-year period will be particularly striking in addition to the current pressures generated by spending.
The long warm summer could not have come at a worse time for the owners of places where food is mostly sold and the weather will show whether the milder temperatures we had in August will provide the much-needed rest.”
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including the new ones, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the stagnant announcement of new brands.
The UK’s “Coffer Peach Tracker” sales tracking device in the pubs, bars and restaurants sector collects and analyzes data on the effectiveness of the same 47 operating groups with a combined revenue of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion and represents a return.
One in five children has a secret social media profile that they hide from their parents.
One study found that one in five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, has a secret social media profile that they hide from their parents and teachers.
The study, which involved 20,000 high school students, showed an increase in the number of “false Instagram” profiles.
The news heightened the fear that such profiles are being posted sexual content
Twenty percent of the students said they had a “main” profile that they showed to their parents.
One in five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, create a social media profile that they hide from adults.
The survey, which involved 20,000 high school students, showed a rapid increase in the number of “false Insta” profiles, an abbreviation for the Instagram website where photos are shared.
The news heightened the fear that sexual content would be posted on such profiles.
Twenty percent of the pupils said they had a cleared “main” profile that they showed to their parents, and they also had other private profiles.
A mother who accidentally found the secret profile of her 13-year-old daughter of the same found a teenager who asked others to "rape him."
A survey conducted by Digital Awareness UK and The Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) in independent schools found that 40 percent of children aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted that one of them was their own.
HMC chief Mike Bukenan said: “It’s really disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online profiles where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Elid Doyle will be the voice of the athletes on the board of Scottish Athletics.
Ellyd Doyle was elected non-executive director of the board of Scottish Athletics at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most acclaimed athlete in Scotland and President Ian Bitty has described the move as an excellent opportunity for those who are part of the leadership in this sport to take advantage of her extensive international experience gained over the past decade.
“Everyone in the Scottish, British, and world athletic community has a huge respect for Elid, and we are sure that athletes in Scotland would have a huge benefit if she became a board member,” he said.
Doyle said: "I am ready to be the voice of the athletes and I hope that I can really make my contribution and help in the correct direction of the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200- and 400-metre titles at the 1996 Atlanta Games, despite winning a total of four gold medals at the Olympics and who now appears regularly as a commentator on the BBC, couldn't have gone on a run since suffering a trench.
He tweeted: “I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't go.
The doctors told me that only time will tell if I'm recovering or to what extent.
The whole process was hard, but I was able to fully recover, again I can go and do agility exercises!
Thank you for your message of encouragement!”
Advertising for a breast pump in which mothers are compared to cows causes divisiveness of opinion on the Internet
A breast pump manufacturing company has caused a division of opinion on the Internet when it advertises that breastfeeding mothers are compared to milking cows.
To mark the launch of the product, which is said to be “the world’s most popular breast pump,” user-oriented technology company Elvie has released a funny ad inspired by music videos to showcase the freedom that the new pumps.
Four mothers dance in a cow barn full of hay on a song whose lyrics read, "Yes, I'm milking, but you don't see a tail" and "If you haven't noticed this isn't a whistle, this is my breasts."
The motto goes: "Pump, pump, feed the babies, pump, pump, suffocate my breasts."
However, the advertisement, which was posted on the Facebook page of the company, caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it emphasized the "horror" of the dairy industry.
“It’s a really bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
They, just like us, need to get pregnant and give birth to be able to produce milk, except for the fact that their children steal from them just a few days after they give birth," one of the comments said.
Elvie's breast pump discreetly fits into the breastfeeding nursery ("Elvie"/"Mother")
Another comment reads: “It is understandable that this is traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But, yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are keeping their babies?”
Someone else added: “Really inappropriate advertising.”
Others, on the other hand, defended the advertisement, and one woman admitted that she thought the song was really "funny."
“I think this idea is a genius.
I'd buy a pump like that if I was still breastfeeding.
I felt like I was just like a cow.
It's a little crazy, but I think it's honest.
“It’s a brilliant product,” one of the comments said.
Another commented: “This is a fun advertisement designed for mothers who milk (often in their workplaces or in their toilets) and feel like ‘cows.’
This is not an advertisement that misses or condemns the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women discovered that they were dancing while the discrete pumps were stuck in their yards.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the view that many women who use milk pumps say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie’s pump is completely quiet, has no wires, no tubes, and discreetly fits into the nursery, giving women the freedom to move around, hold their babies, and even leave the house while they chew it.
Ana Ballarin, partner and RDR at Mother commented: “Elvie’s idea is a truly revolutionary product and deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By putting a parallel between women who milk and dairy cows, we wanted to milk milk with the help of a pump and the challenges that it brings to put the same in the center of the attention, the way it is, and the way it is, shows the incredible feeling of freedom.
This is not the first time Elvie's pump has been featured in all titles.
During Fashion Week in London, the mother of two children appeared on the fashion track for designer Martha Jakubovski wearing the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of children migrants in detention has increased significantly, although crossings at the monthly level have remained relatively unchanged, in part due to the fact that the sharp rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to accommodate children.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves were unidentified immigrants and were afraid of threatening their own stay in the country if they asked to be a child sponsor.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their families would have to submit fingerprints and that the data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Matthew Albens, a senior immigration and customs official, testified last week before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who applied for unaccompanied minor sponsorship.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested persons do not have a prior criminal record.
“Nearly 80 percent of individuals who are either sponsors or family members of the sponsors illegally reside in the country and most of them are foreigners with criminal records.
That’s why we keep chasing those individuals,” Mr. Albens said.
In order to handle cases with children more quickly, authorities have introduced new rules that require some of them to appear in court within a month of their arrest, rather than within 60 days, as hospital workers say the stance has been overstated.
Many of them will appear through a conference video call, rather than in person, in order to bring their case for legal status before the immigration judge.
Those who are deemed unfit to receive relief will be deported immediately.
The longer children stay in detention, the more likely they will become disturbed and depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape, say shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in the past few months.
Lawyers say such problems have increased in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where due to its size there are more likely to be neglected signs that the child is experiencing difficulties.
They added that moving children to a tent town, without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends, could increase the trauma that most of them are already facing.
Syria has told US, French and Turkish “occupation forces” to withdraw immediately
In his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country has been going on for eight years.
Mualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally staying in Syria on the pretext of participating in the fight against terrorism and that "they will be dealt with appropriately."
“They have to withdraw immediately and without setting conditions,” he said in front of the assembly.
Mualem insisted that the “war on terrorism is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011 and millions have been displaced from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to “lead this world battle until we clear all Syrian territories” of both terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence.”
The U.S. has about 2,000 troops in Syria, most of whom are trained and advised by Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the territory of this country destroyed by the war.
On the issue of refugees, Mualem said conditions were good for them to return and accused "some of the Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that prompted refugees to stay away.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these repatriations,” he said.
“They’re politicizing the issue that needs to be purely humanitarian.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be provided with reconstruction aid until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib has created an opportunity for progress in political talks.
The Russo-Turkish deal prevented a major attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province where three million people live.
However, Mualem stressed that the deal had “clear deadlines” and expressed hope that the military action would be directed against jihadists, including the Nusra Front fighters linked to al-Qaeda, who “will be exterminated.”
U.N. Representative Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members in order to prepare a new constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Mualem set the conditions for the Syrian government to participate in the committee, saying the panel's work should be limited to "reviewing the members of the current constitution," and warned of the consequences of further interference in it.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Mandate
According to that logic, Mr. Trump will win the 2020 election again unless impeachment and scandal preemptively terminates his presidential term, which most liberals are likely to hope for.
In what will undoubtedly be “the most dramatic finale in the presidency that has ever been seen!”
From now on, there are no signs of fatigue in viewers.
As of 2014, the strike-time rating has more than doubled and reached 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled and reached 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Nilsen says Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at the time of impact, which is 1.7 million more than four years ago, and MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show has reached the top cable news ranking with about 3.5 million viewers in the world.
“This is like a fire that people feel attracted to because it’s not something we understand,” said Neal Baer, the lead producer of ABC’s Designated Survivor drama for a cabinet secretary who has been president ever since.
Nell Scovel, a veteran of writing comedies and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has another theory.
She recalls a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
She asked me why.
“He replied, ‘Because I think it’s really funny,’” Mrs. Scowell told me.
There is also a certain amusing value in all the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, the stories coming out of Washington can determine the future of the Roy vs. Wade case, whether immigrant families will be able to reunite, as well as the well-being of the global economy.
Exclusion from all this is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you are no longer an uninformed citizen of the Washington Post as you have been looking at a panel of experts debating the use of the source of "deep background" by Bob Woodward for his book "Fear 1", a bomber jacket made of leather by a New Yorker.
I, for example, will never be able to see Super Mario in the same way.
“Part of what he’s doing and what gives you the feeling of watching a reality show is that every night brings you something new,” says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and co-creator of NFC’s New York Times.
You can’t afford to miss a single episode because then you won’t be able to make up for it.
When I visited Mr. Flays this week it was sunny and the temperature was 80 degrees outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he was locked inside and watching MSNBC while filming on CNN.
He could not stop watching, at least not when Brett Cavanaugh was due to face the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the Supreme Court's future was in a critical state.
“I remember doing all those crazy shows in the past, and people were like, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization.’”
“I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Influx of foreign funds in the toughest midterm elections in the race for the Upper House
It is not surprising that the 17th congressional district in Pennsylvania is getting a large amount of funding thanks to the reorganization of the congressional districts from where there are two candidates in the race for the same place.
For this recently reconstructed suburban area in Pittsburgh, Democratic Representative Conor Lamb has been nominated, who won a seat in another area of the election last spring.
Lamb is competing with another candidate, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents the old 12th congressional district, and which largely overlaps with the new 17th congressional district.
The maps were changed after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January ruled that the old areas were manipulated in favor of Republicans, which is inconsistent with the constitution.
The race in the new 17th congressional district is a tough competition to fund campaigns between the party's main sponsors, the Democratic Party's Congressional Campaign Committee ("DCCC") and the Republican Party's National Campaign Committee ("RCC").
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district election held in March, which was characterized by broad media coverage.
For more than a decade, this place was occupied by a Republican, and President Donald Trump won the area with a difference of 20 points.
Politicians don’t give Democrats a big advantage.
The U.S. decided to punish El Salvador for its support for China, and then resigned.
The diplomats pointed out that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing under little pressure from Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners kicked out the Trump organization’s management team.
U.S. State Department officials have decided to withdraw U.S. Heads of Diplomatic Missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of "the fact that the U.S. government has issued a decision to no longer recognize Taiwan," said Hender Naport.
But only in relation to El Salvador were penalties taken into account, which received US aid of about $140 million in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included a reduction in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have a detrimental impact on the country in Central America and the high rates of unemployment and murders in the country.
As the internal meetings progressed, representatives from North and Central America postponed the high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity in order to hold a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward for the next year’s summit.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials said they wanted the conference to move forward and effectively put an end to any deliberations regarding the punishment of El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence should address the conference scheduled for mid-October as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats say.
All three U.S. representatives quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without bringing news of heavy messages or punishments from Washington, D.C.
The White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate that were described by the three U.S. representatives, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal thoughts on the state of anonymity.
Their views were supported by an external analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke about the state of anonymity.

The next thing that could happen is to publish Special Counsel Robert Miller’s report on a possible obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump, for which there is currently a lot of solid evidence in the public records.
Mr. Miller is also reportedly directing his investigation to the fact that Mr. Trump’s campaign is linked to Russia in its attack on our elections.
If the composition of the Congress changes, Mr. Trump will have to be held accountable in that body as he prepares to appear again in front of voters, and possibly in front of a jury composed of his colleagues.
There are a lot of uncertainties here, and I don’t want to suggest that Mr. Trump’s fall is inevitable, not to his colleagues in Europe.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic need to make certain choices that will affect the duration of this struggle.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to carry out a coup d'état against Hitler if the West opposed him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We did not succeed in that and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of the massacre that followed.
The course of history revolves around such points of change, and the unstoppable march of democracy is accelerating or delaying.
The U.S. is facing a number of such changes.
What do we do if Mr. Trump resigns Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Miller's investigation?
Rosenstein is on a hot chair after the newspaper announced last year that he had secretly proposed to film the president and speculated that he was unsuitable for the role he was performing.
Mr Rosenstein says the information published in The Times is inaccurate.
“What will we do if Brett Kavanaugh’s new investigation requested by F.B.I. is incomplete or illegal, or if he proves his innocence before the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, are we going to vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will blame Mr. Trump?
If we fall on all these tests, democracy is waiting for a long winter.
But I don't think that's going to happen because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, emigrated to America and 60 years later sent me to light candles for Sabbath on a table with a swastika logo.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?”

Graeme Dorans of the Rangers with an optimistic attitude ahead of the clash with Rapid Vienna
The Rangers are hosting the clash with Rapid Vienna on Thursday, while being aware of the fact that after a match against Villarreal in Spain at the beginning of this month, the victory over the Euroleagues will solidify their stance to the Austrians.
Graeme Dorrens, the middle-class player due to a knee injury was prevented from appearing in the season until the 2–2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can take advantage of that result as a springboard for greater achievements.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good opponent," the 31-year-old said.
“We got into the game believing we could achieve something and came back with a point.
Maybe we could give a little more in the end, but the unresolved result was probably a fair result.
They were better in the first half and we did our best in the second half and we were better.
On Thursday, we have another great European night ahead of us.
I hope we win three points, but it will be a tough game because they had a good result in the last game, but I am sure that with the support of the fans we will return and get a positive result.
“Last year was definitely a tough year in view of everything that happened, namely my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there is some positive factor in the place.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy it; the training is good.
I hope that now we will be able to move forward, to leave last season behind us and to achieve success.”
Women can’t sleep at night because of this fear associated with retirement savings.
Although the participants in the study had a clear idea of the way they wanted to be cared for, few had a conversation with their family members about it.
About half of the participants in the study conducted by Nationwide said they had talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they were talking to their children about it.
“People want a member of their family to take care of them, but they don’t take the steps to talk about the same,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance company Nationwide.
Here's where you should start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to take care of you if you don’t share your wishes with them in advance.
Work with your counselor and your family and talk about where and how care can be obtained because such choices can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Include your financial advisor: Your financial advisor can also help you find a way to pay for those expenses.
Your options for financing long-term care can include a traditional long-term care policy, a hybrid life insurance policy in cash, which can help you to cover your expenses or to insure your own self-insurance with your own insurance.
Set up your legal documents: Avoid legal battles from the very beginning.
Take out a health care license so that you can empower a person with confidence to oversee your medical care and to ensure that health professionals respect your wishes if you are not able to communicate.
Also, consider a full-fledged for your financial resources.
In this way, you would choose a person of trust to carry the financial decisions on your behalf and pay your bills if you are not able to do it yourself.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine that your older parent needs urgent medical attention and is on his way to a hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about the medications he drinks and his allergies?
Take note of these details in a written form to be prepared.
“It’s not just about finances, it’s about who the doctors are,” Martin asks.
“What are the medications?
Who will take care of the dog?

Man shot several times with air rifle in Ilfracomb
A man was shot several times with an air rifle as he returned home from the exit.
The 40-year-old victim was found in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe when he was shot in the chest, stomach and arm.
Police officers described the shooting, which occurred around 02:30 BST (British Summer Time) as a "accidental act."
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening and the police are appealing to the witnesses to help.
Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with the death toll expected to increase.
Due to the disruption of communications, aid workers are unable to obtain information from Dongala County, an area north of Palu that is closer to the 7.5-degree earthquake epicentre.
After the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Following are some key facts about Palu and Dongala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by the earthquake and tsunami.
Dongala is a district that stretches over 300 kilometres (180 miles) off the coast of the northwestern part of the island of Sulawesi.
The district, which is an administrative region within the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of income for the economy of the Central Sulawesi province, especially in the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel mining is also an important activity in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Morovali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Indonesia’s disaster mitigation agency says Palu and Dongala have been hit by a tsunami several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
In 1996, a tsunami struck western Dongala, killing nine people.
Indonesia is in the seismic Pacific ring of fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Some of the major earthquakes and tsunami in recent years are:
2004: A large earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of us.
2005: Severe earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nias, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-degree earthquake struck the southern part of Java, Indonesia’s most populous island, causing a tsunami that destroyed the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck the area near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake struck one of the Mentaway Islands near Sumatra, causing a tsunami that reached 10 meters and destroyed dozens of villages, killing about 300 people.
2016: A shallow-focused earthquake struck Pidi Jaya district in Aceh, causing desert and panic as it reminded people of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time the earthquake did not cause a tsunami, but more than 100 people were killed from the collapsed buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit Indonesia’s tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused thousands of tourists to be temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Trek Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sara Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, from Wasila, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference in a report on domestic violence and opposition to arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaskan police officers.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police and report the alleged crimes, he picked up her phone.
Palin is in the Mat-Su detention facility with the possibility of leaving if he pays an amount of $500, KTUU said.
On Saturday, he appeared in court, where he said he was "definitely innocent" when asked how he was told in court, the network said.
Palin faces three Class A violations, meaning he could be sentenced to up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a Class B violation, a one-day prison sentence and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time a criminal charge has been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called on the police to report the alleged attack.
The case before the Alaska Veterans Court is underway.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, interference in the report on a crime of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the influence of alcohol in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said he allegedly stabbed her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she said her son's violent behavior stemmed from PTSD, a consequence of his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds dead
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-degree earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been cut off, and the number of victims is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake struck the area near Central Sulawesi, which is located northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
On social media, videos are circulating that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for the beach festival in Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are demanding a rare death penalty for the suspect in the New York terror attack.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Saifulo Saipov, the suspect in the New York terror attack that killed eight people, a rare punishment not executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rental truck at Home Depot in October to carry out an attack on a bicycle path on the West Side highway in Lower Manhattan and to cross the pedestrians and cyclists found on the road.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily injuries, according to the report of the intention to seek the death penalty delivered to the Southern District of New York.
According to the court documents, there is a possibility of imposing the death penalty on both of these grounds of the indictment.
A few weeks after the attack, the Federal Grand Jury filed a 22-pronged charge against Saipov, including eight murder charges for reconnaissance purposes, which federal prosecutors usually use indicting a prosecutor in cases of organized crime, as well as a charge of violence.
To carry out the attack required "detailed planning and contemplation," the prosecutors said, describing the manner in which Saipov carried out the same as "horrendous, cruel and depraved."
"Sayfulo Habibulaevi<0xC4><0x87> Saipov caused, injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, En-Lore Decat, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlej, Hern<0xC3><0xA1>n Ferrucci, Hern<0xC3><0xA1>n Diego Man,"
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since a case with the death penalty was prosecuted in New York's Southern District.
The defendant, Calid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York City was in 1953 for Julie and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit two years of espionage for the Soviet Union in the course of the war.
Both were sentenced to death by an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
Police said he told the investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
Police also said he had asked to place the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He was found guilty on all 22 counts of the indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were “obviously disappointed” by the prosecutor’s decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, instead of accepting a guilty plea and passing a life sentence without the possibility of release, will only continue the trauma of these events for all involved,” Paton said.
Saipov’s defense has previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
A spokesperson for the Tory party says Najjel Faraj should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today during a protest at the Tory party’s conference vowed to “mobilize the people’s army.”
The former Ukip party leader said politicians must “feel the warmth” of Eurosceptics, with one of Theresa May’s MPs suggesting he should be indebted to EU negotiations.
Conservative supporter Peter Bone on the Birmingham march said the United Kingdom would have been “out of the EU” if Mr Farage was secretary for Brexit so far.
But the challenge facing Ms. May's reunification of her deeply divided members was highlighted by the counter-Brexit members of the Tory party who joined a special protest against Brexit that was taking place in the House of Commons.
The prime minister is trying to continue with the implementation of the Chequers plan despite attacks by pro-Brexit faces, counter-Brexit faces and the EU.
The Allies insisted that it would continue its efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite strong reactions and that it would force Eurosceptics and members of the Labour Party to choose between its package and “chaos.”
Mr Bon told the pro-Brexit summit Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to “reject the plan from the Chequers.”
He suggested that Mr Farage should be involved and that he should be given the responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was in charge of the negotiations, we would have been out of the EU so far,” he said.
A spokesperson for Wellingboro added: "I will support Brexit, but we must reject the Chequers plan."
Expressing his position against the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars for now to be subordinate.
“We want to create our own laws in our own country.”
Mr. Bonn rejected the suggestion that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British people have changed their mind and want to stay in the EU is completely inaccurate.”
Andrea Jenkins, a member of the Tory and Pro-Brexit party, was also present at the march and said to reporters: “I just say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chekers plan is not well accepted by the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not well accepted by our party and our activists who are actually those who go out on the streets and owe our election victory.
Please give up the Chequers plan and start listening to us.”
In a message addressed to Ms May, she added: “Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Farage said at the meeting that politicians must "feel the heat" if they intend to hand over the decision that was made to the referendum in 2016.
“This is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to hand over Brexit, and we’re here today to tell them we’re not going to let you get away with it.”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, feel the heat.
“We are mobilizing the people’s army of this country that has enabled us to win in Brexit and that will not stop until we become independent, self-governing and proudly United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, anti-Brexit individuals marched through Birmingham, before holding a two-hour meeting in the city center.
After the group's meeting, a small number of activists appeared this weekend who wore banners with the inscription "The Tories against Brexit".
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour Party, ridiculed the Conservatives about the security issues they faced at the opening of the conference in connection with the application that the party created.
“These are people who tell us that they can set up IT systems and all the necessary technology for Canada plus, for border without controls, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
"It's a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren is planning to think well about running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would “think well about running for president” after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democratic Party spokeswoman was talking about her future during a city council meeting in western Massachusetts this Saturday.
Warren, an honorary critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Republican Republican Rep. Jeff Dill, who was co-chair of the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
She was at the center of speculation that she could replace Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holiok was her 36th meeting with voters after Trump came to the presidency, the holding of which uses the format of an urban assembly.
One of them asked if he was planning to run for president.
Warren said it was time for “women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes putting a woman at the top.”
Suspect arrested for the shooting and death of basketball player Sims by the LSU team
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on Saturday said the suspect in the shooting and death of basketball player Wade Sims from the LSU team that happened on Friday was arrested.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Deeon Simpson, 20, at a press conference at 11 o'clock Eastern time.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, in which they asked for help identifying the man from the photo.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early on Friday morning.
"Vaid Sims had a gunshot wound to his head and as a result of that he died," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wade intervened to defend his friend and was shot by the Simpsons.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being present at the crime scene, possession of weapons, and firing at Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody in the police department of the East Baton Rouge Parish.
As a 192 cm tall junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games with 10 appearances last season, an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 catches per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Luis Hamilton is closer to the world title after the team with his orders secured him the victory over Sebastian Vetel
From the moment Valtery Botas qualified for Lewis Hamilton on Saturday it became clear that the Mercedes team's orders would play a major role in the race.
From the semi-position Botas had a good start and almost left Hamilton on the sidelines while defending his position in the first two rounds and invited Vetel to attack his teammate.
Wind got into boxing first and left Hamilton to fight the turmoil at the end of the group, something that was supposed to play a decisive role.
Mercedes entered the boxing one round later and came behind Vetel, but Hamilton went ahead after the action one by one that forced Ferrari's driver to voluntarily leave the interior at his own free risk to remain on the sidelines after a double move.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the net and on his 21st birthday at the end of the first round finished in seventh place.
He then drove for most of the race and directed the tires of his car to quickly reach the finish line and outperform Kimi Raikonen, taking fourth place.
He eventually entered boxing in the 44th round, but could not increase the pace in the other eight rounds, so Raikkonen came in fourth.
“Today is a tough day because Walter did a great job all weekend and he was a real gentleman who let me through.
“The team made a really exclusive decision to have their own pair in the race,” Hamilton said.
It was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Diana Feinstein at a rally on Saturday in connection with her insistence that she had not published a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing the Supreme Court's candidate, Brett Kavanaugh.
In his speech at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what is happening in the Senate showed that people are "vicious and ruthless."
“There’s only one thing that can happen, and the great thing is that in what’s happening in the last few days in the Senate you can see anger, people who are angry and angry and ruthless and dishonest,” he said.
“When you look at posts and information flows and they say, ‘Oh, it wasn’t me.
It wasn't me."
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you publish this information?
Do you remember her answer... did you publish the document—“Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't publish it."
Wait a minute, then.
“No, we didn’t,” he added, imitating the senator.
A letter of information was sent to Finnstein in connection with the charges against Kavanaugh by Ford as early as July, and the same was published in early September, but Finnstein denied that the leak of the information came from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's statements, I didn't publish her story," Finnstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep them confidential and I did what she asked me to do.”
But it seems that the president does not believe her denial, so he commented on the same at the rally on Saturday: “I’ll tell you one thing, it was a really bad body speech.
Maybe she didn’t, but it was the worst body speech I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court candidate, who was accused of sexual abuse by three women, the president suggested the Democrats were using citations to achieve their own goals.
“They’re determined to take back power in any way.
You can see their malice, their subjugation, they don't care who they're going to hurt, who they need to exterminate to regain their power and control," the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants in the match against Dundee
The Dundee Stars compensated for the loss of the Elite League match on Friday against the Belfast Giants by winning the rematch 5-3 at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants gained an advantage from two goals scored by Patrick Dwyer and Frances Bovillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney achieved an advantage over the host before Dwyer returned the Giants leadership.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bouchard equalised for Dundee ahead of Lucas Lundwald Nilsen to secure their victory with his two goals.
This was the third defeat of the season in Adam Kifi's Elite League for the boys, who returned with a 2-1 win over Dundee in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth match between the two sides in the season, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
The chance for Dwyer came in the fourth minute, at 3:35 with the addition of Kendall McFool, which addition was provided by David Rutherford while Bovilier doubled the lead four minutes later.
This was a quick opening of the match, Sullivan secured the host's lead with 13:10, before Matt Merkart assisted Kuhney to score 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took the lead until the first break, when he scored the second goal for the evening at the end of the first period.
The host regrouped and Bushard returned them with a powerful game and goal, with the result being 27:37.
Cowney and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nilsen for the first time secure Dundee's lead in the game late in the second period and he secured his team's victory in the last half of the fifth period.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will play their next game on Friday at a home field in Milton Keynes.
<0xE2><0x86><0x90> Flight Control Killed Helping Hundreds of People on a Plane Saved From Earthquake
A flight controller in Indonesia is famous as a hero after he died helping a plane with hundreds of people to fly safely.
More than 800 people were killed and many disappeared after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong successive tremors continue to devastate the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues avoiding saving their own lives, 21-year-old Antonios Gunawan Agung refused to leave the position in the control tower at Mutiara Sis al-Jufri airport in Palu, which was constantly being destroyed.
He remained in his position to ensure that Batik Air's flight number 6321, which was on the runway at the time, would fly safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower the moment he thought the tower was collapsing.
He later died in the hospital.
Johannes Sirait, a spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, said his decision likely saved hundreds of lives, Australian newspaper ABC News reported.
We have prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter got to Palu.
“This news has broken our hearts,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands of people, and the disaster mitigation agency says access to the cities of Dongala, Siggy and Butong is limited.
“It is believed that the number of victims is increasing because many bodies are still under the rubble, while many cannot be accessed,” said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves that reached up to six meters devastated Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial jets carry aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Help carries bodies every minute.
There's not enough clean water.
The mini-markets have been looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Red Cross in Indonesia is quick to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
It’s a tragedy, but it can get even worse.”
Indonesian President Yoko Vidodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and sent a message to the national army: “I urge all of you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
“Are you ready?” he told CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: 'Air Niugini' now says one man disappeared after plane crash in lagoon
The airline that operated the plane that crashed in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says one man has disappeared, having previously said that the 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the plane that sank.
In a statement, Air Niugini said the male passenger could not be found from Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline does not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuk Island Airport, the statement said.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and that they were all in stable condition.
The cause of the accident, as well as the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane hit the lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had missed the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Janes said the plane was flying very low.
“That’s a very good thing,” Jane said.
Janes said he and the others had managed to get through the water that reached them halfway and to head to the emergency exits of the plane that sank.
He said the guards were panicking and screaming, and that he had suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said seafarers working near the port's reconstruction had also helped in the rescue, with the help of an inflatable ship transporting people to shore before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Air safety data shows that 111 people have died in accidents on airlines registered in the PNG in the last two decades, but none of them have been included in the airline Air Niugini.
Analyst Determines Timeframe for the Night When a Woman Was Burned Alive
The prosecution ended by filing the case on Saturday for the retrial of the man who was accused of burning a woman in Mississippi alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for hours as a craftsman in the field of intelligence analysis.
He pointed out on the jury that he used phone records to link the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Telis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers the night she died.
Rowlett said he had received location data from several mobile phones that showed that Telis was with Chambers the night of her death, which is contrary to his previous statements, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When, based on the data, it was shown that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time when he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford was questioned on Saturday and testified that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked if Telis was telling the truth by saying he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Telis said he knew Chambers about two weeks after she died.
The phone records show that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers' death, Telis deleted Chambers' messages and calls, as well as her contact information, from his phone.
“He wiped her out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense is expected to present its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the jury to decide on the case later the same day.
“The High Breed: What Is Conscious Hip-Hop?”
The hip-hop trio wants to beat the negative attitude towards this genre by incorporating positive messages into their music.
Bristol's "The High Breed" argues that hip hop is far from its origins as music with political messages aimed at solving societal problems.
They want to go back to his roots and re-popularize conscientious hip-hop.
Artists such as "The Fugees" and "Common" recently experienced their revival through artists such as "Akala" and "Lowkey".
Is there another black woman?
A New York babysitter sues a married couple for being fired after sending a “racist” message
A New York babysitter sues a married couple for being fired on grounds of discrimination after mistakenly receiving a message from her mother complaining that she was "another black woman."
The couple denies being racist, saying the lawsuit is in fact "extortion."
Lance Plasco-Flaksman, the mother of two, was disappointed when in 2016 after the first day of the new nurse Giselle Morris found out that she was a black woman.
“NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEHE EARS A BLACK ONE,” Ms. Plasco-Flaksman wrote in a message sent to her husband.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to Mrs. Morris, and that twice.
After realizing what Plasco-Flaksman actually did, feeling "uncomfortable" she fired Mrs. Morris, saying that their friendly nanny, who is an African-American, had done her job poorly in York.
Mrs. Morris was paid for her first day of work and then sent home to Uber.
Morris is now suing the couple and seeking compensation for a $350 daily discharge over a six-month period, a commitment that will involve her living with the family, the one she was originally engaged to, but not until closing.
"I want to show them that we don't have to do things like that," she told Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple returned to the allegation that they were racist, saying the dismissal of Ms. Morris was a reasonable move because they feared they could no longer trust her after they insulted her.
“My wife was following her with something she didn’t think about.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,” husband Joel Plasco told Post.
“But would you trust your children in a person you were rude to, even by mistake?
Your new baby?
Let's be real."
Saying the lawsuit was “extortion,” Plasko said his wife gave birth to the baby just two months ago and was in a “very difficult situation.”
“Are you going to attack someone who is in a situation like this?
That’s not very good,” added the investment banker.
Although the legal case is still in progress, the public immediately condemned the married couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington publishers fear readers won’t be able to relate to a talking bear, a new letter reveals
Karen Jankel, Bond’s daughter who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: “It is really hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it is published.
It is very interesting that we now know all this about Paddington’s huge success.
After saying that her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before getting the inspiration to write the book of a small toy in the form of a bear, would still be optimistic if his work was not well-accepted at his age, she added that the "60th anniversary of the book's release" was "the year of his birth."
For Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family," she adds that her father felt calmly proud of his potential success.
“He was a really quiet man and he didn’t want to fail at all,” she said.
“But because Paddington felt so real, it was almost like having a child who achieved something in life: and you are proud of him even though success is not due to you.
I think Paddington's success was perceived that way.
Although it was about creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always attributed his merits to Paddington himself.
My daughter was on a deathbed and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
On landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors were desperately trying to save her life.
“I was called regularly to say that the situation is very bad and that she is not expected to survive,” Ms. Ednan-Laperuse said.
“Nad then called me to tell me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
And I said, “Daddy, I really love you, my dear.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The effect of medications given to her by doctors to keep her pumping her heart was slowly diminishing and they were coming out of her system.
She died earlier, and this meant that all of her systems were giving up.
I just had to sit and wait, aware of the fact that all this is happening.
I couldn’t scream, I couldn’t scream, I couldn’t cry again because I was surrounded by family members and people.
I really had to stay clean.”
In the end, Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz, grieving her daughter's loss, boarded the plane along with the other passengers, unaware of the difficult situation she was going through.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
“I raised my head and my tears didn’t stop.
It's hard to explain, but while I was on the plane, I felt immense sympathy for Over.
I felt that he needed my love and understanding.
I know how much you loved her.”
Sad Women Put Cards on a Bridge to Prevent Suicide
Two women who have lost loved ones because of suicide make an effort to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put cards on the Welsh Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call out for support.
The son of Mrs. Davis, Tyler was 13 years old when he began suffering from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I feel every day,” she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lidney, says her son had a great potential to become a cook, as well as an infectious smile.
“They all remembered him for his smile.
People have always said that his smile can illuminate every room.
However, he gave up his job before dying because it was “in a really dark place.”
His 11-year-old brother was the one who found Tyler in 2014 after taking his life.
Mrs. Davis said, “I’m constantly afraid that it will have a consistent effect.”
Mrs. Davis makes the cards "to let others know that there are people out there who they can talk to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don’t sit in silence, you have to start talking.”
Mrs. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davis, lost her partner Mark, whom she was married to 15 years after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he felt unhappy or depressed, that is, he didn’t say anything,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He reached the bottom of Christmas day when the children opened their presents, and he didn’t look them in the eye at all and didn’t make any contact with them.”
She said his death was a huge trauma for all of them, but they had to find a way to go through it: “Something like this is ruining the family.
We're still broken.
But we have to go on and fight.”

Bret Kavanaugh's future is uncertain since the FBI started the investigation
"I thought that if we could actually get something similar to what he was looking for, that is, a limited-time, limited-range investigation, maybe we could achieve a little unity," Mr. Flick said in a press release on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would be in the race.
Why didn't Cavano and his Republican supporters want the FBI to conduct an investigation?
Their turmoil is due only to timing.
The mid-term elections should be held in just a few weeks, that is, on November 6, and if Republicans are expected to face failure, then they will be significantly weakened in their efforts to elect their man as a member of the country’s highest court.
George W. Bush calls the senators, while lobbying to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who, in turn, worked as Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI releases its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes to the Senate, which will allow Vice President Mike Pence to change the unresolved result and enter the Supreme Court.
The number of refugees in North Korea 'decreased' under Kim's leadership
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean envoy said.
Park Bieong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Unification Ministry, said that last year there were 1,127 border crossings compared to 2011 when there were 2,706.
Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher tariffs on human smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang did not comment publicly.
Most of the refugees from North Korea have been granted citizenship in South Korea from time to time.
Seoul says more than 30,000 people from North Korea have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, where the longest border with North Korea is located and which can be more easily crossed compared to the well-protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between North and South Korea.
China considers these people to be illegal migrants, not refugees, and often repatriates them for force.
The relations between the North and the South, which are technically still at war, have improved significantly in the last few months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss topics that focused on stagnant denuclearization negotiations.
This was followed by a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they generally agreed to work towards achieving the goal of a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho on Saturday accused the U.S. of stagnating progress from then to now.
“If there is no trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and under such conditions we cannot unilaterally disarm first,” Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Cavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is not fit to serve in the Supreme Court
The minority leader in the House of Representatives called Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavanaugh "hysterical" and said that if his temperament is taken into account, he is inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help but think that if a woman acted in that way, they would say she was “hysterical,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
Kavanaugh was very emotional at his introductory presentation, sometimes even yelling and snarling while talking about his family and his high school years.
He also clearly denounced the Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him a “grotesque and coordinated destruction of his reputation” organized by liberals who are angry that Hillary Clinton lost in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed that Kavanaugh's testimony was proof that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because he was shown to be biased towards Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and the way he attacked the Clinton family and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi did not answer the question of whether she would try to remove Cavano from office if allegations against him were confirmed and if Democrats were to win a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’m going to say this: if he doesn’t tell the truth before Congress or before the FBI, then he’s not only not fit to serve in the Supreme Court, but he’s not fit to serve in the court where he’s currently in office,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the District Court of Appeals in Washington.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she is concerned about possible judgments that will be made by Cavano against the Accessible Healthcare Act or Roye against Wade, as he is considered a subject of conservative justice.
In the hearings to confirm his candidacy, Kavanaugh did not answer questions about whether he would overturn any of the Supreme Court’s decisions.
“Now is not the time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, ‘That’s really great, isn’t it?’” said Pelosi.
Women should also use it.
It’s really a sharp criticism, months and years of collecting anger, which she can’t get rid of without crying.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Mrs. Steinham told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s unusual, do I?”
She went on, “A woman who was doing an executive job helped me a lot, and who told me that she was crying when she was angry, but she was able to develop her technique, so when she got angry and started crying, she told me about the person she was talking to.
I'm angry."
And then she continues to cry.
I think it’s genius.”
Salts are allowed as an inflated valve for anger in part because they are essentially misinterpreted.
One of my clearest memories of one of my first office jobs where men dominated was when I once started crying with indescribable anger and an older woman, a cold manager from whom I always had a certain fear, grabbed me by the neck and grabbed me.
“Never let them see you cry,” he said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll enjoy the fact that they managed to reach out to you.”
Patricia Schröder was a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado at the time and worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught up in an extramarital affair on a ship called "Monkey Business" and withdrew from the presidential race, Mrs. Schröder, deeply frustrated, realized that there was no reason why she would not consider the idea of running for office.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” he told me 30 years later with a laugh.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it "The Snowman and the Seven Dwarfs."
Given the fact that the campaign was started a long time ago, she did not have enough funds, so she promised that she would not enter the race if she did not raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found out that some of her supporters, who gave the men $1,000, would only give her $250, she said.
“Do they think there should be a discount for me?” she asked.
During the speech in which she announced that she would not start a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions, i.e. gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult for her to pay the bills, to raise funds and to de-target.
“If you had seen me, you would have probably thought I had a nervous breakdown,” Schröder recalled how the media reacted to the incident.
“You would have thought Clinex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember wondering what they were going to write on my cemeteries.
"She's crying?"
How the U.S.-China trade war could be a good thing for Beijing
The opening of the fire with the start of the trade war between the United States and China has been dampening and despite the fact that the battle is far from over, the clash between the countries could be useful for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year by dropping key exports to China, including solar panels, steel, and aluminum.
The situation escalated significantly over the course of this week with the introduction of new tariffs on goods worth 200 billion U.S. dollars (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), effectively taxing half of the goods coming to the United States from China.
Beijing has been returning to its natural state every time, i.e. recently imposed tariffs of five to ten percent on U.S. goods worth $60 billion.
China has vowed to return the United States to the same extent, and it is unlikely that the world’s second-largest economy will give up the same in the near future.
Forcing Washington to step down means accepting his demands, but public worship before the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays well, the pressures from the trade war with the United States could result in positive support for China in the long run because it will reduce the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create the conditions for the onset of a sharp decline from an economic point of view in any of the countries is far more dangerous than it has ever been before,” Gree Abigail said in a statement.
Syria Is 'Prepared' to Return Refugees, Foreign Minister Says
Syria says it is prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and is making efforts to help rebuild the country, which has been devastated by the long war that lasted more than seven years.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muhalem said conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is stable and safer, due to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government is continuing to restore the areas devastated by the terrorists in order to restore the situation to normal.
Now all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that they had to leave because of terrorism and the unilaterally introduced economic measures that are reflected on their daily lives and lives are ensured.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
An additional six million people living in the country are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Muhalem said the Syrian regime welcomed aid in the reconstruction of the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or assistance from the countries that sponsored the insurgency.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The Europe team won the U.S. team in the 2018 Ryder Cup with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, outside of Paris, France.
The United States has so far lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup title in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the primate after Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored 14.5 points needed to win over the United States.
American star Phil Michaelson, who faced difficulties during most of the tournament, on his first punch from a hole pointed the ball into the water in the par-3 of the 16th hole, losing to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all rounds, becoming one of the four players to achieve a 5-0-0 result after the start of the tournament in the current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spit lost with a score of 5:4 from the lowest-ranked player of the European team, Torbyorn Olessen of Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, the highest-ranked player in the world, lost 2 and 1 to England's Ian Poulter, who may have last played in the Ryder Cup.
Spanish veteran Sergio Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a, a participant in eight Ryder Cups, became the European who won the most tournament titles with 25.5 points during his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t stop today.
This year was really hard.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for believing in me.
I’m so glad we got the title back.
The team game is the most important and I'm happy to be able to help," Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a said after winning Europe.
He is now retiring from his compatriot John Ram, who in the week one-on-one defeated Tiger Woods, the American golf legend, with a score of 2–1.
"I feel incredibly proud to have defeated Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him play," Ram, 23, said.
Woods lost in all four games in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
It's an incredible statistic of one of the best players of all time, who has won 14 major titles, ranking himself in Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team spent the entire weekend trying to direct the game to the low-grass fields, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finnau, who played high-quality golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Furick said after his team's disappointing game, "I'm proud of these guys, they really fought.
In the morning, we put a lot of pressure on the European team.
We were fighting.
It's downstairs for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played really well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with the Association of Professional Golfers of America and our Rider Cup committee and we're going to continue.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We have to admit it.
They've overpowered us.
