I got married to a Canadian.
Tell her you don't need it.
I invited her to the cinema.
The dog eats an apple.
Tom was trying to reassure his wife.
You don't want to talk to me, do you?
A good dress ensures a meeting, but a good mind ensures a meaningful relationship.
Who's washing the car?
This has probably affected their decision-making.
Tom's better in French than he's in English.
I remember them.
Do you work on Mondays?
I don't know how much Tom makes.
No one's sitting here.
You're talking to me?
A small step for man, a gigantic leap for humanity.
You've got to hear the truth.
Tom knows you.
Give me three minutes.
Tom wants to stay here.
I'd like an orange juice.
I'm ironing my dress.
That's not true.
We demand actions, not words.
They all went to the same bar.
Who's Tom talking about?
Tom told Mary he'd always lived in Boston.
There are a lot of volcanoes in Iceland.
We would stay longer if we had more time.
Let's order two bottles.
I'm weak.
I finally found a job.
Don't leave me like that.
Tom's back from Australia.
Excuse me, what time is it?
I'm not surprised.
I'll give you Tom's address.
When did you get back from Tokyo?
Tom told me he'd like to fix Boston.
Tell him I won't do that.
First, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth... lastly.
I don't remember how he saw her in his little boy.
I'll remember that.
Your French is getting better.
I'm not wasting my time.
Tell him why you can't go.
Come with me to the south coast of France!
Tom forgot his suitcase on the train. I'm sorry.
I borrowed my father's hammer to build a dog house.
I'm just done.
He's not an Algerian.
When Tom comes, I'll pay the money I promised.
First the immigrants, then you, our solidarity is the answer to social cannibalism.
Can you tilt that word?
Can you freeze the cheese?
I don't like taking risks.
Tell them to stop worrying about it.
Tom's taller than me.
Do what you think you're doing.
Stop right there.
I'll talk.
You're sure?
Her eyes were red because of the crying.
Are you taller than Tom?
Yesterday, I went to the park with Mary.
I'm the only one who didn't have to do it.
He's awake.
I could do it in the morning.
I thought you were a Canadian.
He doesn't know how to write or read.
I'm sorry, what time is it?
We have three kids.
Tell them to help me.
Tom's dressed like a girl.
How much is the pants?
I like the fact that my coffee is hot.
Tell them we're busy.
I like the way you think.
Tom didn't want to listen.
When's he coming home?
Tom's good at cooking.
He's impotent.
Do you have tattoos?
This is unparalleled.
"May I help you?" —"No, thank you, I'm just a fool."
Mary's been protecting her husband.
You're not Japanese.
Oh, shit!
Tom's calmed down.
They say that you can usually judge people by the company they have.
We don't have anything.
My shoes are bigger than yours.
I'd like you to come to the meeting tomorrow.
We like the music.
Can you lower the tension a little bit?
I don't have a girlfriend.
The news made them happy.
I've visited her in Germany.
Tom's already gone home, but Mary's still here.
Tom's drinking coffee.
We're not hungry.
We've all been wrong.
This weekend, we can make free-to-phone calls.
You don't have brown eyes.
I wanted to die.
Where's your wife?
You're watching?
I can read without my glasses.
Please tell me your address.
We have what we deserve.
Let's talk about it.
You don't trust me, do you?
It's my job to teach English.
That brings me a lot of joy.
Tell them I won't do that.
I really like Boston a lot.
I'd like to help you.
He's cutting me off, Lord.
You'll be safe with Tom.
Try to convince him to help us.
Excuse me, do you speak English?
You were late yesterday.
We're students.
Why are they angry?
I hope it went well.
I'm human.
Everybody likes the money.
Tom's talking to Mary.
Tom's done a lot of great things.
There's five fish in my aquarium.
Tom doesn't drive fast.
Thomas is smarter than Maria's.
The pen is on the desk.
Are you planning to stay?
Tom and I will be getting married in October.
Sit down! Sit down!
I love horticulture.
Who were you talking to?
You've got to sleep.
Who broke it? Who broke it?
What's your complaint?
Apparently, Tom's too busy.
Wait for me there.
Why don't you help me?
You think you can catch me?
Tom planted three apples in his yard.
Tom claimed that he was innocent.
He smiled.
Your face's red.
You're not ready.
Tom and Mary are coming here now.
You're not Canada.
He said something.
She advised him to take the medicine.
Tom's my older brother.
Don't underestimate me.
The couch is uncomfortable.
I'm a psychic.
You're sure Tom's not busy?
Who's sick?
Thomas has a turkey friend.
I like jazz. I like jazz.
Tom's got a sharp mind.
Are you sure you've hit the right button?
Good evening! Good evening!
You're satisfied?
We shipped the products yesterday.
You'll be jealous.
You have something on your teeth.
How often do you wash your clothes?
Tom's got high moral standards.
I accept threats.
Tom was wearing gloves.
Tom's forgiven Mary.
Tell them who we are.
You went to the casino.
Don't be afraid to make a mistake when you speak English.
I can't help you this week.
You shouldn't say things like that when there's kids around.
I will never forget you.
I thought you guys were Canadians.
We've recognized them.
I heard the news on the radio.
Do you miss Tom?
His wife doesn't even know why he died.
You've got to see this movie.
It's safe to drive.
Tom knows I'm a Canadian.
I've lost my lunch card.
There was no time.
After the accident, the injured were taken to the hospital.
We have to finish it all by Monday morning.
We have to work very hard.
Whatever you want!
Who are your parents?
I've played tennis.
And along with the others, I don't like to wear socks.
We're both planning to attend your party.
Thank you so much for coming.
Tom was sung.
He's a dancer.
What did you ask him?
He's running now.
It's too spicy for me.
What I want now is a glass of cold water.
We would like to order 18 tons of olive oil.
Tom handles the French pretty well.
Why did you shoot her?
Let's move on.
I'd like to talk to my lawyer.
She likes the flowers.
I think they're liars.
This elevator can carry ten people at a time.
Freedom is not free of charge.
He's teaching us French.
You're sick!
You think I'm a dictator?
I'm the only one who doesn't want to do it.
We need to hurry to get to the station on time.
What are Tom's priorities?
Tom's got a brother in Boston.
I want to talk to you.
Tom's decided to go to Australia.
Tom didn't want to do it.
Tom taught at Harvard. He's a teacher.
It's cold. Why don't you put on a sweater?
We'll save you.
Are you ready? !
It's for adults only.
I don't know her.
Tom was in love with Mary.
He wanted to see his boss in Tokyo before he left for America.
Come on early.
How many letters did you send to Tom?
I've had months to see him.
I forgot her nickname.
I want you to go back to Boston.
They're crazy.
You're a liar.
We're not guilty.
I drink milk.
I admire you.
I didn't go to the zoo.
These are my favorites.
One of them speaks English and the other is Japanese.
When do you plan to get married?
They're writing.
What can I do about it?
I can't imagine what it's like to be there.
He was an Englishman.
I didn't have any doubts.
I'm not tired at all.
She's beautiful.
What do you want me to tell you?
Tom doesn't eat red meat.
The roads are covered by the snow.
Well, I have a suggestion to make.
I don't remember the exact date.
He's smart.
What would you say to them?
He's quit smoking.
When do you eat dinner?
Would you like a glass of red wine?
He only drinks water.
I can't forget about her beauty.
Do you wash your hands before eating?
Tom's playing tennis.
They all have secrets.
Don't lie to me again.
I don't have a franc.
I like to help others.
What kind of animal is big?
I'll wait until October.
Do you know how to use it?
They're lucky.
It's my decision.
You want to tell her?
You hid the truth from me.
His answer was in the negative.
I get it.
You're still alive.
How old is he?
Tell her not to come.
Is Tom really a Canadian? Is he a Canadian?
Tom's playing tennis every day.
It's not cheap.
She's a very attractive woman.
Passion becomes a learning.
How can we do this?
Do you think you could help me clear out the garden this afternoon? No, no.
I can't eat pork.
You're very brave.
It's on the eighth floor.
I want to go to Korea.
Tell Tom I'm for a swim.
I want revenge.
I'm tired.
Dinner's mine today.
We're willing to negotiate, sir.
The girl wants to know the truth.
Have I ever asked you to work on Sundays?
I'm feeling guilty.
I'm out of sleep.
Follow him. Follow him.
I prefer the coffee.
There's a cure.
It's unlikely he'll be here today.
My father hasn't had dinner yet.
Melanie thinks the situation is very bad.
Tom's ignored Mary's warning.
He's become rich.
My girlfriend's a Canadian.
If I wasn't carpet, I'd buy it.
Wait for us here.
"Do you speak English?" - "Not yet, this is my first lesson!"
We'll die if we stay here.
Do you want to eat shrimp?
I have a friend.
She didn't understand Mary's joke.
Will you tell them?
It's very slippery.
Who brought you here?
We spent our holidays at the lake.
Who's locked the door?
Are you sure you don't want me to talk to Tom about this?
Take my wife. Take my wife.
Hang up your clothes here.
Is Mary your daughter?
I'm not illiterate.
I want the book.
You have to help him.
He's drinking beer.
It's Thomas's birthday today.
My wife's a doctor.
Someone gave you something.
I'm watching TV.
Tom's bought a brand-new car.
Tom has a lot of debts.
You don't have a way.
Why are you smiling?
Didn't I tell you not to close the door?
Please don't touch me.
I got you a present.
You're not poor.
We're going to visit Tom.
My colleague and I are doing the same job but he was promised promotion very soon.
Does she like oranges?
Are you mad at me?
You have to write a letter.
Tell her I'm ready.
I'll wash the dishes.
I like the snow, it's so nice!
Tom saw Mary today.
I was born in Boston.
They believe me.
You killed her.
They'll find her.
I'm not interested in modern art.
We've murdered them.
You're very handsome!
Tom's a celebrity.
Tom says he's in need of help.
Why'd you shoot them?
It took a lot more than I expected.
Who was right?
I'd like to watch TV.
I took him down.
You speak french.
She's married to a dentist.
We're still in shock.
It's gonna rain tonight.
I'm the coach.
Who's driving?
The park was empty.
The dog dug up a skull for us.
Tell Tom we'll be ready.
Tom's playing golf.
Mary's wife's rich.
The roses smell good. I don't know.
WELCOME TO OUR COUNTRY!
What's your favorite color?
Tell us about this.
Don't make any noise!
I swim once a week. I swim once a week.
Tom's smarter than that.
Tom's got it started.
Tom doesn't know where to wait for Mary.
I'm still in love with Tom.
That's an improbable result.
I like it and I need to learn a lot of foreign languages.
I love you, Tom.
Tom's got gray hair.
We've shot him.
You have three cars, don't you?
Tom's gonna find us.
It's up to you.
I don't remember inviting you.

I don't like them.
He must be an American.
When do we have to deliver the report?
Who stole Tom's bike? Who stole Tom's bike?
We don't want her.
This room is used as a kitchen.
Who are you referring to?
There's someone singing.
How many spring rolls did you eat?
The flower's blue.
I like this room. I like this room.
If you really want to know, all you need to do is ask.
Who's that girl?
Ignore them.
He's the hero.
I didn't eat it.
Our shop isn't open.
You underestimated them.
Get her out of here.

Those candles aren't white.
The man they're talking about has been dead for a long time.
Tom and Mary didn't agree on anything.
I'm diabetic.
He's kicking me!
When was the last time you smoked?
We all agreed with Tom.
Tom's house is close to the beach.
We're going to build a wall.
This tea is good.
This is the last warning.
Give us three minutes.
You'll learn to speak fluently English!
Fantastic!
Say it in Hungarian!
I know his address. I know his address.
I want to know when the meeting will begin.

I would like to visit the ancients of Athens.
This rope is very strong.
You're gonna be busy tomorrow.

Can't you see the stars tonight?
Ask him when the next plane's leaving.
You're lively.
Look around. Look around.
Tom said he knew Mary's secret.
That's the absolute truth. That's it.
Did he admit it?
I paid someone to clean my house.
I'll cook something for you.
We found them.
Mary knows what she's doing.
Tom's really trying to help.
They didn't understand the question.
I'm listening to music.
I'll call you in an hour.
I'm done writing.
I'm in Boston.
I've learned a valuable lesson.
Where can I find an ATM?
Let's thank him.
I want to get to the hotel before nightfall.

You're perfect in everything.
I want to know what that's called.

Why are you so disillusioned?
Tell Tom to help out with Mary.
Call Tom at 2:30 a.m.
The dog slept on the deck.
They need you.
How old are your brothers? !
Tom bought a car at Mary's.
It's almost the summer.
I guessed right.
Tom studied in Boston. He's a college student.
I'll show you.
He wants to live in the city.
I'll never see you again.

Don't tell me you're sorry for me.
Which way did he go?
Tom can't walk. He can't walk.
I'm proud of my brother.
I don't believe what Tom says.
Are we leaving now?
You'll find out.
I want to see them again.
They killed him.
You're older than me.
We're doctors.
Do you think you could help me get the herb out of the garden this afternoon?

Let's hope it works.
Tell them you're sick.
I was hiding.
He's horny, isn't he?
What are you going to eat today?
Tom's a Canadian.
Did you kiss?
We've been warned.
Tom's got a lot of brains.
Wait here. Wait here.
In his eyes, it was perfect.
Can you find him?
He's strong, brave, and above all, polite.
They're Canadians, aren't they?
I'll teach you French.
Tom's singing pretty well.

I'm eating.
Try to stay immobile. I'm sorry.

You know, I have a face in the dark of the night, or I'd be sniffed by a virgin gentleman.
I left the bank empty-handed.
Why don't you tell them?
