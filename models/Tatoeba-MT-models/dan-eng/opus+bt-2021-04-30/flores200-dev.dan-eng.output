As the winner takes the whole-state, Florida gave all its fifty delegates to Romney and made him the Republican Party's leading candidate.
Organisers of the protest told that about 100,000 people appeared in German cities such as Berlin, Cologne, Hamburg and Hanover.
In Berlin, police estimated 6,500 protesters.
Demonstrations also took place in Paris, Sofia in Bulgaria, Vilnius in Lithuania, Valetta in Malta, Tallinn in Estonia as well as Edinburgh and Glasgow in Scotland.
In London, some 200 people protested outside the office buildings of some large copyright owners.
Last month there were major protests in Poland when it signed ACTA, which has led the Polish Government to decide not to approve the agreement for now.
Both Latvia and Slovakia have postponed the process of joining ACTA.
Animal Liberation and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) again call for the mandatory installation of surveillance cameras in all Australian slaughterhouses.
New South Wales' RSPCA chief inspector David O'Shannessy told ABC that monitoring and inspection of slaughterhouses should be common in Australia.
"The monitoring will certainly send a strong signal to the people working with animals that their welfare is of the highest priority".
The International Earthquake Map from the United States Geological Survey showed that there were no earthquakes in Iceland the week before.
No earthquake activity has been reported in the Hekla area in the last 48 hours, says Iceland's Meteorological Institute.
The huge earthquakes of March 10 on the northeastern side of the caldera of the volcano caused major phase changes.
Dark clouds that had nothing to do with volcanic activity were reported at the foot of the mountain.
The clouds showed the potential for confusion as to whether an outbreak had actually occurred.
Luno had 120–160 cubic metres of fuel on board when it broke, and high winds and waves pushed it into the breakers.
Helicopters saved the twelve crew members, and the only injury was a broken nose.
The 100-metre-long ship was on its way to retrieve its usual cargo of manure, and at first suspected investigators that the vessel would lose a cargo.
The proposed amendment was adopted in both houses as early as 2011.
A change had been made in this parliament meeting when the second sentence was first deleted by the House of Representatives and then approved in a similar edition of the Senate Monday.
If the second sentence proposing to ban registered partnerships for same-sex people fails, it may open the door to registered partnerships in the future.
After the process, HJR-3 is again reviewed by the next elected Legislative Assembly in either 2015 or 2016 to remain in the process.
Vautier's exploits in addition to being a film director include a 1973 hunger strike against what he considered political censorship.
French law was changed. His activism started when he was 15 years old and joined the French resistance movement during World War II.
He wrote a documentary book about himself in 1998.
In the 1960s, he returned to newly independent Algeria to teach film instruction.
The Japanese judo fighter Hitoshi Saito, the winner of two Olympic gold medals, has died at the age of 54.
The cause of death was reported as intrahepatic gall gangrene cancer.
He died in Osaka on Tuesday.
Besides being a former Olympic champion and world champion, Saito at the time of his death was also chairman of the All Japan Judo Federation training committee.
At least 100 people attended the party to celebrate the first anniversary of a married couple whose wedding was held last year.
A formal anniversary event has been planned on a later date, told officials.
The couple married in Texas a year ago and came to Buffalo to celebrate the wedding with friends and families.
The 30-year-old husband, born in Buffalo, was among the four people killed in the shooting, but his wife was not injured.
Karno is a well-known but controversial English teacher who taught during Modern Education and King's Glory and claimed to have 9,000 students when his career was greatest.
He used words in his notes, which some parents considered gross, and he allegedly used profanity per hour.
Modern Education accused him of printing large commercials on buses without permission and lying by saying that he was the top English tutor.
He has been accused of copyright infringement before, but no charges were filed against him.
A former student told that he 'used slang in class, gave dating tips in notes and was like a friend to the students.'
Over the last three decades, China has developed a market economy, although officially it is still a communist state.
The first economic reforms were undertaken under Deng Xiaoping's leadership.
Since then, China's size from an economic perspective has grown 90 times.
For the first time last year, China exported more cars than Germany, and they also surpassed the United States as the largest market in this industry.
China's GDP could be greater than that of the United States within two decades.
The tropical storm Danielle, the fourth named storm in the Atlantic hurricane season of 2010, is formed in the eastern Atlantic.
The storm, which is about 3,000 miles from Miami, Florida, has a maximum sustained wind of 40 miles per hour (64 km/h).
Scientists at the National Hurricane Center predict that Danielle will increase in strength and become a hurricane by Wednesday.
As the storm is far from land, it is still difficult to assess its potential damage in the United States and the Caribbean.
Bobek was born in the Croatian capital Zagreb, and gained his fame while playing for Partizan Belgrade.
He came to the club in 1945 and stayed until 1958.
During his time on the team, he scored 403 goals in 468 matches.
No one has ever been more involved or scored as many goals for the club as Bobek.
In 1995, he was voted as the best player in Partizan's history.
The celebrations started with an excellent show from the world-renowned group, Cirque du Soleil.
They were succeeded by the Istanbul State Symphony Orchestra, a Janitshar band, and singers Fatih Erkoç and Müslüm Gürses.
Then swirling dervish dancers went on stage.
The Turkish diva, Sezen Aksu, performed with the Italian tenor Alessandro Safina as well as the Greek singer, Haris Alexiou.
Eventually, the show "Troy" was performed by the Turkish dance group, "Four of Anatolia".
13-year-old motorcycle breeds, Peter Lenz, have died in an accident on Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
During his warming round, Lenz fell off his motorcycle, and was then hit by another racing driver Xavier Zayat.
He was immediately inspected by the medical staff on the field and transported to a local hospital where he later died.
Zayat didn't get hurt in the accident.
In relation to the global economic situation, Zapatero then stated that "the financial system is part of the economy, an essential part.
We have a year-long financial crisis which has had its toughest period in the last two months, and I think the financial markets have now begun to return to a normal level."
Last week, Naked News announced that they would increase their international language mandate for news reporting significantly with three new broadcasts.
The global organization, already reporting in English and Japanese, launches Spanish, Italian and Korean programs for television, internet and mobile devices.
"Luckily nothing happened to me, but it was a macabre sight when people tried to smash windows to get out.
People hit the windows with chairs, but the windows couldn't be smashed.
"One of the windows was finally smashed and they started to escape through the windows," said surviving Franciszek Kowal.
Stars emit light and heat due to the energy produced when hydrogen atoms are merged (or melted) to shape heavier elements.
Scientists are working to produce a reactor that can produce energy in the same way.
However, this is a very difficult problem to solve and it will be many years before we see usable fusion reactors being built.
The steel needle floats on top of the water due to surface tension.
Surface tension occurs because the water molecules on the surface of the water are strongly attracted to each other, more than they are to the air molecules above them.
The water molecules collect and form an invisible membrane on the surface of the water, allowing objects such as needles to flow.
The blade on a modern skate is two-edged with a hollow concave between them. The two edges give a better grip on the ice even when they pour.
As the bottom of the blade is slightly curved, the edge that is in contact with the ice also arches when the blade tilts to one side or the other.
This makes the skater turn. If the skater leans right, the skater turns right, and if the skater leans left, the skater turns left.
To return to their previous energy level, they must burn the extra energy they received from the light.
It does this by emitting a small light particle, which is called a "photon".
Scientists call this process "stimulated broadcast of radiation" because the atoms are stimulated by the bright light, causing the broadcast of a light photon, and light is a kind of radiation.
The next picture shows the atoms emitting photons. In fact, photons are of course much smaller than those seen in the picture.
Photons are even smaller than what atoms consist of!
After hundreds of hours of operation, the bulb's filament gradually burns out, and the bulb no longer works.
Then the bulb must be replaced. It is important to be careful when replacing the bulb.
First, the light switch must be switched off or the plug must be removed.
This is because electricity flowing into the switch where the metallic part of the bulb sits can give you a serious electrical shock if you touch the inside of the switch or the metal on the bottom of the bulb while still sitting partially in the socket.
The largest organ in the body's circulatory system is the heart, which pumps the blood around.
Blood is diverted from the heart in veins called arteries and returned to the heart in veins called veins, the smallest veins called capillaries.
A Triceratops' teeth would have been able to crush not only leaves but also very hard branches and roots.
Some scientists believe that Triceratops ate cone palms, a plant type that was common in the Cretaceous period.
These plants resemble a small palm tree with a crown of sharp leaves with spines.
A Triceratops may have used its strong beak to remove the leaves before eating the trunk.
Other scientists claim that these plants are highly toxic, so it is unlikely that some dinosaurs ate them, although both the sloth and other animals such as the parrot (a descendant of dinosaurs) are today able to eat toxic leaves and/or fruits.
How would Io's gravity affect me? If you stood on the surface of Io, you would weigh less than you do on the ground.
A person who weighs 200 pounds (90 kg) on the ground would weigh about 36 pounds (16 kg) on Io. So gravity pulls naturally less in one.
The sun doesn't have a crust that you can stand on, just like the Earth does. The whole sun consists of gases, fire and plasma.
The gas gets thinner, the further away you come from the center of the sun.
The outer part, as we can see when we look at the Sun, is called the photosphere, meaning "light ball".
About three thousand years later, in 1610, Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used a telescope to observe that Venus has phases, just as the moon has.
Phases happen because only one side of Venus (or the Moon) faces the sun gets light. Venus' phases supported Copernicus' theory that the planets orbit around the sun.
Subsequently, a few years later in 1639, an English astronomer, named Jeremiah Horrocks, observed a Venus passage.
England had lived through a long period of peace after the reconquest of Danelagen.
In 991, however, Ethelred faced a Viking fleet larger than anyone before since Guthrum's fleet from a century earlier.
This fleet was led by Olaf Trygvasson, a Norwegian with ambitions to retake his country from Danish domination.
After initial military setbacks, Ethelred was able to agree on the terms with Olaf, who returned to Norway to try to win his kingdom with partial success.
Hangeul is the only consciously created alphabet that is widely used in everyday life. Alphabet was invented in 1444 during the reign of King Sejong (1418-1450).
King Sejong was the fourth king of the Joseon dynasty and is one of the most respected.
Originally he named the Hangul alphabet Hunmin Jeongeum, meaning "the right sounds for instruction by the people".
There are many theories about how Sanskrit came into existence. One of them is about an Aryan migration from the West to India, where they took their language with them.
Sanskrit is an ancient language and can be compared to the Latin language spoken in Europe.
The earliest known book in the world was written in Sanskrit. After the collection of the Upanishades, Sanskrit simply faded as a result of hierarchy.
Sanskrit is a very complex and rich language, which has formed the basis of many modern, Indian languages, just as Latin forms the basis of European languages such as French and Spanish.
When the battle for France was over, Germany began preparing to invade Britain.
Germany gave the attack the code name "Operation Soløve". Most of the British Army's heavy weapons and supplies had been lost when they evacuated from Dunkerque, so the army was quite weak.
However, the Royal Navy was still much stronger than the German fleet ("Kriegsmarine") and could have destroyed any invading fleet that was sent over the English channel.
However, very few of the Royal Navy's ships were based close to the likely invasion routes, as the admirals feared they would be sunk by German air strikes.
Let us begin with an explanation of Italy's plans: Italy was mainly Germany's and Japan's "little brother".
It had a weaker army and a weaker fleet, though they had just built four new ships just before the war started.
Italy’s main goal was African countries. To conquer these countries they needed a launch pad for the troops so that they could sail across the Mediterranean and invade Africa.
For this they had to get rid of British bases and ships in Egypt. Besides this, Italy's warships were not meant to do anything else.
Now to Japan. Japan was an island kingdom like Britain.
Submarines are ships designed to travel underwater, and remain there for a long lasting period of time.
The submarines were used in both World War I and World War II. At that time they were very slow and had a very limited firing range.
At the start of the war they traveled mainly above the water, but as the radar began to develop and became more accurate, the submarines were forced to go underwater to avoid being seen.
German submarines were called U-boats. The Germans were very skilled at steering and operating their submarines.
Due to their success with submarines, since the war, the Germans have not been trusted enough to let them have many of them.
Yes! King Tutankhamun, sometimes referred to as "King Tut" or "The Boy King", is one of the most well known ancient Egyptian kings of modern times.
Interestingly, he was not considered to be particularly important in ancient times, and in most ancient royal lists he was not registered at all.
But the discovery of his grave in 1922 made him famous. Although many of the tombs of the past were robbed, his grave was largely unaffected.
Thousands of items made of precious metals and rare stones were buried with Tutankhamon and are still extremely well preserved.
With the invention of the spokes wheel, Assyrian chariots became easier, faster, and also more suitable for catching up with both soldiers and other chariots.
The arrows of their mortal crossbows could penetrate the weapons of the enemies. Around 1,000 BC, the Assyrians introduced the first cavalry.
A cavalry is an army fighting on horseback. The saddle had not been invented yet, so the Assyrian army fought on their horses' bare backs.
We know many Greek politicians, scientists and artists. Homer, the legendary blind poet, who is perhaps the most famous person from this culture, composed two masterpieces in Greek literature: the poems Iliaden and Odyssey.
Sophocles and Aristofanes are still popular playwrights, and their plays are considered to be among the greatest works of world literature.
Another famous Greek is the mathematician Pythagoras, who is most known for his famous theorem on the relationship between the sides of a right triangle.
There are different estimates of how many people speak Hindi. It is assumed to be between the second and fourth most commonly spoken language in the world.
The number of people speaking their mother tongue varies depending on whether or not you count very closely connected dialects.
Based on estimates, it is estimated that there are between 340 million to 500 million speakers and as many as 800 million people who can understand the language.
Hindi and Urdu resemble each other in their vocabulary but are different in writing; in daily conversation speakers of both languages can usually well understand each other.
About the 15th century, northern Estonia was greatly influenced culturally by Germany.
Some German monks would bring God closer to the local people, so they invented the Estonian literal language.
It was based on the German alphabet and a single letter "./õ" was added.
In time, many words borrowed from German melted together, and this was the beginning of the Enlightenment.
Traditionally, the heir to the throne would go directly into the military after completing the school.
Charles, however, attended the University of Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied anthropology and archaeology and later history and received a 2:2 (a lower second-class degree).
Charles was the first member of the British royal family to receive an education.
The European part of Turkey (eastern Thrace or Rumelia in the Balkan Peninsula) accounts for 3% of the country.
Turkey's area is more than 1600 kilometres (1000 miles) long and 800 km (500 miles) wide, and the country has a rectangular shape.
Turkey's land area, including lakes, is at 783,562 square kilometres (300,948 sq mi), of which 755,688 sq mi (291,773 sq mi) is located in Southwest Asia and 23,764 sq mi (9,174 sq mi) is located in Europe.
Turkey’s rural area makes it the world’s 37th largest country, and it is about the same size as the French mainland and Britain combined.
Turkey is surrounded by seas on three sides: the Aegean Sea to the west, the Black Sea to the north and the Mediterranean to the south.
Luxembourg has a long history, but its independence dates back to 1839.
Parts of present-day Belgium used to belong to Luxembourg, but became Belgian after the Belgian Revolution of the 1830s.
Luxembourg has always tried to remain a neutral country, but it was occupied by Germany in both World Wars I and II.
Luxembourg became one of the founding members of the organization known today as the European Union in 1957.
Druggyal Dzong is a ruined fortress and a Buddhist monastery in the upper part of Paro district (in the village of Phondy).
It is said that Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel in 1649 created the fortress to celebrate his victory over the Tibetan-Mongol forces.
A 1951 fire left only some of the Druggyal Dzong relics such as the image of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal.
After the fire, the fortress was preserved and protected and now stands as one of Bhutan's most visible attractions.
During the 18th century, Cambodia felt squeezed between the two powerful neighbors, Thailand and Vietnam.
The Thais invaded Cambodia several times in the 18th century and in 1772 they destroyed Phnom Phen.
The Vietnamese also invaded Cambodia in the late 18th century.
Eighteen percent of Venezuelans are unemployed, and most of those with work work work in the informal economy.
Two thirds of Venezuelans in work work in the service sector, nearly a quarter work in the industrial sector, and one fifth work in agriculture.
An important industry for Venezuelans is the oil industry, where the country is a net exporter, although only one percent of the population works in the oil industry.
In the time after Singapore became independent, the botanical garden’s expertise helped transform the island into a tropical garden town.
In 1981, the orchid hybrid Vanda Miss Joaquim was chosen as the country's national flower.
Every year around October, nearly 1.5 million herbivorous species cross the Mara River on travel from the northern mountains towards the southern plains and the rain.
And then back north through the west - again across the Mara River after the rain season around April.
The Serengeti region includes Serengeti National Park, Ngorongoro Conservation Area and Maswa Game Reserve in Tanzania as well as Maasai Mara National Reserve in Kenya.
Learning to create interactive media requires conventional and traditional skills as well as tools learned in interactive courses (storyboards, audio and video editing, storytelling, etc.)
Interactive design requires you to reassess your assumptions about media production and learn to think in nonlinear ways.
Interactive design requires that the components of a project can be connected to each other, but at the same time makes sense as separate units.
The disadvantage of zoom lenses is that the focal complexity and number of lens elements required to achieve a range of focal lengths are much greater than for main lenses.
This becomes less problematic as lens producers get higher standards in the production of lenses.
This has allowed zoom lenses to produce images of a quality comparable to that obtained by lenses that have a fixed focal length.
Another disadvantage of zoom lenses is that the maximum glare (speed) of the lens is usually lower.
This makes cheap zoom lenses difficult to use in low light conditions without a flash.
One of the most common problems when trying to convert a movie to DVD format is overscanning.
The majority of televisions are made in a way that works for most.
For that reason, everything you saw on TV was cut in the edges - the top, bottom and sides.
This is made to ensure that the image covers the entire screen. It is called overscan.
Unfortunately, if you make a DVD, its edges will also most likely be cut off, and if the video had subtitles too close to the bottom, they would not be fully visible.
The traditional medieval castle has long inspired the imagination, conjuring images of knight's tournaments, banquets and Arthur's chivalry.
Even when one stands in the middle of a thousand-year-old ruins, it is easy to think of the sounds and smells of battles that took place a long time ago, almost to hear the sounds of hooves on the cobblestones and smell the fears coming up from the dungeons.
But is our imagination based on reality? Why were castles built to start with? How were they designed and built?
Kirby Muxloe Castle is typical of the time period as it is more like a fortified house than it is a real castle.
Its large glass windows and thin walls would not have been able to withstand a targeted attack long.
By the 1480s, when the construction was begun by Lord Hastings, the country was relatively peaceful, and there was only a need to defend itself against small roaming robber gangs.
The European nations tried to maintain the national sovereignty of all European states by means of a system of balance of powers.
The concept was that all European nations should try to prevent a single nation from becoming strong, and thus national governments often changed their alliances to maintain balance.
The Spanish Succession War was the first war, the central point of which was the balance of power.
This marked an important change as European powers no longer wanted the pretext that it was religious wars. Therefore, the Thirty Years' War was the last war to be described as a religious war.
The temple of Artemis in Ephesus was destroyed on July 21, 356 BC in a fire set on by Herostratus.
According to history, his motivation was fame at all costs. Ephesians furiously announced that Herostratus' name should never be recorded.
The Greek historian Strabo later wrote down the name, which is why we know it today, and the temple was destroyed the same night that Alexander the Great was born.
As king Alexander offered him to pay for the rebuilding of the temple, but his offer was refused. Later, after Alexander's death, the temple was rebuilt in the year 323 BC.
Make sure your hand is as relaxed as possible while still hitting all the tones correctly - also try to avoid making too many extra moves with your fingers.
In this way you exhaust yourself as little as possible. Remember that there is no need to hit the keys hard to get more sound like the piano.
To increase the volume of the accordion, use the bellows at higher pressure or speed.
Mysticism is the pursuit of fellowship with, identity with or awareness of an ultimate reality, divinity, spiritual truth or God.
The believer seeks a direct experience, intuition, or insight into divine reality/godhead or gods.
Followers strive for certain ways of living and practices that aim to nourish those experiences.
Mysticism can be distinguished from other forms of religious faith and worship by the fact that it emphasizes the direct personal experience of a unique state of consciousness, especially those with a peaceful, insightful, happy or even ecstatic character.
Sikhism is a religion derived from the Indian subcontinent. It originated in the Punjab region in the 15th century as a result of a sectarian division in Hindu tradition.
Sikher sees their faith as a religion that is different from Hinduism, even though they recognize its Hindu roots and traditions.
Sikher calls their religion Gurmat, which in Punjabi means "the way of the guru". The guru is a fundamental element of all Indian religions, but in Sikhism has been assigned an importance which forms the foundation stone of the Sikh faith.
Religion was founded in the 15th century by Guru Nanak (1469–1539). He was followed by another nine gurus in a row.
In June 1956, however, Krushchev's promises were put to the test, as riots in Poland, where workers' protests about lack of food and cuts in wages, turned into a general protest against communism.
Although Khrushchev eventually sent tanks in to restore order, he met certain financial demands and agreed to appoint the popular Wladyslaw Gomulka as new prime minister.
The northwestern Indian subcontinent, where the Indus culture was a widespread civilization in the Bronze Age, included most of today's Pakistan as well as regions of northwest India and northeast Afghanistan,
Civilization flourished in the basins of the Indus River, and it is from here that it has its name.
While some scientists suggest that civilization, as it also existed in the areas of the now dried up Sarasvati River, should be called the Indus-Sarasvati civilization, others call it the Harappa civilization after Harappa, the first of its excavation sites excavated in the 1920s.
The militaristic tendencies of the Roman Empire promoted the development of medical progress.
Emperor Augustus began recruiting doctors, and even made the first Roman Medical Corps to be used in the wake of the battles.
Surgery knew of various forms of anesthetic such as morphine from poppy seed extract and scopolamine from bumble herb.
They became adept at amputating to save patients from gangrene and to use arterial clamps to reduce blood flow.
For centuries, the Roman Empire led to great progress in medicine and formed much of the knowledge we know today.
Pureland-origami is origami with the limitations that only one fold may be made at a time, that more complex folds such as inverted folds are not allowed, and that all folds must have simple placements.
It was developed by John Smith in the 1970s to help inexperienced leaflets or those with limited motor skills.
Children develop awareness of race and race stereotypes when they are quite young, and these race stereotypes affect their behavior.
For example, children identified with a race minority who stereotypt is perceived to be coping badly in school will fare badly in school when they learn about the stereotyp associated with their race.
MySpace is the third most popular web page in the United States and currently has 54 million profiles.
These websites have received much attention, especially in the field of education.
There are positive aspects of these sites which include easy to set up a class page which may include blogs, videos, images and other features.
You can create easy access to this page by simply providing one internet address, which is easy to remember and easy to type in for students who may find it difficult to use the keyboard or spell.
It can be customized so it is easy to read, and as little or as much color as you want can be used.
Attention Deficit Disorder "is a neurological syndrome whose classic triad of defining symptoms includes impulsivity, distraction and hyperactivity or excess energy".
This is not about learning difficulties, but about learning disorders and "from 3 to 5 percent of all children and perhaps as many as 2 million children in the United States".
Children with ADD have a hard time focusing on things like schoolwork, but they can concentrate on things they like such as playing games, watching their favorite comic books or writing sentences without punctuation.
These children tend to run into a lot of problems, as they "engage in risky behavior, get into brawls, and challenge authorities" to stimulate their brain, as their brain is not being stimulated normally.
ADD affects relationships with other peers, as the other children cannot understand why they behave as they do, or why they spell as they do, or that their maturity is on a different level.
As the ability to gain knowledge and learning changed as described above, people's learning speeds changed.
The approach to obtaining information was different. There was no more pressure on with regard to individual memories, but the ability to remember texts came more into focus.
In short, the Renaissance represented a significant change in the approach to learning and disseminating knowledge.
Unlike other primates, hominids no longer use their hands in motion to carry weight or to swing through the trees.
The hands and feet of the chimp are of the same size and length, reflecting that the hand is used to carry weight when it goes knuckled.
The human hand is shorter than the foot and has more equal falanger.
Two to three million-year-old fossils of hands show this shift in hand development from movement to manipulation.
Some people think it can be very exhausting when they experience many artificially induced lucide dreams.
The main reason for this phenomenon is that the result of the clear dreams extends the period between REM phases.
With fewer REMs per night, this state in which you actually sleep and your body is restored rarely becomes enough to become a problem.
It's as exhausting as if you woke up every 20 or thirtieth minute and watched television.
The effect depends on how often your brain tries to dream lucide dreams at night.
The Italians had problems in North Africa almost from the start. Within a week after Italy declared war on June 10, 1940, Britain's 11th Housearians had taken over Fort Capuzzo in Libya.
In an ambush attack east of Bardia, the British captured General Lastucci, the Italian Tenth Army engineer general.
On 28 June, Marshal Italo Balbo, Governor-General of Libya and apparently Mussolini's successor, was killed by self-fire during landing in Tobruk.
Fighting as modern sports is practiced at many levels by students at universities for professional and Olympic tournaments.
The sport is primarily played in duel format, where one fencer duels with another.
Golf is a game where players use clubs to beat balls into holes.
Eighteen holes are played during a regular round, where players usually begin on the first hole on the field and end on the eighteenth.
The player who uses the lowest punches or swings with the club to complete the pitch wins.
The game is played on grass, and the grass around the hole is beaten a little shorter and is called "the green".
The most common type of tourism is probably the one most people associate with travel: leisure tourism.
That's when people go somewhere very different from their everyday life to relax and have fun.
Beaches, amusement parks and campgrounds are often the most visited places of holiday tourists.
If the purpose of your visit to a particular place is to learn about its history or culture, it is called cultural tourism.
Tourists can visit different landmarks in a particular country, or they can choose to focus on just one area.
After seeing this activity, the colonists also called after reinforcements.
The troops strengthening the front positions consisted of the two 200 men large 1st and 3rd New Hampshire regiments led by Colonels John Stark and James Reed (who were subsequently appointed generals).
Stark's men were positioning themselves along the fence at the northern end of the colonists' position.
When shallow waters opened a hole along the Mystic River along the northeastern part of the peninsula, they quickly extended the fence with a short stone wall to the north, ending at the water edge of a small beach.
Gridley or Stark put a stake about 100 feet (30 m) in front of the fence and gave orders that no one should shoot until the soldiers passed it.
The American plan was dependent on coordinated attacks from three different directions being fired.
General John Cadwalder launched a diversion attack against the British garrison in Bordentown to block any reinforcement.
General James Ewing would take 700 men across the river at Trenton Ferry, take over the bridge over Assunpink Creek and prevent enemy troops from escaping.
The primary assault force of 2,400 men were to cross the river nine miles north of Trenton and then split into two groups, one under Greene and one under Sullivan, to start an attack at dawn.
With the change of the race from a quarter to half a mile, the runner's speed becomes much less important, while endurance becomes an absolute necessity.
Of course, a first-class half-miler, a person who can beat two minutes, must base his race on speed, but endurance is also an important factor.
Some cross-country skiing during the winter combined with gymnastics work for the upper part of the body is the best preparation for the running season.
Good nutrition habits alone cannot produce performance in elite class, but they can significantly affect the overall well-being of young athletes.
Maintaining a healthy energy balance, drinking plenty and understanding the meaning of taking supplements can improve athletes' performance and give them a better enjoyment when they play sports.
Medium distance running is a relatively cheap sport; however, there are many misunderstandings about the few parts required as equipment to participate.
One can buy products as needed, but most will have little or no significant effect on one's performance.
Sportsmen may feel that they prefer a product, even if it has no real benefits.
The atom can be considered one of the fundamental building blocks of all matter.
The unit is very complex unit and consists of a central core around which orbits electrons, about the same as the planets orbiting the sun, cf. a simplified Bohr model – see figure 1.1.
The core consists of two particles - neutrons and protons.
Protons have positive electrical charge, while neutrons have no charge. Electrons have negative electrical charge.
To check the victim, you must first investigate the area to ensure your own safety.
You must notice the victim's position when you get closer to him or her, and look for automatic warning signs.
If you get hurt while trying to help, you may only make the situation worse.
The study found that depression, fear, and disaster mediated the relationship between pain and disability in people with lower back pain.
Only the effects of disaster thoughts, not depression or fear, were conditional upon weekly, structured meetings with a medical assistant.
Those who participated in regular activity required more support in terms of negative perception of pain, showing the differences in chronic pain and the feeling of discomfort from normal physical movement.
Vision, or the ability to see, depends on sensory organs for the visual system or eyes.
There are many different constructions of eyes, which have different complexity depending on the requirements of the organism.
The different structures have different capacities, are sensitive to different wavelengths and have different degrees of sharpness, they also require different treatments to make input and different numbers make sense, and it all works optimally.
A stock is a collection of organisms of a particular species within a specific geographical area.
When a country's population has common phenotypic features, they are called monomorphic.
When individuals show multiple variants of a particular trait, they are polymorphic.
Also colonies of hiking ants march and build nests in various phases.
In the nomadic phase, army ants march at night and stop to camp by day.
The colony begins a nomadic phase when there are no doctors food in the area. During this phase, the colony makes temporary nests that are being changed every day.
Each of these nomadic ravages or marches last for about 17 days.
What is a cell? The word cell derives from the Latin word "cella", meaning "small space", and it was used for the first time by a microscopeist who observed the structure of the cork.
The cell is the basic unit of all living things, and all organisms consist of one or more cells.
Cells are actually so basic and critical to study life that they are often referred to as "the building block of life".
The nervous system maintains homeostasis by sending nerve impulses throughout the body, to keep blood flow flowing, as well as to keep it undisturbed.
These nerve impulses can be sent quickly around the entire body, helping to keep the body safe from any potential threat.
Compared to other violent storms, tornadoes only hit a small area, but they can, in turn, destroy everything in their way.
Tornadoes rip out trees with their roots, tear boards of buildings, and throw cars into the air. The most violent two percent of tornadoes last more than three hours.
These monster storms have winds up to 480 km/h (133 m/s; 300 miles per hour).
Man has made and used lenses to enlarge for thousands of years.
However, the first real telescopes were manufactured in Europe at the end of the 16th century.
These telescopes used a combination of two lenses to make distant objects appear both larger and closer.
Greed and egotism will always exist, and it is part of the way cooperation works that once the majority has taken over, it will always be possible to gain more in the short term by acting selfishly.
Hopefully, most people will realise that their best option in the long term is to cooperate with others.
Many dream about the day when people can travel to another star and explore other worlds. Some wonder what is out there and some believe that aliens or other lives may live on another planet.
But if this ever happens, it will probably not happen until very soon. The stars are so scattered that there are several billion kilometers between stars that are "neighbors".
Perhaps one day your great-grandchildren will stand in a strange world and think of their ancient ancestors?
Animals are made of many cells, they eat things and digest them in their bodies, most animals can move.
Only animals have brains (though not all animals have one; jellyfish, for example, have no brains).
There are animals all over the world, digging in the ground, swimming in the oceans, and flying in the sky.
Cells are the smallest structural and functional units for a living (thing) organism.
Cell comes from the Latin word cella, which means small space.
If you look at living things under a microscope, you will see that they are formed from small squares or spheres.
The English biologist Robert Hooke saw small squares in cork with a microscope.
They had a shape that looked like space. He was the first to be able to observe dead cells.
Elements and chemical compounds can go from one state to another without changing.
Nitrogen in gaseous form still has the same properties as liquid nitrogen. The liquid form has higher density, but the molecules are still the same.
Water is another example: water is composed of two hydrogen atoms and an oxygen atom.
It has the same molecular structure, whether it is gas, liquid or solid.
Although its physical condition may change, its chemical state remains the same.
Time is something that's everywhere, and it affects everything we do, but it's hard to understand.
Time has been studied by religious, philosophical, and scientific scientists for thousands of years.
We experience time as a series of events going from the future through the present to the past.
Time is also the way in which we compare the duration (length) of events.
You can mark the passage of time yourself by observing the repetition of a cyclical event. A cyclical event is something that regularly happens over and over again.
Computers today are used to manipulate images and videos.
Advanced animations can be created on computers, and such animations are becoming more and more widespread in TV and film.
Music is often recorded using sophisticated computers that can process and mix the sound.
For much of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, it was believed that the first inhabitants of New Zealand were the Maori people who hunted giant birds called moa.
The theory then established the idea that the Maori people immigrated from Polynesia into a large fleet and took New Zealand from the Moriorians, and established an agricultural community.
However, new evidence suggests that the Moriorians were a group of mainland Maoris who migrated from New Zealand to the Chatham Islands and developed their own distinctive, peaceful culture.
There was also another tribe in the Chatham Islands, these were Maoris who were migrated from New Zealand.
They called themselves the Moriorians.There were a few clashes and eventually the Moriorians were wiped out.
Persons who had been involved in several seasons helped us to appreciate our strengths and passions while assessing our problems and mistakes sincerely.
As we listened to individuals who shared their individual, family and organizational stories, we gained a valuable insight into the past as well as some of the personalities that influenced the organization's culture in a positive or negative way.
While understanding one's history does not require understanding culture, it at least helps people to get a sense of where they fall within the organization's history.
When individuals assess the successes and discover errors, they, as well as all the participants, gain a better understanding of the values, mission and driving forces of the organization.
In this case, it helped people to be open to new changes and a new direction for the local church to recall past cases of entrepreneurship and the successes it brought about.
Such success stories lessened the fear of change and created positive inclinations toward change in the future.
Converging thought patterns are problem solving techniques that bring together various ideas or areas to find a solution.
The focus of this thinking is speed, logic and accuracy, as well as the identification of facts, the recycling of existing techniques, and the collection of information.
The most important factor in this thinking is: there is only one right answer; one thinks only of two answers, namely the right or the wrong.
The way to think is associated with specific scientific or standard procedures.
People who think this way use logical thinking, and they are able to remember patterns, solve problems, and work with scientific tests.
Man is by far the most talented species in reading the thoughts of others.
This means that we are able to correctly predict what other people perceive, plan, believe, know or want.
Among these skills is the ability to understand the intentions of others. It enables us to clarify any indistinctness in physical actions.
For example, if you saw someone smash a car window, you would likely assume that the person was stealing a stranger’s car.
It would be necessary to judge him differently if he had lost his car keys and it was his own car that he was trying to break into.
MR is based on a physical phenomenon called nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), which was discovered in the 1930s by Felix Bloch (employed at Stanford University) and Edward Purcell (from Harvard University).
In this resonance, the magnetic field and radio waves cause the atoms to emit small radio signals.
In the year 1970, Raymond Damadian, a doctor and researcher, discovered the basis for using imaging with magnetic resonance as a tool for medical diagnoses.
Four years later, the patent was approved, which was the world's first approved patent within MRI.
In 1977, Dr. Damadian completed the construction of the first "wholebody" MRI scanner, which he called the "Indomitable".
Asynchronous communication allows time to reflect and respond to others.
It allows students to work at their own pace and manage how quickly they receive guidance information.
There are also fewer time limits and good opportunities for flexible working hours. (Bremer, 1998)
The use of the Internet and World Wide Web gives students access to information at any time.
Students can also submit questions to instructors at any time of the day and expect proportionately quick answers, rather than waiting for the next physical meeting.
The post-modern approach to learning gives freedom from absolutes; there is not one certainly good way to learn.
In fact, there is not a single good thing to learn. Learning takes place in the meeting between the learner and the knowledge presented.
Our current experience with all the do-it-yourself and informative, learning-based television programs illustrates this point.
So many of us are there where we watch a television show that informs us about a process or an experience that we will never participate in, nor will we use the information we receive.
We will never renovate a car, build a fountain in our backyard, travel to Peru to investigate old ruins, or remodel our neighbor's house.
Thanks to underwater fibre optic cable connections to Europe as well as satellite-based broadband, Greenland is well connected and 93% of the population has internet access.
Your hotel or hosts (if you live in a guest house or private home) will probably have wi-fi or a computer with internet connection, and all cities have an internet café or a place with public wi-fi.
As mentioned above, the word "Eskimo", although still considered acceptable in the United States, is considered to be derogatory to many Arctic people outside the United States - especially in Canada.
While you may hear that word being used by Greenlandic natives, it should not be used by foreigners.
The native inhabitants of Greenland call themselves Inuits in Canada, and in Greenland they call themselves Kalaalleq (disambiguation: Kalaallit), which means "Greenlander".
In general, crime and hatred of foreigners are almost unknown in Greenland. Even in cities there are no "dangerous areas".
Cold weather may be the only real danger the unprepared person will face.
If you visit Greenland during the cold months (and with rain that it gets colder and colder the further north you take), it is essential to bring warm enough clothes.
The very long days of summer can lead to problems in getting enough sleep and accompanying health problems.
In summer you should also keep an eye on the Nordic mosquitoes. They give you no diseases, but they can be annoying.
San Francisco's economy is associated with being a world-class tourist attraction, while its economy is diversified.
The main employment sectors are professional services, the public sector, finance, trade and tourism.
The fact that it is often portrayed in music, film, literature and popular culture has helped make the city and its landmarks known all over the world.
San Francisco has developed a large tourist infrastructure with numerous hotels, restaurants and the best conference facilities.
San Francisco is also one of the best places in the country for other Asian food: Korean, Thai, Indian and Japanese.
A journey to Walt Disney World is like a great pilgrimage for many American families.
The "typical" visit consists of flying to Orlando International Airport, driving in a bus to a Disney hotel on site, a week's stay without leaving Disney's property and a return trip.
There are an infinite number of possible variations, but this is still what most people think when they talk about "taking to Disney World".
Many tickets sold online on auction sites such as eBay or Craigslist are partially used multi-day Park Hopper tickets.
Although it is a very common activity, Disney is not allowed: tickets are not transferable.
To camp in the Grand Canyon itself, a wilderness permit is required.
Permissions are limited to protecting the gap and are available from the first day of the month, four months before the starting month.
Therefore, a backcountry permit for any starting date in May becomes available on 1 January.
Seats for the most popular areas such as Bright Angel Campground near Phantom Ranch, are generally made up via the queries received on the first date they are open to reservations.
There are a limited number of permissions reserved for drop-in requests, which are available according to the first-to-mill principle.
Getting to southern Africa by car is a great way to see the beauty of the entire region as well as finding places outside the normal tourist routes.
This can be done in a normal car with careful planning, but a four-wheel drive is highly recommended, and many locations are only available with a four-wheel drive with a high wheel base.
Remember, when you plan that even though South Africa is stable, not all neighbouring countries are.
Visa requirements and costs vary from nation to nation and change depending on the country you come from.
Each country also has unique laws that require different objects for emergencies that must be found in the car.
Victoria Falls is a town in the western part of Zimbabwe across the border from Livingstone, Zambia and close to Botswana.
The city is located right next to the waterfalls, and they are the main attraction, but this popular tourist destination offers both adventurers and tourists plenty of opportunities for a longer stay.
During the rain season (November to March) the water volume will be larger, and the waterfalls will be more dramatic.
You'll definitely get wet if you cross the bridge, or walk along the trails winding around the waterfalls.
On the other hand, it is precisely because the amount of water is so large that your view of the actual waterfalls becomes blurred—by all the water!
Tutankhamun's tomb (KV62). KV62 is possibly the most famous of all the tombs in the valley as it was the site of Howard Carter's discovery in 1922 of the almost perfect maintenance of the young king's royal burial.
Compared to most other regents' graves, Tutankhamun's tomb is hardly worth a visit, as it is considerably smaller and with few decorations.
If you are interested in seeing the damage caused to the mummy while trying to remove it from the coffin, you are disappointed as only its head and shoulders are visible.
The amazing riches from the grave no longer exist in it, but have been moved to the Egyptian museum in Cairo.
It would be best if visitors with limited time spent their time elsewhere.
Phnom Krom, 12 km southwest of Siem Reap. This temple was built on a hilltop in the late 9th century during the reign of King Yasovarman.
The bleak atmosphere of the temple and the view of Lake Tonle Sap make it worth it to complete the climbing to the hill.
A visit to the area can be easily combined with a boat trip to the lake.
The Angkor Pass is necessary to access the temple, so remember to take your passport with you when you travel to Tonle Sap.
Jerusalem is the capital and largest city in Israel, although most other countries and the United Nations do not recognize it as Israel’s capital.
The ancient city of the Judean Highlands has a fascinating history that goes back thousands of years in time.
The city is sacred to the three monotheistic religions - Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, and serves as a spiritual, religious, and cultural center.
Due to the religious significance of the city and in particular the numerous attractions of the Old City area, Jerusalem is one of the essential tourist destinations in Israel.
Jerusalem has many historical, archaeological and cultural sites as well as lively and packed shopping centers, cafes and restaurants.
Ecuador requires Cuban citizens to receive an invitation letter before entering Ecuador via international airports or border crossings.
This letter is to be legalised by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ecuador and meets certain requirements.
These requirements aim to ensure an organised flow of immigration between the two countries.
Cuban citizens who have an American green card should go to an Ecuadorian consulate to obtain an exemption from the requirement.
Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months after the date of your trip. You must have a return ticket or a ticket for a further trip to prove the length of your stay.
Tours are cheaper for larger groups, so if you are alone or with only one friend, you can try to meet with other people and make a group of four to six people so you can get a better price per person.
However, this should not be something you worry about, as tourists are often moved around to fill the cars.
In fact, it seems to be more of a way to trick people into thinking they have to pay more.
This steep mountain rises high above the northern end of Machu Picchu, and is often the background for many pictures of the ruins.
It looks a little scary from below, and it is a steep and difficult ascent, but most persons in reasonable shape should be able to handle it in about 45 minutes.
Stone steps are laid along most of the path, and in the more steep sections steel cables form a supporting railing.
That being said, you should expect to be breathed, and you should be careful on the steeper parts of the route, especially in wet weather as it can quickly become dangerous.
There's a little cave close to the top that you have to go through, it's pretty low and narrow and hard to get through
It is best to see the places and wildlife of the Galapago Lakes by boat, just as Charles Darwin did in 1835.
Over 60 cruise ships sail through the Galapagos waters - with sizes from 8 to 100 passengers.
Most book their seats in good time (since the boats are usually well filled during the high season).
Make sure that the agent you book through is a specialist in Galapagos and has a good knowledge of many different types of ships.
This will ensure that your particular interests and/or limitations are matched with the ship that best suits them.
Before the Spanish arrived in the 16th century, northern Chile was under the rule of the Incas, while the original Araucans (Mapuche) lived in central and southern Chile.
The Mapuche people were also one of the last independent American indigenous groups which were not completely integrated into the Spanish-speaking regime until after Chile became independent.
Although Chile declared independent in 1810 (mid the Napoleonic Wars which left Spain without a functioning central government for a few years), they first achieved the decisive victory over the Spaniards in 1818.
The Dominican Republic (Spanish: República Dominicana) is a country in the Caribbean located on the eastern half of the island of Hispaniola, which it shares with Haiti.
Besides white sandy beaches and mountain landscapes, the country is home to the oldest European city in America, which is now part of Santo Domingo.
The island was first inhabited by the Taínos and Caribes people. The Caribbean was an Arawakan-speaking people who had arrived about 10,000 BC.
Within a few years of the arrival of the European explorers, the people of Tainos had been significantly reduced by the Spanish conquerors
Based on Fray Bartolomé de las Casas (Tratado de las Indias), the Spanish conquerors killed about 100,000 taínos between 1492 and 1498.
Jardín de la Unión. This area was built as an atrium to a 17th-century monastery, where Templo de San Diego is the only surviving building.
It now serves as the central square, and there always happens a lot, day and night.
There are several restaurants surrounding the garden, and in the afternoon and evening free concerts are often given from the central garden pavilion.
Callejon del Beso (Kyssets Gyde). Two balconies, separated exclusively by 69 cm., are home to a historic love legend.
Some kids will tell you the story for a few pennies.
Bowen Island is a popular destination for day trips or weekend excursions, and offers kayaking, hiking, shops, restaurants and more.
This authentic community is located in Howe Sound just outside Vancouver, and there is easy access via scheduled water taxis departing Granville Island in downtown Vancouver.
For those who like outdoor activities, a trip up the Sea to Sky corridor is essential.
Whistler (1.5 hour drive from Vancouver) is expensive, but known due to the 2010 Winter Olympics.
In winter you can try some of the best skiing in North America, and in summer you can try something authentic mountain biking.
Permissions must be reserved in advance. You must have a permit to stay in Sirena.
Sirena is the only ranger station which offers accommodation in dormitories as well as warm meals besides camping. La Leona, San Pedrillo and Los Patos offer only camping and no food.
It is possible to buy park permits at the ranger station in Puerto Jiménez, but they do not receive credit cards.
The park service (MINAE) does not issue park permits more than one month before expected arrival.
CafeNet El Sol offers a 30$ or 10$ reservation service for a one-day pass; more details can be seen on their Corcovado page.
Cook Islands is an islandate in free association with New Zealand, the islands are located in Polynesia, in the middle of the South Pacific.
It is an archipelago with 15 islands spread over 2.2 million km2 sea.
Being in the same time zone as Hawaii, the islands are sometimes thought of as "Hawaii below".
Although smaller, they remind some older visitors of Hawaii before it became a state, without all the major tourist hotels and other developments.
Cook Islands have no cities but are composed of 15 different islands. The main islands are Rarotonga and Aitutaki.
In today’s developed countries, offering luxury beds and breakfasts has been elevated to a kind of art form.
At the top end, of course, Bed & Breakfasts compete mainly in two areas: sleeping conditions and breakfast.
Therefore, you can often find in the finest such establishments the most luxurious linens, perhaps a handmade quilted carpet or an antique bed.
Breakfast may include seasonal treats from the region or the host's specialty.
The site can be an old, historic building with antique furniture, a well-kept plot and a swimming pool.
Getting into your own car and going on a long drive is in itself an appealing idea because it is so simple.
Unlike larger vehicles, you probably already know how to drive your car and you know its limitations.
Setting up a tent on private properties or in a city of any size can easily attract unwanted attention.
In short, the use of your car is a good way to take a road trip, but rarely in itself a form of "camping".
Carcamping is possible if you have a large minivan, SUV, sedan or station wagon with seats that can be laid down.
Some hotels have a legacy from the golden age of steam railways and ocean ships: before World War II, in the 19th or early 20th centuries.
These hotels were where the rich and famous from that time lived, and often had fine dining places and nightlife.
The old-fashioned fittings, the lack of the latest facilities and a certain graceful aging are also part of their character.
Although they are usually privately owned, they sometimes accommodate visiting heads of state and other senior officials.
A traveler with lots of money may consider flying around the world and splitting the trip with stays at many of these hotels.
A network for the exchange of hospitality is an organisation that connects travelers and local residents of the cities they are going to visit.
Signing up for such a network usually only requires completing an online form; although some networks offer or require further confirmation.
A list of available hosts is then provided, either in print and/or online, sometimes with references and reviews from other travellers.
Couchsurfing was founded in January 2004, after computer programmer Casey Fenton found a cheap flight to Iceland but lacked a place to stay.
He sent emails to the students of the local university and received an overwhelming number of offers for a free place to stay.
Hostels are intended primarily for young people - a typical guest is in his twenties - but often you can also find older travelers there.
Families with children are a rare sight, but some hostels allow them in private rooms.
The city of Beijing in China becomes the host city of the Winter Olympics in 2022, which will make the city the first city to have hosted both the Summer and Winter Olympics.
Beijing will host the opening and closing ceremonies as well as indoor events on ice.
Other ski events will take place in the Taizicheng ski area of Zhangjiakou, approximately 220 km (140 miles) from Beijing.
Most of the temples have a festival once this year, which takes place from late November to mid May. The festival varies according to the temple's annual calendar.
The temple festivals are most often celebrated when the temple is anniversary, when the presiding god is birthday or in case of other major events associated with the temple.
It is very interesting to see Kerala's temple festivals with their frequent parades with decorated elephants, temple orchestras and other festivities.
A world exhibition (often called World Exposition or Expo) is a major international festival of art and science.
The participating countries present both artistic and educational exhibitions in their national pavilions to show the country's view of world problems or to show the country's culture and history.
International exhibitions on gardening are specialized events showing flower setups, botanical gardens and everything else related to plants.
Although in theory they can take place annually (as long as they are in different countries), they do not do so in practice.
These events usually last somewhere between three and six months and are held at places that are at least 50 hectares large.
Over the years, many different film formats have been used. Standard 35 mm films (36 x 24 mm negative) are clearly the most common.
It can usually be refilled fairly easily if you run out, and provides solution that is roughly comparable to a current DSLR.
Some medium format film cameras use a format of 6 x 6 cm, more precisely a 56 x 56 mm negative format.
This gives a resolution almost four times greater than a 35 mm negative (3136 mm2 versus 864).
Animal life is among the most challenging motives for a photographer and requires a combination of good luck, patience, experience and good equipment.
Nature photography is often taken for granted, but like photography at all, a picture is worth a thousand words.
Natural photography often requires a long tele lens, but other lenses are needed for things such as a flock of birds, or tiny creatures.
Many exotic animals are hard to find, and parks sometimes have rules on whether to take pictures for commercial use.
Wild animals can be either shy or aggressive. The environment can be cold, hot or hostile in another way.
The world has over 5,000 different languages, with more than twenty of them having 50 million or more speakers.
Shrinked words are often also easier to understand than the spoken words. This applies especially to addresses which are often difficult to pronounce in an understandable way.
The population of many countries speaks fluent English, and in even more countries one can expect some knowledge - especially among younger people.
Imagine people from both Manchester, Boston, Jamaica and Sydney sitting around a table and having dinner together at a restaurant in Toronto.
They entertain each other with stories from their hometowns told with their local accents and special jargon.
The cheapest way to get food is usually to buy food at the supermarket. However, without the possibility of cooking, the choice is limited to ready meals.
Supermarkets are increasingly getting a more varied selection of ready-made foods. Some even offer a microwave or the like where the food can be heated.
In some countries or shop types there is at least one on-site restaurant, which is often quite informal and has affordable prices.
Make copies of your policy and your insurance company's contact details, and make sure to have them with you.
They must display the insurance company's e-mail address and international telephone numbers for advice/authorisations and for reporting cases.
Make sure to have an additional copy in your luggage and online (sent as attachment in an email to yourself or stored in "the cloud").
If you are travelling with a laptop or tablet, you can store a copy in memory or on disk (available without internet).
Also give copies of the policy/contact information to fellow travellers as well as family or friends at home who are willing to help.
Moose (also known as moose) is not as such aggressive, but they defend themselves if they experience a threat.
When people don't see elk as potentially dangerous, they can risk getting too close and putting themselves in danger.
Drink alcoholic beverages in moderation. Alcohol affects everyone in different ways and it is important to know your limit.
Possible long-term health effects from excessive drinking may include liver damage and even blindness or death. The risk increases if you consume illegally produced alcohol.
Illegal spirits may contain various dangerous impurities, including methanol, which can cause blindness or death even in small amounts.
Spectacles can be cheaper abroad, especially in low-income countries where wages are lower.
Consider having an examination of the eyes in your own home, especially if the insurance covers it, and bring the prescription so that it can be archived elsewhere.
The exclusive frames from recognized brands found in such areas may have two problems; some may be cheap copies, and the genuine imported goods may be more expensive than at home.
Coffee is one of the world’s most traded items, and you can probably find many types in your hometown.
Nevertheless, there are many distinctive ways of drinking coffee around the world that are worth experiencing.
Canyoning (or: canyoneering) involves walking at the bottom of a canyon which is either dry or full of water.
Canyoning combines elements of swimming, climbing and jumping - but it requires relatively little training or physical form to get started (compared with, for example, mountaineering, diving or alpine skiing).
Hiking is an outdoor activity that consists of walking in natural surroundings, often on hiking trails.
Day hikes involve distances from less than a mile up to longer routes, which can be managed in a single day.
During a day’s hike on an easy route, there is no need for the great preparations, and anyone in reasonably good shape can enjoy the trip.
Families with small children may need more preparations, but one day outdoors is a good experience even with babies and kindergarten children.
Internationally, there are almost 200 organisations for touring, most of which are independent.
The sequel of Global Running Tours, Go Running Tours, networks with up to several sightrunning providers spread across four continents.
With roots in "Barcelonas Running Tours Barcelona" and Copenhagen's "Running Copenhagen", "Running Tours Prague" ended, based in Prague, and others quickly joined them.
There are many things you need to consider before and when you go somewhere.
When you travel, expect that things are not as they are "at home". Manners, laws and rules, food, traffic, settlements, standards, languages and so on will to some extent be different from where you live.
This is something that you must always remember to avoid disappointments or perhaps even negativity over the local ways of doing things.
Travel agencies have existed since the 19th century. A travel agent is usually a good way to find a journey that extends beyond a traveler's past experience of nature, culture, language or low income countries.
Although most agencies are willing to take on most common reservations, many agents specialise in certain travel types, price classes or destinations.
It may be better to use an agent who regularly book similar trips for you.
Look at the tours the agency offers either on their website or in their shop window.
If you want to see the world cheaply either out of necessity, as a lifestyle or as a challenge, there are various ways to do it.
Overall, they fall into two categories: work while travelling or try to limit your expenses.
Those who are willing to sacrifice comfort, time and predictability to push expenditure down to almost zero can see during minimum budget travel.
The information is based on the fact that travellers do not steal, commit burglary, participate in the illegal market, beg or otherwise exploit other people for their own benefit.
An immigration check is usually the first stop when you leave an aircraft, ship or other means of transport.
In some trains crossing borders, inspections are carried out on the train and you should have valid ID with you when you board one of these trains.
On a night train with overnight accommodation, the conductor can collect passports so you don't have to be interrupted in your sleep.
Registration is a further requirement in connection with the visa application. In some countries, you must register your place of residence, as well as the address at which you live, with the local authorities.
This may require you to fill out a form with the local police or visit the immigration offices.
In many countries with such a law, the local hotels handle the registration (make sure to ask).
In other cases, only those staying outside tourist accommodation must be registered.
Architecture is about the design and construction of buildings. A building's architecture is often a sight in itself.
Many buildings are beautiful to look at, and the view from a tall building or from a well placed window can be a like to the soul.
Architecture has much in common with other areas such as urban planning, civil engineering, decorative arts and landscape design.
Because many of the pueblos are so remote, you will not find any significant nightlife unless you travel to Albuquerque or Santa Fe.
However, drinks are served in almost all the casinos listed above, and several of them pick up well-known entertainers (mainly the big ones located around Albuquerque and Santa Fe).
Beware: here the city's small bars are not always good places to hang out for visitors from other states.
First, northern New Mexico has major problems with drinking driving, and the concentration of drinking drivers is high close to bars in small cities.
Unwanted murals or drawings are known as graffiti.
Although it is far from a modern phenomenon, most people probably associate it with young vandalizing public as well as private property with spray paint.
Nowadays, however, there are well-known graffiti artists, graffiti events and "legal" walls. Graffitimaleries in this context often resemble works of art rather than unreadable tags.
Being able to throw with Boomerang is a popular ability that many tourists would like to learn.
If you want to learn how to throw with a boomerang which comes back to you, make sure you have a boomerang that is suitable for the purpose.
Most of the boomerangs you can get in Australia are actually non-recurring. It is best for beginners not to try to throw in windy weather.
Hangi meals are prepared in a hot hole in the ground.
The hole is either heated with hot stones from a fire, and in some places geothermal heat will make soil areas natural heat.
The hangien is often used to cook a traditional fried dinner.
Several places in Rotorua offer geothermal hangi, while other hangi can be tasted in Christchurch, Wellington and elsewhere.
MetroRail has two classes on commuter trains in and around Cape Town: MetroPlus (also called First Class) and Metro (called Third Class).
MetroPlus is more comfortable and less crowded, but slightly more expensive - yet still cheaper than the normal metro tickets in Europe.
All trains have both MetroPlus and Metro carriages; MetroPlus wagons are always in the rear part of the train closest to Cape Town.
Carrying the Baggage of Others - You must never let your bags out of your sight, especially when crossing international borders.
You may experience yourself being used as a drug carrier without your knowledge, which will cause a lot of problems for you.
This includes waiting in line, as drug dogs can come into use at any time without notice.
Some countries have very severe penalties, even for first-time crimes, such as prison sentences over 10 years or the death penalty.
Left bags are a target for thieves, and can also attract attention from authorities that are wary of bomb threats.
At home, this constant exposure to local bacteria means that you are probably already immune to them.
But in other parts of the world, where the bacteriological fauna is new to you, you are much more likely to run into problems.
In warmer climates, bacteria also grow faster and survive longer outside the body.
From there come the plagues of Delhi-mave, Pharaoh's curse, Montezuma's revenge and their many friends.
As with breathing problems in colder climates, it is quite common to have bowel problems in hot climates. They are in most cases extremely irritating but not really dangerous.
If you travel to a developing country for the first time - or to a new part of the world - do not underestimate the potential cultural shock.
Many stable and experienced travellers have been overwhelmed by the new development of world travel, where many small cultural adjustments can quickly become overwhelming.
Especially in your first days, you should consider not holding back spending money on hotels, food and service in Western style and quality to help you settle in.
Do not sleep on a mattress or pillow on the ground, in areas where you do not know about the local wildlife.
If you want to camp, you should bring a camp bed or hammock to keep snakes, scorpions and so on away.
Fill your home with a tasteful coffee in the morning and relaxing chamomile tea in the evening.
When you are on a staycation, you have time to indulge yourself and spend a few extra minutes brewing something special.
If you feel more adventurous, you can seize the opportunity to make some smoothies:
you may find a simple drink that you can make for your breakfast when you return to your daily routine.
If you live in a city with a varied drinking culture, you can go to bars or pubs in neighborhoods you usually do not visit.
For those who do not know medical jargon, the words contagious and infectious have different meanings.
A contagious disease is caused by a pathogen, such as a virus, bacterium, fungus or other parasites.
An infectious disease is a disease that is easily transmitted to other people who are near an infected person.
Many states demand that visitors entering the country, or residents leaving the country, be vaccinated against a number of diseases.
These requirements may often depend on which countries a traveler has visited or plans to visit.
One of the forces of Charlotte, North Carolina is that the city has plenty of high-quality offers for families.
Residents from other areas often mention good conditions for children’s families as a primary reason to move there, and visitors find that the city is easy to enjoy with children.
For the past 20 years, the number of child-friendly opportunities in Charlotte's hinterland has grown exponentially.
Taxis are generally not used by families in Charlotte, although they can be quite practical in certain situations.
There is a surcharge for having more than 2 passengers so that this option can be more expensive than is necessary.
Antarctica is the coldest place on earth and surrounds the South Pole.
Tourist visits are expensive, require good physical fitness, can only take place during the summer months of Nov-Feb, and are largely limited to the peninsula, islands and the Ross Sea.
A few thousand employees live here in the summer in about 50 bases mainly in these areas; a small number remain over the winter.
The inner Antarctica is a desert plateau, which is covered by 2-3 km of ice.
At times special air trips enter the country to climb mountains or to reach the south pole, which has a large base.
The South Pole route is a 1,600-kilometre-long path from McMurdo station on the Ross Sea to the pole.
It is compressed snow with cracks filled and flag marked. The only thing that can move on it is specialized tractors that draw sledges with fuel and supplies.
These are not very easy, so the path must swing around the transantarchtic mountains to lead up to the plateau.
The most common cause of accidents in winter is slippery roads, road pavement (troves) and especially stair steps.
You will at least need footwear with suitable soles. Summer shoes are often very smooth on ice and snow, and some winter boots are even inadequate.
The pattern should be deep enough - 5 mm (1/5 in) or more - and the material should remain soft in cold temperatures.
Some boots have buds, and there are extra buds for smooth conditions that can be put on most shoes and boots on either the heels or both the heels and soles.
The heels should be low and wide. Sand, gravel or salt (calcium chloride) is often spread on roads or paths so that you can better stand firm.
Lavins are not abnormal; there is a limit to how much snow steep slopes can hold, so the excess amounts of snow will fall like avalanches.
The problem is that snow is sticky, so something is needed to make it fall down; and when a little snow falls, it can be what makes the rest fall.
Sometimes it is the sun's warming of the snow that makes the appearance, sometimes it is more snow or other natural events, and often it is a human being.
A tornado is a rotating column of air with very low pressure which absorbs the surrounding air inwards and upwards.
They generate strong winds (often 100-200 miles/hour) and can lift heavy objects up into the air and carry them around when the tornado moves.
They start as hoppers coming down from storm clouds, and become "tornados" when they touch the ground.
Providers of personal VPN (virtual private network) are an excellent way to bypass both political censorship and commercial IP geofiltration.
They are better than web proxys for several reasons: They redirect all Internet traffic, not just http.
They usually offer higher bandwidth and better service quality. They are encrypted and are therefore also more difficult to spy against.
Media companies also regularly lie about what the purpose of this is, claiming it is to "prevent piracy".
In fact, region codes absolutely have no effect on illegal copying: a bite-by-bit copy of a disk will play perfectly fine on any device where the original can be played.
The real aim is to give these companies more and better control over their markets; it is about making money.
Because calls are directed via the Internet, you do not need to use a phone company where you live or where you travel.
There is also no requirement that you obtain a local number from the community where you live; you can obtain a satellite internet connection in Chicken, Alaska, and choose a number that claims that you live in sunny Arizona.
For the most part, you need to purchase a global number separately, which allows PSTN phones to call you. The place of origin of the number has meaning for people who call you.
Apps for real-time text translation - applications that can automatically translate entire text parts from one language to another.
Some of the programs in this category can even translate texts in foreign languages on signs or other objects in the real world when the user points his smartphone at these objects.
The translation machines have become much better, and now often provide more or less correct translations (and more rarely gibberish), but some care is needed as they may still have understood it quite wrongly.
One of the most prominent apps in this category is Google Translate, which allows offline translation once the preferred language data is downloaded.
GPS navigation apps on your smartphone can be the easiest and most convenient way to find your way around when you're not in your home country.
It can save money compared to buying new cards for a GPS, a separate GPS device or renting one from a car rental company.
If you do not have data connection on your phone or when it is out of reach, its functionality may be limited or inaccessible.
Every kiosk is filled with a confusing selection of prepaid prepaid prepaid prepaid cards, which can be used in payphones or ordinary phones.
Although most cards are good for calls everywhere, some specialize in providing good call rates to certain country groups.
Access to these services is often via a duty-free telephone number which can be reached from most phones at no cost.
Rules on general photography also apply to wide-ranging recording, possibly even more.
If it is not allowed to take a picture of something, you should not consider filming it at all.
If you use a drone, you should check in advance what is allowed to film and what requires further permission.
Flying a drone close to an airport or above a crowd is almost always a bad idea, even if it is not illegal in your area.
Nowadays, flights are rarely booked directly from the airline, without first applying and comparing prices.
Sometimes the same flight can have very different prices from different providers, and it pays to compare results, as well as to check the airline's own website before ordering.
Although you may not need a visa for short visits as a tourist in certain countries, or for business visits, it often takes a longer stay to go there as a foreign student than to go there as a casual tourist.
In general, you need a visa in advance if you are to stay in a foreign country for a longer period of time.
Study visa generally has different requirements and application procedures, compared to normal tourist or business visa.
In most countries, you will need an admission letter from the institution you wish to study with, as well as proof of the means to support yourself for at least the first year.
Contact the institution as well as the immigration agency of the country you wish to study in for details of the requirements.
Unless you are a diplomat, work abroad usually means that you have to pay income tax in the country in which you are based.
Income tax is structured differently in different countries, and tax rates and classes vary widely from country to country.
In some federal countries, such as the United States and Canada, income tax is levied at both federal and local levels, so rates and tariffs can vary from one region to another.
Even if immigration controls do not normally take place, or are merely a formality when you arrive in your home country, it may still be difficult to get through customs controls.
Make sure you know what you are allowed and what you are not allowed to bring and declare everything that is above the legal limits.
The easiest way to get started with professional travel writing is to hone your skills on an established travel blog website.
Once you have become familiar with formatting and editing online, you can eventually create your own website.
Volunteering during travel is a great way to make a difference, but it's not just about giving.
Living and volunteering in a foreign country is a great way to get to know another culture, meet new people, learn something about yourself, get a sense of perspective and even gain new skills.
It can also be a good way to stretch a budget to allow for a longer stay in a given place, as too many volunteer jobs get board and lodging and for some also a small salary.
The Vikings used the Russian waterways to get to the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. Parts of these routes can still be used. Check if special permissions are needed, which can be difficult to obtain.
The link between the White Sea and the Baltic Channel connects the Arctic Sea to the Baltic Sea via Lake Onega, Lake Ladoga and Saint Petersburg, mostly via rivers and lakes.
Lake Onega is also connected to Volga, so you can still get through Russia from the Caspian Sea.
You can confidently trust that once you are in the marina everything will be fairly obvious. You will meet other boat-blaffers who will share their knowledge with you.
Basically, you need to put up listings in which you offer your help, walk around the harbor, go up to people who clean their yachts, try to make contact with seafarers at the bar, etc.
Try talking to as many people as possible. After a while everyone will know you and give you tips about which boat is looking for someone.
You should choose your Frequent Flyer airline in an alliance with care.
Although you may think it makes the most sense to become a member of the airline you use the most, you should be aware that member benefits and points systems often vary and may be more advantageous for another airline in the same alliance.
Airlines such as Emirates, Etihad Airways, Qatar Airways & Turkish Airlines have expanded their services to Africa to a large extent and they offer connections to many major African cities at more competitive prices than other European airlines.
As of 2014, Turkish Airlines flies to 39 destinations in 30 African countries.
If you have more time available, you can see how your total fare to Africa is compared to a ticket for world travel.
Do not forget to add the extra costs of additional visas, departure fees, land transport, etc. to all areas outside Africa.
If you only want to fly around the world in the Southern Hemisphere, the selection of aircraft is limited due to few transocean routes.
No association of airlines covers all three ocean crossings in the Southern Hemisphere (and SkyTeam does not cover any of them).
However, the Star Alliance covers everything except the eastern Pacific Ocean from Santiago de Chile to Tahiti, which is a route operated by LATAM Oneworld.
This flight is not the only option if you want to skip the South Pacific and South America's west coast. (see below)
In 1994, the ethnic Armenian region of Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan declared war on the Azerbaijani.
With Armenian support, a new republic was established, yet no nation - not even Armenia - officially recognises it.
Diplomatic disagreements around the region continue to exacerbate relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
The Channel District (in Flemish: "Grachtengordel") is the well-known 17th-century district which is located around Binnenstad in Amsterdam.
The entire district is designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its unique cultural and historical value, and its property values are among the highest in the country.
Cinque Terre, which means five countries, consists of the five small coastal villages of Riomaggiore, Manarola, Corniglia, Vernazza and Monterosso, located in the Italian region of Liguria.
They're on the UNESCO World Heritage List.
Throughout the centuries, people have carefully built terraces on the rugged, steep landscape right up to the cliffs overlooking the sea.
Part of the charm is the lack of visible development. Paths, trains and boats connect the villages, and cars cannot get to the cities from outside.
The way French is spoken in Belgium and Switzerland is slightly different from that in France, but they are the same enough to be mutually comprehensible.
In particular, the system of figures in French-speaking Belgium and Switzerland has some slight peculiarities, which are different from the French spoken in France, and the pronunciation of some words is slightly different.
Nevertheless, every French-speaking belger and Swiss would have learned standard French at school so that they could understand you, even if you used the ordinary French numeral system.
In large parts of the world it is to wave a friendly gesture that means "hello."
However, in Malaysia, at least among the Malaysian population in rural areas, it means "come here", just as the index finger bent against the body, which is a gesture used in certain Western countries, and the gesture should only be used for that purpose.
Similarly, a British tourist in Spain might misunderstand a parting tip with the palm of his hand aimed at the person who is waving (instead of the person to whom he is waving) as a sign that they must come back.
Auxiliary languages are artificial or constructed languages created with the aim of facilitating communication between individuals who would otherwise have difficulty communicating.
They are different from lingua francas, which are natural or organic languages, which for one reason or another become dominant as a means of communication between people who speak other languages.
In the warmest time of the day, travelers can experience fatamorgana, forming an illusion of water (or other things).
These can be dangerous if the traveler pursues the illusion and waste precious energy and his remaining water.
Even the warmest deserts can get extremely cold at night. There is a real risk of hypothermia without warm clothes.
Especially in the summer, if you decide to wander through the rainforest, watch out for mosquitoes.
Even if you drive through the subtropical rainforest, it is enough that your doors are open for a few seconds while you get in the car so that mosquitoes can get in the car with you.
Birds flu, more formally known as avian influenza, can infect both birds and mammals.
Fewer than a thousand cases have ever been reported in humans, but some of them have been fatal.
Most people who work with poultry have been affected, but there is also a certain risk of birdwatchers.
The steep fjords and valleys that suddenly give way too high and, more or less, plain plateaus are typical in Norway.
These plateaus are often referred to as "range", meaning a wide, open, wood-free place, a boundless extension.
In Rogaland and Agder they are usually called "hei", meaning a woodless heathland that is often covered with heather.
The glaciers are not stable, but float down the mountain. This causes cracks and cracks, which may be well hidden by snow bridges.
The walls and roofs in the ice cave can collapse, and cracks can close.
At glacier edges, large blocks tear loose, fall down, and may jump or roll further away from the edge.
The tourist season for the mountain towns is generally the largest during the Indian summer.
However, they have a different kind of beauty and charm in winter, where many mountain towns get lots of snow and offer activities such as skiing and snowboarding.
Few airlines still offer family prices, which give small discounts on last-minute journeys in the event of death.
Airlines offering these include Air Canada, Delta Air Lines, Lufthansa for flights from the United States or Canada, as well as WestJet.
In any case, you need to book directly from the airline by telephone.
