This not only confirms that there were at least some dinosaurs who had feathers, a theory that is already widespread, it also provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as the color and the three-dimensional arrangement.
. Scientists say that this animal's plumage was chestnut brown at the top with a bright or carrot-colored underside.
The find also provides insight into the development of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, called a feathershaft, but have other characteristics from feathers - rays and bees - scientists inferred that feathershaft was probably a later evolutionary development than these other characteristics.
Removed structure suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or for decoration. The researchers believed that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows an adult plumage and not a chicken's down.
The researchers believe that the sample from the tail of the young dinosaur shows an adult individual's plumage and not a chicken's down.
A car bomb detonated at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty other people.
The governor's office said that nineteen of the wounded were police officers.
Police said they suspect an assumed supporter of Daesh (ISIS) for being responsible for the attack.
They found out that the sun works on the same basic principles as other stars: The activity of all the stars in the system proved to be driven by their brightness, their rotation and nothing else.
The brightness and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to the plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of magnetic terms.

The work performed was mostly theoretical, but the program was designed to simulate observations of the SagDEG galaxy.
The effect that the team was looking for would be a result of tidal-like forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a move on the earth and causes tides, so the Milky Way exerts a force on the galaxy SagDEG .
The researchers could conclude that the dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter does.
This theory says that most dark matter around a galaxy is found around the galaxy in a kind of ring and consists of lots of small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered the extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
He said in an interview that the new variant was "very troubling and that there was cause for alarm due to its very high mortality."
Some patients may have had the virus in the hospital, Dr. Moll believes, and at least two were hospital health care workers.

Infrared images show that the temperature fluctuations from night and day show that they are probably caves.
During the day they are cooler than the surrounding surface, and at night they are warmer.
"Glen Cushing from United States Geological Surveys (USGS) Astrogeology Team and Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff, Arizona said: "Your thermal behaviour indicates that they are fairly deep holes in the ground, even though they do not behave as stable as large holes on Earth that often keep a fairly constant temperature 24 hours a day."
In Frankring, voting has traditionally taken place low-tech: Voters isolate themselves in a box and put a preprinted piece of paper, which indicates their choice of candidate, into an envelope.
Once officials have verified the identity of the voter, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting list.
The procedure is codified very precisely in French electoral law.
Since 1988 polls have been transparent so that voters and observers can see that the urns do not contain ballot papers at the beginning of the vote and that no ballots other than those correctly counted and coming from approved voters are added.
Candidates can send representatives as witnesses to all parts of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strong supervision and according to specific procedures.

Besides Wednesday's event, Carpanedo competed in two individual races at the championship.
Her first was slalom, where she did not complete her first race. 36 of the 116 contestants got the same result during the race.
In her second race, which was big slalom, she finished in tenth place in the women's sitting group with a total term of 4:41.30. 2:11.60 minutes slower than the woman in first place, Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary, which finished in ninth place.
Four skiers in the women's group for seated practitioners did not complete the race, and 45 out of a total of 117 skiers in the big slalom did not rank in the race.
The police in Madhya Pradesh found the stolen laptop and cell phone.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman, and we have found her cell phone and laptop".
The names of the defendants are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki told that the defendants met in court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people in the house when the car hit it, none of them got hurt.
However, the driver suffered severe head injury.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while the rescue services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged in Edinburgh Sheriff Court with murdering his son.
She is in custody waiting to be indicted and brought to justice, but evidence from eyewitnesses may be flawed because her image has been widely disclosed.
This is common practice elsewhere in Britain, but Scottish courts operate differently, and courts have considered the publication of images as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee comments that "it certainly seems that journalists should be careful if they publish images of suspects and the like."
The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for prosecution, has indicated to journalists that no further comments will be made, at least until the indictment is available.
According to the leak, the document will refer to the border conflict that Palestine wants based on the borders of the pre-six-day War of 1967.
Other topics covered reportedly include the future condition of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries, as well as the problems surrounding the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a constant military presence in the valley for ten years when an agreement has been signed, while the Palistinian authorities only agree to leave the valley for five years.
Shooters in the additional pest control study were to be closely followed by the park rangers as the study was monitored and its efficacy was evaluated.
In a partnership between the NPWS and Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the acting director of nature conservation and cultural heritage in NPWS, the four shooters chosen for the first shooting operation received extensive safety and training instructions.
A new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members was sworn in yesterday by Martelly.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the resignation of the former CEP was recommended by a presidential commission as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
Martelly's response to the extensive anti-regime protests, which began in October, was the commission.
They sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of them had not been held since 2011.
In about 60 reported cases, defective iPods have been overheated, causing a total of six fires and giving four people less burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economic Affairs, Trade and Industry (METI) reported that they had been aware of 27 accidents involving the units.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of a further 34 cases of overheating, which the company called "non-serious."
The Ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "extremely regrettable."
The earthquake hit Mariana at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT Friday).
The North Marianan Emergency Office announced that no injuries had been reported in the nation.
Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Philippine policeman has taken tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the Philippines capital.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six have been confirmed as dead so far.
Six hostages including children and the elderly were released early and likewise the Philippine photographers.
The photographers later took an older lady's place when she had to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was shot down.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and started a career in medicine.
He took an education as an obstetrician and began working in 1959 at Aucklands National Women's Hospital.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching early births in his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone was given, it would accelerate the development of the baby’s lungs in the embryonic stage.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night with two moons. Pretty unique, like herself. Strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as wild as me... maybe even more... love her and will miss her... hopefully she's a better place now."
Out of 1,400 people questioned prior to the 2010 federal election, the number of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Constituent Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 campaign for the federal election that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those in the study share this view, and want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
In the vote's various extremes, 29 percent of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was to swim in the style 100 m and 200 m free and in three batons at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints there has been doubt about his condition.
He could not take the medication needed to fight his pain as these are forbidden during the Games.
Curtis Cooper, mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered on 25 January the largest known prime number to date.
Several people confirmed this discovery in early February using different hardware and software, and Tuesday it was announced.
Kometer may have been a source of water on the ground along with organic material that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are shaped, and especially how Earth was shaped since comets collided with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, became governor earlier this year and signed last month a bill that legalized marriage for same-sex individuals.
He referred to the rumours as "political nonsense and foolishness".
One wonders if he is running for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system which, according to the FAA, allows aircraft to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel per year and reduce CO2 emissions.
It uses satellite technology, unlike older technology based on ground radars, to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No extra transport is put in and the trains above ground will not stop in Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride options will not be available on the ground.
Fear of lack of transport raised the possibility that one would be forced to play the fight behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published on Thursday in Science magazine reported on the formation of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galápagos.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new species was developed in just two generations, although it had been thought that this process should have taken much longer due to mating between the endemic Darwin-fink geospiza fortis and the invasive cactus finke geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into all kinds of shapes. It can be rolled into very small shapes.
It can be pulled out to a thin cable, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into plates.
It can be made very thin and put on other metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted images in books called "lit manuscripts".
This is called the pH value of a chemical. You can make an indicator by using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes colour depending on how acidic or alkaline (alkaline), the chemical is.
The pH is expressed at the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the tested chemical.
Brintions are protons which have had their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Shake the two dry powders together, then squeeze them together into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which will feel strange and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet connected to a sophisticated sewer system in almost every house,
Remains of sewerage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women stayed together in mixed company.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in the room receives the call and reflects it down again almost immediately.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
Putting a satellite or a telescope into space requires a giant rocket that is over 100 feet tall.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest thing that the wheel has done for us is that it has given us much easier and faster transport methods.
It has given us the train, the car and many other means of transport.
Under them there are several medium-sized cats who eat medium-sized prey, reaching from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including loose domestic cats) who eat the much more numerous small prey animals such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is a concept of the niche, a special task each cat has that keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cat animals and live in large groups called flocks.
The flocks consist of one to three related adult males as well as up to thirty females and young.
Females are usually closely related to each other and are a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion flocks react much like wolves or dogs in flocks, animals which are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other large cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
The tiger is a good athlete who can climb (though not well), swim, jump far and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger’s roar is not like the loud roar of a lion, but sounds more like a phrase of snarling, shouted words.
Ozelottes prefer small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds, if they have the opportunity. Almost all the animals hunted by Ozelotte are much smaller than it itself.
Scientists believe that ozelots follow and find animals to eat (exchange) via odors, by sniffing where they have been on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and they also move very quietly around. Ozelots hunt their prey by walking in one with their surroundings and then throw themselves over their prey.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) are separated from the main population from which they came (as if they move over a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily move back), they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population needs to have different functions or adaptations in order to be a stronger competitor than it had previously been necessary.
The indigenous population has not changed at all; it still needs the same adaptations as before.
Over time, while the new population is beginning to adapt to their new environment, they are beginning to resemble the rest of the population less and less.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process the formation of species, which simply means the formation of new species. Species are an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants make oxygen that humans inhale, and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e. exhale).
Plants make their food from the sun by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses of plants and make clothes of plants. Most food we eat are plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
Mosaicasaurus was the top of the food chain in its time, so it feared nothing apart from other mosaics.
Its long jaws had more than 70 razor-sharp teeth and an additional set at the top of its mouth, meaning there was no escape route for anything that crossed its path.
We do not know for sure, but it may have had a divided tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked everything that came into the water. Even a giant dinosaur like a T. Rex could do nothing against it.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans ate some strange or unusual things, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called a sleeper.
Another difference was that while the poor and the women ate their food while sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to have large feasts together, where they lay on the side while they were eating.
Old Roman meals could not have contained food that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built each of their gods a primary temple, which was considered the home of the god.
People made sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctuary, into which only the priests could enter.
Sometimes pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurates, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
The Hebrew family lived most of its life outdoors.
Women made the food in the yard; the shops were just open discs facing the street. Stone was used to build houses.
There were no large forests in Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was settled with few people. In the Nordic sagas it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west he found Greenland and called it Greenland.
But whatever his discovery, there already lived inuit tribes in the area at the time.
Although each country was "scandinavian", there were many differences between the people, kings, customs and history in Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have seen the National Treasure film, you may think that a treasure map is drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
That is not true, however. Even though something was written on the back of the document, it is not a tax card.
Written on the back of the U.S. Declaration of Independence, the words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated to July 4, 1776". The text appears at the bottom of the document when it is upside down.
Although no one knows with guarantee who wrote it, it is known that early in its lifetime the large parchment document (it measures 293⁄4 inch x 241⁄2 inch) rolled up for storage.
So it is likely that the note was simply attached as an addition.
The D-day landings and the following battles had liberated northern France, but the southern part was still not free.
It was ruled by the French Vichy government - there are French people who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with them instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, Allied troops invaded southern France; the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the free French forces had freed southern France and were focusing on Germany.
A civilization is a single culture divided by a larger, significant group of people living together and cooperating, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, and is related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city state; and it also defines somehow the size of society.
Urban states are the forerunners of nations. A culture of civilization involves passing knowledge across generations, long-lasting cultural influences, and fair communication.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence, and are not recognized as real civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government — with Congress as the only component — under the Confederate Articles.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and because there was no national executive or judiciary, they were dependent on the state authorities that were often not cooperative in enforcing all actions.
Nor did it have any right to override tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles required unanimous acceptance from all the states before they could be changed, and the states took so lightly the central government that their representatives were often absent.
Italy's national football team, along with Germany's national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and became the 2006 FIFA World Champion.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller skating hockey and F1 motor sports.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often described, from a geographical point of view, as an "island group"
Taiwan's history begins all the way back in the 15th century when European seamen passing the island named it Ilha Formosa or the beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East Indian Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan that started a change in the original grain production practices, and employed Chinese workers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644–1912) troops take control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas and declare in 1885 Taiwan as a province of the Qing–Impery.
In 1895 after a defeat in the 1st Chinese-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government signed the Peace of the Shimonoseki Treaty, with which it relinquished sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, ruling over the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple with the three windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and excavations continue to this day.
For example, the most common photograph format in the world for still images is 35 mm, which was the most widely used film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited by sensor formats in digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually, which may seem confusing, 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format is therefore 3:2 (divided by twelve to achieve the most simple integer ratio).
Many common formats (e.g. APS formats) are equal to or close to this image format.
The highly abused and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism and at the same time keeps a certain order in an image.
It says that the most effective place for the main motif is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in the history of Europe, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and influential, was looked at.
For over a thousand years the Christian religion tied European countries together despite various languages and customs.
Its all-encompassing power affected all from king to ordinary citizens.
One of the most important Christian dogmas is that prosperity should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's financial resources are specifically used for this purpose.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money caused many to question whether this dogma was properly lived up to.
Shortly after hostilities broke out, Britain launched a blockade at sea against Germany.
The strategy proved effective and prevented important military and civilian supplies from reaching its destination; this blockade was contrary to the recognised international laws codified in several international agreements over the last two centuries.
Britain laid mines in international waters to prevent ships from entering entire sections of the sea, which was a danger even to neutral ships.
Since there was limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to the country's unlimited submarine war.
During the 1920s, most citizens and nations' attitudes leaned towards pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work at Edison Company, New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents on him, a poetry collection and a written recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his boss from his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, different time periods were shown in a unique way; every Chinese time period or family in power was a separate dynasty.
In addition, between each dynasty there was an unstable period of divided provinces. The most well known of these periods was the epoch of three kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years between Han and Jin dynasty.
During these periods there was fierce war between many noblemen who fought for the throne.
The period of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient China's history. Thousands of people died in the struggle to sit in the highest seat in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are a lot of social and political effects, such as the use of the meter system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people, and not one ruler.
Even after the revolution, the professions were open to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to fare well.
The same applies to the military, for instead of class-based ranking in the army, the ranking was now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people from other countries to start in their own internal revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in relationships beyond secular life. He used to visit a cave that became known as "Hira" on the mountain "Noor" (light) to immerse himself in his thoughts.
The cave itself, which has survived through time, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find at all, even if you know it exists. Once you're inside the cave, it's a total isolation.
Only the clear beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains can be seen. Very little of the outside world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders still standing today.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E. and is one of many large pyramid structures built in honor of the dead pharaohs.
The Giza plateau, or "Giza necropolis" in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, contains several pyramids (of which the world-famous Great Pyramid is the largest of them all), several small tombs, several temples and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created to honor the pharaoh of Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The "up-bow" mark looks like a V and the "down-bow mark" looks like a staple, or a square missing its lower side.
Up means you have to start at the tip and push the bow, and down means you have to start at the frog (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
Stroke usually produces a softer sound, while the stroke sounds stronger and more powerful.
You can always insert your own markings, but remember that the inscribed arch markings are determined for musical reasons, so they should usually be respected.
The terrified King Ludvig 16th, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11 years old Marie Therese and four years old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister, Mrs Elizabeth, were forced back to Paris from Versailles on 6 October 1789 by a bunch of market women.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a screaming group of people who shouted threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the windows in their carriage completely open.
At one point, a member of the Mafia showed the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles to the frightened queen.
The war expenses of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Philippine people themselves.
The Philippines had to pay tax to the U.S. colonial power to raise money for the bulk of the expenses, and bond rates ran through the banks on Wall Street in the name of the government.
Of course, the superprophets of the long-running exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the basic gains of American imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, you need to understand the context in which the order was established.
The time period during which these events took place is commonly known as the High Middle Ages, the part of Europe's history that took place in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages preceded the early Middle Ages, which was followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ends around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is an expression which includes a wide range of ideas in practice from technology as a driving force or technological necessity, to a narrow idea that man's destiny is driven by an underlying logic that is related to scientific laws, as well as the way they translate into technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a route largely outside of cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, has an "impact" on societies that are hereditary and not socially conditioned.
For example, it can be said that the motor car necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically profitable for just a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
When many own cars, there are also several accidents on the roads, leading to inventions of new health techniques to heal body damage.
The romance contained a major element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In connection with Romanticism it was geography that shaped the individual, and over time customs and cultures arose which were related to geography, and these were in harmony with the location of society and were therefore better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
In the same way that Paris today is known as the modern capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the modern capital of feudal Europe.
It is known to be an epicenter for luxury since about 400 AD and lasted until about 1,100 AD.
Its status declined in the twelfth century, mainly because crusaders had returned with gifts like silk and spices that had a greater value than what the Byzantine markets could offer.
It was at that time that the title of fashion capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style was most prevalent in the period between the 10th–11th century and the 14th century.
At first, clothing was greatly inspired by the Byzantine culture in the East.
However, as a result of the slow communication channels, Western styles could fall behind by 25-30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of the time as a result of the Crusades was that people began using buttons to put clothes on.
Subsistence farming is agriculture that is exported to produce sufficient food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence farming is a simple and often organic system that uses stored seeds native to the ecoregion, in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques, to maximize yields.
Historically, most farmers have been engaged in subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring like-minded individuals together who feel overlooked by societal standards, and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be characteristic due to age, ethnic background, social class, location, and/or gender of members.
The qualities that regulate a subculture as being distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of several factors.
Individuals belonging to a subculture often signal their affiliation through a clear and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, manners and slang.
One of the most common ways of illustrating the importance of socialization is to draw on the few unhappy cases in which children, through failure, accident or deliberate neglect, have not been socialised by adults in their childhood.
Such children are called "wild" or wild. Some wild children have been detained by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, this child failure was caused by parents' rejection of a child's serious intellectual or physical impairments.
Wild children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others are claimed to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in nature on their own.
When raised by non-human animals, the wild child exhibits behavior (within physical boundaries) that is almost similar to the animal that has shown care for the child, such as its fear or lack of interest in humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but a support for people who need to learn new things - e.g. using a new computer program or starting a project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and genuine, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is the small paper clip-man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is internalized in the software, and aims to question, ask for and explain procedures that may have been too challenging for the student to handle alone.
Children come into foster families for a variety of reasons ranging from neglect to abuse and even blackmail.
No child should grow up in an environment without sustenance, care and education, but they do.
We see the care family system as a safety zone for these children.
Our care family system must provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable healthcare.
The task of a nursing family is to make available all the necessities that were not found in the home from which they were removed.
The Internet combines mass communication and inter-human communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of use and satisfaction approach.
For example, it is suggested that "learning" and "socialization" are important motives for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal participation" and "persistent relationships" were also identified as new motivational factors by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they examined the audience's reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in understanding microexpressions, which are facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can identify whether a person is lying by interpreting micro-expression correctly.
In his article The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks indicated how people who are unable to understand speech due to a brain injury are nevertheless able to assess sincerity with great accuracy.
He even believes that such abilities of interpretation of human behavior can also be found in pets such as dogs.
Research from the twentieth century has shown that there are two different pools of genetic variation: the invisible and the visible.
New genetic variation is added via mutation, and it is removed from the pool of exact variations via selection."
Separation and recombination mix the variation back and forth between the two pools with each generation.
Out on the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like man's to satisfy his need for amino acids from available plant sources.
In addition, there are serious consequences of non-compliance: reduced growth, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant resources would have been the proteins that exist in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us, these are difficult to digest unless they are prepared.
Conversely, animal feed (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easy to digest; it also provides large amounts of protein, which contains all the essential amino acids.
All in all, it should not surprise us if our own ancestors solved their 'protein problem' in about the same way as chimpanzees on the savanna do today.
Sleep disorder is the process of consciously waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep a short time later (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without awakening you completely.
If you experience that you turn off the clock while sleeping, you can place it at the other end of the room, forcing you to stand up to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking plenty of fluid (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) prior to sleep, forcing one to get up and let the water.
The amount of inner tranquility a person possesses is quite opposite to the amount of tension a person possesses in body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force is. All people have the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
The only thing that stands in the way of achieving this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on Buddha's teachings, but was extended by the love path mahayana and with a lot of techniques from Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy is revived (information energy) through yoga positions, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the divinity yoga ("Deity Yoga"). Through the visualization of various divinities, the energy channels are cleaned, the chakras are activated, and the awareness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. When the war ended, the difference in the system, process and culture of the countries led to countries opposing each other.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies now became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years and would be fought in earnest by deputy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already broken and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when over 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army took over and established the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading Poland's eastern regions in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Polish-Soviet Non-Assault Pact, as well as other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for freight transport is the most effective way to transport large quantities of both people and goods across the seas.
The Navy's task has traditionally been to ensure that your country continues to have the opportunity to move your people and your goods, while also affecting your enemy's ability to move its people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. Americans tried to carry soldiers and materials across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, which mainly used submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain like the rest of Europe.
As far as we know, goats were tamed for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros mountains of Iran.
Old cultures and tribes began to hold them so that they could have easy access to milk, fur, meat and skins.
House goats were generally kept in flocks that wandered on hills or other pastures, often supervised by goatsherds who were often children or teenagers, corresponding to the more widely known shepherds, and these shepherding methods are still being used today.
As early as the 16th century, carriageways were built in England.
Although the lanes were merely made up of parallel wooden planks, they meant that horses could pull heavier loads faster than on the slightly more uneven roads of the time.
Sveller was invented quite early, to keep the tracks in place. However, eventually it was realized that tracks would be more effective if they had an iron piece on top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first rails were used that were made entirely of metal.
The first known transport method was to walk, humans began to walk upright two million years ago with the advent of Homo Erectus (meaning erect man).
Their predecessors Australopithecus did not usually walk upright.
There are two-legged specialisations in Australopithecus fossils that are 4.2-3.9 million years old, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs already seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can become part of the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is in many cases like treating symptoms. However, if we do not just want a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problems and disable them.
It is obvious that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological progress of mankind, and problems have increased due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of man.
After the Congress passed it on July 4, a handwritten draft was signed by President of Congress John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomsen was then sent to John Dunlap's printery a few blocks away.
Through the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
First public reading of the document was done by John Nixon on 8 July in Independence Hall's courtyard.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6, and on July 9, he had it read to his soldiers in New York City.
The 25 Dunlap sheets that still exist are the oldest surviving version of the document. The original handwritten version no longer exists.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and still live. We call them birds.
Most people don't see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
There are many things about birds that resemble dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, laying eggs, and walking on the hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers that are being used today are based on manipulation of information, which is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one in two values, e.g. 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits, to now use computer language.
Internal poisoning may not be visible immediately. Symptoms of vomiting are far too general to be diagnosed immediately.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open medicine container or toxic household chemicals.
Refer to the label for specific instructions on first aid for the specific poison.
The term bug is used by entomologists as a formal description of this group of insects.
This term derives from ancient knowledge of bedbugs, which are insects that largely live as parasites on humans.
Both looters and bedbugs are nidikoless, meaning they are adapted to live in their host house or nest.
Across the United States there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the largest neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease affecting the central nervous system consisting of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women have twice the risk of getting MS than men.
A couple may decide that it is not best for them or their child that they have a baby.
It is possible for these couples to make an adoption plan for their baby.
By adoption, biological parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can take over them.
The main aim of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method. This method is actually used in most scientific studies.
However, it is not alone, experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to remove one or more possible hypotheses. Asking questions and making observations also leads to scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek disappeared, the West felt cut off from its Greek roots in philosophy and science.
Many of the observations made in physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and natural biological production.
Periodic rhythms, which are not reactions to external periodic signals, have been documented for most living beings as both bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-driving oscillators who will continue a period of free-running cycles, even without external signals.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading suggestions that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments in which they marked either the DNA in the bay with radioactive phosphorus or the protein in the bay with radioactive sulphur.
Mutations may have a variety of effects depending on the mutation type, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are gemline cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of enjoying the landscape as well as plant and animal life.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird observation and visits to parks as well as studies of information about the ecosystem.
An example is to visit, photograph and learn about orangutans in Borneo.
Where morning people leave small villages by car to go to their workplace, and pass by others whose workplaces are the place they have just left.
On this dynamic transport ferry, all are connected with, and support, a transport system based on private cars.
The decarbonised economy has loosened the biosphere from the stable phase that has supported human development over a few million years, science now believes.
Everyone is part of society and uses transport systems. Almost all complaints about transport systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear as many complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why do transport systems give rise to such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis?
Traffic flow is a study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interaction with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flows because the behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with a hundred percent safety.
Fortunately, drivers typically behave fairly consistently; thus, traffic is also typically fairly consistent and can be calculated mathematically.
In order to better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) current, (2) density and (3) speed.
These conditions help to plan, design and operate road systems.
Insects were the first animals to fly to the weather. Their ability to fly helped them to more easily dodge enemies and find food and partners more effectively.
Most insects can fold their wings along the body.
This gives them a larger selection of small places where they can hide from predators.
Today, the dragonfly and the dayfly are the only insects that can't fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system was moving around the Sun.
There were divided opinions on his theory—some believed that he was right, while many believed the opposite: that the solar system, including the sun (and even the other stars), revolved around the earth.
That makes sense, because we don't feel the world spinning, do we?
The Amazon River is the largest and second largest river on earth, with more than 8 times as much water as the second largest river on earth.
The Amazon River is also the world's widest river, and is in some places up to six miles (about 9.6 km) wide.
As much as 20 percent of the water flowing through the planet’s rivers and into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River collects water from thousands of smaller rivers, but the main river itself is 6,387 km (3.980 miles) long.
Although pyramid building with stone continued until the end of the old kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their constructions' size and technical expertise.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed at the monuments of their ancestors, which were then well over a thousand years old.
The Vatican State population is about 800; it is the smallest independent country in the world, and the country with the lowest population.
Vatican State uses Italian in its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language spoken by most of those working in the state, while Latin is often used for religious ceremonies.
All residents of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known about the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper since ancient times, because they are found in nature in their natural form and are relatively easy to dig for if you have the right tools.
The philosopher Aristotle had the theory that everything consists of a mixture of one or more four elements, namely soil, water, air and fire.
This was more like the four modes of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he had also had a theory that they change into new substances, to form what we see.
Alloys are basic mixtures of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are many substances in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter consists of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into the sentence ending this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was a good friend to most when it appeared.
Unfortunately, the pencil has lost status and is being used less since new writing methods have appeared.
People now write messages through computer monitors and never have to get near a pencil sharpener.
You can only guess what will become of the keyboard when something new comes up.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to put together a core with many protons and neutrons.
Kind of like pushing a heavy wagon up a hill. When the core splits again, some of the energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to collapse under little or no influence.
The surface of the moon is made of stone and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the front and 100 km thick on the back.
It is thinner under the maria and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more lunar gardens on the front as the crust here is thinner. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are centered on finding out what makes people react or what appeals to them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they become more mature and reach adulthood.
The theories examine what it is about certain people that causes them to perform certain actions and what elements in their surroundings cause them to perform or not to perform certain actions.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's theory of the need pyramid, and Hertzberg's two factor theory.
Generally speaking, two types of behaviour can occur when a manager begins to lead his former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is to try to remain "one of the guys" (or the girls).
This type of leader has difficulty in making unpopular decisions, carrying out disciplinary actions, performance evaluations, assigning responsibilities and holding people accountable.
At the opposite end of the spectrum one turns into an unrecognizable individual who feels that he or she must change everything the team has accomplished and make it his or her own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's successes and failures.
This behavior often results in problems between the leaders and the rest of the team.
There are the same expectations of expertise for virtual teams as conventional teams, but there are small differences.
Virtual team members often act as contact points for their immediate physical group.
They often have greater autonomy than conventional team members, as their team can meet in different time zones, which their local management may not understand.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique part of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why should an organisation want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organisation? One of the objectives of translating organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
Creativity and ingenuity begin to appear when all available resources are effectively used across an organisation's functional departments.
As a result, the process in an organisation that works together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that meets the customer's needs.
Before an organisation can be innovative, managers must create a culture that promotes innovation as well as knowledge sharing and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method that can help organisations reach a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence of a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. Therefore, it narrows the field of research and makes it much more precise.
The link between the pathology of the brain and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and examine brain structures and processes that we have never seen before.
This gives us plenty of information and materials to build simulation models with which to help us understand our mental processes.
Although artificial intelligence is often associated with science fiction, it forms a very important branch of computer science that deals with behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in AI includes being able to manufacture machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include checking, planning and schedules, the ability to answer customer diagnostics and questions, as well as handwritten recognition, voice and face recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to real life problems.
The AI system is now often used in economic, medical, engineering and military business areas, since it has been built into several home computers and software applications for computer games.
Excursions are a large part of any class. Quite often a teacher would love to take his students to places where it is not possible to travel by bus.
The technology offers solutions with virtual excursions. Students can look at museum items, visit aquariums or admire beautiful works of art while sitting in the classroom.
Sharing a tour virtual is also a good method of evaluating an excursion and sharing experiences with future classes.
For example, students from Bennet School in North Carolina each year design a website about their journey to the state capital, and each year the website is remodeled, but old versions are still available online as a kind of scrapbook.
Blogge can also help improve students' writing skills. Although students often begin their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally corrects this.
As students are often the most critical audience, the blog's author begins to strive to improve in writing to avoid criticism.
Additionally, "blogging forces students to learn more about the world around them." The demand to give the audience what they want inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning far beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "can help students to become more analytical and critical; by providing active response to Internet materials, students can define their roles in relation to what others have written and describe their own perspectives on specific topics (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital and has a number of art galleries and museums that exhibit Canada's past and present.
Farther south is Niagara Falls, and the northern part is home to Muskoka and other areas' untapped natural beauty.
All these things as well as several highlight Ontario as what is considered genuine Canadian by outsiders.
Farther north there are large areas that are quite sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that surprises many: There are more African-Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is clearly the largest and is a continent for itself when it comes to wild animals.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or are associated with France and known for their luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the country, and religion was rapidly spread in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism started in the 15th century with the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama's discovery of the Cape route between Europe and India.
In the north, the region borders the Sahel, and in the south and west to the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: it is recommended that all female travellers say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is sensible to wear what may look like a wedding ring (it should just not look too expensive.
Women should realize that cultural differences can result in what they would regard as harassment, and it is not abnormal to be persecuted, seized by the arm, etc.
Be determined when you reject men, and don't be afraid to say no (cultural differences or not, it's not okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berbian fishermen in the 10th century B.C. and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Mernids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to leave it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and it was named Casablanca by Spanish merchants as established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop throughout Morocco.
Around the old Medina it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods such as tagins, ceramics, leather goods, waterpipes and a variety of nips, but it is very touristic.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of Congo and is located all the way east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city streets in particular in the city centre.
Despite the fact that Goma is reasonably safe, all visits outside Goma should be investigated, in order to understand the fighting taking place in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for the climb of the Nyiragongo volcano as well as one of the cheapest places to track mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use a boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for the short trip.
Along with the city's relative inaccessibility, it has made "Timbuktu" a metaphor for exotic, distant regions.
Today Timbuktu is a poor city, though its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added the list of endangered world heritage sites due to the threat from the desert sand.
It was one of the major stops during Henry Louis Gates' special Wonders of the African World for PBS.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities because it has a more Arabic flair than an African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east and Zimbabwe to the north, while the southern border is Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all South African national parks, there are daily conservation and access fees to the park.
It can also be advantageous to buy a Wild Card, as this provides either access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all the South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory of Hong Kong its name, and is the place that many tourists consider the primary focus area.
Hong Kong's skyline is a group of buildings that, by their reflection in the water of Victoria Harbour, are often compared to a glittering column chart,
To get the best prospects over Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the Kowloon port front on the opposite side.
The majority of Hong Kong's urban development is closely packed together on land acquired along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonists made their own, so if you're looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, extending 80 km from the coast into Bangladesh and India's hinterland.
Sundarbans has been added to the UNESCO World Heritage List. The part of the forest that is within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not just mangrove swamps — they include some of the last remaining stands of the mighty forests that once covered the gangtic plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, about a third of which is covered by water/mose areas.
Sundarbans has been a game reserve since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal king's and about 30,000 chital deer in the area.
Buses run from the interregional bus station (beyond the river) all day, though most, especially those going east to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since buses in the district are often full, it is a good idea to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small, Japanese buses, which are both comfortable and robust.
Deletaxa is a fast and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Now) and Punakha (200 Now).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable bridge. It extends across the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 metres high, the bridge is 378 metres long and has two lanes that are 3.50 m wide.
The vertical ground clearance below the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011. It first opened for traffic in March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational by September 2017 when the Brazilian customs control posts are expected to be completed.
The Guaranís were the most significant group of natives who lived in the area which is now eastern Paraguay, and they lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also cultivated agriculture to survive.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurús and Payaguás, which survived by hunting, collecting and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called "the great province of India", came into the world in the 16th century as a result of the meeting between Spanish conquerors and indigenous populations.
The Spaniards started the colonization period that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain a lot of its original character and identity.
Argentina is known to have one of the world's best polo teams as well as some of the world's best players.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the Polobans in Las Cañitas.
Also smaller tournaments and matches can be seen here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments as well as where to buy tickets, you can check with Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of Falkland Islands is the Falklands Punde (FKP), the value of which is set at the value of a British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
UK pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and in Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the outlying islands, credit cards are unlikely to be used, although British and American currencies may be useful; ask the owners in advance to know which method of payment is accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland's currency outside the islands, so make sure to exchange your money before leaving the islands.
As Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropes; in the summer months it is normal to have temperatures above 30°C.
Winter can be misleadingly cool: temperatures rarely below freezing point, but the wind and humidity combined make it feel colder than what is written on the thermometer.
There is no particularly "rainful" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, you have to be at least 100 yards/metres away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/metres from all other wild animals!
No matter how docile they look, bisons, moose, bears, and virtually all large animals can attack well.
Every year a lot of visitors are injured because they do not keep proper distance. These animals are large, wild and can be dangerous, so give them space.
In addition, you should be aware that smell attracts bears and other wild animals, so avoid bringing or cooking food that smells and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is Samoa’s capital. It is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been Samoa's official capital since 1959.
The port formed a framework for a notorious naval confrontation in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk except for a British cruise ship. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence, which was organized by the Mau movement, there was a peaceful gathering in the city that resulted in the killing of top chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches because Auckland is close to two ports. The most popular are located in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in North Harbour district) are located in the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches with safe swimming, and most get natural shade from pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are found at Waitemata port in the exclusive suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops along the sea. It is safe to swim here.
The most widely used local beer is "Number One", which is not a complicated beer but is pleasant and refreshing. The second local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to drink, but the New Zealand and Australian wines may be better to transport.
It is certainly to drink the local water from the tap, but it is easy to find bottled water if you are worried.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is alien. A "short black" called "espresso", cappuccino has plenty of cream on top (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but in return excellent.
Many visit the reef all year round, and people rarely get hurt on the reef for these reasons.
Always listen to advice from the authorities, read and observe signs, and pay great attention to security warnings.
Sea wasps occur near beaches and near estuaries from October to April north of 1770. They can occasionally also be found outside these times.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live their active lives in the sea, their primary habitat is in estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Preservation gives the traveller peace of mind that they have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have offers for specific hotels, although it may be possible for you to book other types of accommodation through a travel agent, such as campsites.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transport arrangements to/from the airport or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also keep the reservation for you if you need time to consider the offer or provide other documents for your destination (e.g. a visa).
However, changes or requests should be addressed to the tour operator first and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the majority of participants choose to camp on-site music festivals, and many participants view it as a crucial part of the experience.
If you want to be where it's going, you need to get in early to get a tent site close to the music.
Remember that even though the music on the big scenes is over, there may still be parts of the festival that play music until late in the evening.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
Check where your cabin is if you cross the Baltic Sea in winter, as sailing through ice can make a lot of noise for those closest to.
Passengers on cruise ships are exempt from visa requirements (see terms), which is nice to know as cruises to Saint Petersburg give passengers time to see the city.
Casinos do everything they can to make guests spend as much time and as much money as possible. Windows and watches are usually not present and it can be difficult to find an exit.
They usually have special offers for food, drink, and entertainment to keep the guests in a good mood and keep them in the house.
In some places alcoholic drinks are offered at the house's expense. However, drunkenness weakens judgment, and all genuine gamblers know how important it is to be sober.
Anyone who has to drive at high latitudes or above mountain passes should take into account the possibility of snow, ice and minus.
On ice and snail roads there is low friction, and you can't drive as you would normally, on dry asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow may fall in a very short time to get you stuck.
Visibility may also be limited by snow falling or blowing, or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snail conditions are common in many countries, and traffic is mostly undisturbed all year round.
Safaris are the highlight for many and are perhaps what draws most tourists to Africa.
The term safari is often used to refer to country trips to see the beautiful African wildlife, especially on the savanna.
Some animals such as elephants and giraffes tend to approach cars, so standard equipment is enough to see the animals.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy, and you can better see them with a binoculars.
A hiking safari (also called a "bush walk", "go-safari" or "safari on foot") consists of hiking that takes either a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held elsewhere in Japan.
Tokyo becomes the only Asian city to have hosted the two Summer Olympics, as it also hosted the 1964 Games.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the eviction was announced, you may have problems.
Cancellation policies vary, but from late March most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend until July 2020 when the Olympics were planned.
It is expected that most tickets for the event will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, where typical tickets cost about ¥7,000.
Ironing of damp clothes can help to dry it. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board that you can borrow even if there is not one in the room.
If you do not have the option to use an iron, or if you do not like wearing socks that are ironed, try using a hairdryer if available.
Be careful not to let the substance get too hot (which may cause shrinkage or in extreme cases burn marks).
There are different ways to clean water where some are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas it is enough to boil water for one minute, in others it is necessary for several minutes.
Filters vary in efficiency, and if you are concerned you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests they do not know from home.
Pests can destroy food, cause irritations or in worse cases cause allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit diseases.
Infectious diseases in themselves, or dangerous animals that can hurt or kill humans, are usually not perceived as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the possibility to buy goods in specific places that are exempt from taxes and taxes.
Travellers travelling to countries with a high tax rate can sometimes save substantial amounts, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont offers the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, which often goes through isolated terrain in the hinterland.
Be wary if you are not used to driving on the road: steep hills, narrow lanes and sharp turns there are plenty of.
The speed limits laid down are remarkably lower than those on lines before and after — typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) — and it is even more important than usual to observe them accurately.
Strangely enough, the coverage of mobile phones is much stronger here than along many other sections of the route such as Pennsylvania Wilds.
German cakes are quite good, and in Bavaria they are very tasteful and varied, as in Germany's southern neighbour, Austria.
Baking with fruit is common: apples are baked in cakes year round, and cherries and plums make their appearance during the summer.
Very German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. Popular cakes and a strong cup of coffee often go hand in hand
If you want some small but full cakes, try what depends on region called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices along with either meat or vegetables.
A curry is either "dry" or "wet" depending on how much fluid is in it.
In the inner regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curry dishes. In southern India and some other coastal regions on the subcontinent, it is common to use coconut milk.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an overall designation covering a wide range of regional food cultures that exist throughout the country.
But if the term is used without further deepening, it typically refers to the food originally derived from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now, the Javanian cuisine is widely available throughout the archipelago; it consists of a number of single seasoned dishes, where the most popular spices are peanuts, chilies, sugars (especially Javan coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
Stairs are support for the rider's feet, which hang down on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but can cause security problems due to the possibility that a rider's feet get stuck in them.
If a rider falls off the horse, but has a foot trapped in the stirrup, he or she can be dragged along if the horse runs away. To minimise this risk, some precautions can be taken.
First, many riders use riding boots with a heel and a soft, narrow sole.
Then some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety braces, which release the stirrup straps from the saddle if they are pulled backwards by a falling rider.
The Cochamó Valley - Chile's largest climbing destination, known as South America's Yosemite, has a number of large granite walls and rocks.
Mountaintops present breathtaking views from the peaks for all visitors. Mountain climbers from all over the world continuously establish new routes among its endless potentials for new climbing walls.
Alpin winter sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports activities involving driving down snowy terrains with skis or a snowboard strapped on your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts - sometimes known as "ship bums" that plan the entire holiday around skiing in a particular area.
People have been skiing for thousands of years - cave paintings dating back to 5,000 BC show people skiing!
Alpin skiing as a sport dates back to the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking on ski: This activity is also called for backcountry skiing, skiing or skiing.
It is related to, but usually does not involve skiing in alpine style or mountaineering. The latter is performed in steep terrain and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
I want you to see the ski route as if it were a similar hiking route.
Under good conditions, you will be able to cover more distances than if you walk – but it is only very rare that you get the same speed as on cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack and on prepared tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries.
In this context, however, the Schengen area functions more or less as one country.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can usually cross borders without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you should not apply for a separate visa for each Schengen country, which saves time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what manufactured goods are considered as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations where the age limit may be lower in, for example, North America than in Europe.
Handmade products can be categorized as antiques, even though they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer husbandry is an important livelihood for the Sami, and the culture around it is also important for many Sami with other professions.
Even traditionally, however, not all Sami kept reindeer on a large scale, but they lived by fishing, hunting and the like and used the reindeer mainly as migratory animals.
Today many Sami work in modern subjects. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the territory of the Sami.
Although the word 'gips' is often used especially among non-Romans, it is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Roma population.
If travel instructions occur in the country you visit, your travel insurance or cancellation insurance may be affected.
It may also be that you want to get advice from governments other than your own, but their advice will be designed for their own citizens.
One example is that US citizens in the Middle East may face a different situation than Europeans or Arabs.
The advice is only a brief overview of the political state of a country.
The views expressed are often with a corrigendum on the matter, general and simplified in comparison with the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Extreme weather conditions are the general term for all dangerous weather phenomena that can cause damage or serious community disturbance or cost human lives.
Extreme weather conditions can occur throughout the world and there are different types which may depend on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, extreme rainfall and forest fires are forms of, and effects of, hard weather like thunderstorms, tornadoes, cloud pumps and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include snowstorms, drifting, ice strokes and dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of any risk of severe weather conditions that may affect their area, as this could affect travel plans, if any.
Anyone planning to visit a country that can be considered a war zone should undergo professional training.
A search on the Internet for "Course in hostile environment" is likely to provide the address of a local company.
A course will usually cover all the topics discussed here with much more detail, usually with practical experience.
A course will usually last from 2-5 days and will involve role-playing games, a lot of first aid, and sometimes there will be gun training.
Books and magazines about survival in the wilderness are common, but there are not many releases dealing with war zones.
Travellers planning gender-change operations abroad must ensure that valid documents are carried for the return journey.
The willingness of governments to cooperate varies when it comes to issuing undeclared gender (X) passports or documents that are updated to give a person a desired name and gender.
The willingness of foreign governments to respect these documents varies equally.
Safety check visits have also become more urgent in the period since 11 September 2001.
Transgender passengers who have not received operations should not expect to get through the scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
The current from waves returning and breaking on the beach, often at a reef or equivalent, is called a countercurrent.
Due to the topology under water, the return course is concentrated in a few deeper sections, and a rapid flow to deep water can be formed.
Most deaths occur as a result of fatigue by trying to swim back towards the current, which may be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the stream, it's no harder than normal to swim back.
Try to aim somewhere where you don't get caught again, or, depending on your skills and whether you've been discovered, you might be able to wait for you to be rescued.
Homecoming shock comes faster than culture shock (there is not to the same degree a period of enthusiasm about the new), lasts longer and can be more serious.
Travellers who had easy to adapt to the new culture sometimes find it very difficult to adapt to their own culture.
When you return home, after living abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some of your habits from your home culture.
When you went abroad for the first time, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that a traveler in a completely new country needs to adapt.
People do not necessarily expect patience and understanding when returning home.
The Pyramid's sound and light show is one of the most interesting activities in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark, and you can see them in silence before the show begins.
Usually you always hear the sound of tourists and sellers. The story of the sound and the light is like a history book.
The sphinx is set as a background and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are shown on the pyramids, and the various pyramids light up.
The South Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819 and which many nations have claimed, have the most bases, sixteen of which are active in 2020.
The archipelago lies 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception, where an active volcano's flooded caldera provides a spectacular natural port area.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here the peninsula's mountains meet on the high plain and form the Ellsworth Mountains' 360 km long chain, which is divided into two of the Minnesota glacier.
The northern part of the Sentinel Range holds Antarctica's highest mountains, Vinson Massif (also called Mount Vinson), peaking at 4,892 m.
In remote areas without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone can be your only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a substitute for a mobile phone, as you need to be outside and have a clear view of the satellite to make a phone call.
This service is often used by shipping, including pleasure craft, as well as expeditions that need remote data and speech.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information about connecting to this service.
An opportunity that is becoming increasingly popular for those planning a sabbatical year is to travel and learn.
This is especially popular among those who leave school as it allows them to take a year out before the university without compromising their education.
In many cases, a course abroad during your sabbatical year can actually improve your chances of getting a place on a higher education in your home country.
There will typically be a tuition fee, to enroll in these training programs.
Finland is a great destination for sailors. "The land of the thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands in the lakes as well as in the islands along the coast.
In the islands and lakes, you don't necessarily need a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelago and the largest lakes are large enough for any yacht, you get another experience in a smaller boat or even a kayak.
Sailing is a national hobby in Finland where there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is somewhat similar to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise it is quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the figure is one to forty).
On most Baltic cruises is offered an extended stay in St Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a few whole days when you go back and sleep on the ship at night.
If you only land with the ship's excursions, you don't need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruises have Berlin, Germany in the brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not at all close to the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
It can be a frightening experience to travel by plane for people of all ages and from any background, especially if they have not flown before, or if they have experienced a traumatic event.
It is nothing to be ashamed of: it is no different from the fear and hatred of other things that many people suffer from.
For some, understanding how an aircraft works and what happens in flight can help to overcome a fear that is based on the unknown or not having control.
Delivery companies are well paid to deliver quickly. Often time is very important when it comes to business documents, goods or spare parts for urgent repair.
On some routes the larger companies have their own aircraft, but on other routes and in smaller companies there was a problem.
If they sent things via air cargo, it may have taken days on some routes to get through unloading and customs clearance.
The only way to get it through faster was by sending it as checked baggage. Airlines regulations do not allow them to send luggage without a passenger. That's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to put a big pile of money over the opportunity (or even better, get your business to do it for you).
However, this is not cheap: as a rough rule of thumb you can expect to pay up to four times the economy class's normal price for business class and eleven times the price for first class!
Generally speaking, there is no need at all to look for discounts on seats in business or first class on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know well that certain core groups of passengers are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of coming forward quickly and comfortably, and they set their prices thereafter.
Moldova's capital is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also spoken on a wide scale.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the establishment of the self-appointed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognised by any UN member state.
Economic relations have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova, despite the breakdown in political negotiations.
The largest religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is Turkey's third largest city with a population of about 3.7 million, the country's second largest port after Istanbul, and a very large transport hub.
What was once the old town of Smyrna is now a modern, developed and busy trading town located around a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, glass façade buildings and modern shopping centres are surrounded by traditional red brick roofs, the old 18th-century market and old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere that is more Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík overlooks the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery there are interesting marble sculptures of pigeons over some gravestones.
It is worth spending half an hour walking around the exciting village.
To the north and within reach lies the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which was made famous among foreigners after a praising account of its magnificentness by Lord Byron.
Scotturb Bus 403 regularly drives to Sintra and stops at Cabo da Roca.
On the north you can also visit the great shrine Our Lady of Fatima (alter) which is the site of world-famous Marian spirits.
Remember, you're actually visiting a mass grave site, a place that's of vital importance to a large part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived their time here, and many more who had loved ones murdered or worked to death there, both Jews and Gentiles.
Please treat the place with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves. Do not tell jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not shame the site with markings or by sketching graphiteti on the structures.
Barcelona’s official language is Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it, and almost everyone can speak Spanish.
However, most signs are only indicated in Catalan because by law it has been established as the official language.
Yet Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities.
General messages in the metro are only given in Catalan, but unforeseen changes are communicated via an automatic system in several different languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians possess a reputation of being self-absorbed, rude, and arrogant.
Although this is often only an imprecise stereotype, the best way to get along with people in Paris is still to behave as nicely as possible, to behave like a bee élevé (student) which will make it considerably easier to get around.
The cool exterior of Paris evaporates quickly if you show basic courtesy.
The Plitvices Islands National Park is filled with forest areas - mainly beech and conifers - and offers a mixture of both Alpine plants and Mediterranean plants.
It has a remarkably wide variety of plant communities due to its many microclimates, different soil types and varying altitude levels.
The area is also home to an extremely large variety of animals and bird species.
Here, along with many more common species, rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat and tjur are found.
During visits to the monasteries, women are required to wear skirts covering the knees, while also having their shoulders covered.
Most of the monasteries have scarves for women who appear unprepared, but if you bring your own and especially some with strong colors, you get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear trousers covering their knees.
This can be borrowed from the warehouse at the entrance, but the clothes aren’t washed after each use, so maybe you’re not entirely comfortable wearing these skirts. One size fits all men!
The Malorcinian cuisine, like other similar Mediterranean areas, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and the use of a great deal of olive oil.
A simple, popular dinner, especially in summer, is Pa amb Oli: Bread with olive oil, tomato and any kind of accessible accessories such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, including the word Sie for you, always begin with great, also in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and lenses
It no doubt also makes reading easier, although writing complicates some of the need to find out whether a verb or adjective is used in a substantive form.
The pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to keep an eye on are c and g, as their pronunciation varies depending on the posterior vocals.
Also make sure to pronunciation r and r different: caro means loved ones, while carro means cart.
Persian has a relatively easy and mostly common grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar basic book will help you learn much about Persian grammar and better understand phrases.
Just so you know, if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people who can a little Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese is enough like it to avoid having to study it separately.
Premodern observatories are usually obsolete today and remain as museums or educational sites.
As light pollution in their heyday was not such a problem as it is today, they are usually found in cities or on campuses where they are easier to reach than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities in remote areas with good atmospheric conditions.
Looking at flowering cherry trees, known as Hanami, has been a tradition in Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where flowers from plum trees were the chosen flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom celebrations were held by the emperor for only himself and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
Plants look best when they are in a natural environment, therefore you must resist the temptation to "just take one sample".
If you visit a publicly available garden, you will be evicted without discussion if you collect "samples".
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to visit and very easy to navigate around, and you can buy almost anything after you have arrived.
But when you are in the "high tropics", only a few degrees north of the equator, you need to handle both heat (all the time) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, which is more rare).
There are also a few buses heading north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the Biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Make sure to check if the bus you're considering is going into Hebron, and not only to the nearby Jewish settlement Kiryat Arba.
The inland waterways can be a good theme to base a holiday around.
For example, to visit castles in the Loire Valley or the Rhine Valley, to take a cruise to interesting cities on the Danube or to sail along the Erie Canal.
They also define routes for popular walking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of Christianity's most important holidays and is celebrated as Jesus' birthday.
Non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians from all over the world have embraced many of the traditions of holidays.
There is a tradition of staying awake on Easter night to see the sunrise in a exposed place.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be a spring and fertility ritual from before Christianity.
The more traditional churches often hold Eastervigilie Saturday night in the Easter weekend, where the congregations often break out at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All animals that originally arrived in the islands came here either by swimming, flying, or floating.
Because of the long distance from the continent, mammals could not cope with the journey, making the giant turtle the primary grass eating animal on Galapagos.
Since the first humans came to Galapagos, many mammals have been imported such as goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit Arctic or Antarctic areas in the winter, you will experience the Arctic Night, which means that the sun does not come up above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see polar lights as the sky will be dark more or less around the clock.
Since there are not many people living in the areas, and therefore light pollution is often no problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are used to.
Suits are standard business clothing, and colleagues address each other by their surname or job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is important and thus places emphasis on group action rather than praise of individual performance.
Workers often need their superiors to approve all decisions they make, and they are expected to obey their superior's instructions without asking questions.
