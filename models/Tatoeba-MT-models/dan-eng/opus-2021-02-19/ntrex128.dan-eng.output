Politicians in Wales afraid to "like fools"
There was dismay among certain members of the Welsh National Assembly about a proposal that their title should be changed to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
It has arisen as a result of plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
AMs from all over the political spectrum are concerned that the change of name could give rise to ridicule.
A Labour member said that his group was concerned because 'it rhymes with Twp and Pwp'.
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means silly, and pwp means shit.
A member of the party Plaid Cymru said that the group as a whole was "unsatisfied" and had proposed alternatives.
A Welsh conservative said his group was "open" to the change of name, but noted that there is only a short verbal leap from MWP to Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced in the same way as the letter u is pronounced in Yorkshire-English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently putting together a bill introducing the name changes, said: "The final decision on names that Members of Parliament will have is, of course, up to Members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh National Assembly the power to change its name.
In June the Commission published the results of a public consultation of the proposals, with broad support for calling the Assembly a Welsh Parliament (Welsh Parliament).
With regard to the title of the AMs, the Welsh Parliament Commission preferred Members or WMPs, but the MWP option received the greatest support in a public consultation.
Ams seem to suggest alternative options, but the struggle to reach agreement may prove difficult for the President of the Assembly, Elin Jones, who is expected to put together a bill on the changes within a few weeks.
The draft law on reforms includes other changes in the way the assembly works, including rules on the disqualification of AMs and the composition of the committee system.
The AMs get the final vote on what to call them when the bill is debated.
Macedonians are voting to change the name of the country
The voters will vote on Sunday on whether their country's name should be changed to 'North Macedonia Republic'.
The vote is being held in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour constitutes a claim on Greece's territory and has long protested against Macedonia's attempts to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
The Macedonian President, Gjorge Ivanov, is opposed to the vote and says that he will overrule the vote.
Supporters of the vote, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is just a price paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The bells in St. Martin's get quiet while the churches in Harlem fight
"The older people I spoke to said that in the old days there was a bar and a church on every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today there's neither."
He said it's understandable that the bars are disappearing.
"People are socializing in other ways these days," he said.
"Bars no longer constitute the living rooms of the neighborhood where people enter on a daily basis."
In relation to churches, he is concerned that the money obtained from selling assets does not last long and that they are "before or later back where they started".
He adds that churches could be replaced by apartment complexes that are full of the kind of people who don't help the neighborhood's recurring areas.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy condos in these buildings are white," he says, "and it breathes further to the development, where these churches eventually close completely because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into the condos will become members of the churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation, which had operated nearby, took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation under priest John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of shops on 125th Street, one of the main shopping streets in Harlem, who would not hire or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when Father Johnson’s parishioners planned to restore the building, they ordered the glockenspiel.
Pastor David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor in St. Martin's, proudly called the bells of the poor.
The expert who played the bell in June called it something else: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first glockenspiel in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the major glockenspiel in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin's didn't find a replacement for him.
What has taken place in St. Martin's over the past few months has been a complicated story about architects and contractors. Some of them caught up with church leaders, others of the diocese.
The church council – the parish’s leading body, which consists of leading laymen – wrote in July to the diocese about concerns that the diocese “would try to push the expenses forward” to the church council, even though the council had not been involved in hiring the architects and contractors that the diocese sent in.
Some members of the congregation complained about a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injuries 13-year-old diving for lobsters in California
A shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday when he dived for lobsters in California on the first day of the lobster season, officials say.
The attack happened just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had dived with friends for about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy scream for help and then along with a group paddled over to him to help him out of the water.
Hammel says that he thought it was just enthusiasm for having caught a lobster, but then he realized that the boy shouted, "I was bitten!
I was bitten!"
"His whole collarbone was ripped open," said Hammel, who saw when he came to the boy.
"I cried out that everyone should come out of the water: 'There is a shark in the water!'" Hammel added.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is reported in critical condition.
It's unknown what kind of shark attacked.
Lifeguard Larry Giles said at a media briefing that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was not considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to his upper torso.
Officials closed access to the beach on the route from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for safety reasons and for conducting investigations.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's planning to take the beauty market in Britain
Sainsbury's takes up the competition with Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams with rows of beauty products with special assistants in the style of department stores.
As part of a major effort to take in Britain's beauty market, which has a value of GBP 2.8 billion and continues to grow while fashion and home products are falling. The larger rows of beauty products are tested in 11 shops around the country and launched in several stores next year if they prove successful.
The investment in beauty products takes place as supermarkets look for new items for shelves that were previously used for televisions, microwaves and home products.
Sainsbury's says they double their selection of beauty products to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw that are introduced for the first time.
The existing range from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also offers more space with branded areas similar to those seen in shops like Boots.
The Supermarket also relaunches the range of Boutique makeup, so the majority of products are suitable for vegans – something that is increasingly required by younger shoppers.
In addition, the perfume shop Fragrance Shop tests stalls in two Sainsbury's shops. The first opened in Croydon in the south of London last week, and the second opens in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and a development towards the purchase of small amounts of food daily at local merchants means that supermarkets need to do more to get people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, director of Sainsbury's, has said that the shops will look like department stores as the supermarket chain takes up the fight with the discount chains Aldi and Lidl by introducing more services and goods that are not food.
Sainsbury's has introduced Argos sales outlets in hundreds of shops and has also introduced a number of Habitat sales outlets since they bought both chains two years ago. These measures have strengthened their sales of groceries and have made purchases more profitable.
The Supermarket's earlier attempts to update beauty and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint approach with Boots in the early 00's, but the cooperation ended with an argument about how the profits from the pharmacies in the supermarkets should be distributed.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold their pharmacy chain of 281 shops to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, GBP 125 three years ago.
According to the strategy, Lloyds will play a role in the plan by adding an additional range of luxury skin care brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We have changed the appearance and decor of our rows of beauty products to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to give advice.
Our range of brands is designed to suit all needs and the attractive environment and the practical placements mean that we are now a convincing destination that challenges the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones "Raging", after Holly Willoughby withdraws from agreement to GBP 11 million
Dragons' Den-star Peter Jones left "Railing" after TV host Holly Willoughby withdraws from deal to GBP 11 million with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home product and accessories brand Truly.
The company had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
This Morning host, 37, went on Instagram to announce she's leaving the project.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons' Den star Peter Jones furious after she withdraws from their lucrative lifestyle brand at the last minute – to focus on her own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones was "rare" when the popular TV woman during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, said that her new deals – worth up to GBP 1.5 million – meant that she no longer had enough time for their home product and accessories brand Truly.
The company had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was tipped to double Willoughby's estimated GBP 11 million fortune.
Willoughby, 37, went on Instagram to announce that she left Truly while Jones flew out of Britain to one of her vacation homes.
A source said, "Truly was one of Holly's top priorities.
It should have been a long-term project that she should be dealing with over the next few decades.
Her decision to resign surprised everyone involved.
No one would believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods at headquarters in Marlow, which is already ready for sale."
Experts estimate that the announcement from This Morning host, which is among the UK's top-earning stars, can cost the company millions due to large investments in products – everything from pillows to candles to clothing and home products – and the potential for further delays in launching.
And it can also be the end of a long friendship.
Mother of three Willoughby and husband Dan Baldwin have had a close relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined the board of directors in March.
The two couples go on vacation together, and Jones owns 40% of the shares in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will be a fire ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We couldn't comment on his business action."
Tough talk, "and then we fell in love."
He made fun of the criticism he would get from the news media to make a comment that "is not worthy of a president" and to be so positive towards the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in his impression of a newsman.
"I gave up nothing."
He noted that Kim is interested in another meeting after Trump proclaimed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards nuclear disarmament by North Korea.
But negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho on Saturday told the world leaders at the UN General Assembly that North Korea does not see a "corresponding reaction" from the United States in relation to North Korea's initial anti-armament measures.
He noted that instead the United States continues with sanctions aimed at keeping the pressure running.
Trump took a more optimistic view in the speech at his electorate meeting.
"It's going really well with North Korea," he said.
"There was a war going on with North Korea.
Millions of people could have been killed.
Now we have an amazing relationship."
He said that his attempts to improve his relationship with Kim had produced positive results – completion of rocket tests, help with the release of hostages and the repatriation of remains from American military personnel.
And he defended his unusual approach to Kim.
"It's so easy to behave stately, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we'd have about 200 people standing there," Trump said, pointing to the group right in front of him.
Indonesian tsunami and earthquakes ravage island and kill hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, non-governmental organisations were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombo's population were without homes, no national disaster was declared, which is a prerequisite for the call for international relief.
"Unfortunately, in many cases it has been clear that they are not asking for international assistance, so it is a bit challenging," said Sumbung.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain whether foreign employees can work in the field.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster response, said that Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu to see if international organisations would be allowed to contribute to the relief efforts.
Because of the earthquakes that Indonesia is constantly experiencing, it is very badly prepared for natural disasters.
Tsunami resorts have been built in Aceh, but they are not a common view of other coastlines.
A warning had been issued in Palu, but apparently there is a missing Tsunamisirene, and this has probably affected the death toll.
Even under the best conditions it is challenging to travel between Indonesia's many islands.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that has been in Lombok to deal with earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new accident site.
President Joko Widodo made Indonesia's inadequate infrastructure a central point in his campaign, and he has spent a lot of money on roads and rail routes.
However, Mr Joko's administration has been plagued by a lack of funding in the run-up to next year's election campaign.
Mr Joko is also experiencing pressure from underlying sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands removed from their homes when Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets with machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge balances last minute against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat in the Premier League to Chelsea with a score in the 89th minute Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 meters from Chelsea's target, while his team was behind by 1-0.
He poked the ball with his left foot before he made a high shot to the farthest posts.
The ball flew high over the field towards the top right corner of the net.
The ball dropped over a bouncing kepa arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"It was just about getting in that position, getting the ball. Players like Shaq always try to get as far forward as possible, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible," said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, and I made a single touch, and I didn't think about it much, and I just took the shot."
Chelsea led 1-0 by half, after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Chelsea attacker handed the heel back to Mateo Kovacic before speeding up the midfield and sprinting into Liverpool's court.
Kovacic made a quick one-two on the midfield.
He then made a long pass that led Hazard into the field.
Hazard ran from the defense and finished towards the farthest posts with a shot with the left foot past Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool fights against Naples in the group play in the Champions League at 3 pm on Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea plays Videoton in UEFA Europe Leaguge at 3:00 pm in London on Thursday.
Deaths from tsunami in Indonesia are rising to 832
The death toll from Indonesia’s earthquakes and tsunami has risen to 832, indicating its disaster preparedness early on Sunday.
There were reports of many trapped in the rubble of buildings that fell after the earthquake, which measured 7.5 on the Richter scale. It hit Friday and created up to 6 meters high waves, said spokesperson Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a news conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with rubble from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a man at 32 on suspicion of murder after a woman is stabbed to death.
A murder investigation has been launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old was found with stab wounds at 7:55 a.m. at Grayson Mews on John Street, a 32-year-old man arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police have called on people in the area who saw or heard something to come forward.
Sergeant Brian O'Hagan said: "We are in the early stages of the investigation, but I would urge anyone who stayed near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard anything suspicious about contacting us.
I would also urge everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something with Dashcam, to contact us as they may have information that may be crucial to the investigation."
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body was found is from the Birkenhead area and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe to know the woman have arrived on the spot to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues, and the police say they're in the process of informing the victim's relatives.
A cab driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get into his apartment but is told by the police that no one is allowed into the building.
He was stunned when he heard what had happened.
The people are now told that it will be several hours before they can enter again.
A police officer was overheard telling a man that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
A crying woman arrives.
She keeps repeating, "It's so terrible."
At 2:00 there were two police cars inside the fence and another car just outside.
A number of officers were within the perimeter and were monitoring the apartment complex.
All with information please write a message directly to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 and inform log 247 on 30 September.
Parliament's statue of Cromwell will be the latest memorial to be struck by discussion about 'rewrite of history'.
The removal would be poetic justice for his taliban-like destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts that were performed by his fanatical, puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "madness" and an "effort to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in connection with the current debate on the removal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the palace at Westminster would become an objective.
The picture storm during the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Maybe the wrong Cromwell is being sacrificed for the actions of his forefather Thomas in the last century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's fantastic depiction of Cromwell is a testimony to attitudes in the 19th century and part of the historiography of a figure that many still believe it is worth celebrating.
Mr Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against outside pressure, in his case pressure from the monarchy.
Whether it is an accurate depiction is subject to ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the mid-17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is one recognizable figure representing one side of the struggle.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of praise and remembrance."
Killer pig attacks and kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan", was found dead with a severed artery and covered in blood near a pig path on the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, reported South China Morning Post Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to inject pigs with vaccines at a pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He had allegedly travelled with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, the cousin found him dead and discovered that a door to the pig's teat next door was open.
He said there was a big boar in the pig's ass with blood in his mouth.
A forensic study confirmed that the 250 kg pig had bitten the farmer to death, according to the report.
"My cousin's leg was bloody and injured," said the cousin who goes under the surname "Wu", in a quote from Guiyang Evening News.
Recordings from security cameras showed that Yuan entered the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market leader told Evening News that the pig had been locked away to prevent it from attacking others while the police were collecting evidence at the crime scene.
It is reported that Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
It is rare, but there have been cases in the past where pigs have attacked people.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and left the man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 295-kg pig masted a Welsh farmer against his tractor, until his wife scared the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba CBC News told that pigs usually are not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a "trigger".
"They're just playful.
They're grabbing, they're very curious... they're not trying to hurt you.
You just have to treat them with respect," he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa are expected to cause heavy rain in large parts of the southwestern United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa becomes weaker as it moves across the cooler waters of Mexico’s northern coast.
However, Rosa will cause heavy flooding in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the next few days.
Rosa had a win of 38 m/s, a category 1 hurricane at 10 a.m. on Sunday (Danish time) and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a low-pressure outer is forming over the Pacific Ocean, moving east towards the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the peninsula of Baja California on Monday as a tropical storm, it begins to push tropical moisture northward into the southwestern United States.
Rosa will give up to 254 mm of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then the tropical moisture will interact with the low pressure runner, which is approaching, and create heavy rain in the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Locally, 25 to 101 mm of rain will create dangerous storm floods, liquid fallout and possibly landslides in the desert.
The tropical moisture will create rain with up to 51 to 76 mm of rain per hour locally, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 51 to 101 mm of rain is expected in parts of the southwestern United States, especially over large parts of Arizona.
Storms with rapidly deteriorating conditions are very likely due to the scattered nature of tropical rains.
It would be a very bad idea to move into the desert on foot when there is a danger of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can transform canyons into roaring rivers and thunders will create powerful local winds and create dustblown.</seg>
The approaching low pressure runner will give heavy rain along the coast in parts of Southern California.
There is a risk of total precipitation of more than 13 mm, which can cause smaller amounts of liquid fallout and smooth roads.
This would be the region’s first rainfall during their rainy season.
Spreading tropical rain showers will approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday and spread more late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the area of Four Corners on Tuesday and continue on Wednesday.
In October there may be large temperature fluctuations throughout the United States as the Arctic cools, but the tropics remain fairly warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
There is a good example of dramatic temperature differences through central America on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of almost 11 degrees between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
Over the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
Large parts of the central and eastern United States are expected to experience a warm start by October with temperatures above 26 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeastern areas.</seg>
There may be up to 26 degrees in New York City on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long climate outlook indicates that there is a high probability of temperatures above average in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million saw the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
Over 20 million saw Thursday's poignant testimony from the nominee for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that allegedly took place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television stations.
At the same time, the political struggle continued with stations that interrupted the regular programs to report on Friday's late development: an agreement composed of Senator of Arizona Jeff Flake, which allowed the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate's jury that she's 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh, in a drunken state, was grabbing her and trying to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in an emotional testimony that he's 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
According to Nielsen it is likely that 20.4 million saw it Friday.
The company counted average ratings at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were no immediately available ratings from other stations that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has problems measuring how many people see programs in offices.
To put it in perspective, it is a viewer number that corresponds to a match during the NFL playoffs or Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion-born hosts have strongly supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, was at the top of all stations with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the hearing, which lasted all day, said Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the Moderate Republican's office issued a statement that he was going to vote for Kavanaugh, he was captured for open CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning while protesters shouted at him when he tried to take an elevator for the hearing in the judicial committee.
He stood with a downward look for several minutes while he was being scolded and CNN sent live.
"I'm standing right here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
He was told, "You have so much power, and so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator closed, that he would have more to say at the hearing of the committee.
All the television stations covered live a few hours later, when the judicial committee was to vote on whether or not Kavanaugh's nomination should proceed to a vote for the entire Senate.
But Flake said that he would only vote in favour under the conviction that the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominee the following week, which the Democrats, who are outnumbered in the Senate, had demanded.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, the Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and a number of senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's election had an impact because it was clear that the Republicans would not have votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
UK Prime Minister accuses critics of "play politics" with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the EU to "play politics" with Britain's future and undermine national interests, in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK on 29 September 2018.
In another interview next to that with Theresa May on the front page of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson made his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and said that a proposal that Britain and the EU collect each other's tariffs was 'through ridiculous'.
Killing Wayde Sims: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson suspected of responsible LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at the LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and imprisoned under suspicion of manslaughter, said Baton Rouge police.
Officials released video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims lost his glasses during the game.
The police found the glasses at the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on it, reported the CBS subsidiary WABB.
After the interview with Simpson, the police said that he had confessed to the shooting on Wayde.
His bail is set at $350,000, reports the lawyer.
The coroner in East Baton Rouge Parish issued a preliminary report on Friday saying that the cause of death was a gunshot wound from a gun shot from the head to the neck.
Police Department says a Louisiana State Police task force, state police lab, Southern University police and local citizens have assisted in the investigation that led to the arrest.
The sports leader of the LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked the police in the area for their "rethought and search for justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 198 cm-high forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per match last season.
Friday morning, the basketball coach at LSU, Will Wade, said that the team was "crushed" and "in shock" over Wayde's death.
"That's the kind of thing you're always afraid of," said Wade.
Volcano spits ashes over Mexico City
Ashes, spewed from the Popocatepetl volcano, have reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico’s capital.
On Saturday, the National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after activity occurred in the crater and 183 gas and ash leaks were recorded within 24 hours.
The center watched the rumbling and shaking over several laps.
Pictures on social media showed thin layers of ash on car windows in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted increased activity in the volcano, which is 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, since an earthquake that measured 7.1 on the Richter scale shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police collide with Catalan separatists prior to the anniversary of the vote on independence
Six were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after protesters seeking independence, collided with rioters as thousands took part in rival demonstrations marking the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarising vote on secession.
A group of masked separatists held back rioters, threw in and powder paint and created dark dust clouds on streets that would normally be full of tourists.
There was also a fight later in the day when the police used their batons to keep the fighting down.
For several hours independence groups shouted "Nothing Forgotten, Nothing Forgived" and were met with unionist protesters who shouted "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries that occurred during the protests, reported the local press.
The mood remains high in the independent region one year after the vote on 1 October, which was declared illegal from Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The voters voted overwhelmingly in favour of independence, but the electorate was low and those opposed to secession boycotted the vote on a large scale.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly a thousand people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the vote during violent clashes at polling stations throughout the region.
Independence groups had camped overnight to Friday to prevent a demonstration to support the national police.
The demonstration was held but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said that he no longer dared hope that Catalonia could gain independence.
"Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy at having been given the opportunity to vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Although they gained a narrow but important victory in the regional elections in December last year, the Catalan independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum, and many of their best-known leaders have either moved themselves into exile or sit in detention awaiting judgment for their role in holding the vote and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, recorded the protests on her phone in support of the police and said that the conflict was created by politicians on both sides.
"There is growing tension," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who has been waiting for his trial since last year, reported that he was going to run for the European elections next year.
"The nomination as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to distance ourselves from the setbacks in democratic values and the oppression we have seen from the Spanish Government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested, after house hit by car
Three men 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after a car ran into a house in Londonderry several times.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19.30 BST.
Captain Bob Blemmings said there was damage to the gates and the building itself.
A crossbow may have been fired at the car at some point.
Shots from Menga give Livingston victory of 1-0 over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory.
The rioters Livingston took Rangers by surprise and gave Steven Gerrard his second defeat after 18 matches as manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga's shot made the difference when Gary Holt's team moved up side by side with Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's team has not won in the league this season and will meet the leading team Hearts, after which they are eight points, next Sunday.
Before then, the Rangers will be visited by Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, on the other hand, is expanding their undefeated line to six games, and Chief Trainer Holt has still not been defeated since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses chances against cash outhold
Holt's team should have been ahead long before they scored, and their direct playing style created big problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but turned across in front of the target, after which Alan Lithgow inevitably hit outside the target after he slipped in to hit Craig Halkett's transverse header in front of the target.
The home team was content to let the Rangers play in front of them because they knew that they could give the away team trouble in deathball situations.
And it was under those conditions that the important goal came.
The Rangers committed free kicks, and Livingston took advantage of an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson together created the presentation for Menga, who made a touch and scored from the middle of the field.
By then, Rangers had dominated the ball possession, but struggled to get through the home team's defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly challenged.
That pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman's shot was averted with the feet of the Rangers target Allan McGregor, and Lithgow shot outside the frame during another of Livingston's deadball situations.
There were continuous deliveries into Livingston's field, but were averted, and two demands for penalty kicks – after Halkett's tackle on the replacement Glenn Middleton and one by hand on the ball – were rejected.
"Fenomenal" from Livingston – Analysis
BBC Scotlands Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal effort and strong result for Livingston.
Everyone played great and exceeds the expectations of their upward journey.
Their playing style and squad are largely unchanged since their return to the best league, but much of the credit must go to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since he stepped in.
There were a lot of heroes.
Commander Halkett was great and led a well-organized defense, and Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on his toes throughout the game.
The Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
They have sometimes been really good under Gerrard, but they played below level.
Their endings lacked sharpness – only once were they exposed to the home team – and this is a sudden awakening for Rangers, located in the middle of the scoreboard.
Erdogan gets mixed reception in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies on Saturday (29 September) when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations with the two NATO members.
Disputes have arisen over areas such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's rapprochement with the European Union.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new, large mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police held a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but lots of supporters showed up nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan opponents – many of them Kurdish – also noted and condemned both Erdogan's policies and the German Government's decision to accept in the country.
The competing protests reflect a controversial guest who is seen as a hero by some German Turks and mocked as an autocrat by others.
Accident on the way in Deptford: Cyclist dies in collision with car
A cyclist died in a collision with a car in London.
The accident happened close to the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the southwestern part of town around 10.15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped, and there were paramedics on the scene, but the man died on the spot.
The accident happens a few months after another cyclist died in a collision with a car whose driver escaped from the scene, on Childers Street, about a mile from Saturday's accident.
Metropolitan Police said that policemen were working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Roadblocks have been set up, bus routes have been changed and motorists are encouraged to stay away from the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured during unrest
Six prison officers were injured in unrest in a high-security prison, according to Prison Office.
There was unrest in the prison HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9.30 BST Sunday, and the unrest is still going on.
Specialized Tornado officers have been brought in to handle the riots involving eight inmates and are taking place in one wing of the prison.
The officers were treated for minor facial injuries on site.
A spokesperson for Prison Service said: "Specially trained prison officers are deployed to deal with the ongoing riots in HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and are clarified that those responsible are reported to the police and may end up spending longer behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the warden was treated in the hospital after being attacked by an inmate.
And in October last year, riot officers were summoned to prison to deal with serious riots, where employees were attacked with billiards.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with stormy floods (dry areas can take advantage)
It is rare for a tropical low pressure to hit Arizona, but it most likely happens at the beginning of next week when the remains of Hurricane Rosa move across the desert landscape in the south-west of the United States and create the risk of storms.
The National Weather Service has already issued storm warnings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route over Phoenix Tuesday with arrival late Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix pointed out in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones had retained the status of tropical storm or low pressure within 320 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 64 km of the Arizona border."
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 51 to 102 mm rain with isolated amounts up to 152 mm in Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas in the south-western desert landscape, including the central Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, are likely to get 25 to 51 mm with the possibility of 102 mm locally.
For those without the risk of storms, Rosa's rain can be a blessing because the region is hit by drought.
Flooding is a very serious matter, but it is likely that some of the rain will be useful because the southwestern United States is currently experiencing drought.</seg>
According to the U.S. Drought Monitoring, just over 40 percent of Arizona experiences the least extreme drought, the second highest category", reports weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa is expected to hit land on the peninsula of Baja California in Mexico.</seg>
Rosa still has hurricane strength on Sunday morning with a maximum wind power of 38 m/s and is located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moving north at 19 km/h.
The storm meets cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean and therefore drops in strength.
It is therefore expected to hit Mexico with tropical power on Monday afternoons or evenings.
The rain over parts of Mexico can become heavy and cause great risk of flooding.
"A total of 76 to 152 mm is expected for precipitation from Baja California to northwestern Sonora with a possibility of up to 254 mm", reported weather.com.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the border with Arizona early in the morning Tuesday as a tropical low pressure, which will then move up through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
"The primary expected danger from Rosa or the remains of it is very heavy rain in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the southwestern desert area of the United States," reported the National Hurricane Center.
The rain is expected to create life - threatening storms and floating falls in deserts and landslides in mountain terrain.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested under suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teen boy was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton around 4 BST Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital where his condition is reported to be stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, says Avon and Somerset police.
Officers have called on anyone who may have mobile footage of the incidents to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh was under the "evil and anger" of the Democratic Party.
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and monstrous tactics of the Democratic Party," said Trump at an election meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has been subjected to the "evil, anger" of the democratic party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress on Thursday and denied strong and emotional accusations from Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on his charges.
The president said on Saturday that the "American people saw the skill, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"A vote confirming Judge Kavanaugh is a voice confirming one of the most capable legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a fantastic history of public service," he said to a group of supporters in West Virginia.
The President indirectly referred to the nomination of Kavanaugh while talking about the importance of Republicans coming to the polls at the mid-term elections.
"In five weeks, one of the most important choices in our lifetime will be.
You can't vote for me, but you actually vote for me," he said.
"That's why I travel around fighting for amazing candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats are out on a mission to "strike and block".
The first important procedural vote in the Senate on the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected to take place by Friday, a person highly placed in the Republican Party has told CNN.
Hundreds killed by Indonesian earthquakes and tsunami, death toll growing
At least 384 were killed and many of them washed away by huge waves that hit the beach when a major earthquake and a large tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, said authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people were gathered for a festival on the beach in the town of Palu on Friday, when up to 20 feet [6 m] high waves hit the coast at dusk, sucked many into death and destroyed everything in their way.
The tsunami occurred after an earthquake that measured 7.5 on the Richter scale.
"When the tsunami began yesterday, people were still doing activities on the beach. They did not run immediately and became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for Indonesia's disaster preparedness GDPB, during a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, the towed cars, logs, houses, it hit everything on land," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had moved through the open sea at 800 km/h before it hit the coast.
Several managed to survive by climbing trees to escape the tsunami, he said.
About 16,700 were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The emergency response has published aerial photographs showing many destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Afternoon continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes could be felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Board of Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) stated in a statement that the energy released during Friday's major earthquake was about 200 times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city is geographically located at the end of a long, narrow bay, and it may have made the tsunami bigger, said the board.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of a number of victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 had been injured and 29 reported missing.
Nugroho said that the death toll and the damage could be greater along the 300 km long coastline north of Palu, the area of Donggala, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter.
The communication "was completely paralyzed without information" from Donggala, said Nugroho.
"More than 300,000 live here," said the Red Cross in an announcement, adding that their employees and volunteers are heading towards the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could get much worse," they said.
The board was criticized on Saturday from many fronts for not informing us that a tsunami had struck Palu, but officials said that the waves had arrived within the time of the warning.
In amateur recordings shared on social media, you can hear a man on the top floor of a building desperately shouting warnings about the tsuami coming closer to people on the street below.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the coast and carries buildings and cars away.
Reuters could not confirm the authenticity of the recordings immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power failure that cut off the communication around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending cargo planes with relief from Jakarta and other cities, reports authorities, but food and basic necessities are still urgently needed among the evacuated.
The city airport has been reopened, but only for relief work, and remains closed in until October.
President Joko Widodo is expected to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll after Indonesian tsunami goes over 800.
It's really bad.
World Vision employees from Donggala have come safely to Palu city, where employees seek shelter under tarpaulins set up in the courtyard at their account. They came by areas with extensive destruction on the road, said Doseba.
"They told me they saw so many broken houses," he said.
It's really bad.
Even when relief organizations began the hard work of re-establishing relief work, there were complaints that foreign relief workers with extensive expertise were prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian legislation, financial support, supplies and staff from abroad can only enter if the area where the accident occurred is declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a provincial disaster," said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says 'OK, it's a national disaster', we can open up for international assistance, but there's no status yet."
On the second night in Palu after Friday's earthquakes and tsunami, friends and family of the missing people held fast in the hope that their loved ones would become the miracles that brighten the gloomy tales of natural disasters.
Saturday, a little boy was pulled up by a sewer.
On Saturday, rescue workers released a woman who had been trapped under rubble for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others who were captured at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mondayi, were among his students.
"As a veteran in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr Gendon told us how in the hours, after the news of the collapse of Roa Roa Hotel circulated in paragliding circles, he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the participants in Palu, who attended the festival on the beach.
His messages, however, resulted in only one grey checkben instead of two blue.
"I think that means the messages weren't delivered," he says.
Twenty take 26,750 USD while filling up the ATM in Newport on the Leve
Twenty stole on Friday morning 26,750 USD from a Brink's employee who was meeting an ATM in Newport on the Leve, according to a press release from the Newport police.
The driver of the car had emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and prepared to deliver more money, said Detective Dennis McCarthy in the press release.
While he was busy, another man ran up behind the Brink's employee and stole a bag money that should have been delivered.
Witnesses saw several suspects who fled the scene, according to the press release, but the police did not indicate how many were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information on the identity of the thieves, please contact the Newport police on 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes its name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing its name to Ye.
He announced the switch on Saturday on Twitter, where he wrote, "The Weapon formerly known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for a while and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change takes place prior to his appearance in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on the show, who canceled for "emotional reasons", said the creator of the show.
The name is an abbreviation of his current artist name, but West has previously said that the name has religious meaning for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," said West earlier this year, when he discussed his album title with the radio host Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to Ye – which is a reflection of our good, bad and confused sides, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are."
He's one of a number of famous rappers who's changed their name.
Sean Combs has switched between Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he reported that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
One of West's former partners, JAY-Z, has also changed between small and large letters and changed whether the hyphen is included.
Mexico's AMLO promises not to use military force against civilians
Mexico's newly elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised never to use military force against civilians as it approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliatory action against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he "would never use the military to suppress the Mexican people."
Troops fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square on 2 October 1968 and killed up to 300 at a time when left-wing student movements took root in many places in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by giving monthly state grants to students and opening several free, open universities.
He has said that unemployment and a lack of educational opportunities attract young people into criminal gangs.
The United States should double the funding of artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount they spend on research in the field, says investor and AI user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after various parts of the U.S. government have given announcements of artificial intelligence. However, the U.S. still lacks a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
However, China introduced their plan last year and aims to take first place in innovation in the field of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"It would be a good idea to double the research budget for artificial intelligence, as all other countries are so far behind the United States and we are looking for the next major breakthrough in AI," said Lee.
The doubling of the budget could double the chances that the next major achievement in the field of artificial intelligence will be achieved in the United States, Lee told the CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee published the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" this month at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt and is Managing Director of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the most prominent artificial intelligence companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that beat the top ranking American Othello player, and later became head of Microsoft Research and director of Google’s China branch.
Lee recognised former technology competitions supported by the US government, such as Robotics Challenge, which was held by Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when a new competition would be coming, so that the next visionaries could be identified.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain government scholarships, says Lee.
"It is not China that grabs the academic leaders, it is the big companies," said Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have employed star students from universities to work with artificial intelligence.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States to strengthen efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think that PhDs in the field of artificial intelligence should automatically have been offered work permits.
The Chinese Council of State issued their Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people at academic institutions in a way similar to the National Science Foundation and other state organizations' distribution of money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a joint artificial intelligence centre to involve partners from industry and research, and the White House announced the founding of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced an investment of USD 2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
NSF is currently investing more than USD 100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
However, US legislation seeking to set up a National Safety Commission for Artificial Intelligence has stood still for several months.
Macedonians are voting to change the name of the country
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday on whether their country's name should be changed to 'North Macedonia Republic', a measure that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia's attempts to gain membership of the EU and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and maintains that the name of its neighbouring country to the north constitutes a claim on Greek territory and has therefore used its veto right when Macedonia has applied for membership of NATO and the European Union.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents believe that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's mainly Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not take part in the vote, and a boycott campaign has raised doubts as to whether the voting volume will be the 50% required for the vote to be valid.
The question on the ballot was: 'Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece?'
Supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that it is a price worth paying to create access to associations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged as a result of the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote on the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means safer lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
The vote is not legally binding, but enough MEPs have said that they will keep to the result of the vote and assert it.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission said that by 1 p.m. there were no irregularities reported.
However, the turnout was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, where 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I voted today because of my children. We belong in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko took part in the vote in Macedonia on a change in its name, which would open up for membership of NATO and the EU, in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje prepared Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, a small scene and pulled up chairs in front of tents set up by those who will boycott the vote.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we will achieve membership with our heads up, not through the back door," said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of European-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership would give a much-needed investment in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
'I believe that a large majority will vote in favour because over 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO', Zaev said after voting.
He said that a "yes" result would be a "safeguard of our future".
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research indicated that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the vote – less than the required turnout.
Another poll made by the Macedonian television channel Telma TV indicated that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote 'yes'.
For the vote to be valid, the turnout must be at least 50 per cent plus one vote.
If the vote fails, it will be the first major political loss to the pro-Western government since it took place in May last year.
See: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero fights its way through the Brighton defense and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling fought the Brighton defense in Manchester City's 2-0 victory Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy with his scoring that came after 65 minutes.
The Argentine attacker received a pass on the midfield at the beginning of the sequence.
He quickly ran past three Brighton defenders before he swung out into the open.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green sweaters.
He fought his way past one defender, and then ran from several on the edge of Brighton's field.
He then made a pass to the left and found Sterling.
The English forward used his first touch in the field to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right boot to outwit Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot on the right side of the net.
"Aguero is struggling with some problems with his feet," said City-manager Pep Guardiola reporters.
"We talked about him playing about 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the immediate head start in the Premier League game.
That target came in 29 minutes.
Aguero received in the sequence the ball deep inside Brighton's territory.
He sent a nice pass along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few touches before he led Sterling towards the farthest posts.
The Sky Blues forward poked the ball in the net just before it slipped past target.
City fights Hoffenheim in the group play in the Champions League at 12.55 pm on Tuesday on Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to tease Rockies.
Nationals are eliminated from playoff participation, so they didn't have much to fight for.
But the always competitive Scherzer hopes to take the caste Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if there is still the possibility of participation in the playoffs for Rockies, which have played a game more than the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
At least the Rockies held on to a wild-card seat with a 5-2 victory over the Nationals Friday night, but still have their first division title for good.
"Even if we have nothing to play for, we can go to the fight knowing that the atmosphere would be at its highest in the audience here in Denver, and that the opponents would play at the probably highest level that I will face this year.
Why shouldn't I be excited to play under those conditions?"
Nationals have not yet announced the start option for Sunday, but will probably put Scherzer in as pitcher in such a situation.
Scherzer, who wanted to be the first man on the spot for the 34th time, trained his throws on Tuesday and would pitch on Sunday, which is usually his rest day.
The right hand player from Washington is located at 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump is having a voter meeting in West Virginia.
The President indirectly referred to the situation surrounding his election to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while talking about the importance of Republicans coming to the polls at the mid-term elections.
"All we've done is at stake in November.
Five weeks from one of the most important choices in our lifetime.
It's one of the big, big ones – you can't vote for me, but you actually vote for me. That's why I travel around and fight for fantastic candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You can see this horrible, terrible radical group of democrats, you can see it's happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by every means at their disposal. You can see how vicious, how disgusting they are.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to gain power and control. That's what they want, power and control, but we won't give it to them."
The Democrats, he said, have as a mission "strike against and block".
"And you have seen it over the past four days," he said, calling the Democrats "wrath and vicious and disgusting and lying."
He referred to the Supreme Democratic Senator of the Senate Court of Justice, Dianne Feinstein by name, which triggered the loud boom from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh, wait a minute – it was really bad body language – the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer an inclusive party.
They are intolerant of those who express their views
When Momentum's activists in my local party voted to censor me, it wasn't really a surprise.
I am just the latest in a large number of Labour MEPs who have been told that we are not welcome – just because we have given our opinion.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, received similar treatment because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censor action was to criticize me because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
Compared to the importance of a responsible economic policy, in terms of national security, in Europe, ironically, similar problems that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders in.
The call for the meeting of Nottingham East Labour on Friday stated that 'we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive'.
For most of my eight years as a local Member of Parliament, Friday evening meetings have just been like this.
Today, unfortunately, the tone of many meetings is not like that, and the promise of "friendly, gentler" politics is a long way back in the past if it ever got started.
It has become increasingly clear that divergent views are not tolerated in Labour and that all opinions are weighed according to whether the party's leadership can accept them.
It started shortly after Jeremy became the leader, when colleagues with whom I thought I shared my political position began to expect me to make a U-turn and take positions that I otherwise would never have agreed with – whether it was about national security or the EU's internal market.
When I say my opinion in the public – and it doesn’t really matter what I say – a long line of rude messages on social media is following, calling for the opt-out and contradiction of the center-seeking policy and telling me that I shouldn’t be a Labour member.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I am luckier than some of my colleagues, because the comments directed at me are usually political.
I have a deep respect for professionalism and the will to fight by those colleagues who, every day, are deluged with sexism or racism, yet continue to fight.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is how normal abuse has become.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that Labour should create a tolerant culture.
But in reality it is no longer a spacious organization and with every motion of censure or change of selection rules the party becomes narrower.
I've been getting a lot of advice over the last two years that if I put a lid on myself and I'm not so loud, I'm gonna be okay.
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I joined Labour 32 years ago, when I was in school, I was provoked by the neglect of Thatcher government, which had left our classroom in a dilapidated state, and I set out to create better public services for those who need it most – whether as a councillor or government minister.
I've never hidden my policy, even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way have been confused about my political positions and disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who tabled the motion for a resolution on Friday, I would say that when the country turns to Brexit, which will harm households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of Labour.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Undefeated Ayr becomes top team
Two late scores may have got the final result to draw a not entirely truthful picture, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved the victory in this fantastic entertaining match of the day in Tennent's Premiership.
They are now at the top of the scoreboard and are the only undefeated team of ten.
In the end, it was as much their superior defence as their better use of chance that carried the home team home, and Coach Peter Murchie had absolutely the right to be satisfied.
"Our battles have been demanding so far and we are still undefeated, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Respect for Ayr, they took better advantage of their chances than we do."
Grant Anderson's score after 14 minutes was followed by a successful kick from Frazier Climo and brought Ayr ahead, but a yellow card for Scottish national team player Rory Hughes, who was awarded to the Battle of Warriors, gave Melrose an advantage, and Jason Baggot made a score that was not followed by a kick.
Climo expanded Ayrs lead with a penalty kick just before the half. He scored and then got a solo score, so it was 17-5 for Ayr at the break.
But Melrose began well in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's score, followed by a kick from Baggot, reduced the score to five.
There was then a long interruption because Ruaridh Knott had suffered serious damage. He was carried out on stretcher. When the game resumed, Ayr expanded the head start with a score from Stafford McDowall and a follow-up kick from Climo.
Acting Ayr commander Blair Macpherson then got a yellow card, and again Melrose took advantage of their extra man with a score from Bruce Colvine without follow-up kick after a period of intense pressure.
However, the home team came again, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to tackle Climo without the ball, MacPherson was able to score behind the forward Ayr cluster after a line-out.
Climo followed up with a kick within the posts and followed up with a more nearly immediately after the game was resumed, after Kyle Rowe intercepted David Armstrong's box kick and sent wing player Gregor Henry to the home track's fifth score.
Still Game star looking for new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran seems to be taking the step to the restaurant business after it emerged that he has taken the directorship of an authorized restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, in which he writes and is the main character along with his partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the coming ninth season will be the last of the series, and Kiernan seems to be planning a life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he's the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, but a source suggested to Scottish Sun that Kiernan would be part of Glasgow's "growing market for restaurants".
"The sea is ours": The land of Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the route to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrol around Navy headquarters, wrapped in riggings, in La Paz.
A sea blue flag has been hoisted on public buildings.
Fleet bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are painted with the motto: "The sea is ours, it is a right.
It is a duty to take it back."
Throughout the landlocked state of Bolivia, the memory of a coastline lost to Chile in a bloody conflict over resources in the 19th century is still strong, as is the longing to sail on the Pacific again.
The hopes may be at their peak for decades, while Bolivia awaits a judgment of the International Court of Justice on 1 October, after five years of voting.
"Bolivia has momentum, a sense of community and clarity, and naturally waits with a positive look at the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the ruling of the International Court on large screens throughout the country and hope that the Hague Court will agree that Chile – after decades of discussion – is committed to negotiating to give Bolivia sovereignty over an area of access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who is facing a controversial election campaign next year, also has a lot at stake at the trial on Monday.
"We are close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
But analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will take Bolivia’s side – and that there would not be much change if it did.
The UN Assembly, which is based in the Netherlands, does not have the power to take over Chilean territory and has stipulated that it cannot determine the outcome of possible discussions.
That the International Court of Justice gives judgment only six months after the final arguments were heard indicates that the case was "not complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And instead of furthering Bolivia's cause, the last four years may have returned.
"The case of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian leadership," Zárate said.
She said that Morales' warlike rhetoric has ended the remaining Chilean goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will eventually continue the discussions, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making was abnormally fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end an era of 139 years of disagreements and benefit both sides", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, used the maritime problem as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up access to the Pacific," he added.
"Judgement is an opportunity to see that we have overcome the past."
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless they can rely on the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm their nuclear weapons if they cannot first trust Washington.
Ri spoke Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to keep promises made during a summit of rival leaders in Singapore.
His comments were given in response to the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo apparently facing a restart of the locked nuclear diplomacy over three months after the Singapore meeting with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says that it is a 'desires' that continued sanctions and US resistance to a declaration ending the Korean war will ever bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is reluctant to declare, as long as Pyongyang has not first taken significant steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim and American President Donald Trump want another summit.
However, there is widespread scepticism about whether Pyongyang is serious about abolishing an arsenal which the country most likely sees as the only thing that can guarantee their safety.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month in preparation for a new summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest collections with large headgear that you will soon be able to buy in local shops
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or block the sun completely, you will find the answer here.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled on the runway a collection of extraordinary extra-large-sized headwear as part of their SS19 collection. The collection was impressed by the Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats have dominated on Instagram this summer, and the two designers have sent their eye-catching creations down the runway.
The most impressive work from Valentino was a lavish with a feather-like broad shadow covering the heads of the models.
There were also other extra large accessories, including watermelons with jewels and even a pineapple – but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn-up lips that were more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation looked like diving gear with snorkel and mask, and others looked like a melted waffle ice cream.
And if you continue the big fashion statements, you'll be lucky.
The scouts predict that the huge hats could come to shops near you.
The giant hats arrive on the heels of "La Bomba", the straw hat with a 60 centimeter-wide shadow, seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult mark behind the most impractical hat that was spread across the social media has sent a new big creation down the runway – a beach bag in straw that is almost as big as the model that presents it.
The orange bass bag with bast fringes and a white leather handle was the most eye-catching in the Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags in ordinary shops next summer. The designer has had so much influence that it will be hard to ignore the demand for accessories in huge size."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools have many impressive academic achievements behind them, and this is still in 2018 with yet another outstanding exam results, which are even strengthened by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other efforts in the local environment.
With up to 30,000 students around Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to their pupils and parents.
Independent schools are trying to prepare their pupils for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their place as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can put together and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we find that modern languages remain a popular topic in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it hits his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, it'll hit the heart."
It is an important reminder that we cannot just stick to English when we want to build relationships and trust among people from other countries.
We can see from the latest exam results this year that languages are highest in the statistics with the most passed exams in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students studying foreign languages received the high grade A.
The data collected by the 74 member schools of the CIS showed that 72 percent of the students were graded A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied French, and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important competences that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now perceived as subject choices at the same level as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools' curricula and elsewhere.
A study carried out by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that among the reasons why employers could not fill vacancies, 17 % had to do with lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future careers.
More job opportunities in the future will require language skills, and these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Whatever career they choose, if they have learned another language, they have a great advantage in the future with a lifelong skill like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a multilingual person a head start to competitors.
According to a YouGov poll of over 4,000 polls in Britain in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, and French is the only language spoken by a multi-digit percentage, 15 percent.
That is why it is important to invest in language teaching for those who are children today.
When you can speak more languages, especially those from developing countries, you give children a better chance of finding meaningful work.
In Scotland, there is a difference between schools in which languages are taught.
A number of schools focus on the more classic modern languages, while others teach languages that are expected to be most important for the UK by looking towards 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child is interested in, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools with teachers who are specialists in the field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that prepares children and gives them the skills needed to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
At present, it cannot be denied that languages continue to be really important for the future of the country in a global business environment, and this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should actually be regarded as 'international communication skills'.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, this diversity and this distinction to Scotland's youth.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron makes her debut for Lakers Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans who want to watch LeBron James play his first game for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James is playing in Sunday's opening match before the start of the season against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it is not yet clear how many minutes he plays.
"It's going to be more than 1 and less than 48," said Walton on Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James probably won't play the whole game.
After the training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans in relation to Lakers' scheduled six matches before the start of the season.
"Where I am in my career, I don't need games before the season starts to get ready," he said.
Trump's election meeting in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a series of voters' meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's Trump's first out of five scheduled election meetings next week, including meetings in Trump-friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote confirming Trump's appointed judge to the vacant seat of the Supreme Court is suspended, Trump is trying to create support for the upcoming mid-term elections because Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when votes are cast in November.
When is Trump's election meeting in West Virginia tonight, and how do you see it online?
Trump's electorate meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia will be held at midnight (Danish time) the night between Saturday 29 November and Sunday 30 November 2018.
You can see Trump's election meeting in West Virginia online via livestream on YouTube.
Trump will most likely talk about this week's hearings on Brett Kavanaugh, who has been nominated for the Supreme Court. The hearings became tense due to allegations of sexual abuse, and the expected vote in the Senate for confirmation has been suspended for a week while the FBI investigates the charges.
But the primary objective of this series of electorate meetings is to create momentum for those Republicans who are facing a difficult election in November.
People from President Trump's campaign team said that the five election meetings next week aim to "create energy among volunteers and support when Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Consultation control is so important to his agenda that the President will travel to as many states as possible, as we enter the busy campaign time," said a spokesman for the Trump campaign, who would not be quoted by name, to Reuters.
Tonight's electorate meeting is held in Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling and is expected to attract Trump supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and be covered by media from Pittsburgh", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month, Trump has visited West Virginia, the state, he won by over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Republican candidate for the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is lagging behind in the polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to appear to give him a boost in the polls," said Simon Haeder, who deals with political science at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA has shown a fighting spirit and is trying to keep hope alive ahead of Sunday's single duels
After three one-sided laps, Saturday's four-man duels might have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging momentum pendulum is a completely invented sports concept, but a concept that players believe in – not least in competitions like this one.
Where would they say there's momentum now?
"They led by six points, and now it's four, so we probably see that as a little momentum," said Jordan Spieth, before he finished his shift.
Of course, Europe has the advantage: they are 4 points ahead and there are 12 more points to bet on.
As Spieth says, however, the Americans feel that they have a little wind in their sails, and there are plenty of encouraging things to focus on, not least the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both boast three points of four possible.
Spieth has been sharp from tee to green and sets a good example for his teammates.
The loud cheers grew louder as the round continued, and Spieth hit an important putt, which ensured victory in duel four, although he and Thomas had been two blows behind after two duels.
His putt, who secured them the fight at hole 15, was met with a similar scream – the kind of scream that shows that he does not believe the American team is out of competition yet.
"You just need to find out the inner strength and focus on your own fight," Spieth said.
That's all the players have left now.
18 holes where you can make a difference.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, undoubtedly the biggest story from the Ryder Cup.
Europe's strange but sympathetic couple have scored four points in four battles and appear flawless.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't get a bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogey's Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes Friday morning.
The series and the way in which energy seems to flow both to and from the wild audience show that it is they who will be the hardest to beat on Sunday. And it would undoubtedly be very popular if a potential European victory were to be settled by Fleetwood or Molinari when the sun sets on Le Golf National.
Preferably synchronised on each of their holes.
However, it is too early to talk about European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short process against Sergio Garcia, the morning completely in the four-man duels when he formed a couple with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two double bogeys on the first nine holes dug the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole they were never near getting out of.
On Sunday, no one can help you get out of your hole.
The battles with four balls and two teams of two players are so fascinating to see closely because of the interaction between the couples, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way the strategy can change quickly.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has created a significant lead before the last day, but the four-man pigeons have also shown that Team USA has the fighting spirit that some, especially in the United States, have doubted.
Europe creates lead on 10-6 ahead of last day in Ryder Cup
Europe has a great advantage before the last day at the Ryder Cup, after they came out of Saturday's fourballs and foursomes with a lead over the United States on 10-6.
The well-playing duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the way with two victories over a troubled Tiger Woods and has so far gained four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjørn's European team, trying to win the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated over an imprecise American team in this morning's fourballs and won the series 3-1.
The U.S. gave more resistance in foursomes, won four games, but was still behind.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points in Sunday's 12 single matches if they're gonna keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant who has won four points in a row, and he and Molinari who together have been nicknamed "Molliwood" are after a sensational weekend the just second pair in Ryder Cup's history who have won four points in their first four matches.
They crushed Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs and then elegantly defeated a discouraged Woods and the American debutante Bryson Dechambeau with an even more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who fought his way through the first two games on Saturday, had little brilliant glimpses, but now he has lost 19 out of his 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose was well rested for this morning's fourballs and returned to his partner Henrik Stenson in foursomes and had a 2-1 victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – number three in the world.
Europe, however, has it as it pleases, on a slightly windy day southwest of Paris.
Triple major-winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas led the way for the Americans by two points on Saturday.
They had a hard-won 2- 1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs and later returned and beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in foursomes, after losing the first two holes.
It has only happened twice in the Ryder Cup story that a team has fought their way back after being behind by four points before the single matches. However, as Furyks currently has the trophy, they only have to achieve a tie to keep it.
After being second best for two days, however, it seems that they cannot master a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea says they won't disarm unilaterally if there's no trust.
On Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister told the UN that continued sanctions reinforce their distrust of the United States and that it will not abandon their nuclear weapons unilaterally under such conditions.
Ri Yong Ho told the General Assembly of the worldwide organisation that North Korea had shown "significant goodwill" within the last year, for example by stopping nuclear and missile tests, running an area for nuclear tests and promising not to develop nuclear weapons and technology further.
"However, we have not seen a similar reaction from the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security and under such conditions there is no chance that we ourselves will take the first step and disarm unilaterally."
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's opposition to a "phased" approach to nuclear disarmament, where North Korea would be rewarded if they took gradual steps. However, his speech seemed important as it did not unequivocally reject unilateral disarmament, as it had previously been the case with Pyongyang.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit ever between a incumbent US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim promised to work "nuclear disarmament on the Korean peninsula", while Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has asked for a formal end to the Korean war, which took place in 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first abandon their nuclear weapons.
Washington has also shown resistance to softening international sanctions against North Korea.
"The US insists on 'nuclear disarmament first' and extends the pressure with sanctions to achieve their purpose by coercion and even opposes 'the declaration of the end of the war'", Ri said.
"The notion that the sanctions can bring us down is a dream among people who do not know who we are.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions reinforce our distrust."
Ri did not mention any plans for another summit between Kim and Trump, as the American leader highlighted at the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If nuclear disarmament were to be negotiated with South Korea and not the United States, the negotiations would not be so bogged down."
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that firing North Korea's rockets against the American mainland was inevitable after "Mr Evil President" Trump called Kim a "rocket man" on suicide mission.
Last year in the United Nations, Trump threatened 'total destruction' of North Korea, but this year he praised Kim for showing courage in terms of disarmament, but said that there is still much to be done and that sanctions have to remain until North Korea disarms.
Wednesday Trump said he didn't have a schedule for these actions, but said "It doesn't matter whether it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The Security Council must maintain sanctions with conviction and without error until we achieve the total, final, confirmed nuclear disarmament."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously increased economic sanctions against North Korea in an attempt to stop Pyongyang's missile and nuclear weapons programme.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines during the UN General Assembly and subsequently said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times during the year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made, while North Korea, just hours later, accused him of making "gangsy demands."
At a meeting with Moon this month North Korea promised to shut down a missile plant and a nuclear complex if the United States took "equivalent steps."
He said that Kim had told him that the "corresponding steps" he demanded were the security promises given by Trump in Singapore, as well as moves towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Students at Harvard take a course to get enough sleep
A new course at Harvard University has given all bachelor students more sleep. The purpose of the course is to counteract the growing macho culture, where you study all night kept up with large amounts of caffeine.
One researcher has shown that students at the world's best university often have no idea the first thing about taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, has completed the course which he thinks is the first of his kind in the United States.
He got the idea for the course after giving a paper on what effects sleep deprivation has on learning.
"When the presentation was finished, a girl came up to me and said, "Why am I only told this now when I'm on the candidate?"
"She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me", he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is offered for the first time this year, explains how good sleeping habits can improve your academic and sporting performance as well as your overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and managing director of the university's health area, says that the university has decided to offer the course after finding out that the students were in severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The hour-long course consists of various interactive exercises.
In one of the exercises there is a picture of a dorm room where students have to click on coffee cups, curtains, running shoes and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, and how your sporting performance is affected by lack of sleep and how important good sleeping habits are.
In another part of the course, participants hear about how long-term sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attacks, blood clots, depression and cancer.
Participants are encouraged to think about their daily habits by clicking on different icons on an interactive map of campus.
"We know that it will not change students' behaviour immediately.
But we think they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know how cigarettes affect health", adds Professor Czeisler.
The pride of taking an "all-nighter" still exists, he says, adding that modern technology and increased pressure on students have led to sleep deprivation as a growing problem.
The "secret weapon" against stress, exhaustion and anxiety is good and sufficient sleep, he said – it even counteracts weight gain, because lack of sleep makes the brain think that you are starving, why they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californiar who studied chemical and physical biology, last year helped Professor Czeisler organize the course when he took one of his courses at his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and got him to work on making it a general course throughout the university.
He hopes that the next thing will be that all graduates are offered a similar course before they continue their education.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students set an alarm so that they know when to go to bed and when to go up. This can create awareness of the harmful effects of the light from electronic screens, which can move at the circadian rhythm and make it harder to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Targets from Menga lower Gerrard and co.
The Rangers suffered yet another defeat when Dolly Menga's goal meant that Steven Gerrard's incoherent team had to take on board with a defeat of 1-0 in Livingston.
The team from Ibrox was after their first victory in the outdoors since 4-1 Triumph at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team only gave Gerrard second defeat in 18 matches as coach. Thus, there are eight points up to Hearts in first place by Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga struck seven minutes before the break, which an uninspired Rangers team could not respond to.
Rangers are now going down to a sixth place, while Livingston climbs up to a third place after Hibernian with only the score in difference.
And there could be more bad news on the way to the Rangers when line judge Calum Spence had to be treated after being hit in the head by a thrown object that seemed to come from the outfield section.
Gerrard made eight changes to the layout that reached the Betfed Cup semifinal by tonping past Ayr.
Holt, on the other hand, with the same 11, who shaved a point of Hearts' lead last week, would have rejoiced to see his sharp team exhausting the opponents all over the track.
The Rangers had the ball the most, but Livingston was more efficient.
They should've scored two minutes into the game when Menga's first pass sent Scott Pittman against Allan McGregor's target, but the midfielder's attempt passed by.
A free kick in the depths of Keaghan Jacobs found his way to Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense player Alan Lithgow kicked past the back post.
The Rangers, however, took control, but played more on hope than ability in the attack game.
At least Alfredo Morales was not satisfied when Judge Steven Thomson overruled the Colombian's appeals for punishment when he and Steven Lawless crashed together after 15 minutes of gambling.
The Rangers only managed two shots on target in the first half of the year, but former Rangers target Liam Kelly had no problems with Lassana Coulibaly's headshot and Ovie Ejaria's tame shot.
Although Livi's opening in the 34th minute was a coincidence, it must be said that they deserve their efforts alone.
Again, the Rangers couldn't handle a deadball situation in depth from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who took the time to find Menga, who could easily kick it to the finish line.
During the break, Gerrard Coulibaly replaced Ryan Kent, which almost instantly paid off when the wingman sent the ball to Morelos, but the well-playing Kelly ran from her position to block.
But Livingston forced the out team to play on their terms with many long balls up the track from Lithgow and Halkett.
Holt's crew could have expanded the lead in the final part of the fight, but McGregor rejected Jacobs with a secure hand before Lithgow headed next to targets.
The Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton appealed again for a late penalty after having dried up with Jacobs, but Judge Thomson also looked here the other way.
Yearbook: The inventor of the geiger counter
And now a page from the yearbook "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today – if we TELL... – was the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger invented a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that would eventually lead to the device known as the geiger counter.
The Geiger counter has become an integral part of both science and popular culture, as can be seen in the film "Bells of Coronado" from 1950, where Roy Rogers and Dale Evans had the leading roles as bond scientists:
Man: "What on earth is that?"
Rogers: "It's a geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms that the radioactivity in the minerals makes."
Evans: "Oh, my God, this is it!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before he would have turned 63.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells as part of treatment
The method consists of extracting immune cells from a patient and changing them in the laboratory
They can then "see" the protein that is common to many cancers and where they are injected again
A test vaccine is successful in patients with a number of cancers.
When a woman with ovarian cancer was treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells, the cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method consists of extracting immune cells from patients and changing them in the laboratory so that they can "see" the protein called HER2, which many cancers have, and then inject the cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our findings indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "makes several cancers develop", including breast, ovary, lung and intestinal cancers, explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, taking immune cells out of patients and "teaching" them to attack cancer cells, has worked in the treatment of a certain type of leukemia.
Kanye West gave Trump-friendly speech wearing a MAGA hat after his SNL performance.
It didn't go well.
After an incoherent performance in the Saturday Night Live studio, Kanye West was bowed off when he hailed the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and said he was going to run for president himself in 2020.
When he had played tonight's third song Ghost Town wearing a Make America Great Again cap, he started a dope talk against the Democrats and maintained his support for Trump.
"I talk so often to white people who say, 'Why do you like Trump, he's a racist?'
But if I were concerned about racism, I would have long since moved from the United States," he said.
SNL started tonight's show with a sketch with Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony on the Senate Justice Committee on Christine Blasey Ford's assault charges.
Even though the footage wasn't shown, the comedian Chris Rock West uploaded the tirade on the social media.
It's uncertain if Rock tried to exhibit West by putting up the footage.
West also complained to the audience about poor treatment backstage because of his head covering.
"They bullied me backstage.
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat on."
They bullied me!
And they said I had sunk deep," he said according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Would you like to see how deep I have sunk?" and said that he would put on his Superman cloak, because it means that "you can't decide what to do. Do you want progress in the world?
Try with love."
The audience buhed at least twice of his comments, and the SNL staff seemed to be embarrassed, says Variety with a comment from a person present: "There was a boom in the studio."
West had been booked to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose boyfriend, the rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West confused many by performing the song I Love It while he was dressed like a Perrier bottle.
West received the support of the leader of the Conservative Group, TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest people: THANK YOU FOR NOT LAYING YOUR KUE OF THE PURCHASE."
Talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West just "is who he is, and that's fine."
"But I choose NOT to reward a person (by buying his music, his clothes or supporting his "art") who embraces and pours out an ideology that is harmful to society.
He's allowed.
And so do we," she added.
Before the show, the rapper had announced that he's changed his name to "the entity officially known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to have changed his name, and thus follows Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The Rapcolleague Snoop Dogg is named Snoop Lion, and the recently deceased music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to The Artist Formerly Known as Prince.

The charges shall be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington lashes out for toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known to wield swords in the role of Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor is lashing out at the stereotypical macho hero and says that these kinds of TV characters mean that young men often feel that they have to be hard to be respected.
Kit said to Sunday Times Culture that he believes that something has gone wrong and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo age.
Kit, who recently married her 31-year-old Game of Thrones fellow star Rose Leslie, admitted that the problem is "very close to his heart".
"At the moment, I am very concerned – where have we gone wrong with masculinity?", he said.
"If we look at the current problems, what have we taught young men in their upbringing?"
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to the very masculine characters.
He continued: "What is inborn, and what is taught?
What is it that young men learn from television and on the street that makes them feel that they should be men in this way?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time – how do we change it?
For it is obvious that something has gone wrong for the young men."
During the interview he also admitted that he will not make successors to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, and said that he is "finished with battlefields and horses".
Kit participates from November in a remake of Sam Shepard's True West, which is the story of a film director and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he regards meeting his wife Rose as the best thing about the whole Game of Thrones experience.
"I met my wife because of this series, so it has given me my future family and shaped my life forever," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, in whom Kit's character, Jon Snow, falls in love with, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple was married in June 2018 at Leslie's family farm in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has published a 14% increase in the number of citizens with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country have been affected, says the health authorities.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases were recorded.
The vast majority of the new cases were sexually transmitted, which is a new trend.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China because of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people getting HIV in this way has been reduced to something close to zero, says Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan Province.
In one year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is an acute problem in China's LGBT environment.
In 1997, homosexuality was legalised, but discrimination against LGBTs is reported to be widespread.
Studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men marry women sooner or later because of the country's conservative values.
Many cases of infection are due to lack of contraception in these conditions.
Since 2003, the government of China has promised free and equal access to HIV medicines as an attempt to resolve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that personnel leaked data on Republican senators and thunders against "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories."
Member of the House of Representatives Maxine Waters denied Saturday's allegations that a member of her staff has shared personal information about three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The democracy of Los Angeles claimed that the allegations stemmed from websites and supporters of the "extreme right wing".
"Lie, lie and more terrible lies," Waters wrote in a Twitter post.
The published information reportedly contained home addresses and telephone numbers of US senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of whom are from Utah.
The information was posted on Thursday by an unknown person on Capitol Hill, during a Senate hearing on allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court-nominated Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak happened after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative support pages such as Gateway Pundit of RedState reported that the IP addresses pointed to the fact that the information had been posted by Waters' people, after which they published information about a member of Waters staff, says The Hill.
"This unfounded accusation is completely untrue and a direct lie," Waters continued.
"Member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations, is by no means responsible for this leak of information.
This unfounded accusation is completely untrue and a direct lie."
Waters' announcement quickly got criticism online, among other things from former press secretary at the White House Ari Fleischer.
"It's an angry denial," Fleischer wrote.
"It seems she doesn't have the right temperament to be a congressman.
If you're accused of something you haven't done, you can't get angry.
You can't get defiant.
Do not question the motives of the prosecutor.
You have to stay calm."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction with the democrats' criticism of Kavanaugh, who was criticised for being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who aims to take Waters' place in the mid-term elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Great, if that's true," he tweeted.
In Waters' official statement, she says that her staff has contacted "the relevant authorities and the law enforcement authorities regarding these fraudulent allegations."
"We will make sure the perpetrators are found," she continued. "And that they will be held legally responsible for their actions which are destructive and dangerous to everyone in my staff."
Review of Johnny English strikes again – underwhelming spy comedy with Rowan Atkinson
It has become the norm to look for a Brexit angle in all recent films with a British look, and it also seems relevant to the latest action comedy in the Johnny English series, which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and reappeared in 2011 with Johnny English - born again.
Will the dry, sarcastic self-satisfaction, whether we are in a bad position, become the country's new export option?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with the rubber face and the big eyes have got his permission to make roars over again. His name signals more than anything else that he is a comical invention aimed at places where the cinema visitors do not speak English.
He is, of course, the tumultuous secret agent, who, despite his desire to be a smooth gentleman, has a bit of Clouseau, a pinch of Mr. Bean and proper clutter of him, who performed a single note to the Chariots of Fire song at the opening ceremony of the London Olympics 2012.
He is also originally based on the world-wide and international sneaky pants that left chaos in his wake after Atkinson portrayed him in Barclaycard's television commercials.
There are a few good moments in this latest shot on the trunk of the JE.
I loved it when Johnny English approached a helicopter wearing a medieval armor, and the propellers sounded against his helmet.
You can see Atkinson's talent for physical comedy, but humor feels rather underwhelming and strangely superfluous, especially now that more "serious" films like 007 and Mission Impossible also offer convincing comedy as an ingredient.
The humor seems to be directed at children rather than adults, and to me Johnny English's crazy adventures are not as imaginative and focused as Atkinson's mute movie fools in the role of Mr. Bean.
The infinitely current starting point for the film is that Britain is in serious trouble.
An Internet hacker has infiltrated England's top secret spy network and revealed the identities of all the British agents in the field to the horror of the responsible agent – a unfortunately very small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last chance for a pompous and combat-ready Prime Minister who already suffers a complete meltdown in political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best with this Teresa May-like character, but there is not much to work with in the manuscript.
As her security advisors inform her that every active spy has been exposed, she has to cancel someone's pension.
And of course it is the clumsy Johnny English, who is now headmaster of an upper-class school, but who secretly teaches how to become a secret agent. There are some fun sequences here when English stands for some kind of School of Rock education in espionage.
English is rushed back to a crisis meeting at Whitehall and reunited with its hard-tested former right hand Bough, which is once again played by Ben Miller.
Bough has now married an overentusiatic but well-meaning submarine captain – a role that Vicki Pepperdine is being wasted on.
Thus, the very painstaking Batman and Robin of the Royal Intelligence Service are back when they meet Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale, Ophilia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is stumbling close to being infatuated by the charismatic and scary tech billionaire Jason Volta – played by Jake Lacy – who claims to be able to solve England's computer problems.
English and Bough start their furiously risky escapades: disguised as servants, they set fire to a distinguished French restaurant; they create chaos as they smuggle themselves aboard Volta's luxury yacht; and English creates pure Armageddon as he tries to use virtual reality glasses to familiarize himself with Volta's house.
All the cannons are fired in the final sequence of the film, but however well-meaning and energetic it is, there is a feeling of child television about it.
Pretty mediocre.
And as I couldn't help thinking with the other Johnny English films: Can't the English film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that does justice to his talent?
Labour refuses to bear with the plan for a four-day working week with unchanged pay for the British
Jeremy Corbyns Labour is said to be considering a radical plan so that the English can settle for a four-day work week, but get paid for five.
The party allegedly wants business leaders to use their savings from artificial intelligence (AI) to give employees an extra day off.
That would mean that the employees would have three days' weekend without going down on pay.
Sources say that the idea would be in line with the party's economic goal of drawing the country in a more favourable direction for the workers.
Trades Union Congress supports the idea of a four-day working week as a way for workers to benefit from a changing economy.
An experienced member of the Larbour Party said to The Sunday Times: "A political proposal is expected to be published by the end of the year."
"This is not going to happen in one day, but a four-day working week is a goal that fits with the party's approach to changing the economy to the benefit of the workers and to the party's overall strategy for industry."
Labour would not be the first to support such an idea when the Green Party proposed a four-day working week during the election campaign for the parliamentary elections in 2017.
The aim, however, is not supported unanimously by the Labour Party.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: "A four-day working week is not the party's policy and is not under consideration in the party."
Labour shadow finance minister John McDonnell spent last week's party meeting drawing up his plans for a socialist economic revolution.
McDonnell says he's determined to tear power back from "anonymous directors" and "exploitations" in utilities.
The shadow finance minister's plans also cast doubt on whether the current shareholders of water supply companies will get their money back, as a government headed by Labour could "set it off" on the basis of immoral acts.
He also confirmed plans to have employees on company boards and to set up including ownership funds to distribute 10 percent of the equity of private companies to employees who stand to receive up to £500 a year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell 60 Minutes if the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh can change their voice.
The FBI investigation of allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, and this raises the question of whether the FBI's findings could get Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview that was shown last Sunday, 60 Minutes journalist Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could dig up anything to change their attitude.
Kennedy seemed to be more open to the idea than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
"When I went into the hearing, I said that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened – after the accusations came out – and said, "Did you do it?"
He was firm, firm and unambiguous."
Graham’s voice, on the other hand, seems to have been chiseled in stone.
"I've made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh, and something else would require a very violent accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of those she mentioned could confirm it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I don't see that it should change anything."
What is the Global Citizens Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York hosts the Global Citizens Festival – an annual music festival with a very impressive range of artists and an equally impressive goal; to end world poverty.
For the seventh time, the Global Citizens Festival will receive tens of thousands of people on Central Park’s large lawn, where they can look forward to concerts with Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes. At the same time, the festival will raise awareness of the real goal, which is to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival started in 2012 and is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international interest organisation that is struggling to end poverty by increasing the number of active opponents.
To receive a free ticket to the event (if you do not want to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers must perform a number of tasks or "actions". For example, do volunteer work, write to a world leader, make a phone call or some other meaningful action that can raise awareness about the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been now that they have 12 years left to reach the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert real change, or is it just another case of so-called "clicktivism" – i.e. people feel that they make a difference by signing a petition online or making a Twitter look?
Global Citizen reports that since 2011, they have recorded more than 19 million "actions" from their members aimed at various goals.
They believe that these actions have encouraged world leaders to make binding goals and policies that correspond to more than 37 billion dollars, which by 2030 are expected to have affected more than 2.25 billion people.
At the beginning of 2018, the group listed 390 objectives and actions that had been created because of their actions, which amounted to over $10 billion, which had already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that so far these funds have had a direct impact on almost 649 million people worldwide.
One of the main objectives is The Power of Nutrition, which has started in England and is a collaboration between investors and active people. They strive to "help children live out their full potential" and promise 35 million dollars to alleviate nutrition problems in Rwanda after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the help of the British government, donors, governments of other countries and world citizens like you, the social injustice of malnutrition can become a footnote in the history books," said the ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, to the audience at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that the UK Government has now promised funds to improve the nutrition of mothers and children after receiving more than 5,000 calls online. This project, Power of Nutrition, will help five million mothers and children with advice on nutrition.
In answer to one of the website's frequently asked questions, saying: "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?",
Global Citizen wrote: "It will be a long and hard struggle, and sometimes we will stumble and make mistakes.
But as with the civil rights movement and the movements against apartheid, we will succeed because we are stronger together."
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are among the performers at this year's festival in New York. Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will be hosts.
The United States can use its fleet to "block" Russian energy exports, says the U.S. Home Secretary.
"If necessary," Washington can use its fleet to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East, revealing the U.S. Home Secretary, Ryan Zinke, to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's interference in Syria – especially where they operate at the invitation of the rightful government – is a pretext for expanding the sale of their energy.
'I believe they are in the Middle East because they want to sell energy, just as they do in Eastern and Southern Europe', he must have said.
And according to him, there are both methods and resources to prevent it.
"The United States, with our fleet, has the opportunity to ensure that there is free passage on the sea routes and, if necessary, we can also block them to ensure that their energy does not come onto the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants at a meeting held by the Consumer Energy Alliance – a non-profit organisation that considers itself "the voice of the U.S. energy consumer" –.
He compared Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, saying that they are essentially the same.
"The economic opportunities with Iran and Russia are about exploiting and replacing fuel," he said, referring to Russia as a "one-trick pony", whose economy is dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come after the Trump administration has aimed at increasing European exports of liquefied natural gas, which is to replace Russia, which is by far the cheapest choice for European consumers.
To achieve this, spokesmen for the Trump administration, including Donald Trump himself, have tried to convince Germany to withdraw from the "unsatisfying" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project which, according to Trump, has made Berlin the "captive" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion-dollar Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to double the current capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is only an economic project.
The Kremlin believes that Washington's strong opposition to the project is an expression of unequal conditions of competition and is simply due to economic considerations.
"I think we share the view that energy should not be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose a supplier," said Russian energy minister Aleksandr Novak at a subsequent meeting in Moscow with US energy minister Rick Perry in September.
The American position is met by criticism from Germany, which has confirmed its participation in the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, BDI, has asked the United States to avoid the EU's energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem with a third party interfering with our energy supplies," said the leader of BDI, Dieter Kempf, after a recent meeting between the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the Russian President, Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "considers strongly" running for president in 2020, says Senator Massachusetts.
Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren "considers strongly" running for president after the mid-term elections, she said Saturday.
At a Council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering running for office.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and repair our political system, and that requires a woman in front," she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will give strong consideration to running for president."
Warren gave his opinion on President Donald Trump under the council and said that he "is leading the country in the wrong direction."
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren has been pronounced in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
On a tweet Friday Warren wrote: "Of course the FBI must investigate the matter before the vote."
However, a poll from Thursday shows that the majority of Warren's own hinterland does not think she should run for office in 2020.
According to a poll by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe, 58% of "probable" voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not stand.
32 % supported the possible candidature.
The poll showed greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick by 38% for and 48% against a possible set-up.
Other high-profile democratic candidates discussed during the presidential elections in 2020 include, among others, former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden states that he announces his final decision in January, writes Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions Track Palins PTSD at a voter meeting for Donald Trump
The 26-year-old Track Palin was a year in Iraq after joining the army in September.
Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"What my own son is going through after he has come home makes me relate to other families who are experiencing the consequences of PTSD and other injuries that our soldiers are returning home with," she told the audience at a Trump voters' meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in space" and said of his son and other veterans that "they have changed and become harder. They go and think whether there is respect for what their colleagues on land and in the air and all other members of the military have done for the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was charged with domestic violence against a woman to prevent the report of domestic violence and the possession of a drunk weapon, says Dan Bennet, a spokesman for the Wasillas police.
18 states and D.C. support opposition to new asylum law
18 states and the District of Columbia support a legal objection to a new American law denying asylum to victims fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and D.C. delivered a party-independent statement in Washington on Friday in support of an asylum seeker who contradicts the law, says NBC News.
The applicant's full name in the case of Grace vs. Sessions, which the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against the federal law, has not been published.
She says that her partner "and his violent sons who are gang members" had abused her, but American officials refused her application for asylum on 20 July.
She was detained in Texas.
The state prosecutors supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of American asylum seekers originated, as countries with far-reaching problems of gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum law overturned a decision by the U.S. Immigration Board in 2014, allowing undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
The District of Columbia's District Attorney, Karl Racine, said on Friday that the new law "disregards decades of state, federal and international law."
"The federal legislation requires all asylum applications to be decided on the basis of relevant facts and circumstances, and such an obstacle goes against that principle", states the Party Independent Declaration.
The lawyers also argued in the statement that the law of rejecting immigrants harms the US economy, as they are more likely to become self-employed and "provide necessary labour."
In June, the Minister of Justice deprived Jeff Session of the right to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asylum is offered to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear on the basis of race, religion, nationality or membership of a given social group or a political position," said Sessions in its announcement of the law on June 11.
Asylum has never been meant to solve all problems – or just all serious problems – that people across the world face every day.
As the death toll doubles, attempts to find survivors in Palu become desperate
For survivors, the situation only got worse.
"It's very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, comforting her little fever-stricken boy at an evacuation centre in the devastated town of Palu.
"Every minute the ambulance comes in with bodies.
We need clean water."
The inhabitants now returned to their ruined homes to sort in soaked possessions and save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, which were also affected by the 7.5 earthquake, were unable to keep up.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who broke his back and shoulder, were located outside Palu’s military hospital, where patients are treated outdoors due to severe aftershocks.
He got tears in his eyes when he told how the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was crushed against a broken wall, I think," said Haris to the Associated Press, adding that his family was going to a wedding in town.
"I heard my wife cry out for help, but then it became quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
American ambassador accuses China of unfine methods and propaganda ads
A week after a Chinese newspaper brought a four-page ad in an American daily that drummed for the benefits of American-Chinese cooperation, the American ambassador in China accuses Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
On Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump referred to China Daily’s paid indentation in Des Moines Register – Iowa’s best-selling newspaper – after accusing China of interfering in the 6th November Congressional elections. China rejects the accusation.
U.S. officials tell Reuters that Trump's accusation of Chinese interference in the U.S. elections marks a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to announce the promotion of trade, Beijing and Washington are now stuck in an escalating trade war in which they have in several ways imposed duties on each other's imports.
China's retaliatory tariffs in the trade war were supposed to hit exporters in states like Iowa, which supported Trump's Republican Party, believe Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, US ambassador to China, former governor for a number of years in Iowa, a major exporter of agrifoods to China, said that Beijing has harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a leader on Sunday's Des Moines Register that China "is stepping up the use of the unfine methods by running propaganda ads in our own free press."
"By spreading propaganda, the Chinese government is using the proud American tradition of freedom of expression and freedom of the press by running a paid ad in Des Moines Register," wrote Branstad.
"In the kiosks here in Beijing, on the other hand, you will find few voices of disagreement, and you will not get a true view of the Chinese people's different positions on China's worrying economic direction, as the media are under the tight control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers failed to publish" his article, although he did not say which one.
Republicans alienate women prior to the mid-term election on the Kavanaugh case, warning analysts
While many top Republicans support and defend the Supreme Court-nominated Brett Kavanaugh against accusations of sexual abuse, analysts warn that they will experience a counter-reaction in the coming mid-term elections, especially from women.
The matter has stirred up emotions, and most Republicans have already announced that they would like to see the voting process continue.
"This cannot be undone," said Grant Reher, professor of political science at Syracuse University Maxwell School, to The Hill in an article Saturday.
Reher said that he doubts that Republican Senator Jeff Flakes (Arizona)'s request for an FBI investigation in the 11th hour will alleviate angry voters.
"Women don't forget what happened yesterday – they won't forget it tomorrow or November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, according to The Hill last Friday.
Friday morning the protesters shouted during a demonstration in the Senate: "November is coming!" when the Republicans, who control the Judiciary Committee, chose to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Professor Christine Blasey Ford, says Mic.
"The democratic enthusiasm and motivation will reach new heights", told independent political commentator Stu Rothenberg to the news media.
"People say it's already reached a high level; that's right.
But it can reach even higher, especially among female swingers in the suburbs and younger voters – 18-29-year-olds – who rarely vote, despite not liking the President."
Even before Ford's public accusations of the sexual abuse of the Supreme Court nominee had been made, analysts had pointed out that it could backfire if the Republicans continued with the nomination.
"It has become a mess for the Republicans," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee's vote or the final result, or about Kavanaugh being held accountable; it's also about how the Republicans have handled this and how they've treated her," says Guy Cecil, president of the Priorities USA – a group that supports Democrats in being elected – to the news channel.
But the Americans seem to have divided opinions as to who to believe in after the testimony from Ford and Kavanaugh, where the latter have a little more on their side.
A new poll from YouGov shows that 41% of those questioned believed in Ford's testimony, or probably believed in it, while 35% said they believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 % said that they thought Kavanaugh was either probably or certainly lying during his testimony, while only 30 % said the same thing about Ford.
At the request of Flake, the FBI is now investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least another, writes Deborah Ramirez for The Guardian.
Last week, under oath to the Senate Judicial Committee, Ford told us that Kavanaugh was drunkly assaulting her when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed his genitals to her at a party when they both studied at Yale in the '80s.
The inventor of the Internet plans to create a new Internet and compete with Google and Facebook
The inventor of the Internet, Tim Berners-Lee, is launching a new company to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend is called Inrupt and is a company based on Berners-Lees open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners Lee joked that the plan with Inrupt is "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup business.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology so people can create their own "personal online data collection" or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were available in a single browser at the same time.
What is unique about the personal online data collection is that it is entirely up to the user to decide who can access the specific information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data".
According to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is to gather resources, processes and abilities to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some software developers on project contract and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week onwards, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised apps using the tools available on Inrupt's website.
Berners-Lee says that he and his team don't talk to "Facebook or Google about whether to change everything completely so that all their business models suddenly become redundant."
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a post on Medium last Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to offer commercial energy and an ecosystem that can ensure the integrity and quality of the new Internet being built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he started World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an important voice in the so-called net neutrality debate.
While Inrupt is launched, Berners-Lee will still be the inventor and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic about the next period of the Internet," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Clergy recipient of the Victoria Cross from World War I
The only priest in the Church of England, who won the Victoria Cross by fighting during World War I, is celebrated in his home town 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Priest Bernard Wann won the order on September 29, 1918, during the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But he was killed four days later by a sniper and was never told that he had won the highest English military order.
Last Saturday a memorial stone was revealed by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northhamptonshire.
Michael Vann, one of his grandchildren, said that it was "unbelievably symbolic" that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather's orderly achievement.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick mist and under heavy fire from machine guns and artillery."
Later he ran to the front line and led his people forward with the "greatest courage" before he alone attacked an artillery and detonated three guns.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann at 72 said that his grandfather's actions were "something I knew I could never live up to, but which humbles me."
He and his brother James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade, which was led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he "felt very honored to participate in the parade" and added that "the support of all these people emphasizes the true heroism."
MMA fans stayed up all night to see Bellator 206, but got instead Gurli Gris
Imagine you've been up all night watching the star-split Bellator 206 and being denied the main event.
There were 13 matches on the program from San Jose, including six matches on the main program, and they were shown overnight in England on Channel 5.
At 6 in the morning, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared to meet each other, the viewers in England were somewhat surprised when the transmission switched to show Gurli Gris.
Some were unimposed after they stayed awake until early morning for this particular fight.
A Twitter fan described the switch to a children's cartoon as "a kind of sick joke."
"According to the legislation, this content was not appropriate at 6 in the morning, which is why they had to switch to children's programs," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president, when he was asked about the broadcast.
"'Gurli the Pig, yes."
Bellator’s CEO, Scott Coker, stated that they will work to include English viewers in future planning.
"When you think about the rerun, I think we can make it work," Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock Sunday morning over there, and we won't find a solution until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the change took place, I got a lot of messages, and they weren't all friendly.
We were trying to fix it, and we thought it was a technical error.
But it was actually the law.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We settle for five games instead of six, as we normally do, and we tried to give our fans something extra, and then we went over time.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley had "less value" over sexuality
The Olympic diver Tom Daley says that he felt less worth than everyone else in his upbringing because of his sexuality, but that motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize until he got into the larger classes that "everybody's not like me."
When he was on Radio 4's first Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about homosexual rights to give others "hope".
He also said that he was less concerned about winning the Olympics after becoming a parent.
The usual host on the radio show that's been running for a long time, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off due to illness.
Daley was a guest in Laverne's first program and said that he felt "less worth" than everyone else in his upbringing because "it was not socially accepted to like boys and girls."
He said: "To this day, the feelings of feeling worthy of memory and feeling different have been the things that have given me the strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he didn't disappoint everyone when they got to know his sexuality.
The dual Olympic bronze winner has become a high-profile LGBT champion and used his participation in this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal for a decriminalisation of homosexuality in several countries.
He said that he spoke out because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without negative consequences, and he would give others "hope".
The triple world champion said he had been "surprised" when he fell in love with a man – the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married the Oscar winner last year, who is 20 years older than him, but told me that the age difference had never been a problem.
He said that it is hard to find someone of the same age who has experienced similar ups and downs when you go through so much at such a young age – he went to his first Olympics at 14, and his father died of cancer three years later.
In June the couple became the parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that "his whole perspective" had changed."
"If you had asked me last year, it would all be about winning a gold medal," he said.
"But there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after having been diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley told me that his father did not accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was whether they had been given tickets to London 2012 – when he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him he wouldn't be there by then.
I held his hand when his breathing stopped, and it only dawned on me that he was not immortal when he stopped breathing and was dead," he said.
The following year Daley participated in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of my whole life – diving in front of a home audience at the Olympics. Nothing could beat that feeling," he said.
It was also the inspiration for his first song selection – Proud of Heather Small – which had meant a lot during the run-up to the Olympics and still gave him goose bumps.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 BST.
Uskarp Mickelson on the bench for the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson sets the record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but he must do something about the shape if it is not to be a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who sets a record by joining the competition for the 12th time, which is held every two years, was benched by Captain Jim Furyk because of Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being in the centre of events of the United States as usual, the five-fold winner had to act as cheerleaders and practice his game in the hope of correcting the distortions.
Even at the peak of his career he had the most equal drive, so the 48-year-old is not a perfect match to the track at Le Golf National, where the long rough often punishes lost shots.
And if the track wasn't a big enough mouthful, Mickelson at the ninth match on Sunday must meet the always precise winner of British Open Francesco Molinari, who has joined forces with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans, starting the 12 single games, start fast, Mickelson's fight can be decisive.
Furyk did not surprisingly express confidence in his teammate.
"He understood his role completely today, gave me a pat on my back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a great faith in himself."
He is in the Hall of Fame and has given so much to these teams in the past – and also this week.
I didn't think he'd play two games.
I imagined he'd play more, but that's how it went, and that's how it was supposed to be.
He wants to be out there like everybody else."
On Sunday Mickelson Nick Faldo beats the record for the most played matches in the Ryder Cup.
It could be the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never completely matched his individual performance.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven draw, although Furyk said that his presence contributes something indefinable.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, witty, he likes to stab people, and he's good to have in the hold room," he explained.
"I also think that the younger players had fun playing against him this week, which was fun to see.
He contributes much more than just the game."
Europe's Captain Thomas Bjørn knows that great lead can quickly disappear
European Captain Thomas Bjørn knows from experience that a solid lead before the last day of Ryder Cup's single showdown can quickly become nerve-wracking.
The Danish made his debut in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but was about to be caught up before the finish line with a win of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a nice lead in Valderrama, we had a nice lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we only exactly won", says Bjorn after watching the 2018 team win both 5-3 Friday and yesterday for a total lead of 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The story tells me and the rest of the team that it's not over.
It's going to need full trash tomorrow.
Go out and do everything right.
It's not over until you get the points on the board.
We have a goal, and that is to try to win the trophy, and that is where our focus lies.
I have always said that I am focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we are also aware of what is on the other side – the best golfers in the world."
Enjoyed by his players' performance on a difficult track, Bjorn added: "I'm not taking any of this for granted.
Tomorrow is a whole new challenge.
Tomorrow, it is the individual achievements that count, and that is something completely different.
It's great to be out there with a partner when it goes well, but when you're out there alone, you're tested on all parameters as a golfer.
That's what players need to understand – bring out the best in yourself tomorrow.
Now you have to leave your partner, because he also has to bring out the best in himself."
This is different for opponent Jim Furyk, who hopes for better individual performance than in the partner game with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk has seen his own turnarounds on the last day, first on the Brookline winning team, before he lost when Europe made the miracle on Medinah.
"I remember every word," he said when asked how Captain Ben Crenshaw in 1999 had spoken to his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you want a good start, like you saw at Brookline, like you saw at Medinah.
When momentum has found a direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle fights.
We put together our team in relation to it and put the players on the field in the order we feel for. We try to create magic tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead backlash and is facing Rory McIlroy in the top game, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and the other Europeans play in the first half of the order.
"I chose this group of players in this order because I think it secures us all the way through," said Bjorn about his choice of single players.
Germany’s new warship is being postponed again
The German Navy's latest frigate should have been ready in 2014 to replace warships from the Cold War. However, the Germans must wait at least a year yet due to technical problems and an escalating price, reports local media.
The insertion of the largest ship into the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg class of frigates, "Rheinland-Pfalz", has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quotes a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to be part of the fleet in 2014, but after delivery problems have plagued the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered back in 2007 are to replace the ageing frigates of the Bremen class.
They are known to have a powerful cannon, a wide range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as stealth technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Another important feature of the latest frigates is a smaller need for maintenance: it should be possible to have frigates away from home ports for up to two years.
But the repeated delays mean that the advanced warships – which are said to make Germany appear to be an overseas power factor – will already be obsolete when they are deployed, Die Zeit writes.
The failed F125 frigate created headlines last year when the German fleet officially refused to take the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned a ship to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media mentioned a number of crucial "software and hardware errors" that made the warship useless in combat situations.
Software failures were of particular importance as the ships of the Baden-Wuertemberg class must be controlled by a crew of 120 sailors – that is only half the crew of the older Bremen frigates.
It also turned out that the ship was too heavy, reducing its performance and limiting the fleet's ability for future updates.
The 7000 ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is said to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to hardware errors, the cost of the project, which includes staff training, is also becoming a problem.
It is said to have reached staggering €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion), with an initial price of €2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates are becoming even more important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is shrinking.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Government's Defence Committee, admitted earlier this year that the fleet "is running out of ready-to-lay ships."
The official said that the problem has grown over time because the old ships were taken out of service without being replaced.
He complained that none of the frigates from the Baden-Wuertemberg class were ready to join the fleet.
National Trust Sniping Into Bats’ Secret Life
New research from an area in the Highlands of Scotland is trying to reveal how bats use the landscape when hunting.
The hope is that the findings will shed light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and will help in the work on future conservation efforts.
The study is conducted by scientists from the Scottish National Trust and follows ordinary bats, dwarf bats, long-eared bats and water bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment is placed in carefully selected locations in the area to record the activities of the bats during the season.
Data are also collected by staff from NTS and volunteers using handheld detectors.
In-depth analysis of the sound recordings will reveal the bat call frequencies and show which species does what.
To produce a detailed landscape picture of their behaviour, a report and map of the habitat are made.
Nature conservation advisor to NTS Rob Dewar hopes that the results reveal which areas of the habitat are most important and how they are used by the different species.
This knowledge can help determine the benefits of habitat conservation interventions such as the establishment of meadows, and how best to preserve forest areas for bats and similar species.
The number of bats in Scotland and Britain has fallen dramatically over the last 100 years.
They are threatened by buildings and urban enlargement projects which affect the shipowners and restrict their habitat.
Windmills and lighting can also pose a danger, as can fly traps, chemical treatment of building materials, and attacks from pets.
Bats aren't actually blind.
But because they primarily hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes.
They use an advanced echolocation technique to find insects and fly around obstacles.
NTS, which is responsible for the preservation of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes bats very seriously.
They have ten trained experts who often collect data, inspect nests and sometimes perform rescue operations.
The organization has even made Scotland’s first and only dedicated bat reserve in the area around Three in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight out of ten of Scotland’s bat species.
The area's caretaker, David Thompson, says it's an ideal territory for them.
"Here at Three we have a very good area for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and the whole good habitat.
There's a lot you don't know about bats, so work here and elsewhere can help you understand what they need to thrive."
He stresses the importance of looking for bats before carrying out maintenance tasks on properties, as the destruction of a single nest can kill up to 400 females and young, thus risk destroying an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or disturb them or their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish Project Manager for the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to lend a hand.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of the species we have, we don't know how the populations are developing."
Ronaldo rejects rape charges while lawyers sue German journal
Cristiano Ronaldo has called rape charges against him "fake news" and says that people "will promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are getting ready to sue the German news media Der Spiegel, who brought the accusations.
The attacker from Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is claimed that he paid her $375,000 to keep it a secret, Der Spiegel wrote on Friday.
A few hours after the allegations had been made public, 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke to his 142 million followers on Instagram Live and criticised the information as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news", said the five-time winner of the Ballon d'Or to the camera.
"They will promote themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They'll be famous by saying my name, but it's part of the job.
I am a happy man, and everything is fine", added the player smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel because of the charges they have called, according to Reuters, "an unforgivable disclosure of suspicions of the privacy sphere".
Lawyer Christian Schertz says that the player would seek compensation for "moral corruption in a class similar to the accusation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The incident allegedly took place in June 2009 in a room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly took back to the player's room, where he must have raped her anal according to the report submitted to the District Court of Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronald fell to his knees after the alleged incident and said he was "a good guy 99% of the time" caught by "the one percent".
The file says Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that there was consent to it.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had her injuries photographed in a hospital, but that she later agreed to an agreement outside the court because she felt "fear of retaliation" and worried about being "publicly rude".
The 34-year-old now says that she will reverse the agreement as she is still deeply affected by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo faced a shift from Manchester United to Real Madrid, when the event was supposed to have taken place, and changed this summer to the Italian big club Juventus for 100 million €.
Brexit: Britain "will forever regret" losing car manufacturers
Britain "will regret it forever" if it lost its world leading car manufacturer status after Brexit, said business minister Greg Clark.
He added that it was "anxious" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily reduce production at the Burnaston plant near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that longer waiting at the border in case of a Brexit without agreement could cost jobs.
The Burnaston factory, which produces Toyotas Auris and Avensis, produced almost 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"As I see it, production will stop at our factory if Britain goes out of the EU at the end of March," said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, express fear of leaving the EU without an agreement on cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, says that they will close their Mini factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concern of car manufacturers has to do with risks to the supply chain in the event of a withdrawal without agreement.
Toyota's production runs on a tight schedule, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU.
If Britain leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there could be problems at the border which, according to the car industry, could lead to delays and a lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than one day of production at the Derbyshire factory, and then production would be stopped, the company said.
Clark says Theresa May's Chequers plan for future negotiations with the EU is "composed to precisely avoid these inspections at the border."
"We need an agreement. We want the best deal, which not only allows us – as I call it – to enjoy our current success, but to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The opinions of Toyota and other manufacturers indicate that we need to be able to continue what has been successful supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would have stopped, but in the long term higher prices would reduce the factory's competitiveness, which would ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is a joint shop steward at the factory, says that his members are becoming more and more concerned: "My experience tells me that as soon as these jobs disappear, they will not come back."
A government spokesman said: "We have proposed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the European Union."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be late again, says White House
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein may "be postponed another week", as the discussion around Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, said the White House last Sunday.
Rosenstein looks over the shoulder of the Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller during his investigation of Russian electoral interference, links between Trump's aides and Russia and the possible obstruction of justice by the President.
Whether Trump will fire the Deputy Minister of Justice and thereby risk Mueller's independence has been a gossip subject in Washington for months.
The New York Times wrote earlier this month that Rosenstein considered wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of dismissing the president via the 25th paragraph.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But last Monday he went to the White House, and word was he was gonna quit.
Instead, a meeting was arranged with Trump on Thursday, which was then at the UN headquarters in New York.
Trump said that he would "prefer not" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid a coincidence with the Senate Judicial Committee hearing, where Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault, had to testify.
Last Friday, Trump ordered a week's FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, which delayed the Senate's election.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders was on Fox News on Sundays.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "There is no set date. It could be this week. I can also imagine that it could be pushed a week with everything going on in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some journalists would challenge that claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
The host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences was not due to TV journalists' games for the gallery, but added: "I do not disagree that they play up to the camera."
She then said that the direct contact between Trump and the press will be increased.
"The President accepts more questions from the press than any president before him," she said, adding without quoting a source, "We have looked at the figures."
Press meetings will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask direct questions to the President of the United States, it is infinitely better than talking to me.
We're trying to give you plenty of opportunity, and you've seen us do it over the last few weeks, and it's going to be in the place of the press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump often accepts questions when he leaves the White House or attends open hearings or press conferences with senior guests.
Press meetings with Trump alone are rare.
This week in New York, the president showed why when he made an improvised and sometimes mysterious figure in front of the journalists present.
Minister for Health contacts EU staff in Scottish health care after Brexit concerns
The Minister for Health has written to the EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to express the country's gratitude and wish that they remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before Britain withdrew from the European Union.
The Government of Scotland has already committed itself to paying for applications for permanent residence for EU citizens working in its delegated public sector.
In his letter Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between Britain and the EU on withdrawal have continued and decisions are expected in the autumn.
But the British Government has also increased their preparation for a possible Brexit without an agreement.
I know this must be a very uncertain period for all of you.
That is why I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the efforts made by each individual employee, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from and outside the EU come with valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the healthcare system for the benefit of patients and local communities.
Scotland is definitely your home, and we would very much like you to stay.
Christion Abercrombie undergoes acute surgery after head injury
The lineback from Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, was acutely operated upon after having suffered a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 defeat to Vanderbilt Commodores, reportedly from Tennessee's Mike Organ.
First coach of Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told journalists that the incident took place before the break.
"He went to the sidelines and just fell over out there," said Reed.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sidelines before putting him on a stretcher and taking him in for further examination.
A spokesman from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from the WSME in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie's operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center was over.
Harris added that there is not "any details about the type or extent of the injury yet", and Tennessee State is trying to find out when he contracted the injury.
Abercrombie is studying in the second year and is starting his first season in Tennessee State after a shift from Illinois.
He had five tackles last Saturday before he left the game, giving him 18 tackles together this season.
Foreign buyers are charged higher stamp duty when buying house in the UK
Foreign buyers are charged higher stamp duty when buying a property in the UK. According to the Conservative Party, the extra money is to help the homeless.
This move is intended to dampen Corbyn's success in attracting young voters.
The higher stamp duty will hit those who do not pay taxes in Britain.
The Treasury expects it to raise £120 million a year for the homeless.
Theresa May will today propose that foreign buyers be charged a higher stamp duty when buying properties in Britain, for the benefit of the homeless.
The pull will be considered an attempt to counter Jeremy Corbyn's success in attracting young voters with promises of cheaper housing and to go after those with the highest income.
The increase in stamp duty will affect people and companies who do not pay taxes in Britain. Earnings from this must be used for the government’s struggle to ensure that everyone has a place to sleep.
The additional fee, which is added to the current stamp duty and the higher levels introduced two years ago on multi-home purchases and purchases to rent, can reach 3 %.
The Treasury expects it to raise £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of new constructions in London are bought by people living abroad, which makes prices rise and makes it harder for first-time buyers to get a foot in the housing market.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become ghost towns due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of the time outside the country.
The new bill comes only weeks after Boris Johnson proposed a cut in the stamp duty to make it easier for young people to buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping up property prices by buying land they don't use. He asked May to drop the quotas on cheap housing to solve Britain's "bad housing situation."
Corbyn has proposed a striking set of housing reforms, including the control of rent prices and the withdrawal of the landlord’s opportunity to put people on the street if they comply with the lease.
He will also strengthen the possibility of building public housing.
May said: "Last year I said that I would use my presidency to restore the British dream; that life will be better for every generation.
And that means repairing our non-functioning housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
But it cannot be that it is as easy for foreign companies and people living outside Britain to buy homes as it is for hardworking British people.
For too many, the dream of owning a home has become too remote, and the unworthiness of sleeping on the street is still too widespread."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to become Scotland's coach."
The head of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says that his "ultimate goal" is eventually to become Scotland's coach.
The 42-year-old scotch enjoys the challenge of reviving the North East club, which now has third place in League One, three points from the top.
He switched to Stadium of Light this summer after having led St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
"I played a game with the B-team, and that was it," said Ross BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"But I grew up seeing Scotland on Hampden with my father when I was a child, and it's always drawn to me.
However, that option would only arise if I were successful in training clubs."
Ross' predecessors as coach for Sunderland are Dick Advocateaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach of Alloa Athletic says he had no qualms about following such established names in such a large club and had previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Now I'm measuring success by whether 'I can get this club back in the Premier League.'
Based on the structure and facilities of this club, it undoubtedly belongs in the Premier League", he said.
"It's not an easy task, but I'll probably only see myself as successful here if I can get the club back there."
Ross is only three years into his career as a coach after a period of assistant coaching at Dumbarton and a 15-month failure as part of Heart's coaching staff.
Then he helped Alloa come back after having moved into the third best row and transformed St Mirren from the relegation threat to title winners the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his career as a player for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real crossroads," he remembers about the time in Alloa.
"I sincerely thought that coaching was the right thing for me, more right than being a player.
It sounds strange because I did well, made sense and had some success experiences.
But it can be hard to play.
There are a lot of things you need to go through on a weekly basis.
There's still that kind of stress and pressure as a coach, but it just feels right.
I've always wanted to train, and now I do. I haven't felt more comfortable with myself in my entire adult life."
You can hear the entire interview at Sportsound on Sunday 30 September at Radio Scotland between 12.00 and 13.00 BST.
The best time for a beer is Saturdays at 5.30 p.m., according to survey
The heat wave this summer has increased profits for England’s pubs, but has put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Sales in pubs and bars increased by 2.7% in July, while sales in restaurants have fallen by 4.8%, according to figures.
Peter Martin, a company consultant at CGA and collected the figures, said: "Continued sunshine and England's unexpectedly long World Cup have meant that July follows the pattern of June, where pubs experienced an additional sale of 2.8%, except that the restaurants are now harder hit.
The fall of 1.8% in the restaurants in June only got worse in July.
Pubbers and bars with a focus on the sale of drinks did clearly the best and experienced success similar to the decline of restaurants.
Pubber with a focus on food suffered in the sun, but not as much as the restaurants.
It looks like people just want something to drink.
Across pub and bar chains, sales of drinks increased by 6.6% for the month, while food fell by 3.3%."
Paul Newman, who analyses the service industry, said: "The results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
When it comes to sale in the out-of-home market, the weather and major social or sports events are the main factors.
It is no surprise that the restaurants are still struggling, even though a fall in sales of 4.8% year after year will hurt very much on top of rising costs.
The long, hot summer could not come at a worse time for the food industry, and only time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we have had in August will give a much needed respite."
The total increase in sales overall for pubs and restaurants including new openings was 2,7 % in July, which shows the decline in newly started brands.

One in five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
Every fifth child – down to 11 years – has secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents and teachers, shows survey.
A study of 20,000 school students in the 4th-9th grade reveals growth in "false Insta" pages.
The news has increased the fear that sexual content will be raised
20% of the students said they have a "main account" that they can show their parents
Every fifth child as young as 11 creates accounts on the social media that they hide from adults.
A study of 20,000 students from the 4th grade and beyond reveals dramatic growth in "false Insta" accounts – a reference to the image sharing service Instagram.
The news has increased the fear that sexual content will be brought up.
Twenty per cent of the students said they have a "main account" that they can show their parents while they also have private ones.
A mother who stumbled upon her 13-year-old daughter's secret account saw a teenager who urged others to "rape me".
The study carried out by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmistressesses' Conference (HMC) for private schools found that 40% of 11-18 year olds had two profiles, half of which admitted to private accounts.
The head of HMC, Mike Buchanan, said: "It's scary that so many teenagers are tempted to create online profiles where their parents and teachers can't find them.
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" on the board of Scottish Athletics.
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of Scottish Athletics at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most winning athlete, and President Ian Bettie described the shift as a good opportunity for those who make decisions about sports to benefit from her extensive ten-year experience at international level.
"Eilidh enjoys great reputation in the athletic world in Scotland, Britain and the rest of the world, and we are sure that the athletics in Scotland will be able to benefit from having her on the board," said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I will try to be the voice of athletes, and I hope that I can contribute and help set out a direction for sport in Scotland."
The American, who won two of his four Olympic gold medals in the 200- and 400-metre races at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996, and who are now often commentators of the BBC, could not go for a transitory ischaemic attack.
On Twitter he wrote: "A month ago I was struck by a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that time would tell me if I would recover from it and to what extent.
It's been hard work, but I'm completely healthy, I've learned to walk again and today I'm doing agility exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Advertising for breast pump comparing mothers to cows gets mixed reception online
A breast pumping company has shared opinions online with an advertisement that compares nursing mothers with cows that are milked.
To mark the launch of what is said to be "the world's first silent breast pump", the technological consumer magazine has released a sarcastic music video-inspired advertisement to show the freedom the new pump gives mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a cowhouse full of hay to a song in which it says, "Yes, I milk myself, but you see no tail" and "If you hadn't noticed, these aren't udders, these are my breasts."
The chorus says, "Pump it out, pump it out, I feed my baby, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my bosom."
But advertising, which has been published on the company's Facebook page, has led to controversy online.
With 77,000 views and several hundred comments, the video has received a mixed reception from the viewers. Many say that it makes fun of the "terrors" of the milk industry.
"Very bad decision to use cows to advertise for this product.
Like us, they must get pregnant and feed before they can produce milk, except that their babies are stolen from them shortly after birth," wrote a user.

Another wrote: "Responsiblely traumatic for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their children?"
Another added, "What an insensitive commercial."
Others defended the commercial. A woman admitted that she thought the song was "unbelievable funny."
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
If I were still breast-feeding, I would have had one.
Breastfeeding made me feel exactly like a cow.
The commercial's a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
It's a brilliant product," one wrote.
Another commented: "It is a fun advertisement aimed at mothers who pump milk (often at their workplace or in toilets) and feel like 'cows'.
It is not an advertisement that praises or criticises the milk industry."
At the end of the video, the women reveal that they have danced with the subtle pumps in their bras.
The concept of advertising is based on the fact that many women who are breastfeeding say that they feel like cows.
The pump from Elvie is completely silent, has no tubes or hoses and fits discreetly in a breast-feeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their children and even go out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and director of Mother, wrote: "The pump from Elvie is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between nursing mothers and dairy cows, we would focus on the challenges of breast pumping while showing in an entertaining and recognizable way the freedom that the new pump can provide."
This is not the first time the pump from Elvie has created headlines.
In London Fashion Week, a mother of two catwalks went for Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children secretly moved to tent camp at the Texas border
The number of migrant children held in detention has exploded, although the number of border-goers has not changed, partly because of a harsher rhetoric and the tougher laws of the Trump administration, which make it harder to place children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and they have feared for their ability to stay in the country by standing forward and accepting a child.
The return risk increased in June when the authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult household members would give fingerprints and that this data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs enforcement official, testified to Congress and reported that they had arrested several people who were applying to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The administration later confirmed that 70 % of those arrested had clean criminal records.
"Close to 80% of those who are either sponsors or members of sponsors' households are illegally staying in the country, and a large proportion of them are foreign criminals.
So we continue to hunt those people," said Albence.
In attempting to deal with children's cases more quickly, the authorities have introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of their detention.
Many people use video calls instead of showing up to plead their own case for legal residence to an immigration judge.
Those who are judged unwarranted for residence are deported quickly.
The longer children remain in custody, the more likely they are to experience anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outcomes or attempted escape, says the aid workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
People who advocate better conditions say that these risks are more pronounced in larger plants such as Tornillo, where size makes it harder to monitor whether a child is suffering.
They added that relocating to a tent village without mental preparation or opportunity to say goodbye to friends can accumulate trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria informs US, French and Turkish "possessional forces" that they must withdraw immediately.
When the Syrian Foreign Minister, Walid al-Moualem, spoke to the UN General Assembly, he asked Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is now on its eighth year.
Moualem, also Deputy Prime Minister, said that the stay of foreign forces in the country is illegal and on the pretext of fighting terrorism, and they will "be met with similar means."
'You must resign immediately and without conditions', he said to the House.
Moualem insisted that the war on terror "almost is over" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died since 2011 and millions have fled their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue to "fight this decisive war until we have purged all Syrian territories" for both terrorist groups and "illegal foreign presence".
The United States has approximately 2 000 soldiers in Syria who are primarily training and advising Kurdish and Syrian-Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the war-torn country.
In the area of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions were good enough for them to return home, after which he accused "some Western countries" of "spreading unfounded fears" that caused the refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to help facilitate these repatriations," he said.
"They politicize what should be a purely humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no help will be provided to rebuild the country until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Syria to create a buffer zone in the last major rebel-controlled city of Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
Due to the agreement between Russia and Turkey, a major attack by Syrian forces supported by Russia was avoided against the province of three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that military actions would target jihadists from the Nusra Front, a spring group of Al-Qaeda, which "will be wiped out".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of the new committee to outline a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for an election.
Moualem has set the conditions for the Syrian Government's participation in the committee and states that the panel's work should be limited to 'going through the legislation of the current constitution' and warned against interference.
That's why Trump wins another presidential term.
Based on that logic, Trump will probably be re-elected in 2020, unless the impeachment case and the scandals end his presidency ahead of time, which many liberal viewers may hope for.
In what will undoubtedly be "The most dramatic end of a presidential term ever!"
Currently, there is no sign of viewer fatigue.
Since 2014, best-time ratings have almost doubled for CNN to 1.05 million and almost tripled to 1.6 million for MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime time compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show has the most viewers with up to 3.5 million on evenings with great news.
"It's a racket that people are attracted to because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, leader of the ABC drama Designated Survivor about a cabinet leader who becomes president after an attack destroys the congress building.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy author and author behind "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has a different theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh,' Scovelll said.
The chaos has entertainment value.
But unlike all other television programmes, the stories coming from Washington can decide between Roe and Wade whether refugee families can be reunited and the health of the world economy.
Changing channels is only the most privileged.
And yet it's about more than being enlightened citizens when you see six hours of panel discussion where experts discuss Bob Woodward's use of "deep background" when he wrote his book "Fear"; Paul Manafort's ostrich leather jacket for $15,000 ("covered with hubris", The Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniels' vivid descriptions of Trump's anatomy.
At least I never want to see Super Mario the same way.
"Some of the things that make it feel like a reality show is that he gives you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", about the Trump show's rotating crew and daily surprises (dreams with N.F.L., praises Kim Jong-un.)
But if you miss an episode, you're off.
When I got hold of Fleiss this week, it was 26 degrees outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he was inside watching MSNBC while he was shooting CNN.
He could not force himself away; not with Brett Kavanaugh, who was to be heard on the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court had to be decided.
"I remember when we did all these crazy shows in the past, and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

Large sums of money find their way to the close midterm elections for the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th district receives large sums of money. As a result of an equalization of two Congressional Districts, two congressmen are fighting for the same seat.
This recently refurbished suburb of Pittsburg creates problems for the democratic representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another special election last spring.
Lamb is running against another incumbent congressman, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents Pennsylvania’s 12th district, which overlaps sharply with the new 17.
The maps were changed after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January ruled that the old district had been illegally set up in favour of the Republicans.
The fight for the new 17th district has started a fight for financial resources between the committees of the major parties, the Democratic Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a high-level election in March's Special Election for Pennsylvania's 18th district.
The seat has been in the hands of the Republicans for over ten years, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political commentators give the Democrats a small advantage.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for supporting China but changed its mind
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing with few protests from Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners threw out Trump's management team.
Foreign Office officials decided to call back leading American diplomats from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama after "the recent decision to no longer recognise Taiwan", said Heather Nauert, the Foreign Office spokeswoman in a statement earlier this month.
But only El Salvador was punished. They received about 140 million dollars of the United States in 2017 for drug control, development and financial support.
The proposed penalties, which include cuts in financial assistance and restrictions on entry permits, would have been painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder statistics.
As internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials postponed a top conference on security and economic development.
But in mid-September, top officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place anyway, thereby dropping the consideration of penalties for El Salvador.
Mr Pence, Vice-President, will address the conference scheduled for mid-October in order to send a signal of the importance that the Americans place in the meeting, said diplomats.
And the three American deployed secretly went back to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new harsh demands or punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Bolton did not want to comment on the details of the case, which were described by three American officials, including two diplomats who would like to talk about internal considerations if they remained anonymous.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an outside analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke out of a condition of anonymity.
Know the History
The next obstacle could well be the special prosecutor Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstacle to the investigation, for which there is considerable and publicly available evidence.
It is said that Mueller will also direct his investigation into the question of whether Trump's campaign secretly cooperated with Russia in the attack on the elections.
If Congress were to come into new hands, Trump would probably be held accountable as he prepares to meet again the voters and, in time, probably a jury of his associates.
There are many uncertainties, and I do not claim that Trump's end is inevitable – as is his counterparts in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we must all make choices that will affect how long the battle is going to continue.
In 1938 German officers were ready to engage with a coup d'état against Hitler, if only the West had been able to resist him by supporting the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and did not seize the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage thereafter.
It is around such turning points that the axis of history is turning, and the inevitable march of democracy is waning or waning.
In the United States, there are now several of these turning points.
What do we do if Trump fires the man who decides the future of Mueller's investigation, Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein?
Rosenstein's seat has been warm since this newspaper was able to announce that last year he had proposed to make hidden recordings of the President and challenged his suitability for office.
According to Rosenstein, The Times' presentation is imprecise.
"How do we react if F.B.I.'s recently sought-after investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is suspended or not carried out properly – or if he is approved to the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And, more importantly, will we vote in favour of a congress that will hold Trump responsible for the midterm elections?
If we fail these trials, it will be a long winter for democracy.
But because of what I learned in Prague, I believe we're gonna make it.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the very Nazi regime that once occupied the homeland of my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to America and sent me 60 years later to light the Sabbath light on the table with the swastika.

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is optimistic ahead of the fight against SK Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will welcome SK Rapid Vienna on Thursday. After the impressive tie in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, with a victory against the Austrians, they will have good opportunities to move forward from Group G of the Europe League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from getting a season debut before the 2-2 fight against Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers can use the result as a springboard for something even bigger.
"It was a good point for us, for Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We went to the fight with the belief that we could get something home, and we got a point.
Maybe we could have taken the plug home, but all in all, it was probably a fair result.
They were probably best in the first half, but we got out in the second half and were the best team.
On Thursday will be another great European evening.
We hope to get three points, but it will be difficult because they got a good result in the last match. But with the audience behind us I am sure that we can put pressure on them and get a good result.
The last year has been hard because of everything that's happened to my injuries and the changes in the club, but the mood is good now.
The team is good, and the boys are really enjoying it.
Hopefully we can ride now, put last season behind us and succeed."
Anxiety over pension savings makes women sleepless
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a firm idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people talked about it with the family.
About half of the participants in the Nationswide study reported that they discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouses.
Only 10% said they talked to their kids about it.
"Most people want a family member to take care of them, but they don't do anything to start the conversation," says Holly Snyder, Vice President of Nationswide's life insurance business.
That's how you get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to take care of you if you do not tell them your wishes in good time.
Use your counselor and family to discuss where and how you will receive care. These choices can be decisive factors for the cost.
Ask your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find out how to pay for the expenses.
Long-term care can be financed, among other things, by means of traditional long-term care insurance, life insurance with cash payments or self-insurance with your own funds – as long as you have finances for it.
Fix the legal documents: take the legal battles in the bud.
Get a proxy so you can get a trusted person to handle your medical treatment and ensure that doctors and medical staff comply with your wishes in case you cannot communicate yourself.
Consider, too, a financial mandate.
In this case, you appoint a trusted person who can make financial decisions and make sure that your bills are paid if you do not have the opportunity to do so yourself.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that one of your aging parents needs urgent medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Get all these details in writing so you're ready.
"It's not just a question of the economy – who are the doctors?" Martin asked.
"What kind of medicine?
Who's taking care of the dog?
Get the plan in place."
Male shot several times with air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air rifle on his way home from a tour of the city.
The victim was in his 40s and was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, diaphragm and hand.
Officers describe the shooting, which took place around 2:30 p.m., as "by chance."
The victim didn't see the perpetrator.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are urging witnesses to come forward.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a violent earthquake and a tsunami which hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday.
Since the communications routes are out of play, relief workers have not been able to receive information from the Donggala, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the earthquake struck.
Here are some facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sultanese province and is located at the bottom of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, which in 2017 had an estimated population of 379,800.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a state that extends over more than 300 km of coastline on the north-western part of the island of Sulawesi.
The government, which is an administrative region under a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the pillars of the Central Sudanese economy, especially in the Donggala coastal area.
Nickel extraction is also important in the province, but takes place mainly in Morowali, which is the coast opposite Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia’s Disaster Center, Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
In 1996, Donggala was again hit by a tsunami that killed nine people.
Indonesia finds itself seismologically on the so - called firing ring in the Pacific and regularly struck by earthquakes.
Some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years have been:
2004: A violent earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia’s Aceh province in northern Sumatra triggered on 26 December a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, including more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake, which measured 6.8, struck south of Java, Indonesia's most densely populated island, triggering a tsunami that crashed on the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 struck near the town of Padang, the capital of the western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake, which measured 7.5, struck one of the Mentawai Islands out of Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 metres, destroying dozens of villages and killing about 300 people.
2016: A superficial earthquake hit Pidie Jaya's government in Aceh, spreading destruction and panic when the population was reminded of 2004's deadly earthquake and tsunami.
Not a tsunami was triggered this time, but more than 100 were killed by the collapse of the buildings.
2018: Severe earthquakes hit Indonesia’s tourist island Lombok and killed more than 500 people, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin’s eldest son charged with domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for violence.
29-year-old Palin from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, prevented from reporting domestic violence, and for resisting arrest, according to the report issued on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, he took the phone from a female acquaintance when she tried to report the alleged crime.
Palin's in custody at the Mat-Su Pretoral Facility with a security deposit of $500, reports KTUU.
He was brought to trial on Saturday, where he declared himself "clearly not guilty", reports the network.
Palin is charged with three Class A offences that could lead to a prison sentence of up to one year and a fine of $250,000.
He has also been charged with a Class B offense, which can lead to a single day sentence in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with crimes.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is currently under consideration at Alaska's Veteran's Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstructing the reporting of a violent crime in the home, as well as the possession of weapons in an affected state in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of slapping her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticised by veteran groups after explaining his son's violent behaviour with PTSD as a result of his secondment to Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake on Friday hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
The earthquake measured 7.5 and triggered a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of homes.
The area is without electricity and communication routes, and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just south of central Sulawesi, which is northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
On the social media, videos are circulating that show the moment when the earthquake hits.
Hundreds of people were gathered for a beach party in the town of Palu, when the tsunami burst on the coast.
Public prosecutors are trying to get the terrorist suspect in NYC sentenced to a rare death penalty.
Public prosecutors are trying to get the death penalty imposed on Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of the terrorist attack in New York City, which killed eight people – a rare punishment that was last sentenced to a crime in the state in 1953.
In October, 30-year-old Saipov reportedly used a rental car from the Home Depot construction market to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where pedestrians and cyclists who got in the way were mowed down.
As the basis for the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov 'intentionally' killed the eight victims and 'intentionally' caused serious personal injury.
According to the court document, the death penalty is a possible result of both these charges.
Several weeks after the attack, a state jury was able to present Saipov with a 22-point indictment, including eight charges of murder in the case of gangster activity, typically used by public prosecutors in organised crime cases, and an accusation of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for "extensive planning and preparation," said the prosecutors and described Saipov's execution as "absolute, vicious and depraved."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, bodily injury and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," states in the Memorandum of Understanding.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since New York's southern district last raised the defendant in a death penalty case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers, but ended up in a life-long prison sentence in September 2009.
The death penalty was most recently sentenced to death in a state case in New York City in 1953, when Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of espionage on behalf of the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov was born in Uzbekistan and, according to legal documents, showed no signs of remorse in the days and months following the attack.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he was comfortable with his actions.
According to the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to commit the attack by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked to have the ISIS flag hung up in his hospital room, told the officers.
He has denied himself guilty of the 22 points of the indictment.
David Patton, one of Saipov's public defenders, announced that they were "disappointed of course" by the decision of the prosecutors.
"We believe that the decision to go after the death penalty and not accept a confession and a life-long prison sentence without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of all those involved," said Patton.
Saipov's defenders had previously asked the prosecutors not to go after the death penalty.
Conservative minister believes that NIGEL FARAGE should take over the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the people's army" during a demonstration at the Conservative meeting today.
The former Ukip leader said that politicians had to be able to "mark the pressure" from the Eurosceptics – after one of Theresa May's own ministers had said that Farage should take over negotiations with the EU.
The Conservative MEP, Peter Bone, stated at the Birmingham demonstration that Britain would have 'been out now' if Farage had been a Brexit negotiator.
May's challenge to bring about unity in the deeply divided party is underlined by the fact that conservative remainers are taking part in a separate demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to keep his compromise plan on track during attacks by both the brexiteers, the remainers and the EU.
Her allies insist that, despite the setback, she will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels – thereby forcing the Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package or "chaos".
At the demonstration Leave Means Leave in Solihull, Bone announced that he was going to scrap the Chequers plan.
He explained that one should have included Farage and put him in charge of the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were in charge, we would have been out by now," he said.
The minister from Wellingborough added, "I'm going to fight for Brexit, but we're going to scrap Chequers."
On the background of his EU opposition, he said: "We did not fight world wars to be anyone's subordinates.
We will determine our own laws in our own country."
Bone rejected that public opinion should have changed since the 2016 vote: "That the British people should have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely wrong."
The Conservative Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns was also at the demonstration and told the journalists: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers Plan is unpopular in the general public, the opposition does not vote for it, it is unpopular in our own party and among our activists, who are actually on the street and have us elected.
Now drop Chequers and start listening.'
As a pointed remark to May, she added: "Premier Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Farage told the procession that politicians should be able to 'touch the pressure' if they fail the decision of the 2016 vote.
"Now it is a matter of trust between us – the people – and our political class," he said.
"They will betray Brexit, but we are gathered to tell them that we will not let them get away with it."
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: "You must make sure that the political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, can feel the pressure.
"We mobilise the people's army here in the country that gave us the victory in Brexit, and we will not stop until we become an independent, self-governing and proud Britain."
Meanwhile, remainers marched through Birmingham before a two-hour parade in the city centre.
Spreading activists waved with Conservative Mod Brexit banners after the formation of the group this weekend.
The Labour colleague Lord Adonis made a mockery of the security problems of the Conservative Party app before the meeting.
"These are the people who claim to be in control of the IT systems and technology for Canada, for border controls, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he said.
"This is ridiculous.
There's no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren "considers strongly" running for president.
Member of the House of Representatives Senator Elizabeth Warren "considers strongly to run for president" after the mid-term elections in November.
According to Boston Globe, the Massachusetts Democrat talked about his future during a city council meeting last Saturday in Western Massachusetts.
Warren, who has often criticised Donald Trump, will try in November to obtain re-election against the state Republican candidate Geoff Diehl, co-chairman of Trump's Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
It's been wondered if she would challenge Trump in 2020.
The meeting in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with the voters at City Hall since Trump took over the office.
One contestant asked her if she was planning to run for president.
Warren replied that it is time that "women go to Washington to repair our political system, and that requires a woman in front."
Arrest in case of LSU's Sims shooting.
The Baton Rouge police, Louisiana, reported on Saturday that a suspect was arrested on Friday for the shooting of Wayde Sims, the LSU basketball player.
The Baton Rouge police reported that 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson had been arrested on Friday at an ET news meeting at 11 a.m.
They had released a video of the shooting on Friday to ask for help identifying a man on the footage.
20-year-old Sims was shot and killed near Southern University early Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and died of the injuries," said Chief Murphy J. Paul, according to medium 247sports.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed to being present in possession of a weapon and to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any problems and is now in the custody of the East Baton Rouge District police.
Sims was a two-metre high third-year student who grew up in Baton Rouge. Last season he played 32 matches, started inside in ten and played an average of 17.4 minutes and made 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per match.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is close to the World Championship, following team orders giving him victory over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team's orders would play a decisive role in the race.
From the leading position, Bottas got off to a good start and was close to pulling Hamilton off when he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel rode in the pit as the first, and let Hamilton fight the traffic in the back of the field, which should have been crucial.
The Mercedes-car went in the pit a bit later and got out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came back in front when the Ferrari-driver after some wheel contact reluctantly had to leave the inner lane after a double defense at the third turn.
Max Verstappen started from the back row and was number seven after the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then took the lead in much of the race when, in an attempt to finish quickly, he failed to change tires to take Kimi Raikkonen’s fourth place.
He had to walk in the pit at 44th lap, but could not speed up the last eight laps, so Raikkonen secured fourth place.
"It's a difficult day because Valtteri made it amazing all weekend and really was a gentleman when he let me through.
The team did an incredible job to secure both first and second place," Hamilton said.
Really bad body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at an election meeting last Saturday because she insisted that she had not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
At an electoral meeting in West Virginia, the President did not refer directly to the testimony given by Ford before the American Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead said that events in the Senate showed that people were "wicked and vile and dishonest".
"The one thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate when you see the anger when you see people who are angry and vicious and disgusting and dishonest," he said.
"When you look at statements and leaks, and they say, "Oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak that?
Remember her answer... was it you who leaked the document – "Oh, uh, what?
No, no.
I haven't leaked anything."
Hey, wait a minute.
No, we haven't leaked anything," he added in an imitation of the senator.
Feinstein received the letter about Ford's accusations against Kavanaugh back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September – but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
"I haven't hidden Dr. Ford's accusations, and I haven't leaked her story," said Feinstein to the committee according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep the letter confidential, and I have."
But her denial was not well received by the president, who during Saturday's election meeting said: "I tell you, it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
During the President's continued defence of the nominee judge of the Supreme Court, who has been accused of sexual assault by three women, Trump suggested that the Democrats use the accusations to benefit their own cause.
"They shun no means in their efforts to take back power.
You can see the meanness, the disgustingness, they don't care who they have to drum to gain power and control," said the president according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars v Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars made amends after Friday's lost Elite League match against the Belfast Giants by winning the return match 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
Giants quickly got ahead with two targets of attacks by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie evened out at home before Dwyer brought the Giants back in front.
Francois Bouchard offset for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory with two more goals.
It was the season's third Elite League defeat for Adam Keefe's team, who came from behind to beat Dundee 2-1 on Friday's game in Belfast.
It was the season's fourth meeting between the sides, where the Giants went out as victors in the three previous battles.
Dwyer started out in the fourth minute at 3:35 from an assistant from Kendall McFaull with David Rutherford as his assistant when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In a busy leading period Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt was behind Cownie's equalisation at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants got ahead at the first break when he made his second goal at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped, and Bouchard again offset with a nice goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran worked together to help Nielsen lead Dundee ahead for the first time in the game late in the second period, and he secured the victory with the team's fifth goal halfway through the last period.
Giants, who have now lost four out of their five games, are home in Milton Keynes for their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller died to ensure that hundreds of air passengers avoided earthquakes
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is hailed as a hero after he died to ensure that a plane with hundreds of passengers came down safely on the ground.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake last Friday hit Sulawesi Island and triggered a tsunami.
Powerful aftershocks still ravage the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung's colleagues fled for their lives, he refused to leave his place in the swaying control tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed back in his seat to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was held on the runway, was safely airborne.
He jumped out of the control tower because he thought it was about to collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said according to the Australian ABC News that his decision may have saved hundreds of lives.
We got a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to take him to a major hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter got to Palu.
"We're devastated," he added.
The authorities fear that the death toll may reach several thousand, and the country's disaster preparedness announces that there is limited access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"The death rate is expected to rise because there are still many corpses in the ruins, and it is not possible to reach them," said spokesperson Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Up to 20 feet [6 m] high waves have destroyed Palu, which holds a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft fly in relief and supplies.
The 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, said to Sky News: "Every minute a new ambulance comes with more bodies.
There is a lack of clean water.
All the stores are looted."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is working hard to help the survivors, but we do not know what we are getting at.
It's already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the country's military: "I ask you all to work round the clock to perform all tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" he said according to CNN.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombrok earlier this year, where more than 550 people died.
Flight crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that a man is missing after the plane crash in the lagoon
The airline behind the plane that crashed into the lagoon in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia now says that a man is missing, even though it had previously announced that all 47 passengers and crew members had been evacuated from the sinking plane.
According to a press release, Air Niugini says that Saturday afternoon could not locate a male passenger.
The airline announced that it cooperated with local authorities, hospitals and police to try to find the man.
The airline has not returned to requests for more information about the passenger, e.g. age and nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and the crew after the plane hit the water during landing at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline says that six passengers stayed in the hospital until Saturday and that they were all in stable condition.
It is still not clear what caused the crash and the exact sequence of events.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both state that the plane landed in the lagoon in front of the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane flew past the airstrip.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed in very low water.
"That was really lucky," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and other passengers could go in water to life to get to the emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said that the crew panicked and shouted and that he had suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy stated that sailors working to renovate a nearby quay also helped in the rescue work by using a rubber boat to carry people ashore before the plane sank at about 30 meters depth.
Data from Aviation Safety Network shows that 111 people have died in accidents with PNG-registered airlines over the past two decades, but Air Niugini has not been involved in these accidents.
Analyst establishes the timeline for the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecution closed his evidence on Saturday during the appeal for a man accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
Analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, testified for several hours as an expert witness in data analysis.
He described to the jury how he used telecommunications to aggregate the events of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers the night she died.
Rowlett said that he got location data from several different cell phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which was contrary to his previous claims, writes The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was close to Chambers' cell phone at the time when he had claimed that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police visited Sanford.
Sanford sat on the witness stand on Saturday and told me he was out of town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said that he "loy because my truck was in Nashville".
Another disagreement was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The cellular data showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers' death, Tellis had erased Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact details from his phone.
"He erased her from his life," said Hale.
The defense is scheduled to begin its proceedings on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the jury to decide later that day.
The High Breed: What is political hip-hop?
A hiphoptrio would like to challenge the negative view of the genre by giving their music positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol believes that hiphop has moved away from its origins with political messages and social problems.
They will return to the starting point and make political hip-hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently been given a revival in Britain because of artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
Nana in New York sues couples after firing with "racist" text message
A nanny in New York sues a couple for discriminatory dismissal after being sent a text message by mistake from the mother who complained that she was "another black person".
The couple denied that they were racists, but compared the lawsuit to "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two, expressed her dismay at finding out that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black when she showed up on her first working day in 2016.
"NEEEEEEOJ, NOT YET A BRIEF PERSON," wrote Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Giselle Maurice, even twice.
When she discovered her mistake, Plasco-Flaxman fired Giselle Maurice and said that their former nanny, who from African-American, had been poor at her job and that she was expecting a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Giselle Maurice was paid for her one day's work and sent home in an Uber.
Now Giselle Maurice sues the couple for compensation for the layoff and compensation for $350 a day for the six months she should have lived with the family, even though this was agreed without a contract.
"I'd like to show them that you can't afford to do something like that," she said to the newspaper on Friday and added, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple have defended themselves by saying that they are not racists and that the sacking of Maurice was justified because they were afraid that they would not be able to trust her after insulting her.
"My wife had come to send her something that she wouldn't have said.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," Joel Plasco said to The Post.
"But would you leave your children to someone you had been rude to, even if it had happened by mistake?
Your baby?
Come on.
Plasco compared the lawsuit with "extortion" and that his wife had given birth two months earlier and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Do you really go after someone like that?
That's not very friendly," added the investment advisor.
Although the trial is still in progress, the People's Court has already written off the couple on social media and shamed their behaviour and logic.
New letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared that readers could not relate to a talking bear
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was admitted for publication, said about the letter: "It is hard to imagine being the one who reads it for the first time before it was published.
It's pretty fun to read now, knowing how popular Paddington got."
She said that her father, who worked as a cameraman on the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book on a small tavern, would have been optimistic even though his story was rejected and that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was "bitterly sweet" after his death last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important part of our family" and says that her father in all modesty was proud of his success.
"He was a quiet man, and he didn't like to brag," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it almost felt like you had a child who achieved something: you're proud of them, even though it's not really your fault.
I think he saw Paddington's popularity that way.
Even though it was his work and his imagination, he used to say it was Paddington's fault."
Saying goodbye to dying daughter over the phone
After landing her daughter was taken to Hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nade called at regular intervals to say that it was really bad and that she probably didn't survive," said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad that she would die in the next few minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
So I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, baby.
I'll see you soon.
I'll see you later.
The medication she had been given to keep her heart going slowly lost its effectiveness.
She was dead a short time before, and now her body shut down.
I just had to sit there and wait for it to happen.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to try to pull myself together."
Finally, the grieving Ednan-Laperouse boarded the plane with the other passengers who had no idea what she was going through.
"Nobody knew," she said.
"I bent my head, and the tears kept running.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane, I had an overwhelming sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Griefing Women Trying to Stop Suicide Shoppers
Two women who have lost relatives to suicide try to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have placed maps on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers where you can get help.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old when he suffered depression and 18 when he committed suicide.
"I don't want any parent to experience the grief I live through every day," she said.
45-year-old Sharon Davis said her son was a promising chef with an infected smile.
"His smile was known to everyone.
People said his smile lit up the room."
However, he stopped working before he died because he felt really bad.
In 2014, it was Tyler's 11-year-old brother who found him when he had taken his life.
Sharon Davis said, "I'm always afraid it's gonna spread."
Sharon Davis made the cards to tell people there's someone out there you can contact and talk to, even your friends.
Don't go with your thoughts yourself – you have to talk to someone."
Sharon Davis' long-time friend, Kelly Humphreys, lost his girlfriend for 15 years, Mark, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say anything about him being sad or depressed or anything," she said.
"Some days before Christmas he began to change.
He was really down on Christmas Day, and when the kids opened their presents, he didn't have eye contact with them at all."
She said that his death was very traumatic for them, but that they have to get through it: "It has created a hole in our family.
It's torn us apart.
But we all have to keep fighting."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is still unclear, while the FBI begins investigation.
"I thought that if we could actually get something like what he asked for – a limited-time study – we might get a bit of agreement," said Flake last Saturday and added that he feared that the committee "falled away from the hind" in the middle of the locked partisan situation.
Why would Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to conduct their investigation?
Their restraint is due to the timing.
The mid-term elections are only five weeks away, on 6 November, and if the Republicans, as expected, do badly, they will be weakened in their efforts to get the man they want elected to the highest judiciary in the country.
George W. Bush has called senators to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and thus met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI completes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still not known whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would give Vice President Mike Pence the decisive vote and elect him to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors 'falls' under Kim Jong-un
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug referred to data from South Korea’s Department of Reconciliation and said there were 1,127 defectors last year compared to 2.706 in 2011.
Park mentioned that stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher figures due to human traffickers contributed to the changed figures.
Pyongyang has not made any official comments.
The vast majority of defectors from North Korea are eventually offered citizenship in South Korea.
South Korea's government says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most people flee via China, which has the longest border adjacent to North Korea and which is easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarised zone between North and South Korea.
China considers the defectors to be illegal immigrants and not refugees, so they are often sent home for forced repatriation.
The relationship between North and South Korea – which is technically still at war – has improved significantly over the last few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to talk about the stranded negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This is after the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed to work towards an overall nuclear-free Korea.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress.
"Without confidence in the United States there is no faith in our national security, and in such circumstances it is out of the question that we will disarm on our own," Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he's unfit for the Supreme Court.
President of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called Brett Kavanaugh, nominated to the Supreme Court judge, "hysterical" and said that his temperament was not suitable for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi’s comment came in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman had behaved that way, they would have called her hysterical," said Pelosi about his reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally dismissed the allegations that he had committed a sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In his opening speech Kavanaugh was very emotional, and when he talked about his family and his years in high school, he almost shouted and was about to cry.
He also condemned the Democrats in the committee and called the accusations against him "grey and coordinated courage of character" organised by the Left, who was angry that Hillary Clinton did not win the presidency in 2016.
Pelosi said that she believed that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not sit in the Supreme Court because it showed that he was biased towards the Democrats.
"I think he has disqualified himself with the statements and the way he went after Clinton's and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi dodged when she was asked whether she would try to bring Kavanaugh before a impeachment if he was confirmed and if the Democrats were to have a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I would say that if he is not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, he is not fit to sit in the Supreme Court, but certainly also in the court in which he is sitting now," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently sitting as a judge in the Court of Appeal of Washington D.C.
Pelosi added that, as a democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions on Obama's health reform or the miscarriage of Roe v. Wade, because he is considered a conservative judge.
During the hearings, Kavanaugh did not answer questions as to whether he would reverse certain previous Supreme Court rulings.
"It must not happen that a hysterical, biased person must take up a job as a judge and expect us to say 'Well, isn't it just wonderful'," said Pelosi.
And women have to use it.
It's a fair outcome, months and years of anger that chamber over, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," said Steinem to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She continued: "I got a lot of support from a woman who was boss, who said that she also cried when she got angry, but that she developed a technique which meant that when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the one she was talking to: "You might think I'm sorry because I cry.
But I'm angry."
And then she just kept going.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are permitted as an expression of anger, partly because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most obvious memories is from one of my first jobs in an office with a preponderance of men, where I often cried out of anger, where I was caught by an older woman – a cold boss that I had always been a little afraid of – and pulled out onto the stairs.
"Never let them see that you cry," she said to me.
"They don't know you're furious.
They'll think you're upset, and they'll be happy they got you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a member of the Colorado Congress of Democrats, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential election campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was exposed in having an affair on a boat called Monkey Business and withdrew as a candidate, Schroeder was really frustrated and came to the conclusion that she might as well run herself as a presidential candidate.
"It was not a very well thought-out decision," she laughed to me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the bud, and they certainly did not need another candidate.
Some called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarves."
Because it was late in the election campaign, she was behind in fundraising, so she promised she wouldn't participate unless she collected $2 million.
The battle was lost in advance.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who gave $1,000 to men, only gave her $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she thought.
When she made a speech about her not wanting to run, she was overwhelmed by feelings – gratitude for the people who supported her, frustration over the system that made it so difficult to raise money and reach out to voters instead of electoral men, and anger over sexism – that she got a lump in her throat.
"You might think I had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalls how the press reacted to her.
"You'd think I was sponsored by Kleenex.
I remember thinking, what are you gonna write on my tombstone?
"She cried?"
This is how the US-China trade war can benefit Beijing
The opening of the trade war between the United States and China was loud, and even though the battle is far from over, divisions between countries can benefit Beijing in the long run, says experts.
US President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year by imposing duties on important Chinese exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The biggest escalation this week of new customs duties affecting USD 200 billion worth of goods is, in principle, half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Beijing has retaliated every time, most recently by imposing customs duties of 5-10% on US goods for USD 60 billion.
China has sworn to follow the United States all the way, and the world's second largest economy is unlikely to give way for the time being.
If it causes Washington to withdraw its demands, it means that they give in, but for China's President, Xi Jinping, bowing down to the United States would be far too embarrassing.
Experts say, however, that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the American pressure in the trade war can have a positive effect on China in the long run by making the two markets less dependent on each other.
"A quick decision in either Washington or Beijing can create a breeding ground for an economy that can get out of control in both countries, and it is actually much more dangerous than one thought," said Abigail Grace, research worker focusing on Asia at the Think Tank Center for New American Security.
Syria is 'ready' to receive refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says that it is ready for the return of the refugees and is asking for help to build the country that has been destroyed by the war of more than seven years.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country were improving.
"Today the situation is more stable and secure thanks to the successful fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to control the areas destroyed by terrorists and is working to restore normality.
All the facts are now there to enable the refugees to return to the country that they had to leave because of terrorists and the unilateral economic sanctions that affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since 2011, when the war began.
A further six million people still in the country need emergency aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian Government would gladly accept help to rebuild the devastated country.
However, he stressed that the government would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that helped support the rebellion.
Europe ensures Ryder Cup victory in Paris
The European team has won the Ryder Cup 2018 and beat the American team 16,5 - 10.5 in Le Golf National outside Paris.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a single Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won back the trophy when Captain Thomas Bjørn's team reached the 14.5 points it took to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had a hard time in most of the tournament, shot his drive in the lake on par 3 at the 16th hole, causing him to lose the match against Francesco Molinari.
Italian Molinari did well in all rounds and became 1 out of a total of 4 players who have received 5-0-0 since 1979, when the tournament's current format started.
American Jordan Spieth was sent out with 5&4 of the lowest ranked European player, Danish Thorbjørn Olesen.
No. 1 on the world ranking, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter from England, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran with eight Ryder Cups in his luggage, Spaniard Sergio Garcia, became the tournament's most winning European with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a hard year.
I am very grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm really glad to get the trophy back.
It's a team effort, and I'm glad I could help," said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He sends the torch to his compatriot John Ram, who felled the American golfing Tiger Woods 2&1 on a single match Sunday.
"I am incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods. I followed him as a child," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a Ryder Cup history of 13-21-3.
It's a funny statistic for one of the best golfers ever to have won 14 major titles, surpassed only by Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had trouble finding the shape all weekend except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who had a solid game throughout the tournament.
The American captain, Jim Furyk, said after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of the boys because they fought for the cause.
There was still time this morning when we gave Europe counter-measures.
We lost.
The hat off for Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
All his 12 players played really well.
We're gonna regroup, and I'm gonna work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and we're gonna move on.
I love the 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to take off your hat.
We were defeated."
Update on algal bloom: Concentrations decrease in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows that there is a general decrease in algal concentration in parts of Tampa Bay.
According to the FWC, spread blooms are reported in the area around Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier – suggesting that the concentration is decreasing.
The flowering of algae spreads over a coastline of 210 km from northern Pinellas County to southern Lee County.
There are smaller blooms about 16 km from the coast of Hillsborough County, but there are fewer than last week.
Resurrections have also been observed in Pasco County.
