No Liberal Novel for Tymoshenko by Parliament
The Ukrainian parliament today rejected the request to abolish, as part of an amendment to the Criminal Code, those paragraphs on the basis of which opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko was convicted.
The new regulation, which could have paved the way for the imprisoned Prime Minister's release, was rejected by MEPs at the second reading of the request for mitigation of penalties for economic offences.
In October, Timoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for concluding an allegedly detrimental contract with Russia on the purchase of natural gas.
The verdict is not yet final, the appeal of the convicted will be tried in December.
Timoshenko himself describes the verdict as a political revenge of the regime and in the West, the trial raised the suspicion of the court’s bias.
The request to remove Paragraph 365, on the basis of which the Prime Minister was convicted, from the Criminal Code was supported by 147 MEPs.
226 votes would have been required for its adoption.
Libyan victory
The history of the Libyan liberation struggle or Libyan rebellion already knows its losers.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
Only the winners have to be defined.
As is usual in this region, Islamists win in the elections, the question is only which - the moderate or the radical.
The National Transitional Council accepted the common law of the Shari'a, of which one now has a certain idea with God.
Libya would become a country without crime, because for theft you cut off your hand in short.
Women should also quickly forget thoughts of emancipation, possible apostates are executed, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator, the Qur’an will unite the society of mutually conflicting tribes.
In short - in Libya, an order will prevail, which in this country would hardly be conceivable and, above all, would hardly be desirable.
Only - our lifestyle is not the only one and objectively not the best and would hardly fit the aforementioned Libyans.
In this way, it is rather strange that the Muslim fighters were even helped by the unbelieving dogs.
To their apology, the only thing that might serve is the fact that NATO’s airstrikes were not led by any general from America, but by Allah himself, whose omnipotence was praised after every successful hit.
The winners in Libya? The West is not one of them.
We only took part in a gunshot, served the interests of Islam, and our politicians got rid of themselves in the person of the dictator of a political ally, without any benefit.
After the fresh and bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we preferred to refrain from a military occupation of Libya.
As a result, the locals are left with a concern - namely the expulsion of the Crusaders.
But will the petroleum companies get black gold at a ridiculous price even without occupation?
Probably hardly and so the West can finally boast of its selflessness in terms of protecting human rights.
Unless the Shariahs destroy them.
The Beginning of a New Crisis Era
France and the rest of Europe in the focus of investors.
On Tuesday, a statistical storm blew through Europe.
The individual countries published their data on their GDP for the third quarter.
The Czech economy stagnated compared to the previous quarter, Germany and France are growing.
The bond market is breaking all records today.
Investors keep an eye on not only Greece, but also Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the European Zone, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries published their preliminary forecasts of economic development in the third quarter.
As expected, Germany's GDP grew by 0.5%, while France's GDP grew by 0.4%.
Both countries simultaneously corrected their data for the second quarter, in which Germany recorded higher growth than originally expected (growth by 0.3% instead of predicted 0.1%), while France admitted a slight decrease by 0.1% (original data spoke only of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent in this year’s third quarter compared to the previous year.
Compared to the previous quarter, gross domestic product stagnated, however, and according to the Statistical Office, this confirmed the trend of slowing growth in economic performance.
The results are worse than analysts’ predictions.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent in this year’s third quarter compared to the previous year, but stagnated compared to the previous quarter.
According to preliminary and seasonally overrated figures, the German economy grew by 0.5 percent in the third quarter.
In the eurozone as a whole and in the EU, the economy recorded growth of 0.2 percent between July and September compared to the previous quarter, which is in line with analysts’ expectations.
The Greek economy shrank by 5.2 percent year-on-year.
The yield from their 10-year government bonds climbed to the value of 28.45%.
The yield of Italian and Spanish government bonds rose to its critical limits.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries are also beginning to feel problems...
Yields on Czech government bonds remain below 4%, even though the situation in the region is deteriorating.
In Germany, voices are being raised that the ECB should become the creditor of the last instance.
Czechoslovakia qualifies for EURO
In Montenegro they won 1-0 and now celebrate their qualification for 200 million
The selection of football has mastered the most difficult task of the whole season!
Thanks to a well-kept goalkeeper <0xC4><0x8C>ech and a wonderful goal by Petr Jirá<0xC4><0x8D>ek, she won 1-0 in Montenegro.
With a great deal of luck, Czech football was able to defend its luxurious advantage from the home game and will once again not be missing in the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the rise game in a detailed report.
Little excitement in the first half and a huge portion of luck in the second.
The Czech selection also won quite happily 1-0 thanks to the final weakness of the home team, a brilliant <0xC4><0x8C>ech's and the hero of the day Jirá<0xC4><0x8D>ek in Montenegro and has thus redeemed their ticket for the European Football Championship.
Due to the precise defensive game of the Czech team, they were only able to put more pressure on the Montenegrins in the second half.
The bad luck of the game were Damjanovic and Vucinic, who shot two huge chances.
Thanks to an excellent Petr <0xC4><0x8C>ech, the Czech selection will therefore participate in the European Championships next year, and it is also gratifying that the domestic football will receive a premium of about 200 million.
From the first few minutes, quite competitive football was played.
Both teams combined for a long time and so mainly played around the middle line.
Also in the second half the pressure of the home team was not and the wide tees before the penalty area were successfully repelled by the Czech defence.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country’s core program.
They formed a living shield.
A few hundred college students formed a living shield around a core object in Iran.
With this gesture, they wanted to demonstrate their support for their country’s nuclear program before a possible Israeli attack.
The students had prayed in front of the building on Tuesday at noon, and subsequently announced the death of the United States and Israel.
A few hundred students from the university in Isfahan, Iran, formed a lively shield around the nuclear technology center in Isfahan on Tuesday, where uranium is processed.
In doing so, they wanted to show that they are ready to protect their country’s core program, if necessary with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently noted in its report that Iran has apparently not given up its efforts to create a nuclear weapon.
In Israel, too, talks about a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Students had prayed at noon in front of the entrance to the complex and then announced the death of the United States and Israel.
In the event of an attack intending to paralyze Iran’s nuclear program as far as possible, the Israeli press said the nuclear enrichment facility in Natan’s target would also be from the center in Isfahan.
The Menu of an Obese Child: It Doesn't Eat Breakfast and Eat Sausage for Dinner
More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 have problems with obesity, with 9 percent of all students and 5 percent of all children being overweight.
Recent surveys have shown - obese children are mostly from families with unhealthy lifestyles.
This shows once again how important it is for the healthy development of a person the environment in which he grows up and the examples that surround him.
On the tables of obese children, sausages are up to half more often on the table than in families where normal-weight children live.
More than 19 percent of the overweight children had fries at dinner on the eve of the education campaign under the motto "obesity is no coincidence".
In families with fatties, exercise is not exactly one of the favorite activities, but it also affects the majority of today’s students – only 15 percent responded that their parents find time for active exercise at least once a week.
Survey of 900 children
The survey took place last year towards the end of the school year, with nearly 900 children from primary schools throughout the Czech Republic being surveyed.
This was the second year of the "Obesity is not a coincidence" campaign, which is supported by the General Health Insurance and the Unilever Society.
So far, more than 12 thousand students from 4th and 8th grades have participated in the project.
Unhealthy diet and lack of exercise in the family are crucial factors that are responsible for the terribly increasing number of overweight or even obese children.
“Only half of the children surveyed, for example, indicated eating breakfast five times a day in the breakfast-second breakfast-lunch-vesper-evening-bread mode—one of the main prerequisites for a healthy diet,” one of the survey results says.
No breakfast and sausage for dinner
Experts point out that even relative trifles, such as the regular breakfast time of the family, are important for the healthy development of a child.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23 percent of the pupils’ families have breakfast.
And - in most families, everyone eats breakfast on their own.
The worst was the finding that in every tenth family, breakfast is not eaten at all.
Breakfast is considered to be the cornerstone of a healthy daily diet.
The survey test showed, among other things, that in the families of overweight children, unhealthy french fries are consumed much more often.
And almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sweet lemonades every day (70%)
While more than 40 percent of the children surveyed do sports, only less than half of their parents do - namely, only 15 percent.
Build your own menu
Another part of the survey enabled selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to assemble their own meal plan according to appetite and opinion.
"What Czech children between 12 and 15 prefer in terms of nutrition is far from the ideal of a healthy diet.
Among her favorite dishes were many flour dishes, meat dishes and of course sweets.
"Alarming is above all the great popularity of sweet lemonades," the final report on this survey emphasizes.
At lunch, the main dish, pasta was just ahead of poultry.
The children almost did not like legumes and the popularity of fish and vegetable dishes as lunch was very low.
Return to health
At the same time, the survey also showed that the children are quite willing to change their eating habits if they get the right information.
"In the control group of survey respondents who completed the questionnaire after completing the clarifying lecture "Obesity is not a coincidence" there was a significant shift in preferences towards principles of healthy nutrition in many cases," is stated in the results of the project.
This was evident, for example, in the sweet limes, where many children began to give priority to ordinary water.
The children also crossed into the questionnaire much more often poultry or fish as the main dish of the day and were willing to eat less dumplings or sweet foods.
Professionals claim - a stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the introductory article about how stylists learn, I had complained a bit that this was a bit too much stuff for the beginning.
I didn’t know at all what was to come.
Lectures by three professionals from the industry, the clothing of problematic figures and a seminar on how "on the pitch" works.
It's got to be worse.
The closer the exam gets, the more information and practical tasks await us.
But even if the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it is still fully occupied.
This time we debated with Director Alena (not a single man participates in the course) how to attract a woman who does not have an ideally proportioned figure.
After all, that’s most of us.
Some have a too short neck, the others a too young figure without decent curves and still others are chubby.
It is up to the stylist to visually hide wide shoulders, to extend the neck or to spell out the necessary curves.
We also got tips on how to dress a woman type like Jennifer Lopez - with big boobs, wide hips and narrow waist - pretty and figure-minded, without making her look too provocative.
If, for example, the difference between waist and hips is so big that the skirt or the pants really do not fit, you should at least have one piece tailored to fit.
You will certainly not regret this, because well-fitting clothes are simply priceless.
In such a tailored skirt you feel much better than in one of the poles that always slides up and down, in the waist, etc.
In turn, young figures can allow themselves to wear clothing with folds, bulges, applications, embroidery or rafting.
With this amount of information and figure types, I am glad that I have a whole week to let everything go through my mind.
And yet I am afraid that given the assignment homework, it is almost impossible to do.
Each of the students was assigned a celebrity, for which she should come up with suitable outfits - daywear and evening robes.
In doing so, we should take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of the corresponding star and its figure type.
I'm supposed to "dress" Miranda Kerr, whom you may know from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
Inside, I cheer, because that is much better for me personally, than for example to put on Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who has recently probably increased to a hundred kilos (well, that is a bit exaggerated), or the young Selena Gomez.
We should cut out the garments from magazines or search on the Internet, print them out and then graphically edit them.
In the "moodboard", as the whole result is called, our very personal style and our relationship to graphic design should be expressed.
It is very important to also think about the graphic side of the styling.
The stylist not only attracts the models purely physically, but also designs the so-called product page in the journals (according to specific specifications, for example trend handbags, coats, etc.).
Stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us about this.
But not until Sunday.
This means that a stylist must have a good overall overview.
The Saturday talk filled with information about figure types was spiced by three visitors from the industry:
by stylist Jan Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, by fashion designer Jakub Polanka and by fashion photographer Ben Ren<0xC4><0x8D>.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and that a stylist should be able to take advantage of it.
And a skilled stylist can work in very different ways with a single piece of clothing.
The magic word is variability.
For example, you can wear a trench coat over the jeans as usual, like a t-shirt or coat, but you can also wear it on the naked body, put on shoes and wear it as a dress.
It is enough to roll up the sleeves or the collar and the whole look looks completely different.
“Play with it,” he said.
But the most important advice came to me: "First you have to know the rules perfectly."
"Then you can hurt her," Jakub said.
Finally, I understand why we have to tinker with all these teachings, what you can combine with what and why, even if you often get to see something completely different in fashion journals.
Not to mention fashion shows.
Thanks to the photographer Ben, I now know that a stylist must have prepared much more clothing variants than he ultimately photographs.
So for a fashion story with ten pages (i.e. ten outfits) you have to be prepared to style at least fifteen.
And also that the clothing in the photo in combination with other accessories sometimes looks quite different than in reality.
All of this is to be expected in the design of the outfit.
That image and style sometimes make up half of the success, this was also confirmed by Jan Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>.
All you need to do is look at Madonna, a not exactly brilliant singer, from whom image and marketing have made a world star.
In the Czech Republic, one is more reserved compared to the services of a stylist.
Even well-known personalities often think this is money thrown out (the main thing is that I bring something what I look like is secondary).
And if one of us can already style, then we should expect that he or she will most likely impose on us a completely different (smaller) size than he or she actually needs.
Then you only have to google to determine with certainty that the tabloid press writes, the corresponding celebrity has again or decreased, etc.
Jan and Mario urged us on Sunday not to believe that a stylist only needs to focus on fashion and then "assemble" the outfit.
In his work, he must first and foremost communicate with the people he styles and he must be a skilled psychologist.
Evaluate people without bidding and standing up to their opinions.
"If any manager orders us to look at her wardrobe and add some pretty pieces, then we can't clear her whole wardrobe and say, 'My God, that's awful.'"
"You have to find at least a few praiseworthy things to recommend what you can wear," says Mario.
He also showed us quite concretely what such a so-called "place bag" must contain.
So such a bag, which you button at the waist and in which you carry all the necessary property.
In addition to such clear things, such as scissors, hair removal rollers or safety pins, it also contains such utensils, such as a nylon thread (this helps the stylist when photographing products, such as handbags or hats), special clips, with which the back of the clothing is picked up, if it is too large.
But so that we not only have to listen, but also to try something practical, we learned how to properly underwear shoes.
Even when photographing in the studio, where the floor is flat, you can damage the sole of the shoe, let alone the outside.
We o glued and glued...
With the scissors you can not even touch the shoes, so that you do not damage them.
So you really have to be clever.
Mario delighted me by praising my "creation" without restrictions.
The aforementioned skill is not exactly my strength.
All this was only a fraction of what we heard on the second weekend continuation course.
One thing has become clear to me in the meantime - devoting myself to styling at a professional level is not a child’s play.
V Need for Speed: "The Run" - the illegal race across America
Review
The original carefree ride is turned into a routine trip to the early shift by a series of completely avoidable, dilettantic mistakes.
It was possible to fulfil the ambitions to a large extent, but what good is that if obviously nobody wanted to do a little more.
Even before he came to the counters, the new part with the subtitle "The Run" aroused high expectations.
He promised to move the already aged game series "Need for Speed" to a new dimension again and in the playable demonstration examples, he actually appeared to be not only one of many action racing games.
We were also curious about the fit-in passages in which the main protagonist gets out of the car and continues on foot.
But as you are used to at NFS, in the end, a lot is different than you expected.
Sure - potentially they are quite decent arcade races, but overall, the game is shrunk by some superfluous flaws that have been present in this series for more or less a few years.
So they are no longer mistakes, but rather signs of a basically incomprehensible laziness of the game developers.
The adventure starts very well.
For the first time in history, the main character Jack has some personal problems; the only solution seems to be to take part in an illegal race across America.
In San Francisco, that is, on the west coast, you get on the steering wheel - with the task of being the first in New York.
The basic idea contains a whole range of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided into ten stages and more than fifty individual races.
This means that each race is held on a different track and that the individual stages take place in a different, sufficiently different and interesting environment.
You don’t have the impression for a moment that the game would offer the same thing over and over again.
Some environments are still very nice to look at, although the technical level of the graphics does not go beyond that of the earlier parts of the series.
So nothing world-shaking.
But the drive through the desert, through autumnal landscape or high up through deep snowy landscape looks visually very pleasant.
Occasionally, atypical elements bring a little variety to the individual races.
In the desert, for example, you are surprised by a desert storm that severely restricts visibility.
In the mountains, you have to be very careful not to get spilled by an avalanche.
By the way, the individual races are built quite well in a row.
Only a few, but they are enough.
For a while you try to overtake the prescribed number of opponents (in principle a classic race), then you have time to catch up (classic race against the stopwatch), then you expect a personal duel with a single opponent.
And then there's the police, who want to mess up the whole thing.
A novelty are passages in which Jack leaves the car.
It’s more about some interactive animations in which Jack runs away from anyone and where the player has to help him by pressing the right button at the right moment.
So nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are far fewer such passages in the game than you would expect (in concrete terms, only three).
Ultimately, this is more to the advantage of the thing, because this element has at least no chance of becoming boring - it is in the context of the above said one of the elements that make the game more varied.
The driving model progresses in the footsteps of the previous parts.
That is, from today’s point of view, although it does not tear out trees, on the other hand, one could not say that it is bad.
If you are looking for realistic simulations, you have to look elsewhere.
But the local driving model will continue to do quite well for an action-packed race, even though you could find better ones in the competition.
Until then, everything is in order.
Real problems only arise after a certain time.
In contrast to the driving model, the collision model is not entirely OK.
It is hard to expect a game of this kind to calculate complicated deformations and collisions, but if you have virtually no idea how the car behaves before any impact on any object, then obviously not everything is fine.
Typical example: In narrow overtaking or passing by oncoming cars, you "strip" the other cars only slightly in some places, but in other, almost identical situations, you get to spin and turn wild pirouettes.
Or the carriage is going to scrap.
Thanks to the restart system, it doesn't matter, it's always annoying.
The restarts are solved in this way: if you have total damage or land far off the track, then the game throws you back to the last point of the track.
Only - in every race you have only five restarts.
When you have exhausted them, everything starts from the beginning.
So the restarts are more like a tool, in case something doesn't work, but you shouldn't rely on it.
But sometimes the restart doesn’t even help, so nothing helps but to learn the critical section from the head.
Quite uncomfortable is that the same things often happen in the same places.
Some curves, for example, you have to go through in a very specific way, otherwise you just don’t fit through.
Elsewhere, you always encounter "civil" cars in the same configuration, whether you arrive first or fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is especially annoying in situations when you see the opponent passing by in front of two cars, but until you arrive there, the cars are already in such a position that you have to turn them around or brake them.
And it does not matter when you arrive there, because everything is designed so that this situation always comes close to your nose.
The opponents have other advantages.
Throughout the game there are a few places where you are always overtaken at the same place by the same opponent and here again without regard to the time.
The most insane is at the end of the game on the long bridge that you pass in the opposite direction.
The opponent obviously has to overtake one here on devil come out.
And if he is in front of you, then of course he takes the view away from you, so that you drive your own car in Klump a few times at first.
Of course - you just want to make the game more exciting and exciting, but this intention is so clear that it quickly misses the pleasure of the game.
And that is a pity, because despite a simpler driving model, the game is overall quite entertaining and in some places so full of action that you almost no longer know where your head stands.
And in principle, it doesn't matter what's "guilty" about it - the concept with fifty unique routes, the arrangement of the races in a way that no boredom can arise, or something completely different...
An unusual idea is also the car change during the course of the races.
You should not miss the petrol stations on the route, because here you can change the car, although in most cases the car you have is enough.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for the urban areas, the strong American limousines for the straight motorways and exotic super sports cars for the technical rides, for example on the serpentines in the mountains.
The task mode (challenges) also goes hand in hand with the mode of the game history - i.e. the races in the individual locations that you know from the history.
Here there are not only medals, but also experience points to win for your own profile, which is common for the tasks (challenges) and the history.
To get to the higher driver level, different items must be opened up: from the car to the backgrounds for the profile.
This is simultaneously connected with the online function Autolog, which compares, among other things, the own achieved results with those of other players and also ensures further collective functions.
One of the other incomprehensible carvings is a situation in the last race in history.
Here you get by car into a subway tunnel (mean roads), where you race on the rails in the dark for a long time (mean roads).
On the speedometer, numbers can see between 150 and 200 km/h (meanway), but there suddenly comes a subway from behind and drives an uncompromising to scrap.
In our editorial office, we will probably argue for a long time about whether this was a blackout of the game designers or whether the authors think we are so stupid.
The technical side is nothing overwhelming but at least the overall visual impression is in most cases quite appealing and here and there even brilliant.
It is all the more annoying that at some exciting moments the refresh rate slows down and this is sometimes quite dramatic.
However, this concerns in particular the accidents with a greater number of participants, where a continuous FPS is of no use to you anyway.
The sound is ok and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an effort to appeal to a broader scale than possible to younger audiences, a soundtrack was created a lá "something from everyone" - but who buys such a game already because of the music?!
Need for Speed: The Run is the best of Need for Speed: The Run.
If the game had not been compromised by the aforementioned totally unnecessary mistakes, we would have been able to maintain with the chest tone of conviction that The Run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But that's how the game looks kind of unfinished.
In itself a great pleasure, but you should be prepared for these mistakes to get in your eyes with the power of airport headlights.

EU Ambassador Vicenová:
The Czechs have the reputation of negativists and Euroskeptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has made the balance between the individual institutions palpable."
I didn't expect such a hard war to burn."
"It will take five or six years for the waves to smooth and everyone to get used to their new role," said Milena Vicenová, Czech Ambassador to the European Union.
In the first part of her lecture, she demonstrated how seriously she takes the motto "Understanding and open about Europe", in which she succeeded in describing the individual EU institutions and their mutual relations in such a manageable and understandable way that she could have envyed so many lecturers at the Faculty of Law of Charles University.
Mrs Vicenová also praised the new Permanent Chairman of the Council of Europe Herman Van Rompuy:
"At first, criticism was raised that he was too inconspicuous - a gray official unfit for such a role, but I have to say it has blown everyone's breath how well he has embraced the matter.
“He’s a person who manages to patiently listen to and communicate with twenty-seven member states and, above all, has clear ideas of how to proceed with the EU.
She then explained the new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy in response to the question: Who is this - the European Union? What number should I call?", i.e. as an important step towards the unification and better readability of EU policy towards countries, such as China or India.
Nobody wants to forbid us our oil caps Quargel
Mrs Vicenová also devoted herself to the agenda in which the European Union lived, lives and plans to live in the near future.
The Czech presidency of two years ago was a success.
The Czechs had mastered the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also hosted the Eastern Partnership Summit.
She described the government’s case during the presidency as a major negative, which severely damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently busy.
In the words of the Ambassador, it was quite hectic not only during the presidency but also during the subsequent crisis, which has not yet been overcome.
And the seven-year EU budget has yet to be approved, which makes things much more complicated, precisely because of the current economic situation.
Whether it will be a lean and economical budget, which sectors of the economy will be given priority, which countries will receive more and which will receive less funding – all of this is now on the agenda.
The ambassador also recalls her own slogans, with which she came to Brussels: "Understandable about Europe".
“If I don’t like something, it’s gray abbreviations, foreign words and technical jargon that no one understands.
As a citizen, how am I supposed to know if in Brussels you really invent curved cucumbers and different sized bananas or if someone actually wants to ban us from the quarrels?
She would have liked to use the soil of the EU to get more Czechs into European institutions.
Europe of two or different speeds in view
In the opinion of the EU ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation for being Euroskeptics, who perceive the negative side of the matter more than the positive side.
The weak representation of Czechs in European institutions is all the more annoying.
This is due to many factors, including the reluctance of our candidates, their inability to write motivational letters and, last but not least, the weak support of the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, it also highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, the so-called V4.
"Believe me, if a Pole or Hungarian comes to me and a Slovak is nearby, the Frenchman next to me thinks, 'Hey, what are you putting your heads together - is that your V4 again?'
According to Ms Vicenové, in the future, the EU expects strict rules for the budget policies of the Member States.
As much more real than a "European federation", she sees the concept of a Europe of two or even different speeds.
“We have the countries of the eurozone and the countries outside the eurozone.
"We have the Schengen area and we already have the institute of enhanced cooperation."
“For the first time, it has been said that only the countries that want it should work together and those that don’t want it should stand quietly aside.”
"There will be more and more such institutions, which will ultimately result in a strong "Europe of different speeds"," Ms Vicenová expects.
In this respect, it also acknowledged the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in enforcing the principle that all issues with an impact on the EU as a whole must be discussed by all member states and not only by the countries of the eurozone.
Brand Story:
IBM enters the second century of its existence
If you wanted to look for a suitable word that most accurately characterizes IBM’s strategy, that would probably be the word “longevity”.
For the general public, IBM is synonymous with technological revolution, known as a modern company, although a century has passed since its inception.
The foundation for this longevity was already laid by her first boss - the visionary Thomas J. Watson sen.
Even he used the slogan that countless global problems could be solved easily if people were willing to think a little bit.
His slogan "Think!" thus became the trademark around which the life of the future giant was to take place (and at the same time the title of the company's in-house magazine, which began to be published at IBM in 1935).
This was also the basis of Watsen’s thoroughly prepared corporate culture.
“For us at IBM, this long-term thinking means a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and succeeded for a century because it remained true to its principles and did not shy away from changing everything else around it.
This allowed us to transform technologies, business and society over the course of our first century.
We hope we can do even more in the next hundred years,” said Samuel J. Palmisano, today’s director of the company on the occasion of the anniversary.
Well-thought-out system
As early as the 1930s, Watson provided social care to his employees – in the same way as the entrepreneur Ba<0xC5><0xA5>a in Czechoslovakia: The IBM people were one of the first American employees to have paid leave, insurance from the entrepreneur plus elegant uniforms as work clothes and a well-thought-out remuneration system for the best innovators and traders.
IBM’s long-term relationships with its customers are equally sophisticated.
From the very beginning, the company was ingenious in talent promotion - as one of the first companies in the world to eliminate any discrimination - and was able to choose accordingly.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan that Palmisan will be replaced by a woman next year at the head of IBM is also - by Virginia Rometty.
She has been with IBM for thirty years, until now she has held the position of Sales, Marketing and Strategy Chief.
IBM has been making so-called online brainstormings in recent years, from which many future strategies and innovations emerge.
No wonder - there are enough ideas, almost half a million people are employed in the company.
An institution with a good reputation
Her unwavering position in the business guarantees the company a strong image, both internally and externally.
“From the beginning, IBM had the concept of an institution rather than a mere technology company,” said Economist, Harvard Business School professor and author of a book about IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems using technology," George Colony of consulting firm Forrester Research added.
As the company itself emphasizes, it is a difference to only be present in the market or to shape it directly through this presence.
IBM - known in the states as "Big Blue" because of its family logo, has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in a century.
It is one of the most versatile technology companies ever - IBM develops hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services in an incredible product range - from servers to nanotechnology.
Of all American technology companies, IBM holds the most patents and five of its employees have already been awarded the Nobel Prize.
His best-known inventions include, for example, ATMs, credit cards, financial swap, barcode or even the floppy disk.
With approximately $220 billion in market capitalization, IBM was the second largest technology company this year (after Apple), overtaking Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
Looking ahead
Not all products and innovations met the taste of today's customers - unfortunate were, for example, the experiment with the own OS/2 operating system, the online service Prodigy or the computer IBM PC jr.
“Business is based on moving forward, so you shouldn’t be emotionally attached to the past,” says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That’s why IBM has no problem building its foundations on different platforms – and if they don’t work, leaving them again.
In contrast to the opponent Microsoft, which basically stands and falls with its operating system Windows.
Promising technologies
IBM’s profits are largely driven by services, software and hardware, with one-fifth of them each.
In 1990, hardware was still the most represented with a share of more than fifty percent.
Since 2000, IBM has sold $15 billion worth of low-profit assets, while at the same time investing $58 billion in the purchase of future-oriented technologies.
In these investments, IBM continues after 2008, when the modern financial crisis swept the world like a storm for the first time.
Here, too, IBM remained true to the legacy of its first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who increased its investment volume in the midst of the Great Depression.
So far, it seems that the company IBM survives today’s crisis harmlessly.
The value of IBM shares has increased by 120% since 2008 and the company’s net profit is growing continuously.
IBM’s corporate slogan is: Everything can be changed, but not the values.
This is also why it can be expected that this flexible giant will also overcome the next crisis.
IBM History: From Cheese Cutters to Space Flights
Founded in New York a hundred years ago, IBM (International Business Machines) initially had a rather complicated name – Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
It was not until 1924 that she adopted the name IBM – originally a brand name for a branch in Canada and South America.
IBM was founded by the merger of four companies whose history dates back to the 1980s.
They possessed technologies such as the famous stitch card clocks for registering the start and end of work.
Charles Ranlett Flint became the architect of this new company, who also held the chairmanship of the Supervisory Board until 1930.
And it was Flint who hired the boss of the competing firm Thomas J. Watson to help him manage the company.
This leader then eclipsed IBM’s founders – based on Watson’s ideas, the company’s invincible culture and identity continues to this day.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as the name suggests, began producing and distributing all kinds of machines for trading - from sausage and cheese cutters to cash registers.
During the first four decades Watson led the company, he doubled its revenue to $9 million and the company gradually expanded to all continents.
Watson was so indispensable to the company that he sat in the chair for forty years, only then he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence and also developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, technicians and computers from IBM helped guide NASA's flights to space - to Mercury and Saturn, and in 1969 also the famous man's flight to the moon.
In 1964, IBM developed the first computer family with the same computer architecture - the IBM System/360 series.
A classic PC, which defined the computer standard of that time, was launched in 1981 under the name IBM 5150.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, but on the other hand, it bought the consultant part of the company PricewaterhouseCoopers and thus fully entered the business of consulting services and services with high added value.
The strategy that IBM has been paying off in the last three years is the concept of a smarter planet.
It embodies the intention to use technologies in a smart way in areas not even planned so far, e.g. also to improve the situation in traffic and in city administration.
In the trading sector, IBM recently introduced the “Smarter Commerce” platform, which is designed to help merchants lead the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
As early as 1932, IBM established a branch in the then Czechoslovakia – the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM <0xC4><0x8C>R also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The Central and Eastern Europe Headquarters is located in Prague, where a world-class research team is also present, dealing with voice recognition technology.
Darina Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová about her unfaithful husband:
Iveta - you can keep this donkey, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová (53) says - now it's over!
After her husband, Josef Rychtá<0xC5><0x99> (53) from the protector of Iveta Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ová (45) became their lover, Darina still remained hopeful that Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and come home.
But now it is finally over with patience and for the rest of her life she has set clear rules.
"Josef can come home, but not more than my partner," explained D. Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová.
When Darina Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová had offered shelter to singer I. Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ová in her own house, she probably wouldn’t even have dreamed of how her husband ends up.
When Iveta moved out and back to <0xC5><0x98>í<0xC4><0x8D>any after 30 days on her insistence, Joseph immediately went with her.
He even confessed publicly that he loved her.
Over time, Darina resigned, even as if she wanted to reconcile with her unfaithful husband - but now she finally gave him the run.
Rychytá<0xC5><0x99> doesn't care who his wife sleeps with
If Rychtá<0xC5><0x99> Iveta Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ová should leave in the future, he will certainly not receive open arms at home.
"He's the biological father of my dreams and if he wants to finish his days in our common home, then I won't drive him out."
"However, not as a beloved, lost old donkey, but as a person to whom I still have certain ties," Ms. Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová said; but she also said that she had already separated emotionally from him and insisted on mutual decency alone.
The fact that Darina has locked the back door to him, so far, Josef bears with dignity.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'm staying with Iveta, that's not going to change."
"My wife wants a paper marriage and I respect that."
"The company continues to run, I take care of the repairs, the garden, the property, I do the purchases."
"I talk to Darina quite normally, only we don't share the bed," said J. Rychtá<0xC5><0x99> (the sheet) Blesk.
If Darina wants to find a new love, he doesn’t want to stop her.
“We don’t sleep together, so I don’t care if she has a boyfriend or who that is.
I realize that it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta, and that's why I take responsibility.
The worst female imperfections: what about you?
When you ask the men to name some typical female imperfections, they invariably shake some promptly out of their sleeves.
Dear ladies, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, in which we revisit a few immoral ones that make the men's blood swell in the veins?
Shopping addiction
Does your husband accuse you of shopping?
Do you need to buy at least one per week?
Do you like to go shopping and can it be a little more during promotions?
Then, in your case, it is really about a weakness.
Some women are at least aware of this and try to keep their shopping lust halfway under control.
But hand on heart, which woman can't wait to stroll through a clothing store in search of a well-fitting outerwear and not try out all of them (in all possible color combinations) in the cabin?
Even though shopping is a hobby for most women, for men it is often hell.
Think about how many times you've told your husband you'd rather stay outside.
Constant dissatisfaction
“Am I not too fat?”
"I would have to lose at least five kilos - should I start jogging or doing gymnastics?"
“Do you like me at all?”
Does this seem familiar to you somehow?
Yeah, yeah?
Then you are probably also one of the women who are really obsessed with what they look like.
That doesn’t mean you should let yourself go, but many men are allergic to it when their wife constantly complains about her appearance.
The stronger gender agrees - with increasing frequency of complaints, women are becoming more and more intolerable.
Order and cleanliness first and foremost
It is a fight against windmills.
Clean windows, wipe tiles and dust, scrub the tub - and this at least twice a week.
Are you taunting your partner, because he once again tramples on the clean tiles with dirty shoes, did you taunt the children, because the just shaved sink is already dirty again and because the glass door on the living room cabinet already has fingerprints again, where the polishing does so much trouble?
If you suffer from this kind of "deviance", then you should know that you must not exaggerate and that order and cleanliness are not the first priority in family life.
This excess of purity can ultimately also damage mutual relationships and, above all, the peace in the family.
Stitching (disambiguation)
"Dirty pants come into the laundry basket."
"Do you really want to put on those old socks again tomorrow?"
"You don't just throw a wet towel on the floor."
If your partner is exposed to such a tirade, you should not be surprised that this brings him to the palm tree.
Of course, this is not bad intentions, they just want everything to be in order.
If the men knew this, then the women might not have had to complain as much.
Gossip and gossip
Some women like to gossip and clatter, whispering behind their backs or even slandering or forging alliances.
Women are focused on relationships, which is why they like to talk about such topics as: who, where, with whom, how and why.
Probably each of us women has a bit of harmless gossip and gossip in stock.
Hand on the heart - this is probably all women's own.
This, however, is not to be confused with clattering ants of the grossest caliber, to whom nothing and no one is sacred, who probably despise everyone in their environment and which represent a considerable danger, especially for women's collectives.
Jágr and Vorá<0xC4><0x8D>ek helped Philadelphia win with their assistants
Ice hockey forward Jaromír Jágr played a big part in the NHL Monday match with two assistants in the 5-3 victory of Philadelphia on the ice in Carolina, making him once again the most productive Czech player in the NHL.
Beneficiary of the overview of the thirty-nine-year-old ice hockey star was in both cases Claude Giroux, who added an assistant and was named the best player of the match.
Jágr's teammate Jakub Vorá<0xC4><0x8D>ek also scored two assists in the same game.
Jágr claimed to journalists after the game that he had prophesied Giroux a big evening.
"Even before the game, I'll tell him that he's going to make a hat trick today."
I kind of felt that.”
"A feeling like that happens every now and then," Jágr explained, after whose action Giroux scored a goal on the first shot of the Flyers.
A little later, the second hit also had "a Czech trail".
Vorá<0xC4><0x8D>ek won the puck behind the Hurricanes and placed it between the circles to the successful Maxim Talbot.
A second before the whistle of the first third, home player Patrick Dwyer scored a short-hander, but the second third then again belonged to the Flyers.
Concretely Giroux.
In collaboration with Jágr, he scored his third goal, after which Wayne Simmonds steered his shot to the fourth goal.
“I love playing with him.”
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the league, but I'm sure he's one of the top three," Jágr said.
"I wouldn't have thought of playing with such an ice hockey player at the end of my career as I do with him."
"I'm very happy about that."
"I cut my game to me."
"All these years in the NHL, my fellow players set their game on me and now the skewer is turning around," Jágr said.
Carolina turned the game into a drama - by the hits of Tuoma Ruutua and once again Dwyer, who prevailed from a penalty shot, it came close to a goal.
Matt Read, however, prevented any further complication in which he was successful in number two against one.
"Pronger still acted excellently in our zone."
"He caught the puck, I took a ride and (Red) moved to more distant posts."
"I tried to hit him and I'm glad that it worked out," Vorá<0xC4><0x8D>ek described the last hit of the game from his point of view.
This victory put Philadelphia at the head of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal Jaroslav <0xC5><0xA0>pa<0xC4><0x8D>ek injured himself in the game against Buffalo and retired in the second third due to an injury to the upper body.
In addition to their experienced Beck, the Candiens also lost their lead in the penalty shootout 2:3.
Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Plekanec was unable to transform one of the penalty shots.
More than the lost points hurt the coach of the home team probably the high illness-related failure in the defensive - the game they played only with five defenders to the end.
"That's bad."
"We only played with a single experienced player, the rest were young players."
"But there is nothing we can do, we have to deal with that," said Jacques Martin.
With every change, one wave of attack after the other and we had nothing to oppose it."
"We should have made the game easier and taken the puck out of our third."
There were still reserves here," said P. K. Subban, one of the defenders.
Czech goalkeeper Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Pavelec withdrew thirty shots from Tampa Bay and thus contributed decisively to the 5-2 win over Winnipeg.
At the gates of the jets, which ended a series of five defeats, five different shooters participated.
Development of travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, there were only five state-approved travel agencies in the former <0xC4><0x8C>SSR: <0xC4><0x8C>edok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
At the time, the travel agencies mainly sold trips to the socialist Eastern Bloc countries, in the West only the elect were allowed.
And so Czech tourists travelled to the Baltic Sea (in the German Democratic Republic - the GDR), to the Soviet Union (Sochi on the Crimean peninsula on the Black Sea), to Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea and to Hungary to the Lake Balaton.
A slight exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when travel to Yugoslavia was also allowed, then Yugoslavia took a pro-Western course and therefore travel to Yugoslavia was severely restricted.
A great paradox of those socialist times was that even citizens of the Eastern Bloc (including the Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel freely within the framework of the socialist countries.
For example, if a citizen of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSR wanted to travel individually to Poland or even to the Soviet Union, he needed a so-called invitation letter, otherwise individual travel was not possible.
Even then, the travel agencies also offered trips to the West, but then you had to accept huge queues or sleep in a sleeping bag in front of the travel agency, or at least have "good acquaintances" in the travel agency.
Even so, things hadn’t gone well.
The so-called foreign exchange promise - the condition for a trip to the West - was only given to "politically reliable" people - the others were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely exchangeable currency, so it would have been impossible to find the necessary financial resources (western currency) for a trip to the West without a foreign exchange commitment.
The vast majority of Czechs therefore spent their holidays in the country, no wonder that the Czechs bought countless weekend houses and datches - a habit that continues to this day.
The velvety revolution of 1989 was followed by a travel revolution by the Czechs.
While holidays in the GDR or Bulgaria were the measure of all things until 1989, the Czechs spent 4.5 million of their holidays abroad in countries around the world last year.
A tremendous paradox, of which one is no longer aware today, is the fact that one could not travel to the currently most popular holiday destination of the Czechs - Croatia at all until 1989, because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
Right from the beginning of the 1990s, the foreign exchange obligation to the neighboring Western European countries was lifted, which caused a huge wave of short visits, especially to Vienna in Austria and to Germany.
The Czechoslovaks simply could not get enough of their trips to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to be there for at least a few days.
For example, the Czech holidaymakers slept in a tent in the park while traveling to Paris, because who would have had the money to stay in a hotel or in a guesthouse at the time.
A typical feature of Czechs travelling abroad was a luggage compartment packed with canned food, beer and permanent sausages, etc.
Another important milestone was the introduction of the freely exchangeable Czech krona - after decades, our tourists were finally able to buy the western currency freely.
Our level of living and thus the average salaries increased, which led to another important moment in 1997.
Due to the increased demand for travel, travel agencies began to regularly prepare travel by charter flights after 1997, making air travel incredibly cheaper than in the past thanks to the ability to negotiate volume discounts.
By the end of the 1990s, Czechs, with the exception of the US, already had currency-free payments with all the advanced countries of the world, making travel even easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of "post-velvet" travel came in 2000, when, thanks to the high demand, the first direct charter flight to an exotic country was completed - to Thailand.
Since then, every year direct charter aircraft with Czech passengers fly to distant sunny countries; this year, twelve exotic destinations are served directly from the Czech Republic.
About 100 thousand Czechs travel to exotic countries every year!
Another significant moment in the epoch that marked our "post-revolutionary" development came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the U.S. lifted the visa requirement for Czech tourists, making our country definitely one of the most advanced countries in the world.
In 2008, the Czechs spent more than half of their holidays abroad for the first time (50.3%) and for the first time in their history they spent more than CZK 15 thousand per capita for a single holiday, including the cost at the resort.
The general meeting should find a new chairman - again a stalemate threatens.
For almost five months, Czech football has not had a chairman and threatens that the successor of Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek at the head of the Czech Football Federation (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R) will not even be known after the extraordinary general meeting on Thursday in Nymburk.
To date, there is no agreement on which electoral code to vote.
And without them, no vote is possible at all on the three potential successors.
Three interested parties want to manage Czech football - Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Paclík.
In June, Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek resigned, urging his colleagues to agree and find a strong personality to lead football in the future.
Only - in the Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek era, the old quarrels between the two association chambers broke out again, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was clear on September 16, when the new chairman was to be selected.
The delegates of the general meeting had come to the People’s House in the Smíchov neighbourhood of Prague for nothing, because the negotiations did not lead to any outcome and it was not just about the election itself.
One could not even agree on who is actually entitled to vote at the plenary assembly - only the statutory representatives or even the officials equipped with a power of attorney.
On this single point, at least partial agreement was reached, to which the recommendation of the Institute for State and Law also contributed, which considers that representation on a power of attorney basis is not acceptable.
However, the disputes over the electoral system continue.
The Executive Committee, too, did not bring more clarity into the matter, and nothing else is on the agenda in principle at its meetings, whether ordinary or extraordinary.
Even though the views regarding the election changed a few times - the neuralgic point remained the same.
The question is: how to proceed in the third round to avoid a stalemate situation?
"The issue is whether to act in accordance with the statutes or whether a completely different model must be found," said Du<0xC5><0xA1>an Svoboda, one of the three deputy chairmen of the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R, who represents professional football in management.
According to the statutory model, in the third round, the candidate who receives the greater percentage of support in the chamber for which he is running wins.
Moravia is allegedly ready to compromise that the candidate who receives the higher number of votes from both chambers will win.
The Czech side, in turn, insists on the condition that the winner receives at least a two-thirds majority in this percentage vote count.
"Then the two preliminary rounds make no sense at all, this mode would question the entire bicameral concept," Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side, which would find it best not to bend the electoral code, but to vote according to the valid statutes.
Surprisingly, Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Paclík agrees, even though it is evident that the statutory electoral system of all candidates is most likely to meet Pelta.
"My wish is that votes be made as far as possible according to the statutes."
"So that no nonsensical substitute variants are devised, as at the last general meeting," said the owner (of the football club) Victoria Plze<0xC5><0x88>, who is running for the first time and in his opinions distinguished himself above all against Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
In his opinion, the new chairman will be known in Nymburk and he believes that the candidates will also work together constructively in the future.
"The possible qualification of the national team for the European Football Championship today would certainly contribute to calming the minds."
"If football rides on the euphoric wave, then the willingness to cooperate is also greater," says the official from Jablonec, who brings the greatest experience of all three adepts and this on both a professional and regional level.
Rajchl is more restrained.
"I hope for an agreement, but the situation is unfortunately ambiguous."
"This is not a matter between the people of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are some efforts to 'bend' the regulations for their own purposes."
"Therefore, a renewed blockage at the Annual General Meeting is not excluded."
"I hope, however, that common sense ultimately triumphs," Rajchl said.
Only - a lot of time to agree on all sides is not left.
Some negotiations are supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows if the football genericity will be complete at all until the qualifying game.
The charter plane, with which, among others, Dalibor Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era and Rajchl were to fly to Podgorice, was not able to take off in the morning in Prague due to a technical failure and so one feverishly searched for a replacement variant, as one can still bring a part of the executive committee to the venue of the barrage.
At the end of the day, the meeting at ministerial level, which is supposed to take place on Wednesday, is decisive.
Josef Dobe<0xC5><0xA1>, the Minister of Education, Youth and Physical Education, would have liked to persuade the split parties within the country’s largest sports federation to reach an agreement.
There is a lot at stake: government subsidies, the trustworthiness of Czech football and also the upcoming general meeting of <0xC4><0x8C>STV, which is to show the Czech sport the new direction after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclík goes into battle for the position of chairman because he sees no suitable candidate
If Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Paclík, the head of the Pilsner footballers, had been able to identify a strong candidate before the Extraordinary General Meeting, who would have fulfilled all his ideas about the new chairman of the Football Federation of the Czech Republic (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R), he would not have entered the fight for this top position at all.
"If there was a good candidate, I would fight for him and give up the election."
"But in the current situation, we have not been able to find such an adept," Paclík <0xC4><0x8C>TK said.
So the main reason for Paclík to go into a duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl is to prevent the alleged favourite of the election, Pelta, from reaching the top of the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R.
Paclík also stresses that in the event of his victory, he will only intend to exercise the function of Chairman for one year, i.e. until 2013, until the date of the Annual General Meeting.
In the position of chairman, he would have liked to see an experienced top manager who is not too much involved in football.
"I spoke to some people in person."
“It’s hard to believe that some people told me they didn’t want to identify with Czech football right now.
"Such views would have liked to have changed," he said.
Most of all, Paclík allegedly disturbs Pelta's connection with the chairman of the Pilsner district football association Roman Berbr, a man of controversial reputation who is regarded behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist, with the ability to influence delegate votes at general meetings.
For this reason, it is unacceptable for Paclík that Pelta should hold the chairmanship.
"With his victory, the current state would be preserved and Czech football would not progress at all."
"The support of Berbr, a clever businessman, would be twice as bad for football," Paclík said.
He also alludes to the fact that Pelta's name fell some time ago in connection with telephone interrogations to investigate a corruption affair, but from which Pelta emerged impunity.
"I don't know what prestige Pelta's victory should bring to football."
"And how would we be in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said <0xC5><0x99>ekl Paclík, who said his previous statement, "he will sell the Pilsner football club if Pelta becomes chairman," but sees something more serenity.
If Paclík wins in the Thursday elections, however, he could well imagine a future cooperation with Pelta.
The same is true of another candidate – Rajchl, whom Paclík had supported before the Annual General Meeting in October, which ended with a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I would go to."
"He has great abilities".
"I could imagine him as head of the national team, for example."
"But I don't think he's able to run the association as a manager."
"I don't put my nose in matters that I don't understand," Paclík said, who had caused a stir in September that he was behind the dismissal of the arbitrator commission with Lu<0xC4><0x8F><0xC4><0x9B>k Macela at the top, which Dagmar Damková replaced.
Paclík himself claims that he feels fit for the role of chairman of the association.
And he relies on his skills in the management of private companies, since last summer he is also head of Pilsen, which with his support celebrated the first triumph in the league in May.
"I have the power to change something in the football environment and contribute to a certain cultivation of this."
"To limit the influence of certain stakeholders, who tend to influence disciplinary and vocational commissions, which degenerates into disgusting situations," Paclík said, noting that his antipathy, for example, towards Sparta chief Daniel K<0xC5><0x99>etínsk<0xC3><0xBD>, does not hide.
One of his priorities was the strengthening of relations between the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which he would lobby political leaders for more money from the lottery tax to the sport.
"This is one of the crucial things the new chairman should be devoting himself to."
"When it comes to taxing gambling, as the political parties declare, then I understand their argument, but they also have to say clearly where the money is going," he said.
His association with the Pilsner club also does not see Paclík as a handicap, although he himself stresses that the chairman of the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R must be "bipartisan".
Pelta in turn is connected with Jablonec, Rajchl with Prague Dukla.
“That’s not exactly ideal.”
"In my opinion, however, it doesn't make much sense to transfer my shares in the Pilsner club to a third person in hypocrisy, in order to return after a year and a half," Paclík explained.
Pelta promised new statutes of the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R, which will rule out a stalemate situation in the future.
Two days before the general meeting of the football association, one of the candidates for the chairmanship, Miroslav Pelta, promised that if he was elected, he would push for the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R to get new statutes, which in the future would exclude disputes about the electoral code from the outset.
The official from Jablonec is confident before the Thursday hearing in Nymburk and believes that the election campaign will certainly defuse in the event of a possible success of the Czech election.
Pelta had already promised before the unrealized election in September that he would focus on the national team and the acquisition of funds in the event of his election.
At the last moment, he decided to participate in the election before the last Annual General Meeting, so the two-month break would help him defend his ideas about how to run football and present them in a broader context.
"People at all levels are dedicated to football, they are impatient and therefore expect the chairman to be known on Thursday."
"He feels that it is high time that the federation was headed by someone," says the man, who is mainly associated with the Jablonecer club, but who also worked for many years at Sparta and on the executive committee.
This is also why he believes that he has sufficient experience to lead Czech football.
He is convinced that the euphoria that prevailed at the time of Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek is responsible for today’s problems with the election.
"Unfortunately, at the Annual General Meeting in June, statutes were endorsed that were not as perfect as everyone had adopted.
If they had not allowed different interpretations, we would have already had a chairman from September," Pelta said.
It was precisely the revision of the most important document of the Citizens' Association that he used as a means of enticement for the delegates.
"If I should become chairman, I'll take it personally and be willing to take personal responsibility if it doesn't work."
"It's a principled thing without which he can't be," Pelta claims.
Furthermore, he does not try to separate himself from his opponents.
He had previously announced that he could imagine working with Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl, whom he recognizes for his legal education, and he knows well that his opponent would be his first deputy.
Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Paclík also stopped attacking for a long time, which in turn did not leave a dry thread on Pelta.
In football he has been moving for over a year and can already point to certain successes."
"However, his attacks were degrading and many people were shocked by his election campaign."
"For this reason, too, many now doubt his real character," Pelta addressed his opponent, who probably remains faithful to his proclamations, which he already expressed in September.
In his opinion, his strongest weapon is the knowledge of football from the lowest classes to the national team.
And this should be the flagship of Czech football.
“I would also endeavour to end all affairs – from the Bohemian cause to the aftermath of last year’s corruption scandal.”
"After that, I would rush into negotiations with the private and state sectors to ensure sufficient funding for the whole of football," <0xC4><0x8C>TK said two months ago.
At the time, he also promised that his entry into the top of Czech football would not mean personnel cleansing.
"I would first have to familiarize myself with the work content of all employees," he said in the direction of Strahov, where the long anarchy is understandably nervous.
Despite the delayed catastrophic scenarios that accompany the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, he believes that the delegates will not go to Nymburk on Thursday for nothing.
"If it's really the only question of how to vote in the third round, we'll get over it."
“Football needs credibility and it only wins back when it finally has a new leader,” Pelta said two days before the potentially decisive day of his career.
Rajchl promises that the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R under him will start working hard
If the former deputy chairman Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl was elected as the new chairman of the Czech Football Federation at the Annual General Meeting on Thursday, it would allegedly mess up the mood of many people in the association.
Rajchl promises that in the event of his election, you will start working hard.
It intends to introduce system changes and hold the members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to resolve Bohemians’ case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, put more money into football and otherwise continue the work that previous chairman Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek has begun.
“As president, I want to dedicate myself to football as a whole.”
From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, to national selection, professional football, to performance football for the youth."
"This is not to say that I want to do everything alone," Rajchl said in a conversation for <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
"I am a team player and therefore want to distribute the competencies in the Executive Committee in such a way that each member is dedicated to a certain area."
And I’m going to distribute hard tasks so that football progresses by miles in every segment.”
Many would not be delighted because, instead of just criticizing the work of others, they would now have to start working really hard themselves," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement have considered not to run at all.
"I know I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it makes sense and that people are behind me who don't constantly throw sticks between my legs and question every step I take," he said as an explanation of why he hesitated.
“But a lot of people told me that I shouldn’t give up because others would too.”
“That’s trust that shouldn’t be wasted,” he said.
He is also said to be motivated to continue the work he started under Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
“In two years, we’ve done a lot of work and I don’t want to just throw that away.”
"Processes have been started, which probably will only come into effect in a few years and I would not like to see them stop anyone," he said, expressing his concerns that in the event that the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta was elected, the situation could return to the times before Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
"I believe in systematic approach and that's something Mirek Pelta doesn't bring."
“Behind him are people who would make football so that it would only be for the elect.”
I may be accused of some things, but not that I am partial."
“I try to be objective.”
“I want football for everyone because then everyone is well and not just the chosen ones,” Rajchl said.
He also contradicts the claim that he is only a leader of the Czechs.
“Although some people say the opposite, I really intend to do the best I can for Moravia.”
"For example, it's time to consider whether you shouldn't divide the league into a Czech and a Moravian part, whose winners then each went up to the first league."
"Then it could not happen that only three Moravian clubs play in the league today, which is a problem especially for the young players in Moravia," says Rajchl.
Because the head of the Pilsner club Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Paclík has now joined the struggle for the function of chairman, Rajchl does not dare to assess his chances of being elected.
"I feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me as its deputy chairman and now recognizes that clear successes are behind me," Rajchl said, who also sees the savings of tens of millions of crowns for unfavorable contracts, the agreement of television contracts and the negotiations on the lottery law as his success.
On the other hand, he partly blames himself for the fact that the association does not pull on a single strand.
While he says of Pelta that "he is disqualified from the outset to give Czech football new confidence", he considers the second rival, Paclík, to be a strong candidate who really has something to offer to football.
"No one can question that he has done an excellent job in Pilsen in just one year."
"If he were elected, he would probably continue the things that Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek initiated, and he would obviously not fundamentally change the staffing in the commissions."
He certainly wouldn't want to bend things in his favor," Rajchl judges about his rival.
Europe's most beautiful pools
Jumping into the blue
By Julia Stanek
Splash pools in UFO look, splendid pools in Budapest: If you travel through Europe, you can experience its blue wonder - and after a city tour or a hike, rest your tired legs in hot tubs.
A book shows where wellness in the water is best.
When Iris Meder went on a research trip in the past year and a half, one thing was not to be missed in her luggage: her swimsuit.
Laying back on the water, she glanced high into artfully designed domes, swam towards marble puts waiting for her at the edge of the pool, and marveled at meticulously restored Art Nouveau swimming halls.
If she liked a bath, she quickly took it into her notebook - with interesting details about the construction and history of the building.
Architectural historian Meder explored more than 200 swimming pools in this way - and now presents them in her newly published book "Badefreuden": Volksschwimmhallen in Munich, historical bathing palaces in the Black Forest, "hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
She travelled through 13 countries to visit the most extraordinary baths in Central Europe: Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true bathing culture enthusiast.
She doesn’t have much to do with sports, says Meder – only in the water is different.
Annoying just that swimming fans have to deal with blue tiles and chlorine smell, while joggers can inhale the enchanting scent of spruce forests or listen to cheerful birdsong in the park.
“One day I wondered why swimming pools always have to be so ugly,” says the Meder living in Vienna.
"So I started collecting beautiful baths."
Water surface doubles architecture
Smoking in the plunge pool and essential sauna oils - the wellness factor in baths is so great because all the senses are served, according to Meder.
And if the builders have made an effort, swimming halls can be a real eye-catcher: "Instead of a floor, you have a water surface in baths."
"On the one hand it is transparent, but on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything doubles visually: high vaults, colorful tiles, springboards.
On 190 pages, the small-format picture book "Badefreuden" conveys interesting information about the architectural and cultural history of historical wellness oases - but above all, it makes you want to jump into the blue.
Remarkable specimens were discovered by pool collector Meder during her research in Hungary.
In addition to magnificent spas such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, she found a nitrate-containing water in a quaint karst cave (cave pool in Miskolc-Tapolca) and a thermal bath whose pools are filled with alkali-containing water and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jázber).
Spectacular views, on the other hand, offer many heated outdoor swimming pools in Switzerland and Austria: While you have the whole city in mind from the Zurich rooftop bath, you can look at the snow-covered Arlberg in the outdoor pool of a bath in St. Anton - and: In the steam bath there is a window from which you can watch the drift on the ski run.
The perhaps most extraordinary pool design awaits bathers in Längenfeld: the Aquadome <0xC3><0x96>tztal looks like a UFO that has just landed in the Alps.
In winter, it steams from three bowls open upwards, while in the background the mountains of the <0xC3><0x96>tztal valley rise up into the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in every swimming pool, the pool collector Meder got the smell of chlorine in the nose.
Many thermal baths smell of sulfur, in the <0xC3><0x81>rpád bath in Békescsaba in Hungary it smells so strongly of heating oil that you hardly believe to have ended up in a health bath.
The smell comes from the alkali-hydrogen carbonate-containing healing water, which is almost black and whose mucus sticks to your skin as soon as you slide into the pool - a wellness experience of a special kind.
In one place, however, Iris Meder was also disappointed in her search for beautiful bathing spots: When she wanted to visit the outdoor and sunbathing in the Czech city of Bad Luhatschowitz, she found a closed terrain.
The bathroom, designed by the architect Du<0xC5><0xA1>an Jurkovic in 1902, has since been closed.
As Meder looked through the weathered windows of the red-white-yellow Art Nouveau building, she saw weeds growing between the tiles.
The decay, on the other hand, has been counteracted in a magical swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
Three phases of construction have already passed this bath; you can discover not only neo-Romanic elements dating from the time of its construction in 1844, but also a Moorish hall in the Alhambra style, which was added around 1900.
Since the careful modernization in 1995, the Palais Thermal has been the favorite bath of pool connoisseur Iris Meder - and not only because it originated in the Black Forest.
"It is already an achievement to merge such different architectural styles into such a great unit," says Meder.
With such a palace, the dive in the thermal pool is apparently only a minor matter.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank to investigate commodity business
By Christian Teevs
Does Deutsche Bank discontinue its agricultural commodities business?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann commissioned a working group to examine the consequences of speculation for the poor of the world.
In January, the company’s chief executive will draw consequences.
Hamburg - Hamburg
According to a study, 84 percent of Germans find it unacceptable that banks speculate with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or corn.
Two-thirds of respondents even demand that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions leave this business because it exacerbates the problems of the poorest in the world.
This is the result of a Forsa survey commissioned by the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In it, the author Harald Schumann shows that the wagers on the global commodity exchanges drive up prices - and the banks are therefore partly responsible for the global hunger problem.
The consumer protection campaign is specifically directed against Deutsche Bank CEO Josef Ackermann, even if major banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Initially, commodity bets were intended to protect traders against price fluctuations.
But by now, most experts agree that the gamblers have decoupled from supply and demand – and are making profits at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike the US competitors, Ackermann responded to the criticism: he promised to examine the allegations and said that no business is "worth putting Deutsche Bank's good reputation at risk."
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the allegations from the Foodwatch report.
The audit should be completed by the end of the year, and the results will then be presented to the Executive Board of Deutsche Bank - together with a recommendation on how to deal with them.
At the end of January, the top of the bank will then announce the consequences it will have.
In the end, there could be a reduction in the commodity business, or even the complete abandonment.
Ackermann crafts on his image
Foodwatch CEO Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time reiterated his criticism of the financial industry: "Betting on rising prices of food shows particularly drastically how reckless banks are damaging the common good today."
As the highest banking lobbyist, Ackermann is now particularly committed.
"Deutsche Bank must remove all investments from its portfolio where money is used to bet on food prices," Bode said.
"Whether Mr. Ackermann is talking about people suffering from hunger or about the reputation of Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann’s insight is surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the CEO wants to give a perfect picture a few months before he leaves office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the CEO will not be moving to the Supervisory Board unlike planned.
With a departure from the controversial agricultural speculation, he could improve his image.
And in order to make possible losses, he hardly needs to worry - that would ultimately have to do with his successor.
One in two would terminate commodity plants
Foodwatch strives to keep the pressure on the manager high.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization’s campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey, for which the Institute Forsa surveyed 1001 people on November 7 and 8.
Only 11 percent believe that it is legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments that bet on prices for food.
Many bank customers would also draw personal consequences when they learn that their bank is involved in such transactions: according to the survey, one in two would terminate all investments where money flows into commodity speculation.
43 percent would discourage acquaintances from such a bank, 49 percent said they were considering terminating their account and switching to another institution.
21st house in Vienna
The relocated pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architectural history with highs, lows and happy endings: The Austrian World Exhibition Pavilion of Brussels won awards in 1958, became a museum in Vienna, stood empty and decayed.
It is now reopened as an exhibition house.
When swarmed with modern post-war architecture, clear shapes, glass halls, bold swings and new building materials typical of the belief in technical progress, the Austrian pavilion of the architect Karl Schwanzer is a fitting and famous example for the 1958 Brussels World Exhibition.
Schwanzer's pavilion was awarded the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its lightweight and floating steel-glass construction.
The building is still considered a milestone in contemporary architecture.
He made the architect so well known that he also built a pavilion at the next World Exhibition in Austria.
With its legendary BMW four-cylinder house plus bowl-like outbuilding in Munich, it finally became internationally famous in 1973.
Its pavilion, which was planned as a temporary exhibition building, had been erected after the World Exhibition in the Swiss Garden at Vienna's Südbahnhof, rebuilt and a museum of the 20th century opened in 1962 - the "20th House" was called it.
However, the building was neither spatially nor technically suitable as a museum - no walls for hanging art, no good climate.
Nevertheless, it was used until contemporary art in Vienna got a new house.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and has come down more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has rebuilt the pavilion, it is now called "21er Haus" and will be used in the future as a museum for contemporary art.
Tuesday evening, the Museum Belvedere, to which the house belongs, opens the first exhibition there - a fortune in every way.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere in 2007, has succeeded.
Husslein-Arco, a doctoral art historian with a considerable career, among other things in her youth as an ice skater, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as founding director of the Museum der Moderne Salzburg, emphatically carried out the conversion with politicians and monument conservationists, she raised public funds and private sponsorship funds and set the use.
In addition to contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba were to be exhibited by the foundation of the same name, there was to be a café and a bookstore, and an office building had to be built for this purpose.
Strict supervision, small budget
For the execution then Krischanitz was the ideal occupation.
Not only because he sensibly rebuilt and expanded Joseph Olbrich's Secession in Vienna and won the competition, but because he studied with Schwanzer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was for him a "immensely important place" where he had seen the exhibitions "almost every weekend".
He knew the original design, and he knew the problems of the building, which was already lost in generosity and ease when it was transferred to Vienna and reused.
During the current renovation, there were far greater problems: the building was "an energy hurl," says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facade were replaced, glass fiber reinforced insulating glass was inserted and the glass roof was replaced by special safety glass.
Cold bridge steel beams have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings have been refurbished.
Two basements brought space for the new use, a lowered light trench between house and road ensures exposure, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the light Schwanzer pavilion.
The original exterior doors have remained, the house has been painted in the old red-brown anti-rust shade.
And the cinema is still exactly as it used to be.
And all this under strict supervision of the monument authority and with a small budget.
"Often a material had to be found, which is good and cheap and also liked the Heritage Office," says Krischanitz, pointing to a rough floor in the basement.
Despite all the constraints, problems and conversions, the building has remained flexible and light.
“It was difficult with the pavilion coming from Brussels,” Krischanitz recently said, a typical “drop-in-the-city story.”
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "awaken a real consciousness".
In this case, however, the 21st house is not in the wrong place, because there has been an urban development luck: Around the Swiss garden, the completely newly planned "main station quarter", with office and residential buildings, is being created.
And another lucky event may still happen: the 21st house could get reinforcements from another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berliner Temporäre Kunsthalle, and it is heard that she is already negotiating with the city for a neighbouring location in the Swiss garden.
Railway Plans Multi-Millions Winter Crisis Package
The railway has devised a crisis plan to prevent train failures in winter.
The number of employees should be doubled.
It costs millions.
In the fight against winter-related train failures and delays, Deutsche Bahn is spending more than 70 million euros this year, according to a newspaper report.
The "Bild" newspaper reported in advance, citing an intra-group crisis plan, that investments of a total of around 300 million euros are planned by 2015.
This aims to achieve better availability of vehicles and rail networks even in extreme weather conditions.
Among other things, it is planned to double the number of internal and external employees for snow removal on railway systems and platforms to 16,000 people.
The goal is to clear platforms from snow and ice within four to five hours by the start of operation and 90 percent of the operationally necessary intersections.
Two months ago, railway chief Rüdiger Grube warned against train breakdowns and delays this winter after a top meeting with the government and industry.
Last winter, the railway had considerable problems in passenger traffic, as it lacked reserves, among other things, in difficult weather conditions.
For example, numerous new regional trains have been waiting for approval from the Federal Railway Office for years.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
For years, the railway has also been struggling to have axles of ICE trains tested in the workshop significantly more often after an ICE had an axle break in Cologne Central Station.
Deutsche Bank Pays Millions in U.S. Penalty
After the turmoil around boss Josef Ackermann comes new calamity from the USA: Deutsche Bank has to pay a million fine there.
As if the problems at home were not enough for the Deutsche Bank, the industry giants are now also catching up with its past in the USA: The Frankfurt Institute pays $145 million (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>106 million) in a comparison to settle disputes over the bankruptcy of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It is about the sale of mortgage papers.
The financial market regulator NCUA accuses a number of major banks of misleading cooperative banks with false promises to buy the financial products; they have downplayed the risks.
During the financial crisis, such securities lost their value and plunged the banks into depth.
"We are satisfied that we were able to resolve the issue without the parties having to go to court," said a Deutsche Bank spokesman in New York.
The bank was not to blame for the settlement.
The same goes for Citigroup, which pledged to pay $20.5 million.
NCUA Chairwoman Debbie Matz welcomed the two houses.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is in charge of U.S. cooperative banks and intervenes in pleas to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA is trying to get the resulting billion-dollar damages compensated.
The comparisons now made are the first of their kind.
The regulator had also pre-buttoned other major banks and sued JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in the summer.
The mortgage securities in question are so-called mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on home loans.
When the U.S. real estate bubble burst in 2007, this became the fate of a large number of financial firms.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers overturned.
Even though the events have been happening a few years ago, the banks in the US are currently experiencing a strong wind.
Investors and regulators have filed countless lawsuits to seek reparation or to punish misconduct.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the biggest wave of lawsuits.
It accuses 18 major international banks of outperforming two U.S. state-owned property financers, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, in mortgage transactions worth around $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank is also facing a lawsuit from the FHFA, which involves several transactions worth a total of 14.2 billion dollars from 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority demands that the Frankfurters stand up for "substantial losses", without, however, giving an exact sum.
The Deutsche Bank had rejected the claims as unfounded and declared that it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett joins IBM with $10 billion
Financial guru Buffett is investing heavily in the IT company IBM.
Since March, he has purchased shares worth more than $10 billion.
So far, the big American investor Warren Buffett has always stated not to invest in IT and computer companies, as the long-term development of the companies can only be predicted poorly.
Now, however, he has read IBM’s annual reports and changed his mind about investments in the industry.
He had to understand much earlier that IBM primarily provides services and procures computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered a knightly blow in the financial world.
As a result, the IT foundation IBM can now call itself “Sir IBM”.
Buffett told CNBC that he had bought IBM shares worth $10.7 billion since March.
Berkshire Hathaway has become one of IBM’s largest shareholders with a shareholding of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that not even IBM knew anything about the commitment.
He praised the management, which had provided decent profits even in the economic crisis.
“They did a great job,” Buffett said of the strategy.
IBM has been relying on lucrative IT services such as the operation of data centers for some time now.
The more than 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and consulting as well as powerful company computers.
Buffett had previously avoided technology companies.
He says he only invests in companies whose business he also understands.
Instead, Buffett approached a freight railway, a lubricant manufacturer or machine builders.
Its holding company Berkshire Hathaway owns around 80 subsidiaries and shares in a number of large corporations such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Munich Re.
The 81-year-old had taken over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and made it one of the most valuable companies in the world with clever investments.
However, his lifestyle is modest.
He is therefore a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost undeniable sense of making money earned him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha".
After Buffett’s investment became known, IBM’s shares rose by 1 percent on pre-exchange.
"Big Blue," as IBM is also known, is worth more than $220 billion on the stock exchange, making it one of the most valuable technology companies in the world together with Apple and Microsoft.
At Microsoft, Buffett said, he didn’t want to get in.
Bill Gates is a close friend.
The threat is tangible
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer Zelle", Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology" that is now resurrected.
The murders of eight Turks and one Greek small businessman between 2000 and 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
This news is being responded with fear and concern in Turkey and within the German-Turkish population in Germany.
For many German-Turkish people, this is the return of a long-deadly believed ghost: Since the fire attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence against Turks with a right-wing extremist background.
The fact that there is xenophobia in Germany was never questioned.
However, the uncovered right-wing extremist network reveals dimensions whose dimension is far from being foreseeable.
"Is the bloody ideology resurrected?" headlined the Internet edition of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk.
The newspaper "Sabah", on the other hand, stresses that one of the perpetrators was a V-man of the Constitutional Protection, and shows concern that German authorities may also be involved in the right-wing radical swamp.
The Turkish community of Germany reacted with caution: It reminded the victims of racist violence with a vigil outside the Brandenburg Gate on the weekend.
Only two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, had commemorated the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
Togetherness had been staged in cheerful colors – as a story of success.
The coverage of some Turkish media seems like a slap in the eye: "Germany's gift to the 50th" is the headline of an article on the Turkish internet platform "Haber X", which talks about the background of the murder series.
Even the German edition of the "Hürriyet" cannot be taken to draw this mental connection.
"It starts to stink," is the title of Ahmet Külahci's column.
He stressed that people had been murdered, that they had paid taxes and that their work had made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany.
In German-Turkish Internet forums, the police’s actions and their subsequent success in searches are discussed extremely critically.
The authors wonder why the German authorities did not think much earlier of searching for suspects in right-wing extremist circles.
Some are at least rhetorically ready to use drastic means: "If the migrants continue to be sloppy here, then there is nothing left for them but self-defense and armament."
"This will probably be the best self-protection."
“From the goodness of the enlightenment and the appropriateness of the punishment of the entire network depends very much the inner peace in Germany,” writes Selen.
What it means when internal peace in Germany is in danger was illustrated by the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s.
The photo of the Solingen fire ruin is deeply anchored in German and Turkish memory.
For no other event showed more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans that distrust and distance can lead to right-wing violence.
The attacks, however, sharpened the feeling on the Turkish side.
Don't repeat the mistakes of the past
At the time, the Turkish press criticized the failure of German politics after the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the Solingen fire, he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish president, but was represented at the funeral in Cologne by his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel listed in his speech how many levies the local Turks paid.
It's like calculating a person's value according to the amount of his tax dues.
The current coverage by the Turkish media shows once again how deep the distrust of many German Turks in the rule of law has been ever since.
In addition to the efforts to extensively educate and reevaluate the right-wing extremist terrorism in Germany, this time open words are needed.
The scandal bank of Lake Zurich
The most adventurous bank in Europe is located not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS went almost bankrupt in the financial crisis and has since slipped from one crisis to the next.
Now let a German judge it.
That’s not what Axel Weber thought.
After his spectacular departure from the top of the Bundesbank, it was announced in July that he would take on an almost equally spectacular new job in 2013: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Swiss large bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career step.
Axel Weber was publicly delighted, praised Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newly gained solidity, and dropped friendly remarks about the future colleagues.
"UBS has made the turnaround".
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel".
But as early as September, it became clear that everything would be completely different.
A UBS dealer in London had bypassed all of the bank’s security systems and wagered around 1.7 billion euros.
UBS CEO Oswald Grübel, a banker not only famous in Switzerland, had to leave.
Since then, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of UBS has also been deemed to have been defeated – and everyone asks: When will Axel Weber finally come?
It has already been announced that Weber will be able to advise the bank from February 2012.
And he will assume the chairmanship of the Board of Directors as early as May – not just in 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber, it's going to be tough.
He is not a banker, but rather a professor of economics and a central banker and would certainly have needed an induction period.
He then takes responsibility for the strategy of a bank that has once again proven that it has long earned the title of "Europe's largest scandal bank".
Because UBS is huge on the one hand - until recently it was the largest asset manager in the world - and on the other hand has been sliding from one scandal to the next for years.
Nothing, it seems, is spared the once so proud Swiss bank.
It started in the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation.
She had combined the image of the silent and solid, but also sophisticated, Swiss asset manager with ambitious goals: she wanted to become a huge number in investment banking.
In 2007, UBS managed $1.6 trillion more money from wealthy clients than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, as an investment bank, it had advanced into the league of the world’s largest banks.
That made an impression.
The former banker and later longtime banking professor in Zurich, Hans Geiger, tells us: "I always used UBS as a model of a good bank for my students at the time."
"From today's point of view, one wonders: how could I be so wrong?"
He was greatly mistaken.
In 2007, it was revealed for the first time that something went wrong in UBS.
In the middle of the year, CEO Peter Wuffli resigned surprisingly, who until then was considered a highly intellectual and equally brilliant banker.
A few months later, he knew why he had left.
The bank’s investment division had been fooled by subprime papers and had to write off billions.
To support this, UBS announced a capital increase of CHF 13 billion.
For this, she actually found investors, but ones that some would have been whining about until recently: an opaque Asian sovereignty fund from Singapore and an Arab sovereignty fund that was so hidden that they didn’t even know its name.
But that was only the first blow.
It got worse in April 2008.
The bank had to announce new billions in losses, Chairman of the Board of Directors Marcel Ospel, Switzerland’s second best-paid Board of Directors, resigned in 2006.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: UBS faced a collapse in view of its misinvestment in the financial crisis and had to be rescued by the state.
The National Bank bought the UBS for tens of billions of problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion Swiss francs for a compulsory convertible bond, through which it could become a co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shocked - because she noticed how dramatic it is for a small country to be home to such large banks.
After all, UBS’ balance sheet total in 2007 was more than five times that of Switzerland’s economic output (see graph).
"Once again, we could not save the UBS," says banking researcher Geiger.
The first disaster was followed by the second.
A few months later, UBS surrendered in the tax dispute with America and agreed to release the data of wealthy customers who may have evaded taxes with the help of the bank.
She also agreed to pay $780 million as a repayment of unjustified profits from these transactions, including a penalty surcharge.
In this way, UBS more or less openly acknowledged that it had helped with tax evasion.
At the same time, she lost something that had always been her capital in competition for rich customers: the nimbus of secrecy.
After the scandal, Swiss banking secrecy was no longer the same.
This was followed by the resignation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of customer funds.
Within a few months, the bank had lost its credibility in both key business areas: investment banking through misspelling and asset management through tax evasion aid.
And just when things got a little quieter again, just when you thought that UBS was going to make it again, this unfortunate dealer story follows: a single dealer lost 1.7 billion euros before the bank realizes that something is going wrong.
And it turns out: with the risk management in investment banking, it obviously still does not work.
"With the Adoboli case, it has been found that risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, economist and professor of finance at the banking institute at the University of Zurich.
The Chief Financial Officer of a large German bank is also sure: "The problem with UBS is that it has no control over risk control."
It was precisely the idea of the caution with which the Swiss bankers had long ago started to become guardians of the world’s great fortunes: no too great risks, but security for money – even beyond the Alpine Republic, the world might collapse.
The safes of the Swiss banks had become a symbol of unshakable reliability like Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly noble chocolate.
The head office of UBS in Zurich still fits the cliché of the strong Swiss private bank - it is only a little bigger.
Already the location is classic.
The bank is headquartered on Zurich’s Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly from the central station to Lake Zurich, which is framed by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are magnificent, the shop rentals are among the highest in Europe.
Jewellers such as Tiffany’s can be found here among Swiss traditional shops such as the Confiserie Sprüngli.
Swiss banks have been residing here for centuries: from the National Bank to the palace of Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius Baer.
You enter the reception hall of UBS through a heavy swinging door.
Inside, the walls are covered in marble, in front of it are thick leather armchairs, next to the bank logo a large sign for the "safe".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has both Swiss large banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but eventually displaced - or betrayed, as the boss of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, after all, like all Swiss bankers, he also does business with the two major banks.
UBS has become far too big, he finds - especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons had also spread.
The Swiss have nothing more to say.
"And if they do, they have long since adapted to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."
In fact, it was Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS, gave it first high profits and then the debacle: No European financial institution has lost as much money in the subprime jungle as the Swiss big bank.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster became visible.
"On that Wednesday, the government coalition of the small seven-million country decided the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation," writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "The UBS crash."
Up to 68 billion francs, or around 45 billion euros, were granted by the politicians to save the bankrupt big bank.
How could this happen?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem mainly in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks merged into a massive group.
A bank emerged, which was already too big for the small Switzerland at the time of the merger - and continued to grow.
The two different UBS precursor banks helped to complement each other: a rich but sleepy bank with a focus on asset management in Zurich and a poorer, but already more internationalized bank.
Suddenly, the internationalized investment bankers got a lot of money cheaply, with which they could turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with this rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, CEO of UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," says banking researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the highly intellectual, humble, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the belly man who has worked himself up from banking to the very top."
But in the end, Ospel relied on Wuffli.
And Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake in the end: "He thought his models were the reality," Geiger says.
“This is a tragic case.”
Tragic, perhaps.
Obviously, overconfidence came before the case.
UBS employees clearly remember the executive meetings, at which CEO Wuffli repeatedly issued the same slogan: Goldman Sachs to fall from the throne.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
She led the League Tables, the rankings that documented the success of the banks of that time.
That's where UBS wanted to go, to the top.
Some steps had already been taken.
In the foreign exchange business and in stock trading, she played at the top.
Business consultants who were commissioned, however, highlighted a weakness: In the international interest rate business, in the banker's language "fixed income", there is a huge distance from the largest banks.
UBS has gaps in U.S. mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS embarked on an adventure that almost cost it its existence.
Hungry for growth, both the bank itself and a hedge fund founded before it invested in American subprime assets.
It developed into a huge machine that packaged and passed securities on American mortgage loans - but also kept risks itself.
Even when other banks long ago sought to exit.
"Even in the summer of 2007, when the American real estate market was on fire, UBS bought there," says banking expert Geiger.
So great is the euphoria, so deep is the case.
One manager after the other had to leave as the attempts to clean up were more difficult than expected.
Posts at UBS have become a centrifugal seat and are unstable to this day.
Anyone who runs the big bank now has an almost impossible job.
He must find a strategy for a bank that has lost all obvious business models.
Bank researcher Geiger already has an idea: stop investment banking, focus on asset management, return to the Swiss roots.
The bank does not (yet) want to go that far.
But investment banking should shrink sharply, so much is already clear.
Next Thursday, the new banking director Sergio Ermotti wants to present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Italo-Swiss was actually only intended as a transitional solution when the bank surprisingly separated from its predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he has prevailed: he should permanently run the business of UBS, the Zurich bank announced on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to the mid-nineties level.
He cut 3,500 jobs.
But that won't be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is probably asking himself right now.
So far, he has only said publicly that he and his wife will first look for an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe burdens US exchange
The imminent recession in Europe has taken the courage of US investors at the start of the week.
The changes of government in Athens and Rome remained without force.
The throttling of industrial production on the continent stifled hopes for a stabilization of the debt crisis in the bud.
The general relief from the changes of government in Rome and Athens could not prevail.
The euro fell against the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glasses were considered half full last week, not half empty - but now the problems were again pushed to the fore, said Mark Luzchini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
Especially financial assets were on the sales lists.
The Dow Jones Index of Default Values was down 0.6 percent at 12,078 at the closing date.
In the course of trade, the market barometer oscillated between 12,027 and 12,170 points.
The broader S&P 500 index closed at 1251 points, down one percent.
The Nasdaq technology exchange index lost 0.8 percent and went out of trading at 2657 points.
In Frankfurt, the Dax said goodbye with a minus of 1.2 percent at 5985 meters.
The industry in the 17 euro countries has significantly reduced its production and is preparing for the end of the upswing.
The companies produced two percent less than in the previous month in September, according to the statistics office Eurostat.
“We are not an island, we are dependent,” said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe will not be able to free itself from a recession so quickly, and there are further signs of weakness in the banks.
Investment legend Warren Buffett only confirmed this caution: it is not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do anything for an end to the crisis, he said in a CNBC interview.
That is why, in his view, it is too early to invest in European government bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffett threw over a decades-old principle and entered the U.S. technology industry.
His investment of more than $10 billion in IBM supported the stock price of the traditional group and initially put it just under one percent higher against the trend in the trading course.
The paper closed almost unchanged at $187.35.
Buffett has paid an average of $170 per piece and now holds 5.5 percent.
Berkshire Hathaway's stock price has dropped 1.3 percent.
Bank of America shares declined significantly more than the market at 2.6 percent.

Intelligent crows spread in cities
In many places, seed crows are considered "problem birds": But the highly intelligent animals can no longer be driven out of the cities, experts claim.
Some like them, others want to get rid of them very quickly: Crows have been part of the cityscape for centuries, but in many municipalities residents complain about dirt and noise of the animals.
A cure for the "problem birds" is not yet in sight.
Seed crows are no longer available from the cities, experts said at the first crow symposium in the East Frisian empty.
There, experts from the entire federal territory consulted on possible solutions.
You are looking for alternatives in cities
Nature conservationists attributed the problems in cities to the rural exodus of the particularly protected seed crows: the use of chemicals in agriculture increasingly destroys traditional habitats.
Hunting, increasing cultivation and the falling of typical breeding trees made life difficult for the birds.
Crows are protected by nature.
Large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs exist in Westphalian Soest, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Leer.
There, in 2005, a controversial project for the mass killing of crows in the district caused negative headlines.
Critics had described catching the animals in bird traps and killing them with clubs as particularly brutal.
"The normal displacement, the engraving, does nothing," the city and landscape planner Werner Klöver from Leer noted.
Nests splashing away with water or falling trees often have undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals evade, large colonies split up and spread out elsewhere."
Extinction is only conceivable as an exception in hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we can't get them away."
Without the surrounding area, the problem in the cities could not be solved, said Mayor Wolfgang Kellner from Leer.
It is conceivable a combination of enraging the animals from sensitive living areas and lure offers to resettle them in other places.
The psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens, on the other hand, advocated a completely different way of dealing with the animals: "A pimple in the face can ultimately best be tolerated confidently."
Jürgens had co-founded the Ascheberg Crow Teaching Path in Schleswig-Holstein, where signs inform about the life of the highly intelligent seed crows.
The project has already been accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also had his own opinion on criticism of the noise of the birds: "There is a lot of communication, they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: Seed crows not only use tools to get a treat, but even make their own tools as a tool.
Behavioral researchers at the University of Cambridge recently tested on four seed crows how far the intelligence of birds reaches.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to bring down a scaffold with stones in order to reach a moth larva.
Without much training, they determinedly realized what size and shape a stone must have in order to collapse the platform.
In a second attempt, the clever crows had to solve a more tricky problem.
In a vertically positioned cylinder, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a moth larva.
With the beak, the birds could not reach their prey.
However, the researchers had placed wire pieces on them.
From this all four animals formed a hook, with the help of which they then fished the bucket on the handle from the tube.
Three of the four seed crows even succeeded in doing so at once.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal for Euro 2012
The hopes of the Bosnians and Turks for a coup were lacking.
Favorites Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and also Ireland will participate in the Euro 2012.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have solved the last tickets for the 2012 European Championship in Poland and Ukraine in the play-offs.
Led by the double-successful superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd) Portugal beat Bosnia-Herzegovina 6-2 (2:1) and made after the 0-0 out of the one-way game the fifth consecutive European Championship appearance.
The Czechs scored a 1-0 (0-0) in the play-off return against outsiders Montenegro, after already the first leg (2-0) had been a clear thing.
Croatia lost 0-0 to Turkey, while Ireland lost 1-1 (1-0) to Estonia.
Nani (24th), Helder Postiga (72th, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored the further goals for Portugal.
Former Wolfsburg Bundesliga professional Zvjezdan Misimovic with a converted trade mark (41.) and captain Emir Spahic (65.) had shortened twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic saw the yellow-red card (54.).
Bosnia had already failed in the play-offs to the 2010 World Cup in South Africa against Portugal.
At the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal got a tailor-made start.
Ronaldo chased a free kick from around 30 meters to the early lead in the stitches.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his wide shot qualities and hit from 25 meters to 2:0.
The Bosnians, who did not take place in the first half hour, had their first clear chance by goalkeeper Edin Dzeko.
The ex-Wolfsburger from the English leader Manchester City put a headball to the bottom of the latte, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33.).
Jiracek meets for Czech Republic
Subsequently, the focus was on arbitrator Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding.
After an attack against Helder Postiga in the Bosnian penalty area, Stark decided on Schwalbe and showed the Portuguese the yellow card (36th).
On the other hand, Stark gave a controversial trade sweep after an action by Fabio Coentrao, which Misimovic safely turned.
But after the break, the 2004 vice-European champion made everything clear with four goals.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek also finished the final doubts in the 81st minute.
This is the fifth time in a row that the 1976 European Champion will go to the European Championships.
However, the team of coach Michal Bilek with Bundesliga legionnaires Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg) was also lucky and had to survive a second of terror in the initial phase.
Finalist Petr Cech prevented a possible own goal by Tomas Sivok (9th) with a reflex at the last moment.
Montenegro had its biggest opportunities when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic shot in the 40th minute out of the turn from the penalty area limit just past the goal of Cech.
After the break, the cross bar had to save for the already defeated world-class goalkeeper of the Czechs, again the striker of FC Seoul had withdrawn (50.).
The gate just before the end finally made everything clear.
In the meantime, Turkey missed the football miracle of Zagreb.
Four days after the 0-3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb did not go beyond a 0-0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink has almost certainly to clear his place on the bench of the World Cup third of 2002, the Croatians can be delighted with their fourth participation in an European Championship final.
In front of 31,000 spectators at the Maksimir Stadium, the Turks almost got a dream start.
Selcuk Inan hit only the pole in the seventh minute with a distance shot, but attacker Kazim Kazim could not sink the bouncer in the goal.
After the second terror, however, Croatia took control more and more.
Even after the break, the Croats did not let anything burn.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic from VfL Wolfsburg, who made place for Dortmunder Ivan Perisic from the 62nd minute, the Bundesliga legionnaires Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) were also in use.
Trapattoni goes to the European Championships
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated the first European Championships since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward led the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already made a preliminary decision with the 4-0 success in the first leg, in the 32nd minute.
Konstantin Vassiliev (57.) balanced for the guests.
Ireland pushed the pace from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute before Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had the first good chance.
It was only at the last moment that the Estonian back team prevented the possible lead hit.
In the 32nd minute it was done.
After an accidental defensive of finalist Pavel Londak, Ward was on the spot and pushed the ball to 1-0 over the line.

SAP plans to double the number of employees in China
Europe’s largest software manufacturer, SAP, is investing billions in China over the next few years and plans to almost double the number of its employees in the country.
By 2015, around two billion dollars (around 1.5 billion euros) are expected to flow, the Dax Group said on Tuesday.
“We will create additional research and development facilities and employ accordingly,” Co-Chairman Bill McDermott announced at a customer fair in Beijing.
The workforce is expected to grow from currently around 2,500 to 4,500 employees.
The global leader in enterprise software will double the number of branches from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP is present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guanzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
Approximately 4,000 of the more than 176,000 SAP customers worldwide are located in the boomland.
The growth plans in China are also an important component of the Dax Group’s 2015 strategy.
SAP aims to increase sales to 20 billion euros by 2015.
Last year, the Walldorfers had raised around 12.5 billion euros.
Currently, the business of the software provider, which employs 55,000 people worldwide, is running as seldom before.
SAP has been active in China for 20 years.
"Now we want to expand our activities (...)," McDermott said.
“Our goal is to support sustainable growth in China through comprehensive education.”
Mass slaughter on a personal level
Empathetic and generous, Peter Englund's new book "Beauty and Horror: A Story of the First World War, told in Nineteen Destinies" begins with a long list of main characters that goes to your heart.
Here’s a tip on how to do it: carefully cut out this page and make it your bookmark.
You will get to know these people very well in Englund's novel narrative, and these main characters will function as your GPS, as a lighthouse in those few moments when, like Englund's men and women, you are lost in the fog of war and deprived of your illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which determines the Nobel Prize for Literature.
He has written an unusual book, which he notably describes as “a work of anti-history.”
It contains only a few big names, important contracts or famous battles. There are hardly any ambassadors, raging reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It is less a book about what happened, he explains, but rather "a book about how it was". It is about "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods".
"Beauty and Horror" almost includes the war experiences of 20 more or less inconspicuous men and women on both sides of the war, from schoolgirls and botanists to mountaineers, doctors, ambulance drivers and office workers.
Some of these people become heroes.
Some become prisoners of war, lose limbs, go mad or die.
Each of these lives flickers up like votive candles in a church, some are added, while others are extinguished.
Englund's book deviates from the usual history books.
It also corrects the notion that the First World War was only the devastating position war on the Western Front.
"Beauty and Terror" wanders with expert view over other war scenes: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
On the soldiers in this book fall beehives, one celebrates Christmas under the pyramids in Egypt, Tsetse flies are an insoluble problem.
This is almost a moving book from the beginning.
The war floods the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like a hurricane Katrina that smells like Kordit.
Imagine you are a woman who is at home with her children, listening to gunfire in the distance. Do you stay or take the flight?
Who's coming?
Hardly anyone understands what is happening or why this war is being waged at all.
"Missing facts," Englund notes, "were muffled with assumptions, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares, and rumors."
"Beauty and Horror" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor.
Her stories were mainly taken from memories, letters and other already published material.
Their life stories can be frightening or poignant, but they are extremely vivid in the englunds of the losing in detail collection of small moments.
Many of them deal with lack and self-help.
In the story of a German schoolgirl, he tells: "Replacement, everywhere replacement."
"Replacement coffee, wrong aluminum, wrong eraser, paper wraps, wooden buttons."
He tells more about substitute food in Germany.
He describes "meat made from pressed rice and baked in mutton fat (and lastly served with a false bone of wood), tobacco made from dried roots and dried potato peels, shoes soiled with wood."
There were, as he notes, "837 registered food substitutes allowed in the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
An American recognizes his own drive to ferocity and says about the war: "You feel that, despite everything, this is what was intended for men rather than sitting in the armchair, with the evening magazine or the bestseller and a cigarette and a whisky in hand, and pretending that such a facade means civilization and that there is no barbarism behind your own strengthened and hemmed."
Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he is likely to die and that no one will notice or care about it.
“When you take away from the idea of sacrificing yourself, you want to think that this is happening in front of an audience,” he writes.
Instead, it's as terrible as "a convicted man hanged in secret."
Other observations are about the old Europe that is falling apart and about new kinds of terror.
"The conflict increasingly became an economic competition," writes Englund, "a war between factories."
He captures the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiary of the still young century": "the word clever and ideologically convinced mass murderer in a dimensional suit that slaughters while sitting behind a desk."
People behave in unforeseen ways and there is as frivolous behavior as heroism.
Englund discusses the soldiers who actively tried to infect a prostitute with a sexually transmitted disease in order to escape the front service.
"The grotesque expression of this can be discovered in the trade with gonococcal eggs, because soldiers bought and lubricated their genitals in the hope of getting to the hospital," he writes.
"Those who were really desperate rubbed him in the eyes, causing them to be blind for the rest of their lives."
In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves, Englund’s poetry becomes supple yet unobtrusive and adapts perfectly to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes, he captures the way the war "unleashed uncontrollable forces in a unique way: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred."
People are starting to wonder why their leaders are making them fight.
The best books about the First World War were mostly rather falsified like Paul Fussell's "Great War and Modern Memory" or novels like Erich Maria Remarque's "In the West nothing new" than extensive history books.
Englund's band joins an unconventional hall of fame.
His book has the most devastating ending I have ever read in a non-fiction book.
I don't give it here anymore.
But it’s as if he had snatched us away with his book, this page with the main characters in front of his nose, and set it on fire with a match.
After an early misstep, a meticulously planned assault
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing emergency helmets.
They had chosen the night from Monday to Tuesday, because at that time there were hardly any people in Zucotti Park.
The operation was kept secret and only a few high-ranking officials were informed; all others initially believed to be participating in an exercise.
Police chief Raymond W. Kelly was among them and his presence underlined the fact that the operation was full of challenges.
The incidents of the past weeks, such as the use of pepper spray against protesters, which violates the rules of the department and gave the house occupiers an enormous increase in public sympathy, were not allowed to repeat.
And so the police action to remove the protesters from Zuccotti Park was carried out after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials had prepared these by observing how occupations were handled in other cities.
A disaster exercise had taken place with a view of Zuccotti on Randalls Island.
Officials reinforced the so-called chaos training — counter-terrorism measures, including the rapid relocation of a large number of police officers — to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session took place Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to move into the park came "at the last minute," said someone familiar with the orders, which spoke for a declaration as an "exercise."
"The few police officers involved, to my knowledge, didn't know it was about Zuccotti Park," said someone who wanted to remain anonymous.
"The only ones who knew it was about Zuccotti Park were the high-ranking officials of the department."
One reason for the secrecy was a lesson the city had learned.
On October 14, officials wanted to clear the park, but then retreated when hundreds of protesters gathered after they learned of these plans.
Officials from various police units were involved in Tuesday’s operation, including operations commandos from all over the city – hundreds of mobile officials normally deployed in highly criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that over the course of the day, many people go in and out of the park, almost like commuters, so 1 a.m. is a good time to go in.
"It was appropriate to do this when the least number of people are in the park," he said.
A ambulance with Jupiter lamps and loudspeakers was waiting for the departure at Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near the Manhattan Bridge.
The lamps and the pre-recorded messages ranging from the loudspeakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
When the public officials in their light blue wind jackets entered the park, many protesters simply picked up their belongings and left the place.
Police said no tents would be touched until 1:45 a.m. to give the protesters time to pack up their belongings.
Other teams of officials were seen gathering in the area to intervene should arrests in the park become necessary.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, spokesman for the police chief, said this was done for their own safety.
But many journalists claim that they were trying to stop them from watching the police actions in the park, and they said that the officers' dealings were very harsh.
Mr Browne said that television cars in Church Street on the west side of the park could have taken photos.
As the police moved westwards through the big mess of the protesters' personal belongings, including suitcases, artificial turf and bags with clothes, their employees followed the city cleaning, picking up what had been left behind.
Some protesters who refused to leave were dragged outside, images of which appeared on the Internet a short time later.
A main core of protesters moved to position near the kitchen area of the camp in the center of the park.
Some established barriers and the police continued their methodical arrests.
About 10 people in the epicentre of the camp tied together by their arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Civil protection officials were called to cut them off.
As Mr. Kelly said, no arrests were carried out in the park until about 3:30 p.m.
The eviction was completed after 75 minutes, according to police.
Mr Browne said 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests were, he said, due to “unreasonable behavior and resistance to arrest.”
The most prominent official on the ground was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the highest uniform official in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, Chief of the Department of Criminal Investigation, was also there.
Despite his presence, Mr. Kelly “did not lead the operation,” as Mr. Browne said.
In case they should access, a second group of officials was waiting on the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street.
Barricades were erected on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block further south.
It was possible to observe the police extending the perimeter around Zuccotti Park from these locations.
In one place, several officers, many of them with protective shields, were observed driving people outside.
There were about 28 people in the northern perimeter.
Some of the most violent actions of the night took place in the south of the park.
Around 5 a.m. south of Pine Street, a protester jumped onto the roof of a police car and other protesters let the air out of the tire of a police bus.
In one place the crowd threw a piece of plywood.
In the end, an official and a protester came to the hospital.
Union of caregivers will file lawsuit against the city for dismissals
The union, which represents hundreds of school caregivers who lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday because the redundancies are not necessary and discriminatory due to their inappropriate influence on the schools teaching poor students.
The lawsuit is probably the last option still open to the union, District Council 37, in its efforts to reverse the dismissals.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, care coordinators and other employees who were among the worst-paid employees in the city and who lost their jobs in a move on October 7, described the union leader as political revenge for having denied the city access to a health fund that the working groups maintained to close the household gap last year.
This accusation has been categorically rejected by the authorities.
At a city council hearing last month, school director Dennis M. Walcott said the redundancies were part of the budget that was passed in June.
A member of the city council shot back and explained to him that nothing in the budget specifies that school help staff would be fired.
City Council 37 officials said they had and warned the Department of Education of a lawsuit, and on Wednesday there will be a press conference to formally announce the filing of the lawsuit before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The lawsuit will list Mr. Walcott and the City’s Department of Education as defendants, and count eight dismissed workers as plaintiffs, all of whom are colored or Latin American women, like most of the helpers who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city's Justice Department, said the city would not face the lawsuit and therefore its individual claims could not be commented on.
According to a draft lawsuit filed by the New York Times, the union has focused on the number of redundancies at schools in the poor neighborhoods of the city in support of a lawsuit for unequal treatment, claiming that poor schools have lost more helpers because they are chronically underfunded.
It states that while there were no redundancies on Staten Island and few redundancies in Upper East Side or TriBeCa schools, 17 school assistants were lost in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 were discharged in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
Noting the loss of five out of eight school helpers employed in 36 public schools in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the lawsuit states, "This is not a neighborhood of miserable parents who can organize donations to catch up on budget cuts."
P.S.: The 36th District’s budget was cut by 3.26 percent this year, and funds were lost when the city changed its method of calculating extra funding for each poor school enrollment.
The union also complains that the heads of high schools were misled by the language in a memo that approved the dismissal of the care coordinators.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the plot, even though "excess" in the U.S. usually describes the shift of a teacher from a school's payroll to a pool of available workers paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six care coordinators were dismissed, not transferred," says the draft lawsuit.
Mission ended, Congress ready to agree on Libya
Ultimately, it looks like Republicans and Democrats in Washington are already agreeing on the uprisings in Libya.
All that was needed was the success of the revolt, the arrest and murder of the longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi, and the end of American interference.
On Thursday, the Senate’s Committee on International Relations passed a resolution under the leadership of President John Kerry (Massachusetts) along with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut), praising Libya for its successful rebellion and U.S. troops for their “courage.”
"This resolution honours the courageous people of Libya who have begun to rebuild their country," Kerry said.
"It is a confirmation of the support of their democratic efforts by two parties."
The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing has been easy in the Libya debate.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties and the White House argued over the wording of a series of resolutions endorsing or disapproving the US military’s role in NATO’s Libya mission.
In June, Kerry and McCain passed a resolution authorizing the restricted use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The law was rejected in the Senate by a broad margin of both parties and there was no vote.
On the same day, the Senate passed the law, and the House voted to cut the funds for American operations in Libya.
As a result, the U.S. mission fell into some sort of legislative purgatory—with a Congress that was upset enough to criticize Obama’s approach within the mission, but not angry enough to finally pull the ground off his feet.
Then the indecisiveness of Congress was overtaken by the events.
Tripoli fell in August under the Libyan rebels and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.
The Senate may be ready to take action.
The resolution of the Committee on International Relations “congratulates the people of Libya for their tremendous courage and extraordinary perseverance in their self-liberation” and “praises the men and women of the US military and their coalition partners who support the military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism.”
The resolution also reaffirms “the national interests of the United States in a successful and irrevocable transition of Libya to democracy.”
Will the new measures receive full support from the Foreign Relations Panel, or will they divide the legislators, as did the June Act?
The final version meets the resistance of Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the top Republican of the committee.
Lugar's spokesman said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new law.
According to the Capitol, it is up to the Senate to vote on a constitutional amendment this week that calls for a balanced budget, a top priority in nearly every congressional legislature of Republicans and some Democrats.
The measures, led by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget or any other area that is currently coming to a vote in the Senate or Congress.
Other legislators have tried unsuccessfully to bring their amendments to the vote, even though they have tried it often enough.
Goodlatte’s amendment is just one of 68 constitutional amendments submitted to this Congress and covers a wide range of topics.
Some are double—the same law has been submitted to both Congress and the Senate—and others are only slightly different.
There are at least 15 versions of the compensation budget amendment in the Senate alone and another dozen that would "control federal spending."
Some of the laws are also identical, but they give their clients—especially beginners among Republicans who want to polish their resume—the opportunity to brag that they have "written" such a measure.
The Budget Control Act, passed in August, requires both Senate and Congress to vote on an amendment to the budget balance.
In March, 58 senators voted for a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such a change.
In addition to the budget, some members want to limit the number of provisions that members of Congress can submit, while Republican José E. Serrano (New York) wants to lift the limit to two presidential terms.
Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a number of amendments that, among other things, guarantee the right to good education and health care.
A change that prohibits same-sex marriage, as well as a change that prohibits the burning of flags, is a recurring template.
Some legislators also want to allow federal laws to be repealed if two-thirds of the states reject them.
As eagerly as the members are proposing changes, they are moving as much faster as they have been in recent years.
In the 111th Congress, legislators submitted 77 such amendments; in the 110th Congress, 66.
The pace fades compared to that of the early 1990s, when members regularly proposed more than 150 changes every two years, according to the figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they weren’t much more successful than today’s ones.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed to Congress as early as 1789.
"Affected but not defeated," Giffords said in the first TV interview after the attack
Ten months after an armed man shot at her from close range during an election rally in Tucson, Republican Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) appeared on national television Monday night singing alone to Broadway's "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" piece, saying that the desire to recover was greater than the desire to return to Congress.
When she appeared with Diane Sawyer in the ABC news "20/20", she struggled for words and needed help walking.
The show showed the severe slow recovery from the damage the bullet, which split her skull, pierced the left side of her brain and crossed her head from front to back.
Three months ago, she surprisingly returned to Congress to triumphantly cast her vote on the debt brake.
In her first television interview after the January attack, in which six people were killed and 13 injured, Gifford smiled, laughed and sang — describing her recovery as "difficult."
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gifford, 41, replied, "Very well."
The interview with Gifford and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one-hour “20/20” special recorded shortly before the release of the couple’s new book, “Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope.”
The special tracks Gifford’s recovery since the January 8 assassination.
In videos that Kelly had recorded in the first few weeks, she is seen in the hospital bed, with her head shaved and a long scarf over her forehead.
She can only raise one or two fingers if her husband encourages her to do so.
Months later, Giffords sits in a wheelchair while therapists show her how to perform simple movements.
A nod with the head.
A twitch with the lips.
And then, her first words: "What."
After a few days, Giffords whispers another word, "Toast." She wants her breakfast changed.
Videos played on the ABC show show that music played an important role in Gifford's recovery: you can see the congresswoman sing along with the therapists to Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty's "Free Fallin'."
In an interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who spends two hours a day on therapy, said she can’t remember the day of the assassination.
Her husband said he had read Giffords an article to a daily newspaper on March 12 about the assassination when she interrupted him and first asked about the six people who had been killed during the assassination.
The suspected shooter Jared Lee Loughner is imprisoned in a Missouri prison and is forcibly treated as he waits for trial.
"Many people have died," Giffords told Sawyer.
"Hart, hart, hart."
In the course of his wife's recovery, Kelly told Sawyer, she said, "I was hit."
"So, I'd say, 'Gabby, you weren't defeated,'" Kelly said.
You were just hit.
And you will get through this and you will recover and you will come back stronger than ever before.
Troops feel more pity than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
A hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines gathered around him.
The crowd in black tuxedos stood up and applauded.
"The soldiers were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the fundraiser in the spring.
A senior military officer at the gala, watched by, among others, the Chief of Staff and then Chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
“They were introduced like orphans,” the officer wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers meant it well.
I know that.
But it wasn't respect, really, it was pity.
The starkly contradictory impressions illustrate the serious relationship between the military and the mostly distant, sometimes admiring, American public.
The troops are overwhelmed with praise for their victims.
But praise has its price, say servants.
The public is increasingly behaving as if people in uniform were hurting her.
"We were by no means victims," Brigade General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq, said.
"But apparently the only way of support is to push us into the role of unhappy souls."
The subject is extremely sensitive to military leaders who do not want to appear ungrateful or in dispute with the public they serve.
They also realised that the anger the returning troops faced in the last years of the Vietnam War was far worse.
As a result, conversations about pity take place in silence and in private between war veterans.
After his two sons returned from battles with the Marines, Colonel A.D. Mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military world could see their service from two different perspectives.
Some would look at them with a sense of awe as they had defeated rebels and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if a “angry, violent veteran is hiding beneath the surface,” said Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and assumed a senior state post in Washington upon his return.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some of the respondents subtly asked if he was able to withstand the pressure of a demanding post in Washington right after his return from the fight.
"When you talk about your service, you have to keep the negative impressions against it," Cancian told his sons.
The military’s lack of ease is partly rooted in Americans’ lack of interest in war.
Achievements on the battlefield are rarely praised by a country that has little experience with the military and sees little use in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We as a nation no longer value military heroism as it was absolutely common in World War II," said Lieutenant General David Barno a.D., who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public is largely focused on the suffering of a member of the ministry.
Troops find recognition for the number of attacks they have endured, the number of friends they have lost, or for the severity of their injuries.
Military faces growing pressure to crack down on rape
This week, an important hearing will decide whether 28 women and men will be charged with non-intervention in a rape case in the military court.
If it does not, hundreds of plaintiffs are ready for the next hearing.
Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and pregnant at the 11th week when she was raped by a soldier's colleague at night.
It was in October 2008 and she was just returning to her barracks in Miramar north of San Diego from dinner with a friend when she met a male colleague carrying a 12 pack of beer.
He asked if he could accompany her to her room for a drink.
"My alarm bells went on," Lyman said.
But the Texan woman wiped her concerns aside.
I thought, "Oh, he's 19.
“He’s from Texas,” she said.
"I wish I had listened to my gut feeling."
A few minutes after they went to Lyman's room, the man behind them stepped down, pushed her and raped her, she claims.
This week, November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military employees are anxiously waiting for a trial with a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, deciding whether to admit to court a lawsuit they filed against former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld.
The lawsuit claims that Gates and Rumsfeld have not acted against the widespread rape within the military and in violation of the soldiers’ constitutional rights.
Filed in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., the lawsuit initially included 17 plaintiffs, but increased to 28 in the following months: 25 women and three men, all claiming to have been raped or sexually assaulted by soldiers, and that the military failed to investigate, convict, or provide appropriate justification for the attack according to the lawsuit.
Burke says she's pursuing the top military leadership as the problem begins there.
"The military is hierarchically structured," she says.
"Who are the individual persons who are in position to eradicate the culture retaliation of? The leadership."
Burke also says she has contacted nearly 400 other survivors since February, many of whom could be part of future lawsuits.
Their strategy: Instead of placing their eggs in a basket, they will, if necessary, file many more lawsuits to maintain the pressure.
The defense team for the Department of Defense, led by Federal Attorney Neil MacBride, has filed an application to dismiss a lawsuit.
Newsweek’s files detail the defense strategy, first and foremost that the military cannot be charged by current or former soldiers for injuries in the armed forces.
Under a 1950 law of the Supreme Court, the so-called Feres Doctrine, the government is not liable for injuries inflicted on soldiers in active service.
"The alleged damage occurred during the plaintiffs' military service," the document says.
The Department of Defense refuses any comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not admitted to service in battle, the distinction lies only in the name: modern wars rarely have clear fronts.
Both in Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of soldiers play increasingly important roles, especially in contact with local women in the war zones.
The result: between these two wars, 150 soldiers died, two-thirds of them in combat.
It's time for the military to be modernized, Burke says.
And she is not alone in her struggle: three other complaints besides her are pending.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans’ Legal Services Clinic is preparing a lawsuit against the four major military academies for allegedly promoting a misogynistic atmosphere.
Independent from this, Vietnam Veterans of America, a non-profit organization, is collecting a lawsuit against the military, focusing on the diagnosis of "personality disorder" that rape victims received to dismiss them from service - a common practice, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
Her group filed a lawsuit against the Veterans Administration in December, accusing it of discriminatory practices in dealing with benefits for individuals who claimed to have been sexually abused in service.
Nine laws were submitted to Congress independently by a mix of senators and representatives of both parties, providing a number of clues.
According to the Department of Defense’s Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office, 3,158 sexual abuses were reported in 2010.
But most of the abuses are not reported at all, and according to the Pentagon’s own estimate, this figure accounts for about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases that occur each year.
The report, which was published in March, also examines law enforcement rates: in 2010, 20 percent of cases recorded in the military went to court, only half as many as in civil law.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case describe their attacks as just the first in a series of traumas.
In Lyman's case, she reported the alleged rape of the military police less than an hour after the raid.
That night, she says, she was asked 11 times to tell the details of her rape to a whole range of police officers, doctors, and commanders.
She had a rape kit and the blood of her attacker, which came from a cut on his arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge who asked her about the sex she had with her boyfriend before the assault.
Six persons testified as character witnesses on behalf of the alleged perpetrator, who was ultimately acquitted.
"I still remember the day the verdict was read," Lyman says.
"I thought the contractions would start. I ran out of the courtroom screaming."
"They took me to the psychiatric department and I remember when I came out, I said to my commander, 'That wasn't his procedure, that was my procedure.'"
Lyman was asked to see a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed a personality disorder and declared her unable to serve.
In January 2010, she was dishonorably dismissed, so she received no support whatsoever.
Whether the lawsuit filed by Lyman and the other plaintiffs is moving forward is pure speculation, says John Turley, professor of law at George Washington University Law School.
Nevertheless, he notes: "In my opinion, they should move forward."
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first questioned.
I have been a critic of the Feres doctrine for a lifetime.
The military is lagging behind for a decade because they do not have the same incentive and deterrence that a liability entails.
He adds, "The odds are against them... but it's important for them that they try."
These things will only change when good people are ready to fight.
If the hearing does not follow its path, Burke, the plaintiff’s attorney, will begin with her hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the military in this respect until reforms are made," she says.
Or until we die, whatever happens first.
Walls Have Eyes: How Researchers Watch You on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just one of many guys who sent their anti-immigration opinion online.
On Monday, Breivik, who confessed to having committed a massacre in Norway in July in which 77 people were killed, had his first public hearing in court.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is far from alone in cyberspace: he spent a lot of time in front of his computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support far-right groups on social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how do you find them?
This is easy - you just have to log in to Facebook.
“We found that it wasn’t difficult to get to them,” says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recent report by the British idea factory DEMOS on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook’s hiding personal data is so encyclopedic, Bartlett says, that researchers simply need to use the site’s advertising tool to accurately pinpoint their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy — just like marketers have been doing for years.
Bartlett’s team found half a million fans of far-right groups across Europe and then targeted them with Adds, but instead of linking up with a new band or diet product, the Adds invited users to a survey asking about their level of education, their attitudes toward violence, and their own assessment of their future.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview more than 10,000 supporters from 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries – without even having to leave their offices once.
"It's a fairly new research method," says Bartlett.
Some of the results are hardly surprising. Online supporters of far-right groups are mostly young, male and annoyed about immigration.
But in a kind of surprising distortion, "those who combine their online activism with an offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic, and less violent than those who sit behind their computer screens."
DEMO’s work is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Idea factories, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study everything from health issues to societal trends such as in "likes", text messages and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three content per day, Facebook’s “data supernova” is generating a research boom that has increased the number of scientific papers with that page’s name in the title by nearly 800% over the last five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is the fact that through this site you can study people you don’t normally reach with your clipboard on the street.
"If you used to try to question people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
“They had to inform the party first and it would never have allowed them access,” Bartlett says.
“With Facebook, it all falls away – you go straight to them.”
Others say the site provides a way to identify and solve social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who discussed their full rush on Facebook were significantly more prone to problem drinking than students who remained silent on this topic.
Moreno suggests that equivalent students, such as housing consultants, monitor the site and help a student if it posts too many status updates.
“You can’t solve a problem if you haven’t recognized it,” said Dimitri Christakis, Morenos’ co-author and head of Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children’s Research Institute in Seattle.
"We have found a way to identify vulnerable children who would not have been found otherwise."
Facebook is also constantly collecting data from its own population.
The site’s data team has compiled statistics on relationship status and Valentine’s Day, turnout in the 2010 midterm elections, and a National Happiness Index (using primarily data that only Facebook has access to – Masters of Digital Freedom have long known that the site should make their large data pit accessible to others for research purposes).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they want it or not. In order to be able to play scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, they allow the site to share their personal information.
But what if Facebook users become part of a survey they don’t even know about?
While researchers have strict guidelines on how to collect their data offline, everything is allowed online.
“I don’t think many users have even thought about the fact that a researcher could study their profiles,” says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, to a 2006 study in which he examined students’ public pages on Facebook.
"As for her, it was just about her and her friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research participant will be absolutely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know how much of the information in a user profile and in posts is true.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things,” Selwyn says.
Therefore, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn thinks that a clipboard and a pen are still the best research tools anyone can use.
“There is no substitute for going out into the real world and talking to real people,” he says.
“Social research has to take care of the social – and lots of social life is still taking place offline.”
"Cold and inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik appears for the first time in a public court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to two massacres in which 77 people were killed in Norway this summer, described himself as a "resistance fighter" in his first appearance before a public court in Oslo.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a Knight Templar of Norway," he said in front of a courtroom with more than 500 people.
"I appeal to the court because you have received your mandate from organizations that support hate ideologies and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the laws, but I don't confess guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue as he "did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform on which he can express his views."
For the same reason, he denied Breivik, who brought a pre-written speech, the permission to contact the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, he had no access to the media for four weeks, and he said the authorities will closely monitor all visits and all correspondence over eight weeks.
Approximately 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came in hopes of seeing Breivik in the eye, others wanted confirmation that he would stay behind bars.
Everyone participated with the goal that everything ends in a lockdown.
"I thought he looked cold and inhumane," one Utoya survivor told Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
"It was uncomfortable, but for me, it goes a little further after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Breivik, wearing a dark suit and a blue tie, looked calm and professional throughout the hearing and looked journalists and survivors in the eye as he entered and left the building.
Despite Breivik's bizarre hint that he was part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge concluded that he was not mentally ill and said there was no evidence that he had accomplices.
Some may like the fact that the July 22 attacks were apparently the work of a single extremist and not of a group of radicals.
But does this automatically ease the grief and confusion that an entire nation still feels?
"I wish he looked like a monster, but he doesn't," the victim's family said.
“It would be so much easier if he did.”
7 Lessons from the Interview with Deceased Steve Jobs Showed at a Theater This Week
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford, highlighting the engineering genius as a great modern inventor.
But what Apple fans may find most revealing in the recently rediscovered Jobs interview, which was dusted this week before special film screenings in the major markets, is how much this creative head understood business processes and workflows.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer, and a self-proclaimed hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer who zealously crafted charts — a man who believed that many executives suffer from “a disease of thinking,” that “a really great idea makes up 90 percent of the work... [but] there’s an enormous amount of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product.”
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the TV series "Triumph of the Idiots" about the break-up of the personal computer, and he spent more than an hour with Jobs, in which they had one of the rare, in-depth conversations.
At that time, more than 10 years had passed since Jobs had been pushed out of Apple. And he was already working hard on his new computer company NeXT, looking forward to the widespread adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringley's interview was used in specialist idiots, he says the copy templates of the interview were missing on delivery.
Only after Jobs' death was a complete VHS copy discovered in the director's garage.
This slightly revised film footage forms the basis for the 68-minute film "Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview", which will be coming to the Landmark Theatre this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who is known to hate extensive interviews, Jobs here seems surprisingly eager to explain his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
Over the course of the interview, there are four longer breaks between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds of reflection, in which Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts and strives for accuracy.
There are also moments when Jobs’ perfectionism comes to light when he seems impatiently responds to Cringely’s questions and pushes him to respond more quickly to topics or incidents of greater importance.
Recorded before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone, the Lost Interview seems somehow eeriely far-sighted when Jobs evaluates what other companies are doing right or wrong in his opinion and represents his own vision of the computer’s future.
It’s one thing to read posthumous appreciations of Jobs’ career, but seeing Jobs here as the eager dreamer on the way to greatness is something quite different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things could and should be.
Shortly after he had done all this here, he went off and did it.
A quick look at seven remarkable sequences of the Lost Interview:
How he learned to run a company:
"During all the years in business, I always ask, 'Why do you do things?'. And the answer you always get is, 'Oh, that's how it's made easy.'
No one knows why he does what he does. No one in the business really thinks deeply about things.
That's what I found out.
Jobs continues his efforts to streamline accounting at Apple.
Astonished at how costs were recorded—usually starting with “standard costs” that were quantified by mere assumption and then adjusted by “deviation”—he developed an automated factory that ensured that business costs could be determined down to the smallest detail.
How the Pope was ridiculed:
Jobs talks about the "Blue Box" he built with Steve Wozniak, a device that could sneak into the telephone company and make long-distance calls for free.
Much has been written about the device, but Jobs’ enthusiasm when he describes the Blue Box as an act of self-empowerment is contagious.
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a paid phone, making a call, and then connecting from one AT&T network to another while looping through as many satellites as possible.
“We sent stuff half a dozen times around the globe and when you screamed into the phone, it came out a minute later in the phone next door,” Jobs says, smiling.
“We were young and we learned that we can build something ourselves that can control trillions of dollars of infrastructure around the world.”
We both, we didn’t know much, but we could build this little thing that can control a gigantic thing, that was an incredible lesson and I don’t think there would be Apple without it.
Jobs continues to tell of a glorious prank that Wozniak and he almost pulled off when they called at the Vatican in the middle of the night via Blue Box and wanted to talk to the Pope while imitating Henry Kissinger as well as they could.
Since several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two had to laugh before the pope himself got on the phone.
How he fell in love with technology (and unpreparedly called Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, when he was looking for spare parts to build a frequency meter, he looked for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after her 20-minute phone call, Jobs got a part-time job at Hewlett-Packard for the summer.
"That had a remarkable impact on me, it was the only company I had seen at that age and it shaped my views on what a company was and how well it treated its employees."
Later, Jobs became one of HP’s employees visiting the company’s research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw “the first desktop computer ever made.”
He was as tall as a suitcase, had a small screen with Braun's tube and I fell in love with him.
I would climb up at HP as a teenager and hang on to this machine and write programs for her.
How to Improve Innovation:
Several times in the interview, Jobs talks about how to spontaneously invent new products.
Early in his career, when he built some boards, he was asked by a customer to assemble the whole computer.
He worked with a payment deadline of only 30 days and had to think through both the assembly and the delivery of the finished equipment.
Later on at Apple, he remembers the problems he had in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember punchy arguments... They yelled at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] and I got up, went out and found a manufacturer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could have built for $15, which was incredibly credible.
About large companies that are declining:
Long before resurrecting Apple, Jobs foresaw the ways in which so many industrial giants stumbled with their visions and lost control of their stocks.
"Let's say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you're making a better copyer or printer, okay?"
They own the stock monopoly, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [are those people] who ultimately lead the businesses and the product that pushes people out of decision making.
The product genius that led to this monopoly position is eradicated by the people who have no concept regarding good products vs. bad products - craftsmanship is necessary.
This happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
It could have been 10 times bigger if it had been Microsoft in the 1990s.
They got the defeat from victory.
About innovation as an art form:
“There’s a lot of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product... when you develop that great idea, it changes and grows.”
You learn a lot about your subtleties.
You have to make votings, certain things you can't do, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
You have to remember 5,000 things, these concepts, and bring them all together...
Ultimately, it comes down to taste, it comes down to trying to deal with the best things humans have created and then trying to bring those things together into what you are doing.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We are always shameless in stealing great ideas.
Part of what made Macintosh great was that the people who worked there were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who happened to be the best computer scientists in the world.
If it had not been the computer industry, they would have created fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas dine with opponents of health laws, as court accepts case
The day the Supreme Court assembled behind closed doors to discuss the politically divisive question of whether to listen to a challenge to President Obama’s health laws, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended a dinner sponsored by the law firm to represent the case in court.
The incident took place last Thursday, when all nine judges met for a meeting to discuss the petitions for consideration.
One of the cases to be dealt with was a lawsuit brought by 26 states against the far-reaching health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that has become a buzzword among conservative activists across the U.S.
The judges agreed to the hearing. In fact, a 5 1/2-hour basic discussion is expected in March, presumably whose outcome will likely boost the 2012 presidential campaign, which will be in full swing at the time the court decision is announced.
The attorney who will stand in court and claim that the law is to be overturned will probably be Paul Clement, once attorney general under the administration of George W. Bush.
Clement’s law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that supported the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a long-established group dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the business associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, who challenge the law.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., who is financially tremendously involved in the outcome of the process.
The dinner took place at a Washington hotel a few hours after the court had deliberated on the case.
Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican group leader and a declared opponent of health reform
The guests of dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: The two judges have been attending events of the Federalist Society for years.
And that does not violate moral rules.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct, which regulates the actions of the lower federal judges.
If they were, they would probably fall under Principle 4c of the Code, which states the following: "A judge may take part in charity events by law and other organizations, whereby the judge may not be a speaker, guest of honor or, according to the program, a guest of such events."
Nonetheless, the extreme proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the law firms involved in the case, as well as a company with a massive financial interest in it, was enough to alert moral and government activists.
“This striking break with morality and the opposite of the code is a lie to some judges’ lawsuits, the court is adhering to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, president of the Common Cause, a civil rights movement in the United States.
"The judges won and dined during a benefit event with lawyers with pending trials at court."
Your appearance and support of a fundraiser for this event undermines any claim to impartiality and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little consideration for critics who say they would too easily mix court affairs with groups that let themselves be guided by the agenda, such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife Ginni is a well-known conservative activist.
On the other hand, the Conservatives claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was a prosecutor general under the Obama administration when the first lawsuits came to court in first instance.
Her critics urged Kagan to withdraw herself from hearing the case for bias, as she was too involved in defending the law to be unbiased.
Kagan makes no attempts to do this.
Boeing to land record $18 trillion order
Emirates has ordered 50 Boeing 777 two-course aircraft with an option on 20 more aircraft.
In addition, Boeing will sell six Boeing Dreamliner to Oman Air, a business worth more than $1 trillion.
It’s really a rare news that a company gets an order of 50 pieces of its products.
But it’s a big deal if the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the list price for these 50 aircraft totals a record sum of $18 trillion.
Equally unusual is Boeing’s client: the Middle East, a growing gold mine for future aircraft orders.
In a forecast released Monday, the Chicago-based company estimates that airlines from the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 trillion over the next 20 years.
This weekend, Boeing announced its largest order ever for commercial aircraft, measured by the value of the order: 50 two-course Boeing 777 jets.
The hammer order came from the Emirates airline from Dubai.
The airline also has, Boeing announced at the Dubai Aviation Show in 2011, an option on the purchase of 20 more aircraft, which will raise the total list price to $26 trillion.
On Monday, according to Boeing Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8, the so-called Dreamliner, which greatly improves fuel consumption and passenger comfort.
The list price for six of these aircraft is more than $1 trillion.
“This is absolutely positive for Boeing,” said Neal Dihora, Morningstar’s stock market expert.
"The quality of these special customers is very high."
Many airlines in the Middle East are owned by oil-producing countries.
So not only do they have the money to pay for the planes, but an increase in oil prices, which usually hurts the airlines, as this is one of their biggest cost points, is not so damaging as the country earns at a higher oil price.
This is important as they tend less than other airlines to cancel or postpone aircraft orders as oil prices rise, Dihora said.
“They have a natural protection,” he said.
The order from Emirates reaffirms Boeing’s leadership in the wide-body aircraft market and helps keep Airbus competitor SAS at bay, which is attacking the supremacy with the A350.
Boeing’s victory at the aviation show comes four months after Airbus announced that it would postpone the launch of the largest A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
The deployment was postponed to gain more confidence after customers demanded a higher payload and reach.
Boeing shares rose 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexican President's Sister Apparently Loses Election in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that drug traffickers supported opponent Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the race for the governor's post.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon apparently lost her application for the office of governor of Muchoacan during the violent state elections, claiming on Monday that drug traffickers had influenced the race in favor of one of her opponents.
According to the preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Party of the Revolution, the PRI, has won the race for the governorship in the Western state.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the election process and especially yesterday is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview a day after the election on Sunday.
"They threatened our candidates, our staff in the polls ... they occupied ballot boxes, built roadblocks ... and instructed people to vote [for the PRI]."
The PRI ruled for seven decades in Mexico until they lost the presidency in 2000.
But they are striving for a return and the victory in Michoacan is an important step in these efforts.
The PRI hopes for a victory in the July presidential election.
Vallejo seems to have narrowly defeated Claderon, who had led in the polls before election day.
Calderon, a candidate of her brother’s conservative Partido Acción Nacional PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the left-wing Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD), the currently running governor, came in third place, a severe defeat for the divided and unhappy left leadership for the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of Morelia, denies ties to drug traffickers and urges the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and amphetamines.
It is the homeland of President Calderon and he chose Michoacan to launch a military-led offensive against drug traffickers in December 2006.
The violence continues.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election during an election event for Luisa Maria Calderon and numerous candidates have stepped down from the local elections out of fear.
For the PRI, a victory strengthens the party, no matter how disgusting the elections in Michoacan appear.
The man who is likely to represent the PRI in the race for president is Enrique Peña Nieto, who congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory will make us bravely look into next year."
ADB urges Asia to help save the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) calls on India and China to support the rescue of the eurozone in its severe debt crisis to prevent a long-term downward trend that will slow the growth of Asia’s economy.
Rajat Nag, Managing Director of the ADB based in Manila, said that the two fastest-growing economic nations in the world must do “everything in their power” to accelerate the recovery of the currency block either through the International Monetary Fund or through direct mutual agreements.
He warned against the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China) who look “passionately” at the difficulties in Europe, saying that Asia’s financial support of European leadership and European resources helps prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
“We are all in the same boat.”
“So anyone who can help Europe out of this crisis is helpful,” he told the Financial Times in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but it is not immune."
"If China and India can help, then by all means."
Europe’s monetary union has fallen into a serious debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy’s interest costs have risen dangerously and the prime ministers of both Italy and Greece have resigned.
The emerging severe debt crisis in Europe stirs fears that the global economy might fall into recession, leading to calls for the leading emerging economies to unite to support the eurozone.
Mr. Nag predicted that any support to Asia by the IMF will be channeled, but said mutual agreements – such as the purchase of bonds from the EU Rescue Fund, the European Financial Stabilization Facility (EFSF) – offer greater negotiating power to European partners in Asia.
Anand Sharma, the Indian trade minister, said that "India will do everything in its power" to help the eurozone as its own economy now suffers from declining exports and the drying out of foreign capital flows.
“Nobody wants the Eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent,” he said.
“We face major challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth.”
“It’s not an option, it’s a job, because where else can we find work for our millions of young men and women?”
Others argue that developing economies like India have no reason to help the rich Europeans when faced with major economic challenges themselves.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor at US Brown University, said it would be politically very difficult to sell the 1.2 trillion people in India help for Europe, more than 800 million of which live on $2 or even less a day.
"Sometimes they will find out that the Greeks are going to retire at 50 and spend holidays on the beach, and then you have a problem," he said.
Lee Howell, Administrative Director of the World Economic Forum, similarly asked why India’s reserves should be used to keep the numerous and well-paid employees in the public service in Greece, with jobs in poorly managed, losing facilities such as the railway.
Mr. Nag said that the crises in the eurozone will have “significant domino effects” across Asia.
The ADB’s forecast of 7.5 percent economic growth in Asia for the years 2011/threatens now “the risk of graduation” due to the imminent threat from Europe.
He said vulnerable emerging markets would need to create “crisis plans” to protect themselves from a downtrend and significant capital drift of their wordings.
Urgent warnings from the Pentagon about possible defense cuts
Defense Minister Leon Panetta warmed Congress on Monday when he warned that automatic budget cuts would unnoticedly weaken national security, triggering a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon’s halls to the war arenas in Afghanistan and civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon is already thinking of cutting $450 trillion over the next decade, but now fears that further cuts of $600 trillion or more will be necessary if Congress can’t achieve a close in spending.
“The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the ministry,” Panetta wrote in a letter to Republican senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said a Congressional failure to reach a budget agreement, which will result in a so-called seizure, would result in 23% general cuts, as well as a halt to numerous new projects.
"Such a high cut, carried out in such a careless manner, would make most of our ship and construction projects impracticable - you can't buy three-quarters of a ship or building - and seriously harm other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We would also be forced to involuntarily separate ourselves from a large part of our civilian personnel and, since the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would have to leave civilians almost certainly to achieve the goal."
"These changes would destroy the faith of those who maintain our military and seriously damage our alertness."
The cuts would ultimately hit the fighting forces," Panetta said.
"While the anti-terrorist wartime contingents are not directly affected by the seizure, the serious interference in the basic budget would adversely affect the war effort," Panetta warned.
"Personal settings were being cut, which would result in delays in settings and hiring oversight supporting the war."
"The salaries of the staff would be cut, which would lead to late payments to wartime traders and would disrupt both legal and political support."
The two senators responded to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for more details about the potential impact of the automatic cuts on the Department of Defense.
"The consequences of a confiscation of the Department of Defense would trigger a rapid decline of the United States as the world's leading military power."
"We are vehemently against this draconian act," the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon when they published Panetta's letter.
"This is a result we cannot live with, and it is certainly not one that should be imposed on us."
"The seizure is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and its occurrence should not be allowed."
Whether Panetta’s letter and the new warnings from the senators will increase pressure on a compromise in the budget or increase demands to exempt the Pentagon from cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has increasingly bluntly expressed the potential cuts, although he was able to gain many years of experience with the budget in Congress and the White House before coming to the head of the Pentagon, and knows that he faces tough decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Defence Minister painted a gloomy picture of what could be ahead – a military with a shell, but without a core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without ammunition."
"It's an air force squadron without adequately trained pilots."
“It’s a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without sufficiently trained soldiers capable of fulfilling the mission,” Panetta said in his opening address at the Pentagon.
"It is a force that lacks morality and alertness and that is unable to face potential opponents."
“She really makes you angry.”
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta cited new details on how reductions "create significant operational risks: delays in crisis times, conflicts and disasters, serious restrictions on our global deployment and intervention capability, leading to an unacceptable risk in future war operations."
And Panetta said that some of the largest defense projects could fall victim to the deletion, including those that have already been tested and are already in the early planning phase.
This list also includes the fighter F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bomber, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new Littoral Combat Ship, and the new ground combat vehicle that the Army and Navy need to replace the Humvee.
Stopping further development and testing of the F35 would save up to $80 trillion over the next 10 years, but advocates say it is an important next step to upgrading so that potential dangers can be banned by China and other opponents.
How to Reveal a Lie
A look at the current headlines shows how worrying and widespread deception and lies are in daily life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy managing the allegations of sexual harassment by several women, both sides accusing each other of lying.
Penn State’s leadership is accused of perjury for allegedly withholding reports of a retired football coach sexually abusing boys.
Last week, an open microphone was heard when French President Nicolas Sarkozy claimed to US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lies destroy careers and shake countries.
New York Congressman and Internet exhibitor Anthony Weidner made a fool of himself when he circulated denials that were quickly refuted by irrefutable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of campaign funding violations related to covering up an extramarital affair.
And then, of course, no one who has experienced it forgets the media circus that President Bill Clinton triggered when he lied about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky during his second term in the Oval Office.
Stories about cheating in school and at college exams are widespread.
There have been incidents in which teachers have given their students the exam answers so that they were doing well even in their performance exams.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send a message that lies and cheating are okay.
How much deception do we experience?
Studies show that we lie between 10 and 200 times a day.
However, many of these lies are regarded as emergency lies.
Another study shows that strangers lie to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
Recognizing lies or "discovering lies" is one that is important for everyone to learn, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from a societal game such as charades, in which the goal is to shout “Have yourself!”, unmasking a deception is a serious area of knowledge based on scientific data gathered over the past six decades at prestigious universities that have conducted far-reaching research projects, especially in the fields of psychology and physiology.
One result of the research is that most ancient myths about lying have been uncovered.
Lies look you in the eye.
They don’t always stutter, stammer, blush, and babble.
However, it is not possible to conclude from this that these liars are difficult to uncover and unmask.
A skilled liar can penetrate to the truth by learning about the structure of the claim, the fine facial expressions, questioning and timing.
I’ve spent several years exploring the scientific findings of the comprehensive and ever-growing field of disguise, and it’s clear that disguising a deception is a modern ability that is easy to learn and helps us navigate in our complex world, especially when hiring or interviewing people or negotiating or administering belongs to one’s own professional responsibilities.
Good liars are very good at evaluating other people, arousing their interest and controlling their own emotions, and they intuitively feel how they are perceived by others.
Thanks to research, we know that extroverted people are more likely to lie than introverted people, that men are more likely to lie "self-oriented" than women, whose lies are more "oriented toward others" - usually they want to protect the feelings of others - that married people are less likely to lie to their partners than unmarried people (but the lies they tell are mostly lies).
We also know that when a person has been exposed as an evildoer, others feel less guilty of having lied to that person.
How do you know if someone is lying?
First of all, observe this person’s normal behavior.
This is called baselining, the starting position.
It provides a point of reference for the subsequent evaluation of changes.
Observe the attitude, the laughter, the voice quality of your subject.
You should know better when someone is usually constantly tripping with the foot so that they don’t wrongly accuse him if he trips with the foot during a meeting.
Then watch for accumulations of conspicuous verbal and nonverbal behaviors.
Think of these accumulations as alarm bells that shriek, not as evidence of a disguise.
People who deceive may become solid when they try to remember their story, perhaps pointing their feet towards the door or leaning towards the exit, changing their position in a significant way, or showing a “relaxation after the hiring conversation,” this deep, relaxing exhalation, and the change in posture when all the hard questions are over.
Questioners often incorrectly signal that an hiring conversation is over, just to look for this relaxation after the hiring conversation.
Also, pay attention to your subject’s language.
Scott Peterson’s slip is famous for using the past form when he claimed his dead wife was still alive and triggered a national search for her.
Deceptive people can also use a distancing language: "I had no sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or if you repeat a tricky question overall.
The most common verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use "qualifying language" when answering a tricky question: "Well... to tell you the truth ... as far as I know ... to the best of my knowledge and conscience."
This makes the answer more perceptive than factual, which often makes the alarm bells ring.
There is no magic tool to unmask lies, but you can learn skills that allow you to unmask them.
Thanks to these skills, anyone can be less likely to become a victim of scammers, both in private and professional life.
Controversial Oil Pipeline Plan Revised After Threatened by Delayed U.S. Authorization
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada into the Gulf of Mexico, upsetting trade unions and reassuring environmentalists, the pipeline-building company is striving to re-plan the project so that it can return to normal.
TransCanada said Monday evening that the planned pipeline will be diverted from the ecologically sensitive area of the Sandhills in Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Nebraska House of Parliament.
Alex Pourbax of TransCanada said the company remains confident that the pipeline will eventually be approved, albeit with a different course.
This came after an announcement by the State Department last week that it would postpone a decision on a federal approval for the project until the new possible course is reviewed that avoids the area of the Sandhills in Nebraska as well as the Ogallala aquifer, a major underwater supply.
"This is a real step forward," Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, told Fox News.
The new environmental review, which the State Department has ordered, may postpone a decision until 2013, following the elections next year, even though officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama stated in a written statement last week that the decision was a task of the State Department and pledged his support.
The 1,700-mile pipeline would connect Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would pump 700,000 barrels of oil a day from the province of Alberta to the refineries in Texas.
The pipeline would have to cross six states.
Environmentalists hate them, but labor markets love them because they estimate that the pipeline will create 20,000 jobs.
But Nebraska lawmakers who oppose the plan are weighing the laws to force a move away from the Sandhills region and the Ogallala aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The State Department’s current study on impact on the environment has found that the project has little impact on the environment, but the source of the energy industry says that the Ministry’s chief auditor has requested a separate probe of the verification procedure focusing on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was Hillary Clinton’s 2008 advisor, is in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company commissioned to conduct the original study was an inappropriate choice as it is associated with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle accused of forcing a toddler to vomit out of fear
A New York family claims that disco diva Patti LaBelle had a rabid attack in the lobby of her Manhattan building that would have frightened her little daughter so much that she gave in to fear.
The lady marmalade singer's tirade scared 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered from "personality changes, sleep disturbances" and "increasing fear of strangers," her family told the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was on November 10 last year when stage worker Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve wanted to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was picking up the car, Roseanna Monk went with the luggage and Genevieve on her arm to the lobby in her building on Riverside Boulevard.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and left her daughter for a moment.
"Someone appeared behind me and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said, "Yes," and went to take her back on her arms," she said.
LaBelle enraged the pregnant woman.
"She said in an aggressive tone, 'You shouldn't drop your daughter near the door,'" said Roseanna Monk.
"I told her, 'I don't care what you say or think.'"
She got angry and began to scold - she used the F-word and the A-word and became very loud...
She had a bottle of water in her hand and started tilting water out of the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve had become hysterical.
"I said to this woman, 'Look what you did to my daughter,'" said the child's mother.
LaBelle rushed on the mother, who was still carrying Genevieve on her arm, and had to be held back by her escort and pulled to a waiting car, said Roseanna Monk.
The baby screamed so much that he had to vomit, she said.
Later, the LaBelle family asked for an apology in writing, but did not receive an answer.
LaBelle’s lawyer and representative did not respond to calls asking for comment.
The lawsuit is for unspecified damages, but the family’s attorney, Sam Davis, said he doesn’t charge any fees and plans for the family to donate the money they get to child cancer aid.
"We want Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her behavior," Davis said.
“This kind of behavior is absolutely unacceptable, especially when it is displayed to a kindergarten nurse who is carrying an 18-month-old baby on her arm.”
Climate change has slowed the economy
In the first year that Mario López Valdez is in government, unemployment and unemployment increased in Sinaloa, while foreign investment declined and the economy stagnated.
2011 will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa. It is the first year that Mario López Valdez, who calls himself the initiator of change and sparked great hopes for economic growth, is in government. However, as a result of the climatic adversity, growth cannot be spoken of, but on the contrary the main economic indicators deteriorated.
The low temperatures in February not only caused losses of millions in agriculture, but also narrowed the growth of the state economy and caused a general decline in economic activity of 3.6 percent in the first quarter. This is mainly due to the historical decline in agricultural development of 31.16 percent, which slowed down further economic sectors.
According to a report published by the Consejo Mexicano para el Desarrollo Rural Sustentable (Mexican Council for Sustainable Agricultural Development) on the impact of frost, 582,000 hectares of agricultural land were damaged, of which 78.03 percent were completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07 percent were partially destroyed, mainly vegetable, maize and chickpea crops.
The decline in economic activity until November has led to a steady increase in unemployment in the Mexican state. The Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía observed a rapid increase in unemployment in the first quarter of the year, because from January to March, 55 053 inhabitants of Sinaloa had no employment, which corresponds to 4.53 percent of the working population. In the second quarter, the unemployment rate rose to 5.28 percent, from 969 percent to 5.28 percent in July.
Lower liquidity
According to economist Gerardo López Cervantes, Dean of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the University of Autónoma (UAS), the policy of public institutions indirectly explains the growing unemployment.
"What we are currently seeing is an increase in unemployment, which has to do with several factors, including losses of liquidity in the market as a result of the cuts in funds by Congress' anti-money laundering legislation, because for those who illegally accumulate dollars, it is not easy to let them work for themselves, invest them or use them for anything else," he said.
Migration stopped
López Cervantes pointed out that growing unemployment is also a demographic factor.
"The number of people leaving the country in search of work abroad, especially in the United States, has decreased, on the one hand because of the problems of entry and on the other because it is difficult to find work there too. These people stay here and look for work here, which increases unemployment," he says.
Black Labour
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more serious if you take into account the high proportion of undeclared work, which, according to INEGI, comprises 60.38 percent of the workforce in the country that works without paying into the social security funds.
Unemployment and unemployment are the lowest wages in Mexico, according to the statistics of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social and the Secretaría del Trabajo y Previsión Social.
The average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa was 5352 pesos until September, which is much less than the general government average, which is 7375 pesos.
Decrease in ADI
In addition to the decline in economic activity and growing unemployment, the strongest decline in foreign direct investment (FDI) in the last decade has been recorded in 2011. According to the Secretaría de Economía (State Economic Authority), the ADI from January to June was $ 630 597, which corresponds to a decline of 87.74 percent compared to the $ 5 143 312 in the same period in the previous year.
The Secretaria de Desarrollo Económico del Gobierno, for its part, recorded a total investment of 17 280 000 pesos in 2011, mainly from tertiary companies.
The debts
Given the economic crisis, the state government applied for a loan of 3,000,000 pesos to the National Congress in July to be invested in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities to reactivate the economy. The state congress approved an amount of 200,600,000 pesos, but by November no positive effects of the debt could be found on any of the economic sectors in the country.
Reactions
For the representatives of entrepreneurship, the first year of government made Mario López Valdé’s inability to govern obvious.
Miguel Loredo López, Chairman of the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformación (Mexico State Chamber of Manufacturing Industry), stated that in 2011 no efforts were made to harmonize the views of different sectors, including the state government.
"Economic activity in Sinaloa has been really poor this year, hard work has to be done to recover the terrain lost this year, and in 2012 we have to double our efforts. The efforts of all, and in particular the progress of the already well coordinated government team, have not been sufficiently coordinated," he said.
Slow economic development
Loredo López commented that events such as the frost at the beginning of the year made economic development of the country difficult and slowed down.
"The low economic flow is the result of several events, including the frost. One of the most important consequences is a slowed economy that is not moving enough to produce economic dynamics that could generate an acceptable flow of processes, products and services. That is why we will close the year well below our expectations," he said.
Redefining the Appeal
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, chairman of the Confederación Patronal de la República Mexicana in Sinaloa, stated that the state must be encouraged to engage in more dynamic productive activities.
"In general, we have observed that work has been done. We believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program to redefine the economic vocation and line of the country, because it is important to activate all the material and human resources of Sinaloa," he said.
There's a lot to do
The chairman of Coparmex stressed the importance of developing a future perspective that guides the government’s efforts in a better direction.
"In general, I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas. Economic development has progressed, but it is important to develop a long-term program," he explained.
He stressed that the current state power has made progress in the government.
"There are areas where you can say that the government has acted more comprehensively, and what I can say is that the government has been working and is aware that there is a lot of work ahead of it," he said.
Arrest for 8 kg of marijuana
A resident of Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days' sentence for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The prosecutor of the republic announced that the drug dealer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was punished for a crime against public health - here the possession of marijuana intended for trade.
According to file AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested on 7 June 2010 by Mexican military officers while monitoring the Cipriano Valdez road in front of Guard No. 80 in the village of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer drove in a white van, holding a black bag in a box in the car and a small backpack in the front passenger seat, in which the military found eight kilos and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the confiscated goods were handed over to the judge of the district and the punished person is still in the prison.
Debt for construction work
The social buildings for migrants provided for in the Habitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 programs run the risk of not being completed due to lack of funds or only with great delay, said Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel López Miranda.
The head of the Municipal Social Development Authority stated that although the construction programs are already advanced, they are now in danger, as the state government has not paid the funds to it, which exceed 11 million pesos for the three programs.
He said the total investment in these three programs amounted to almost 50 million pesos, of which 25 percent fell to the state. So far, only the Federación and the municipality have contributed funds to the construction work, which is expected to delay construction completion.
"They have to contribute 12 million, and although the year is already coming to an end, they haven't given us a penny, and even though they should have paid us a part in July," he said. "To not be too late, we have already started the construction work, and they are already well advanced, but we need the money."
He stressed that under the government of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the state had failed to fulfil its obligations, and that the municipality had to take out a loan of 7 million at the beginning of its reign, equivalent to the amount that the central government would have had to raise.
"We had already done this in the last legislature, because the state did not have sufficient economic resources, the programs continued and this year we had to get the funds that the state had not raised to participate in these programs," he said.
Although the State authorities are obliged to pay these funds, he commented that the Minister of Administration and Finance was asked to accelerate the administrative work and to pay the outstanding share as soon as possible.
"Almost 12 million have to contribute, and although the year is already coming to an end, they haven't given us a penny."
The Court Approves the Transition to Digital Television in Mexico for 2015
The conversion of analogue to digital signals is one of the most important changes in recent years worldwide.
The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) rejected the constitutional lawsuits filed by the Senate and the House of Deputies against the Presidential Decree, and under which the switch from analogue to digital signals from 2021 to 2015 must be forwarded, due to the lack of eight votes required to challenge the law.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, believed that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his responsibilities when he issued the Legislative Decree detailing the switch to terrestrial digital television.
By this decision, the constitutional dispute initiated by the Senate was rejected because it did not receive the necessary qualified majority of eight votes so that the court could decide on constitutionality or non-constitutionality.
In the project for the lawsuit drawn up by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, it was proposed that the legislative decree be declared unconstitutional, since the regulations relating to radio and television are the responsibility of the Comisión Federal de Telecomunicaciones (Cofetel).
In favor of the project only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero themselves voted.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies filed constitutional complaints against the Legislative Decree. After accepting the complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero stopped applying the Legislative Decree and ceased all activities to establish the digital transmission.
The Council of Ministers also rejected the complaint filed by the Chamber of Deputies, without entering into the debate on the project, which was also in charge of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his contribution, the Prime Minister expressed disagreement with the project’s arguments, in the sense that the state government cannot regulate the measures that the public administration is supposed to take by means of general rules.
"I also don't think that doing so would impair the independence of the regulator," she also recalled that for the planning of strategic policies, such as the telecommunications sector, for constitutional reasons, the central government is responsible for managing state affairs.
Replacing analog signals with digital is one of the most important changes that has taken place around the world in recent years, and it results in better use of the radioelectric spectrum, increased signal quality, and more channels.
The postponement of the change, she said, was a postponement of the benefit of digitization, which is a decision in the public interest, which has not only technical aspects, "because it covers economic, social, political and security aspects."
These matters, she stressed, "made the action of the entire system necessary, according to the principle of economic governance by the state, they included a set of features that the Constitution placed in the hands of the central government."
It recalled that many countries around the world had already implemented the digital transition, through the government, despite having highly specialized facilities.
“It cannot be concluded that the government will intervene in the powers of Congress by issuing the contested legislative decree, because the laws passed by the legislature will be complied with,” she assured.
The possibility of counting ballots in Michoacán individually is being considered
According to PrEP, the difference between first and second place in the governor's election is just under 27 percent, with 879 votes out of a total of 6074 not yet counted.
The possibility of single counting of ballots is a reality in the elections in Michoacán this year, because according to the data issued by the Programa de Resultados Electorales Preliminares (PREP), the difference between first and second place in the governor elections is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes out of a total of 6074 not yet counted.
In this sense, the President of the Consejo General del Instituto Electoral de Michoacán (IEM), María de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that just last November 9 the electoral office had adopted a series of regulations to harmonize local regulations with the reforms of the states in electoral matters.
It should be remembered that Michoacán had not adapted his political constitution, electoral law or electoral justice law to the reforms adopted by Congress, so that they did not come into force during this election. Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel avoided their publication in the State Gazette within the deadlines provided for it, arguing that he had no objections to it.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) ruled on the constitutional action filed by the local legislature and judged the state commissioner's vote on constitutional reforms as "invalid and unlawful" since he does not have the right to "decide or veto it."
María de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal explained in an interview about the possibility of individual counting of votes that thanks to the adoption of the guidelines by the Consejo General del IEM, there would now be a possibility that the local electoral authority could count the ballots partially or completely.
Thus, under the following conditions, the votes contained in one or more electoral packages may be partially counted The results in the minutes do not match; the minutes on the counting and calculation of votes are not in the file or are not in the possession of the chairman of the electoral committee or there are obvious errors or amendments in the minutes.
In addition, the total counting of the fully completed ballot papers can take place if there is a difference between the alleged winner and the second-placed winner equal to or less than one percent, provided that at the beginning of the session there is an express request from the party or coalition chairman, who is the second of the aforementioned candidates.
Vote counting may also take place in its entirety if, after completion of the ordinary calculation, it is established that the difference between the alleged winner and the candidate in second place is equal to or less than one percent, provided that there is an explicit request from a representative of the party whose candidate has become second, in which case the electoral packages that have been subjected to a partial counting would be excluded.
It is worth noting that the elections in Morelia are in the same situation where, according to PrEP, the difference between first and second place is just under 0.16 percent, although the votes of 129 out of a total of 923 electoral minutes have not yet been counted.
His Last Will
His ashes will be scattered over the Zapalinamé mountains, the family confirms.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés rushed down to Saltillo, his birthplace, this Sunday evening. On Monday, the show and a mass of the dead took place.
According to family members, the Lieutenant-Colonel's last will was that his ashes be scattered over the Zapalinamé mountains.
After a tribute, the family of Bacio Cortés, along with the others who died in the accident, returned to the capital of Coahuila in an airplane by the Mexican Air Force, the nearest to the Colonel, attending the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At noon, the ashes of the lieutenant-colonel landed on the funeral hall, which is located on Boulevard Nazario Ortiz Garza, and where the family and friends came to.
At 5:30 p.m., his remains were examined at the Technological Institute of Saltillo, where his former fellow students from the technical high school and his American football team, to which Felipe Bacio belonged during his preparations for the high school, led to the body show.
"He wanted to return to Saltillo and spread his ashes over the Zapalinamé Mountains, as he had always told his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
"He was a successful man, exceptional as a father and as a son, a loving brother and he always stood up for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the town of Saltillo very young to enter the school of the Air Force of Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some could not believe it because they thought it would make him dizzy even on a truck, yet he always strived to realize his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers him as a good person. "He had hardly arrived in Saltillo, and already the whole family wanted to greet him, as on the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."
The young man remembers that even at the age of seven, he had gone to Zapopán to graduate his family, so he knows that his uncle died when he did what he liked most: flying an airplane.
A final farewell
The Lieutenant-Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, was passed with all honors under the leadership of Governor Jorge Torres López. Her honor was awarded to him by the people and the government, the Mexican Army of the Sixth Military Area, the Mexican Air Force, headmaster and pupil of the Saltillo Technological Educational Institution, where he also studied as a sports student in 1985 and in both sports.
Bacio Cortés died a few days ago when the helicopter he flew, in which also the Secretary of State José Francisco Blake Mora and six other people from the same authority sat, crashed.
At 6.05 p.m., the cremated remains of Bacio Cortés, a citizen of Saltillo, arrived to be handed over to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, in the forecourt of the barracks, where he was already attended by his relatives, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother and siblings.
The abandoned body was found on a property at Cadereyta NL
A few hours before the discovery, military personnel presented to the media eleven people who had been arrested in the same town in connection with the organized crime.
Three men were found murdered by gunshots in different parts of the body and a merciful shot in an abandoned finca in the town of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The event took place at the mileage point 1.5 of the road from Cadereyta to Santiago at the height of the municipality of El Castillo.
Several transients saw the door of the country house, surrounded by a beige-brown wall, rise to the ground.
When they looked into the house, they found the bodies of three people about three meters further inside, which they immediately notified to the competent authorities.
One wore a yellow T-shirt and dark pants, without shoes; next to him was another who was dressed in a white top.
Nearly a metre away was the body of another person wearing a red T-shirt and blue pants.
All three were on their stomachs.
According to the information obtained on the spot, the three people must have been murdered in another location as no cartridge sleeves were found.
On the wall of the country house there are inscriptions written by an organized gang of criminals to another, and several shots were found in the wall and door.
11 people arrested in Cadereyta
The Secretaria de la Defensa Nacional (Secretariat of State for National Defense) introduced 11 people, including a minor, who were part of a criminal gang that was mainly engaged in the town of Cadereyta, and who are associated with kidnappings, murder, halconeo (hunting) and secret funerals.
According to the information made public, eight people were first arrested on November 11 in the Los Alveros settlement and one prisoner was freed.
Three properties and a cell phone were seized and the detainees confirmed to be members of the criminal group "Los Zetas".
On November 12, at 6 a.m., the military found a car with two occupants without license plates in the village of Rancho Viejo in Cadereyta.
During the inspection of the car, the military found a long weapon, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Later, on November 13 at 2 p.m., one of her accomplices was arrested in the municipality of La Frauda, who attempted to flee at the sight of the military.
They are charged with secret burials in the towns of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
On Wednesday formation of the new Italian government
The Prime Minister-elect, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to introduce the new government to face the crisis that has led Italy to the brink of economic collapse.
The Prime Minister-elect, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to introduce the new government to face the crisis that has led Italy to the brink of economic collapse.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm the formation of the government.
It is expected that he will introduce a cabinet composed of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new prime minister will take office.
Monti said he would present to the president the results of the talks with the political parties on the formation of government.
"I want to reaffirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to cope with these difficult times," the former EU Commissioner told the journalists.
Monti did not explicitly confirm the formation of the government, but his comments indicate that the obstacles have been overcome.
The “framework is now well laid out,” he added.
Monti has managed to form a government in less than three days, which is much less time than normal. Meanwhile, Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has driven the cost of debt to an unbearable level.
The new government, led by former EU Commissioner Monti, must adopt a tough austerity package demanded by Euro politicians in order to regain lost confidence in Italy.
The pressure on Monti to hurry has been exacerbated by the fluctuating market situation, which has strained Italian government bonds at 7 percent interest rates for 10 years, a level that Greece and Ireland have seen themselves forced to apply for the European bailout scheme.
Emma Marcegaglia, president of the Italian industrial association Confindustria, told the press after a meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government to the fullest."
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this emergency situation.
Monti’s chances of success were greatly increased by the support of the PDL party by Silvio Berlusconi, who had to resign on Saturday as a result of the crisis.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are meant to bring good results," said Angelino Alfano, the centre-right party secretary.
The support of the PDL, the largest party in Italy, is essential, because so far many of its members have opposed a government composed of technocrats, which Monti is currently forming.
Support from Parliament
The new Monti government needs strong parliamentary support to implement the probably unpopular austerity measures.
Resistance to his efforts or delaying reforms could once again cause a devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks is also exerting pressure on Montis’ failure to act as a disaster.
Monti started his debates on Monday with political parties, trade unions and business associations, as well as with youth and women’s organisations.
On Tuesday evening, the session will be closed.
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, who initiated an extremely rapid change of government in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite towards the end of last week, when it was announced that Berlusconi would resign, as a result of the uncertainty about the success of the new Prime Minister, the cost of Italian government bonds have once again reached critical limits.
Saving Italy with a national debt of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.8 trillion would be too much for the current EU rescue umbrella.
Monti said his government must last until the next elections, which are expected to be held in 2013, despite predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms, instead of preferring the elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that this should be made up of only technicians, a reference to their concerns in view of the procedure imposed by financial market pressure.
Political sources point out that mutual mistrust and disagreements between parties make the inclusion of people from political life complicated.
Spaniards have more opportunities to play than the Ticos
Of the 22 players retrieved from Spain, ten have over 50 international games on their toes.
On the Costa Rican side, only one of the 22 convened has 50 games behind them.
A huge difference for Costa Rica when comparing the 22 players from both countries for the friendly game, which will take place today at 15:05 at the San José National Stadium.
While the world and European champions, the number one on the monthly ranking of FIFA, can look back on a considerable number of class A selection games, the three-colored team has only defense player Michael Umana as the only one with over 50 international games.
He reached this number last Friday with the match against Panama (0-2) in Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish players who play in the Liga de las Estrellas (Star League) and influential clubs of the Premier League of England have every year the opportunity to participate in numerous home games (League and Cup championships) as well as high-ranking European Cups such as the Champions League.
In addition, the experience with the Spanish fury in complicated elimination games at the Eurocup and the World Cups.
The Tico footballers, on the other hand, have few international matches as part of the Concacaf, which is at the bottom of the FIFA rankings.
We will see the Spanish team draw their last record: goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who scored a tie with former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta last Saturday against England (defeated 0-1 in London) with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play against the three-colored team today and Spain will have a new record of 127 international games.
Xavi Hernández, player of the Barcelona football club, owns 106.
Casillas and Xavi even received a recognition from UEFA last week, along with others of the Iberian team who had reached the magic number 100: the cited Zubizarreta with 126 and the midfielder of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
Carles Puyol is also approaching the number Hundred with 97 games.
Xabi Alonso with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos both with 81, Andrés Iniesta with 62, Cesc Fábregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
From the side of the Ticos and close to Michael Umana are left side striker Júnior Díaz with 48 games and striker Bryan Ruiz with 45.
From then on, only five came out on over 30 matches: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The one with the fewest games.
Fewer than 30 matches have been played by the Spanish team Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31) .
On the side of the national team come on less than 30 games Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest is not even approaching the 20th limit.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, Víctor Bolívar has only one in Costa Rica and <0xC3><0x93>lman Vargas and Edder Nelson have not made their debut yet.
The historic goalkeeper of Spain is David Villa with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz scored the most goals with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The quintet included Costa Rica in its tour to celebrate its 20th anniversary
"To play in Costa Rica is a dream come true"
In the exclusive talk with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam says the band is ready to give one of their best concerts at the National Stadium next Sunday.
They were expected for more than 20 years, but the band assures them that a dream will come true for them when they play in Costa Rica.
The bassist and co-founder of the group, Jeff Ament, assured that Viva gave an exclusive interview from Brazil last week.
The band is in the South American part of their tour to celebrate their twentieth anniversary and on Sunday, the 20th, they make their only stop in Central America.
On that day, they will perform at the National Stadium from 7.30 p.m. together with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica.
They read an excerpt from the conversation, whose full copy can be found in the online edition of La Nación.
For your Costa Rican fans, a dream comes true when Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: Are you aware of what that means for your fans?
Playing in Costa Rica is a dream come true for us.
This is just the second time we’ve played in South and Central America, and so far it’s been great.
I’ve only been to Costa Rica for a holiday, it’s such a beautiful country that we’re sure to stay there for a few more days.
It is exciting for us to bring our music there.
I ask you this because the fans of the band are completely devoted and they are experiencing the days before the concert most intensely.
What do you say to your most enthusiastic fans?
Thank you for being with us all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and we are sorry to have taken so long to get here.
Some people even think that your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
Doesn't that put a little pressure on your visit?
Some of the greatest shows we’ve done in the last 21 years took place in the last two weeks.
We played at a few giant shows in Sao Paulo and we hope they made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
We really want to play there.
We love this country, we love surfing and we love the jungle. Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you get to know Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
Many of our friends are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo, where the waves are simply unimaginable.
My friends have always gone to Costa Rica and Nicaragua for surfing. Together with Mexico, these are excellent areas for surfing. In this way, we learned about people who love surfing.
With a view of the tour you have offered giant shows with many songs.
What are your plans for the event in Costa Rica?
Since we have never played there before, we also set no limits.
We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs. We want to play a few songs from each album and offer our fans a good and versatile repertoire.
You never repeat your repertoire.
- Why?
I think that’s partly because we have nine records and we can play over 120 songs, and each one likes a different song, so it’s not easy to decide which one we’re going to play.
If we add two or three songs that we haven’t played for a long time, we can better maintain our concentration and they surprise us because they remind us of the reasons why we liked these songs. Otherwise, they might fall into oblivion.
This makes the show more interesting for us and I believe, therefore also for the audience.
With this tour, you celebrate your twenty-year history.
When you look back, do you find it hard to believe in your success?
Yeah, totally.
First of all, I don’t think any of us imagined playing in a great rock band for over 20 years, which sounds like a dream.
We also continue to rely on this blessing and find it great to be able to make music together even now.
We like each other and are enthusiastic about producing music.
We are lucky to be able to drive to the places of the world that we have always wanted to visit.
Things couldn't be better.
What did it mean for you to participate actively in the birth of the grunge?
It has always been an honor to be part of this group of great bands.
We are good friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising and abundantly unusual when a movement emerges from a group of friends.
Occasionally a band emerges from a city, but it is unusual when five or ten groups come from the same city at the same time.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle Group.
Sometimes we still play together.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw Soundgarden on their tour. We’re still excited to be friends with them all and we’re honored to be part of this emerging Seattle sound.
It’s also very unusual for a band like yours to stay together with the same musicians for so long.
Yes, four of us have been playing together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago. That alone is much more time than many bands survive.
First of all, I believe that we are all lucky to be still alive and, moreover, we care about each other.
We are all close friends, which is why musical paths have opened up that give everyone the freedom to experiment.
One trusts the other and his music. We couldn't be better.
Your relationship to fame has not always been easy, but thanks to your success, you have always been able to do what you wanted.
How do you find balance?
The way we have grown has made it easier for us to find balance.
We make sure not to be on tour too often, because it’s too easy to fall for this game with huge crowds that love your music.
As long as you remember that people came because of the music, it reminds you that you have to pay attention to the music and what it has brought to life without being obsessed with being a famous rock star.
What memories do you have of your other project Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote very good songs and in the beginning it was great.
We were a band for three years that had never released a record until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods).
We were disappointed to have taken so long. We are still good friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who built the band with us. When I hear a song or see photos, I think about what an incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh. It was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh together and talk about other things and about music and football.
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him.
The domestic band Las Robertas are responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that’s why you chose the band for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos from several groups and we liked this band best. So we are curious to see what Las Robertas can offer live. This will be exciting.
Why do you always change the lyrics of Yellow Ledbetter when you play live?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I have no idea.
He sings it, and I think he sings the first thing that comes to his mind.
Who influenced you as a bassist?
So many+
The first ones I remember are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bass players I like.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the grunge alive, even though it’s no longer a fashion phenomenon?
I don't think we all feel very connected to the word grunge.
When I think about it, I think of the bands I mentioned before, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others that came up at the same time. If they’re still important today, I think that’s great because it’s worth listening to, and bands like Mudhoney are making better music now than ever.
At first her music was darker, now she is more positive.
- Why?
That's interesting because I think there are a few songs on the new album that might seem a little lighthearted, but there are other songs like The End or Just Breathe that are classified as very dark songs, although they also have something positive about them.
Both of them tears came to me when I heard Ed playing them. They're very dark songs.
I think when you get older and something traumatic has happened in your life – for example, when you lose a family member or a friend – that affects your artistic work and your music and these two songs clearly embody it for me.
But I also believe that you can be a happy person and still make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori returned to hospital for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was admitted to a public hospital on Tuesday to investigate the muscle loss of his legs, his family doctor informed.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, who is serving 25 years in prison for human rights violations during his reign (1990-2000), has several illnesses, including tongue cancer, which has been operated on four times and is under control.
Alejandro Aguinaga, Congressman and his personal doctor, told television that Fujimori was being examined for three days at the Peruvian Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplásicas Hospital to determine the reason for his pain and muscle loss in the lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion, Fujimori could be pardoned for humanitarian reasons, but he did not wish to do so because he thought he was innocent.
He was operated on four times on tongue cancer and lost 18 kilos of weight, along with other conditions such as severe erosive gastritis, a cyst in the pancreas, kidney stones, high blood pressure and blood circulation problems in the legs, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has been in the Detention Centre of the Dirección Nacional de Operaciones Especiales de la Policía since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 people by the death squad of the Peruvian army, which was secretly operating during his reign.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political relations
An official delegation led by Uruguayan President José Mujica and composed of several ministers and entrepreneurs will start their visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and discuss political issues of the region
Mujica will meet with his Mexican counterpart Felipe Calderón next Wednesday, which, according to the Uruguayan president, will be the highlight of his busy schedule with politicians, businessmen and a meeting with the collective of Uruguayans living in Mexico.
The meeting of the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara "is suitable for the exchange of information on all policy areas between the two countries," the South American country's presidential office announced on its website.
According to local media, Mujica seeks support from Calderón regarding the French incident when French Prime Minister Nicolas Sarkozy put the South American country on a list of tax havens at the G20 summit in the French city of Cannes.
In his discourse, Sarkozy threatened to exclude those countries that still act as tax havens from the international community. This statement was rejected by Uruguay and prompted a request to his ambassador to the European country.
Mexico has presided over the G20 since November, a group consisting of the most powerful emerging and industrialized countries in the world. Since January of this year, a tax information exchange agreement has been in place to avoid double taxation with the South American country.
In recent years, the government of Uruguay has tried to speed up the concretization of agreements on the exchange of tax information in order to be removed from the "gray list" of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which includes countries that have not implemented all international standards for tax cooperation.
At the business level, a free trade agreement has been in place between Mexico and Uruguay since 2004, which has contributed to a growing exchange of goods between the two countries.
The mustache installer enters the third dimension with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has struggled tirelessly for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but never in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land", he fights for the girl's love in stereo technology.
The game, which is coming to stores around the world this month, has been tailored from the beginning to the features of the Nintende 3DS portable console, which allows you to play three-dimensionally without a special pair of glasses.
"Mario is the character who has to say how stereoscopy works without glasses," said Omar <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, responsible for the press specializing in Nintendo in Spain at the launch of the video game in Madrid.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez stated that “Super Mario 3D Land” is “the first video game from Nintendo that has been developed for this console since the beginning” because hit items such as “Star Fox 64 3D” or “Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D” have been customizations of existing titles.
Nintendo's spokesman underlined that although it's three-dimensional, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "affordable" video game that allows for a fast, smooth gameplay.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contained two games in one: the first part is "easy" to capture the less skilled users.
After that, the experts can "turn a second round" across the different levels of the game, which are becoming increasingly difficult.
In addition, users can choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action. However, to overcome the obstacles without becoming a victim of the "optical effects", you always have to play three-dimensionally.
This outing of Super Mario into the three-dimensional world also means the character’s return to a portable console, which has not been the case since 2005.
With this video game, Nintendo winks at the fans of the saga and repeats the recipe for success of the last editions: the mustache-like installer must overcome dangerous platforms to free Princess Peach.
However, the player encounters news on the movements, the environment, the disguises and the enemies - and a "playable" Luigi.
Colom guarantees Portillo's extradition to the United States
Guatemala’s President, <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Colom, announced on Tuesday that he would consent to the extradition of former governor Alfonso Portillo so that he would be responsible in the United States for the $70 million money laundering conspiracy.
Thus, the trial of the U.S. request for extradition of Portillo ends so that it can be brought to justice there.
In a press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was based on independence from the judiciary and government, considering that a decision-making court had already ordered extradition.
He stressed that during his reign, he did not interfere in court decisions and accepted all extradition requests that he was notified of.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín is extradited for murder and serious assault, Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Colom's action is an act of government that takes place when all courts and constitutional bodies have been exhausted to condemn the former President of the State (2000-2004).
According to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court of Guatemala, Portillo must be extradited when his legal situation in Guatemalte is clarified and his human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted of the embezzlement of 120 million quetzals in the Ministry of Defence during his reign. This negotiation preceded the extradition, but the minister objected and revived the case.
Trinijove has helped 6000 young people at risk of social exclusion
The organization was created to prevent the marginalisation of young people without vocational training.
The first 25 years of life of the Trinijove social welfare organization have led to important results: In this quarter of a century, 6,000 young people at risk of social exclusion were supported to find a way out of their difficult situation.
In addition, there are more than 100 jobs created for this social group.
On the occasion of the anniversary, a balance sheet was drawn yesterday at an event in the former factory buildings of Fabra i Coats, in which more than 300 people participated.
Trinijove was founded in 1986 in the Trinitat Vella district with the aim of helping young people with low levels of education, without work, with drug problems at risk of marginality.
Yesterday’s celebration in Sant Andreu was attended by many leaders of institutions and institutions that have worked with the association in these 25 years.
The participation of political representatives from different directions during election campaign times proved the impartiality of the work done by Trinijove.
Apart from the President of the Generalitat (Parliament of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia), Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol participated in the celebrations of the former socialist education minister Ernest Maragall and the former mayor and current left-green city councillor Ricard Goma.
The large hall of Fabra i Coats was also visited by the current Catalan Minister of Social Affairs and Family Affairs, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director General of the Social Work of the Savings Bank La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas stressed that Trinijove was created in very difficult times and that today's times are no less complicated, but he added that the work done so far is "a good foundation".
For the President of the Generalitat, Trinijove is an example that knows how to fight against difficult circumstances and gives hope to people in difficulty.
"The economic crisis is nothing new to the club and the work it does," he said.
Occupied house where giant parties were held was cleared
The homeowners had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building on the street Balmes 51 (Barcelona).
The twelve squatters left the building yesterday afternoon without resisting.
Everything indicates that the nightmares of the neighbors of House No. 51 on Balmes Street have come to an end.
Twelve people left yesterday at noon voluntarily the building they had illegally occupied and where they had organized huge festivals that had driven the neighbourhood to despair. The eviction took place on a judicial order without any police intervention.
After the evacuation, the door lock was replaced to avoid a similar situation.
"From now on, access will be controlled," the property manager confirmed.
The squatters, who had occupied 11 of the building's 13 apartments - the rest were inhabited - took the entire electrical system and part of the water supply, painted the walls and left all kinds of trash, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
On the three lower floors, huge parties lasting up to two days were celebrated, driving the tenants to despair.
Next to the building is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which also suffered damage from it.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europa Press that her business had declined by 80% since the start of the occupation.
The owner of the discotheque pointed out that the squatters were making their unfair competition, because they sold the drinks for three euros, while they cost 10 euros in the discotheque.
In addition, the owner of the leisure venue had been accused by the neighbors of disturbance to the rest, while according to her statement, the noise was not from the visitors of the disco, but from the house occupiers and especially from the guests of the festivals that were organized there, which, according to the angry neighbors, have become more and more long in recent weeks.
The manager of the discotheque explained that the harassment was so great that she agreed with the owner of the building not to have to pay rent for the last nine months.
The Guardia Urbana also confirmed that it had received more complaints from its neighbors in recent weeks.
The leader of the PP (Partido Popular - People's Party) in the city council of Barcelona, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had asked last week to clear the building without delay and to tackle the problems of bourgeois coexistence and the downfall of the neighborhood.
He explained that only one floor of the building had been occupied before the summer, but that the squatters had penetrated into all floors of the building and almost all apartments in recent months. In some cases, there had even been theft.
In that sense, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to take action against the anti-social acts in the building."
Yesterday another building in the Nou Barris district was cleared by the Catalan police.
At 3:30 p.m., police approached Montral No. 35 after receiving a call from a neighbor who had watched four people attempt to enter the building.
The four were immediately arrested.
Park or mountain?
Apart from the disputes about the fees, the architects agree with the tender.
The urban tender for the 16 gates reopens the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the now-disappearing Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this administration published its libel about the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona city.
He was even compared in numbers to Central Park of New York.
With the fall of the CMB in 1987, the park became the upper limit of Barcelona in the eyes of many, because the capital of Catalonia is one of the few that does not spread in the north-south direction, but up (mountains) and down (sea).
The classification of Collserolas as a natural park plays with this idea.
As an example, it was no longer Central Park, but Yellowstone with wild boars in the role of yogis.
This was the case when the city issued a huge tender in September, consisting of 16 competitions, for further gates to Collserola.
Without a doubt, a gate points to the concept of a park.
Either that's the case, or someone is planning to set gates to the countryside.
The question arises of itself: Collserola, park or mountain?
The invitation to tender is the topic of discussion for all Barcelona architects, not only from an organisational point of view, but also with a view to reflecting on the city.
It is almost a recurring theme that two members of this old caste, who meet in the elevator, can draw on.
And this fact provides the material for one of the rare similarities between what three architects from Barcelona think about it and some university professors who applied for the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The tender is appropriate.
For Roldán, it is "necessary" to speak of the "front on the mountain" after the attack on the coast, insofar as the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, about the green apples, has not been carried out.
“You should start with the principle that Barcelona’s largest park is the beach.
Among other things, because it is easily accessible.
Collserola is more complex", the architect considers, for which the title "Gates of Collserola" carries a "lexical trap": it is not to be "imagined as access to a park, but as a delimitation of areas on which to act."
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with urban planning experience, considers the proposal to be an "intellectual challenge" that carries "some dangers".
Dangers arising from the "uncertainty that the design of a public space entails today" following the experiences from the 1980s, which had their "swan song" in the area of the forum.
The first fear is one's own limitation on what may be cultivated.
"Limiting something always means determining the next step", i.e. exceeding it.
"You have to think about new urban planning tools, because the current [referring to the Plan General Metropolitano (PGM)] can lead to a real disaster."
Modol, who holds closer to the question, says simplified, the side of Collserola, which goes towards Vallesana, "can be understood as a park that does not go towards Barcelona", for purely topographical reasons.
Modol recalls that there is already a study by the Patronat de Collserola, which should not "be stumbled upon deaf ears", although he is grateful to the city council for giving its body the opportunity to participate in this project "from the first moment".
He also notes that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the guiding letter that allows architects to participate in the debate, although he expresses his "doubts" about whether this technical profile should lead the multidisciplinary teams established ("just the right thing," he says) "We architects should only be a tool."
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question in the headline of this article is complex, as in the tender conditions a global view of Collserola is missing: "There were 16 competitions advertised in cross-section," he says, "on the axis mountain-sea. But there is no longitudinal perspective that looks at the area in its entirety."
At least in his case, this led him to take part in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the program and the definition of a project for a gate would collide with that of the architect of the gate next to it.
In his opinion, the city should absolutely guarantee that the strip directly above the Ronda de Dalt is equipped in its entire length to create a soft transition between the city and green areas.
Casino awards Jonás Larrazábal who comes free
After 72 days of silence, the representative of Casino Red freed the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey from the trial being held against him for alleged blackmail.
After 72 days of imprisonment, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal is released after the representative of Casino Red has granted him a pardon before the Second Criminal Court of the District leading the trial against the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey for extortion.
After the assassination of Casino Royale, Sergio Gil García, the owner of Casino Red, published a series of photos and videos showing Manuel Jonás, who allegedly forced him to pay a sum of money so that the city council would approve the secret operation of the betting house.
After the criminal complaint, the prosecution opened a criminal proceedings against the brother of the panic mayor, who was arrested on September 2 for 30 days.
After four hours with the official of the Ministerio Público 3 en Delitos Patrimoniales, he was taken to the Casa de Arraigo 1 in the Antiguo Barrio of the capital.
He remained there 49 days after a second arrest warrant, after the official of the Ministerio Público had dismissed the crimes for bribery and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to Cadereyta Detention Centre for allegedly bribing the owners of Casino Red with one and a half million pesos, while remaining in the middle security wing for only a few hours under threat of death.
The authorities allowed him to participate in the trial as an inmate of the municipal prison of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On October 25, a detention order was delivered to him by the Secretary of the Second District Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who found that, after nearly two months of investigation, there was sufficient evidence to convict Jonás for paying 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the betting house in exchange for opening it.
This Monday, the representative of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, asked the judge José Luis Pecina, the brother of the mayor, to release the sentence, which is why he will be released in the next few hours.
During the court hearing, Ramiro Arias, the official of the Ministerio Público assigned to the court, García Gómez, asked whether he had repaired the damage and which owner of the betting house had given his pardon, but the lawyer withheld the name.
According to Case 197/2011, Jonás Larrazábal is acquitted, and no appeals against the proceedings can be filed in the following, and no damages are demanded.
After the hearing of the representative of the betting house at 3.50 p.m., Larrazabal Bretón was immediately set free.
The court secretary, Jorge Yánez, drove to the municipal jail of San Nicolás de los Garza to inform Jonás that he had been acquitted and that his case would be filed.
He also informed him of the court order for immediate release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the plane crash that killed Secretary of Government Francisco Blake and seven other people.
The Secretaria de Comunicaciones y Transportes - SCT (Secretariat for Communications and Transport in Mexico) informed that the findings of the investigation into the accident in which the Secretary of Government Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people were killed indicate that the helicopter with its entire intact structure had collided directly against the ground without the pilot having been able to conduct an emergency landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transportation, said the pilot had confirmed before launch that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
"The fact that the propeller wing was in contact with trees at a height of 25 meters, with the helicopter losing the hull, seems to indicate that the helicopter had had several ground contacts."
He also explained that the helicopter was built for 19 occupants, which is why it met all the prerequisites for transporting the personnel.
In addition, he said that no helicopter parts were found in the investigations in the area where the aircraft had crashed.
"No aircraft parts were found elsewhere during the search, the surcharge affected the entire structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 occupants, which is why it met all the requirements for passenger transport.
The area has a slope of 7 to 30 degrees.
Currently, it is a priority to get the results of the investigation as soon as possible, but it can take several months, perhaps even a year.
For his part, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (Secretariat for Aircraft and Auxiliary Services in Mexico), assured that the helicopter from the Estado Mayor Presidencial had flown at cruise speed and the plane fell on a soft slope.
"This information reinforces the assumption that it was a normal flight operation at the time of the impact."
At a press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six relevant points that should be taken into account in the investigation:
Visible flight:
In accordance with the flight norms, it was a flight according to the rules of visual flight, which means that the crew must have had sufficient visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The AICM recorded suitable weather conditions during the take-off and during the flight onwards towards the border area between Mexico City and Mexico State, some low-hanging clouds rose.
Selected flight routes:
It is possible that the team had chosen a lower area with better visibility towards the Cuernavaca Valley because of the clouds.
Impact spot:
The impact coordinates and the last radar record of the helicopter match. There may have been no loss of control over the aircraft or deviation from the flight route prior to the impact.
Spreading the remains of the aircraft in a limited area:
The information available to date indicates that the helicopter had impacted from a straight and lateral direction.
The pattern of the scattered aircraft remains suggests that the helicopter, with its intact structure, had collided with the ground.
No signs of fire or explosion:
The remains of the plane at the scene of the accident do not indicate fire or explosion.
The latest findings indicate several ground contacts.
On-site investigations found aircraft parts at an altitude of 9,200 feet above sea level, with slopes of 7 to 30 degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter probably broke.
Some information suggests that the helicopter may have had multiple ground contacts.
After a meticulous search in an area beyond the locked area at the crash site, no scattered aircraft parts could be found, intensifying the assumption that the intact aircraft structure had collided with the ground.
MSS Announces a Research Protocol to Find the Gene for Obesity
She leads a research project to find the gene for obesity in children and adolescents, which is supported by specialists of the IPN.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Mexico Social Insurance Institute) announced that it is conducting a research project to discover the gene for obesity in children and adolescents under the title "Genetics of Obesity in Childhood and Adolescence" to find the genetic markers associated with obesity.
Miguel Cruz López, head of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquímica (Department of Medical Research, focus on Biochemistry) at the Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI Clinic, explained that an interdisciplinary team consisting of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers has been set up.
This team is supported by specialists and students of the postgraduate program at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The population is invited to participate in the study. Interested parties can come to the sports grounds of the IMSS in the Valley of Mexico, where tests with children and adolescents are carried out every Saturday from 8 a.m.
He stressed that the investigation began at the sports field of Cuauhtémoc (west of the state of México) and will continue since October 8 at the sports field of Nezahualcóyolt (east of the state of México).
When the target of 500 to 600 investigators is reached, the study will continue on the sports field of Independencia (south of the capital district) and be completed on that of Morelos (north of the capital district).
He explained that the goal of the study is to get to know the factors and the role of genetics in the development of obesity and to identify risk factors of Mexican children and adolescents for the prevention of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the World Diabetes Day, he stated that the aim is for three thousand children and adolescents aged six to 14 to complete nutritional questionnaires with the consent and supervision of their parents.
They will also be asked questions about their physical activity and family history of disease to control risk factors that could lead to diabetes or kidney failure.
He further explained that on the aforementioned Saturdays the subjects were measured (weight, size, waist circumference), their blood pressure was controlled and blood values such as glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (trying to identify genes associated with childhood obesity) were determined.
Cruz López stressed that this investigation would be conducted on the occasion of health care staff concerns about the alarming weight gain of young people.
"The health surveys from 1999 and 2006 showed that in just under six years, the proportion of obese boys increased by 77 percent and that of girls with obesity by 47 percent, and obesity increased dramatically," the IMSS specialist stressed.
He stated that the search for genetic markers is justified because the genetic history of the population of Mexico is different from that of other peoples.
He stated that on average, a (e) Mexican (in) is 65 percent of Native American, 30 percent of European and 5 percent of African descent, which is reflected in the genes associated with diabetes and obesity.
In general, he explained that the genetics of obesity are expressed in the inability to burn the excess of energy (calories) consumed by us, so that it is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the study participants would be a comprehensive study of the children, in which it would be determined whether they had a degree of obesity or obesity.
It would even examine the occurrence of dark skin folds in the neck and inner arm (acanthosis), which indicate the likelihood of metabolic disorders and diabetes in the pre-stage.
All information will be kept confidential and will be communicated in writing to the parents by the doctors, who will explain all measurement results to the parents and suggest lifestyle changes that are appropriate to prevent disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three fundamental factors responsible for obesity, obesity and other chronic diseases: lack of exercise in everyday life, spending most of the day in front of the TV and using transportation instead of walking short distances.
The high calorie intake, that is, increased consumption of sugared drinks and carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) together with a high fat and protein intake, as well as the genetics to be analyzed in this research project.
Asphalt from UNAM prevents potholes
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry at the Mexican University of UNAM, develops modified asphalts with polymers to make the mixture more resistant to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations
If attention were paid to the signs emerging from the road pavement, it would not be necessary to repair nearly 200,000 potholes when the rainy season breaks out in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (city area of the valley of Mexico), said Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) at the University of UNAM.
In his lecture "Technical Impact Holes", which he gave on the occasion of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory he is responsible for is developing polymer-modified asphalts to produce a mixture similar to the asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera said that this type of modified asphalt should be used in areas with extremely hot climates, such as in some cities in the north of the country, to improve the behavior of the road surface and thus avoid the appearance of potholes.
He explained that the asphalt - the heaviest part of petroleum - is a hydrocarbon compound, one part of which has a high molecular weight - the so-called asphalts - and the other part a low one - the so-called malthene. Together, they give the road surface its characteristic toughness behavior.
Toughly elastic behavior of the asphalt means that it behaves like a liquid at high temperatures of almost 180° C., at 120° C. it is very viscous and almost solid at 50° C., while it becomes brittle at very low temperatures.
"This means that the resistance of the asphalt on the roads is not uniform, but changes in one day depending on the weather conditions and temperature fluctuations," the chemical engineer explained.
The FQ’s researcher noted that the streets of Mexico City had a majority of flexible road surfaces composed of six layers of material, the last three of which included asphalt.
Between the top layers lies a wear layer of asphalt, which consists of small stones bathed in asphalt and then solidified.
Every single stone of this wear layer was bathed in asphalt.
If the vehicles move on it and forces are generated, this layer allows a good distribution of forces in the road surface.
"If it were modified asphalt, the forces would spread even better," said the chemical engineer.
"Above the wear layer," he explained, "a last layer is laid out, the so-called support layer, which consists of tiny stones, i.e. sand, which was also bathed in asphalt.
Since this layer is in contact with the vehicle tires, it requires a greater mechanical force than the wear layer and it must produce friction.
The one that receives and distributes the most forces from this road surface also requires the supporting layer to have an appropriate thickness and the material it is made of must be maintained.
The weather conditions, especially humidity and temperature fluctuations, are other important factors to consider, especially the water," he said, "because it significantly affects the wear layer's behavior.
When the terrain becomes moist, water enters the layer and is difficult to exit, causing a softening of all layers of the road surface and, as a result, the appearance of potholes.
When a pothole is created," he said, "the outer layer is first removed, while the wear layer is only affected afterwards. But the damage does not occur immediately, but it is a process that would have to be maintained at the first signs by appropriate maintenance programs."
The member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (National Research System of Mexico) stated that the vehicle load is another important cause of potholes, so the thickness of each layer of the road surface must always be proportional to the vehicle load and that this regulation must be complied with to avoid frequent potholes.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that there was still a lot of research to be done, for example on asphalt emulsions, which are even already on the market in other countries, and with which the potholes can be repaired easily and without the use of high temperatures.

Once again, Valle del Cauca ran out of money in the awarding of the crown for Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina Ramírez Serna had to be content to be on the winning podium, to show off a silver crown and the ribbon that identifies her as the new Miss Colombia.
With the result obtained that night in Cartagena, in 1989, in 1989, in 1989, in 1989, in 1989, in 1989, in 1989, in 1989, in 1989, in 1989, in 1989, in 1989, in 1989, in 1989, in 1989, in 1989, in 1989, in 1989, in 1989, in 1989, in 1989, in 1989, in 1989, in 1989, in 1989, in 1989, in 1989.
The big question that many people are asking today is: What is missing?
The result is the decline of a great favorite who showed at every show that she had everything she needed to be the new Miss Colombia. It was not for nothing that she had been elected Queen of the Police and Mejor Rostro Jolie of Vogue, titles that the beauty queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro had also received, and who took home the Miss Colombia crown.
The first factor that is decisive for the jury’s decision to appoint her to the First Miss is that she did not convince the answer to the question “Which book influenced you the most and why?”, which was asked to her by Martín Murillo Gómez of the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca replied to the questioner:
"I read a lot, I pretty much believe in literature, I think it's a way of civilizing itself, ultimately I believe that the book that shaped my childhood most strongly, 'The Little Prince', is a pretty deep book.
I'm currently reading 'Guilty and Atonement'. It's a book of universal culture that we should all read. I'm just reading a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book called 'Passions'.
An answer that encountered little mutual love, firstly because of the notion of “civilize” and secondly because it had not explained concretely how each book she mentioned had influenced her.
But at the conclusion of the ceremony, Melina explained to feel calm and happy with the result: "The universe is wise, it happens what must happen.
And for all the people, please read a little bit of 'The Little Prince'. It's a great book.
Among other things, it is said that the favorite of El Valle is burnt out.
A journalist from Bogota suggested that the fact that she was the preferred one who received all the applause and had received all the prizes in advance (Easter gastronomy competition, public vote on the best handmade costume and Reina Madre), "had made the other candidates jealous, which stressed the queen, who therefore could not shine on stage."
And you noticed that on their first performance in a swimsuit on the beach of the Hilton Hotel and on their two elevators at the coronation celebration.
Although she performed safely with both, she lacked the strength and momentum that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico showed.
Ariel Osorio, journalist for the Como en casa program on Channel RCN, said that the fact that Melina was crowned Miss "shows that the candidate who wins the most prizes during the competition does not become queen after all".
In addition, Valle avoided the end of the press - a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle could not convince the jury about their interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
It will already have its reason that two days before the composition of the international jury Lucy Doughty stated that they were looking for a woman who was committed to the social affairs of her country.
"Beauty alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia. You have to look beyond the physical and focus on the social feeling, on the fact that she had already worked on projects before taking part in the competition," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle had sinned with her derriere and fibrosis defects, which were noticed in her stomach area, but this is contradictory, because the jury chose her as a candidate for ‘natural beauty’ with a healthy body, good nutritional habits and responsible physical work.
The Queens' coach, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina didn't have the best body, that there would be better, "but her problem with the fibrosis on the abdomen, which was frankly hard to notice for me, pushed her score on the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of the magazine Cromos believes that the mistake of the woman from Valle del Cauca was the surgical procedures she had undergone.
"The operations are okay, but Valle didn't know how to make them right.
Her body has never been her strong side, and this place she had to pay."
Because of this prize, which will be awarded for the first time by the National Beauty Competition, a cruel prediction emerged after the appearance in the swimsuit, which was to come true at night. It was whispered that Raymundo Melina had given a consolation prize in order not to allow her to enjoy the crown.
Whether this is true or not, the fact is that Melina is starting her reign from today, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that offers her the opportunity to represent Colombia at one of the international competitions on appointment of the National Beauty Competition.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who had escaped the crown despite her overwhelming appearance for Cartagena.
So was the work of the doctor who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A lophoscopicist from Cali went down in history as the man who identified "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials plays a key role.
On November 4th, a lophoscopicist from the Cali Prosecutor’s Unit (CTI) came in as the man who confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Forzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia – Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces): “Alfonso Cano” by comparing the fingerprints.
Of the seven lophoscopicists in the CTI department, this week Eliazar González, a Puerto Tejada man who has been involved in criminal investigations for 21 years, was on standby.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in communities of Chocó, where he often had to spend five days in the jungle to reach the place where the bodies were to be identified.
In 2000 he moved to Valle and after completing the required courses he specialized in lophoscopy, which is the examination of the skin that is exposed to friction, i.e. the palms of the hands and feet.
In the week of the deployment against the so-called Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was advised to pack clothes for at least three days.
Something big awaited him.
Friday night he flew in a helicopter from Palmira to Cauca.
He knew that he was supposed to identify two bodies and that one was suspected to be the man who led the world's oldest guerrilla, so he was supposed to take the ten-finger print sheet of Guillermo León Sáenz (his actual name).
However, when he reached the place where the body was with the investigator, he could not identify him because of his physical appearance, because this was not in the slightest similar to the pictures he had seen in the mass media.
He had no beard, was dressed like a farmer of the area, was not wearing glasses and was much thinner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Armed with a magnifying glass, ink, a planter and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the body’s fingerprints to those on the print sheet.
He had seen it right: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, this Puerto Tejada man was in charge of informing the Defense Minister, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that he was indeed the head of the FARC.
In search of traces
For a dactyloscope from the Sijín in Cali, the appreciation given by President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González at a press conference on the use of "Cano" was very important.
Many people do not know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science with no error rate, which can be a key factor in resolving a crime.
Lophoscopics not only identify bodies, they also support investigations into murder and robbery cases and confirm the identity of the detained persons.
At their arrest, many offenders present false ID documents or they have none.
We take their fingerprints and search for them in the database.
The researcher told us that in the event of a theft, he had to tear a piece of wall out of a house, because the thief had supported himself with his hand at this very point when he pulled out a safe filled with jewelry and money.
"Walls are difficult because their surfaces are unsuitable for fingerprint picking, but in this case we were able to take the imprint of the whole hand and identify the offender who had participated in several thefts," he recalled.
With the help of fingerprints, murder suspects can also be relieved or charged.
Recently, a dead person was found surrounded by bottles of liquor.
In the investigation, it was suspected that a family member could be suspicious, and in fact a fingerprint on the bottle matched.
Although this does not guarantee that the murderer is involved, he is still associated with the place where the crime was committed.
A CTI dactyloscopyist explained that "the fingerprints with chemical or physical reagents were taken from the object."
When they appear, a planting cell or tape is used for taking away.
Afterwards, the prints are sent to the Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the Register of Persons.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without identity documents," explained the expert from the CTI.
He said that not everything was as it would be in the TV series SCI.
Just as not everything that shines is gold, not everything you touch is a fingerprint.
But it can still be used if you carry out a corresponding comparison.
The “Infuriated” Challenge New York Authorities
Hundreds of protesters gathered in tents on Zuccotti Square.
A large part followed the eviction order and moved its location to a nearby park.
Members of the Ocupy Wall Street movement challenged New York authorities this Tuesday as they tried again to enter Manhattan Square with a court order after being cleared of the square at dawn and trying to occupy another place on the Big Apple.
Hundreds of protesters crowded in front of Zuccotti Square, where she tried to gain access with a court order allowing the "indigned" to camp again at this point. Meanwhile, another part of the movement adhered to the eviction order and occupied a park further north in the city, where there were nine arrests.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp on the square, we will gather in another place and continue the battle by legal means for the return to Zuccotti, with sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations," said Mark Bray, one of the spokespersons for the Ocupy Wall Street movement.
Bray explained that the response of the "indigned" to the eviction of their tent camp, which had been ordered directly by Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, came to court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the violent eviction of the square and permitting the protesters to camp.
In addition, the indignants occupied a new park, located at the intersection of centrally located Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel that connects New York and New Jersey, and owned by Trinity Church.
They were able to occupy the place for at least an hour, but afterwards the police arrived and arrested some of the protesters, although Bray cannot give exact figures. He assured the Efe news agency that he also saw several journalists handcuffed.
The organization assures that hundreds of people came to this point, where a delegation of religious leaders also arrived as a sign of their support of the members of the movement and for mediation with the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square (a privately owned site) remains closed in anticipation of a judicial hearing scheduled for Tuesday, in which the legality of the eviction that took place at dawn will be analyzed.
Some of the square-driven protesters carried and distributed photocopies of this court order, and even handed it to some police officers guarding the square, which resulted in "some small clashes," Bray reported, who had reported that some police officers had beaten protesters.
The court order prohibits authorities from evicting members of Occupy Wall Street from the square, as well as applying "laws passed after the occupation and prohibiting the protesters from returning to the park with their tents and other items they had previously used."
Mayor Bloomberg made it clear to the press that due to this court order, the reopening of the square to public traffic and the protesters had been lifted, and he noted to the protesters that the city laws did not allow them to re-establish themselves with tents and sleeping bags at the place.
The mayor personally defended the eviction of Zuccotti Square, carried out at dawn, where nearly 200 people were arrested, and which was decided because the protesters "violated the law."
Bloomberg explained that he had given the order to evict the square because it had “transformed into a place where people did not come to protest, but to break the laws and in some cases to harm others,” because “some businesses had received threats” and residents were afraid “of their quality of life.”
"The eviction at dawn was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is basically interested in protecting financial interests and not the interests of North American workers," the movement's spokesman added, accusing the mayor of "disrespecting press freedom."
The leaders of Occupy Wall Street informed that they were considering organizing “big actions” for Thursday, together with community organizations and trade unions, to commemorate the two months that the protests have been taking place since September 17.
Pamela Anderson is in the TV Christmas Show the Virgin Mary
Together with Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, she will perform on December 1 in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas".
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", lifeguard in "Baywatch", rabbit on "Playboy", the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary on a Canadian TV Christmas show.
Private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson, along with "crooner" Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, will perform on December 1 on the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" and breathe life into a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed images of the television program in which Anderson - also for the distribution on the Internet of a self-made porn, in which she appears together with her former husband, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee - acts as the Virgin Mary with a doll in her lap that is supposed to portray Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Native American origin who recently hosted Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" show, appears as a child of Jesus.
CTV’s Christmas program not only focuses on Anderson and Peters, but also on Canadian singer Bublé, who married Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires at the end of March, and who is not far from this controversy.
Recently, at one of his concerts in New York, Bublé described North American Kim Kardashian as a "whore".
Japan is reborn after the earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the spiral of free fall from the beginning of March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, still recovering from the devastating earthquake that led to a nuclear crisis and the worst disaster Japan had experienced during World War II.
The government’s initial estimates in Tokyo rated the property damage to $300,000, a blow that seems to weaken despite the difficult global economic situation.
After three quarters of fall, the data on GDP from July to September were used to finally close this chapter: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% to the year-on-year estimate.
In addition, the second-quarter figure – in Japan the financial year starts in March 2012 – represents the fastest growth since the January to March 2010 period.
The recovery can be partly explained by the sale of machinery for the reconstruction of the areas devastated by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, the companies increased their investments by 1.1% compared to the 0.9% decline for investments recorded from January to March, the first decline after six months of unstoppable increases.
Nevertheless, the actual upheaval of the Japanese economy is not based solely on Keynesian incentives that use the crisis to build or rebuild infrastructure.
Japan has woken up, thanks in particular to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, driven by growing spending on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The stigma of the Yen
Tokyo entrusted itself to the domestic market after the yen – the Japanese currency – became one of the “refugee currencies” of investors fleeing the eurozone debt crisis and the gloomy forecasts for the U.S., a privilege that weighs like a tombstone on exporting companies’ accounts.
With a tougher currency, products abroad are more expensive, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of major technology producers.
Toyota and Sony, for example, attributed their weak business results from July to September to the listing of the yen.
While markets continue to besiege peripheral EU countries, the Yoshihiko Noda government remains vigilant.
"You have to pay attention to the ongoing risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the effects of flooding in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said the Secretary of State for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa.
The perspectives are really not very cheerful.
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said that most member states showed clearer signs of slowing economic development in September.
The indicator, which predicts the turning points of the global economy, revealed that the brakes would have been pulled on the greatest economic potentials.
After all, he dropped by four tenths to 100.4 points compared to the 100.8 in August.
The eurozone is even below that average, which is 100, after falling by eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens raises doubts
Papadimos says the austerity measures will be adopted, but the Conservatives will not sign a written agreement
With peripheral countries’ increased risk premiums and widespread uncertainty, Greece continues to get lost in the labyrinth that emerges from the great European debt crisis.
The impression that the "consensus" of the new interim Greek government is more a reaction to pressure from Brussels than a real conviction of the political forces is slowly being proved by facts.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday pointed out that there were no alternatives to the structural reforms and that the one hundred days agreed upon when he was appointed might be too short for their implementation, the leader of the Nueva Democracia Conservative Party, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would support the new austerity measures and in no way back his call for new elections on the scheduled date, February 19.
"The most important task of this government is to implement the decisions taken at the summit on October 26," Papadimos assured yesterday at the opening of a parliamentary debate that will reach its climax tomorrow with the vote of confidence for the new government.
A package of 24 programmes to promote employment, reform disciplinary legislation for civil servants and new measures against tax evasion are the first initiatives.
Nevertheless, Samara's message does not dispel doubts about his attitude: "We have committed ourselves to supporting the transitional government, but to nothing else."
The conservative leader took a step too far with his challenge to the EU and the IMF, the body that needs to unlock the 8,000 million that Athens desperately needs, and made it clear that he would not approve of a commitment to implement austerity measures.
But the European Commission, which is still irritated by the impact of the poker game with Papandreu referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand was not to be shaken: Economic aid would not be signed if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties “didn’t sign a clear written agreement as soon as possible”.
The spokesman for the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, said that the inspectors of the troika will return to Athens “very soon” to discuss with the new government “what is needed for the payment of the sixth section” amounting to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8,000 million, although there is not yet a definitive date.
The Greek ball still has threads for a while.
Queen Sofia: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen stressed the "predominant" position of Spain in relation to this type of financing
Spain "has achieved a dominant position worldwide in the role of microfinance".
Queen Sofía of Spain recalled yesterday that in the last two decades Spain has become the second donor worldwide for this means of international cooperation, whose "essence" is based on the fact that it is an "instrument for social progress, justice and the hope of a better future for all humanity based on trust in people".
The Queen consecrated yesterday the fifth World Summit on Microfinance in Valladolid. She was convinced that there would be "no doubt" that this type of business would be "absolutely essential" to meet the UN's millennium targets set by 2015 and "especially the goal of limiting the number of people living under the income of less than a dollar a day".
Spain "continues working" on the expansion of the beneficiary network "to the last corner of the world and it is carrying out this task responsibly," noted Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and contributions that will emanate from the summit, which will last until Thursday, will be "the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and especially for women" as the main beneficiaries of these guaranteed loans.
“We’ve had a lot of successes” and “are facing a lot of challenges.”
The summit on microcredit is not only a forum for debate, but also a platform for initiating "two fundamental objectives".
The queen stated that the goal is that by the end of 2015, 175 million poor families will have access to these financial services and that ten million of these households will cross the poverty line.
The concept of microcredit in Spain and the rest of the world goes back to the “path initiated years ago” by Muhammad Yunus, which Queen Sofia considers an “act of justice and recognition”.
She described the father of this financial instrument as an “admirable idealist dedicated to the fight against poverty” and whose work she had known for 15 years when the queen travelled to Bangladesh to get to know the local loan strategy.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and further meetings in Ivory Coast in 1999 and Canada in 2006. "We have seen a continuous development in all of them," explained the Queen, whose commitment to this project earned her yesterday the assessment as "family head" in Valladolid and as "advocate of the poor."
Finally, Queen Sofia concluded her lecture by encouraging the attendees to participate in the debate and to find solutions in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Commandment"
Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that solidarity is "an ethical imperative" for the entire democratic state.
In this sense, she stressed that it was a mistake to tie development aid to times of economic boom, because it was a "permanent commitment".
Jiménez felt that microcredit was a “serious and rigorous policy to eradicate poverty” and that the governments of the industrialized countries now had to work “more than ever” according to solidarity criteria and not allow solidarity to fall victim to the crisis.
For Spain, micro-loans are one of the "most important forms of development aid".
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, applauded "the success", "marginalized" people, "always standing at closed doors" to "give hope" and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present in a city that "opened its gates, infected by the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the EU president on the basis of a general vote
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democrats (CDU on Monday, 14 November in Leipzig) went without real difficulties for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and Chairman of the Christian Democrat Party.
The future of Europe was not originally foreseen in the programme, but it prevailed in the autumn, in particular to satisfy those activists who consider the government policy towards the Greeks today and possibly Italy tomorrow to be too lax.
The European Commission's proposal for a presidency proposed by the Bureau was adopted almost unanimously.
Out of 1001 delegates, only nine had voted against and ten abstained.
The standing ovation lasting several minutes, which was first for Angela Merkel and a few hours later for Wolfgang Schäuble due to their intervention decrees, left no doubt on the part of the three finance ministers who were prone to Europe.
The Chancellor's main idea, as well as the motion for a resolution, is the following slogan: the answer to the crisis is "no less, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because “nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro”.
For the Chancellor, "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe".
This could be reflected in a revision of the Lisbon Treaty, which strengthens the control of the European Union, as regards the budgetary policies of the countries in the euro area; but this could also result in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of a general vote "to give Europe a face".
However, this is definitely one of the proposals adopted by Congress, which was clearly Wolfgang Schäuble’s patron.
Surely, it is unlikely that the 47 will quickly agree on this revolution: Britain is opposed to the matter, and the leaders of the CDU believe to know that Nicolas Sarkozy is of the same opinion.
However, the milestone has been reached.
Likewise, the delegates overwhelmingly rejected the proposal of weighting each country on the ECB’s board according to the weighting of the individual economies, which obviously would entail strengthening Germany’s position.
Consequently, the chancellor, who is concerned about calming the climate within her party, has strengthened the reference points to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but has no longer tried to win her congress at the expense of the "small" or the in trouble European countries, who would immediately criticize the arrogant Germany.
As far as the Europe motion devotes a paragraph to the importance of "German-French friendship", Angela Merkel does not call France on the agenda.
At least not directly.
This reminds us that two centuries ago Leipzig was at the center of a bloody battle.
In fact, one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What does fraud represent in sick reporting?
After the family allowances, UMP and the government are now tackling the sick reports.
Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive in Bordeaux on Tuesday, 15 November, to seek a family allowance and to speak on the issue of the fight against social fraud and economic dependence on the state, which has been recurring since 2007.
To accompany this attack, which emanates from an effort to put the economy to the test, but on the other hand is no less a harbinger of an axis of the right-wing presidential campaign, the majority wants to focus on employee sickness reports.
First, with budgetary objectives: the government aims to introduce a fourth day of retirement before taking into account a sick report for employees in the private sector.
In good German, this means that a sick employee would lose the salary of four days without the specific company’s permission, i.e. at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that, according to the daily "Les Echos", threatens to evoke anger, but would help raise 280 million euros.
And that would go hand in hand with a different measure of a more symbolic character: to grant state officials an unpaid retirement day in case of illness (unlike the three retirement days in the private sector, there is no retirement period for them so far).
While these questions are in the discussion, the majority also rekindles the fraud issue, this time aimed at the abuse associated with absence from work.
"Controls will be much more important, and moreover, they will be repaid if requested," Xavier Betrand warned on Sunday, November 13 against the microphone of RTL.
As in other cases, the impact of this report on the reality of fraudulent actions in the field of sickness reports seems somewhat disproportionate.
In fact, it has been the subject of constant observation and political offensives since 2002, which have produced the most fruitful results.
The French are no more often sick than people elsewhere in Europe.
Let us, however, first focus on the national numbers.
According to the Landeskrankenkasse CNAM, more than 237 million euros were paid in 2006.
According to the Economic Research and Documentation Institute of Healthcare, the daily allowances in 2008 accounted for 11.3 billion euros in 5% of health expenditure.
This figure fell 46% in terms of maternity leave and accidents at work and 54% in terms of sick leave, i.e. 6.2 billion euros.
This is 2.5% health expenditure.
In 2010, compared to the 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting Group, the French were granted on average only 14.5 sick days.
An average that obscures certain differences: another, published in 2007 by Monster.com, the website for career planning, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French workers surveyed said they had not taken a single sick day.
Another study, this time covered by health insurance, clarifies that 37% of sickness reports in 2010 were of less than 8 days duration; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months, and 11% above.
Compared to their European neighbours, French workers therefore tend to be incapacitated no more than elsewhere.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two researchers from the French State Centre for Science Research (CNRS) showed that between 1994 and 2001 the global absence rate (caused by disease or otherwise) oscillated, in France between 10% and 11% versus 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Fraud in sick reporting represents an insignificant proportion of unemployment.
With regard to fraud, only a weak extent is achieved here.
Strengthening the legislation since 2002 means that there are systematic checks on sickness reports that exceed 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (Public College for Technicians and Engineers Education and Training) under 1.5 million controls found that 13% of the 285,000 short-term illnesses reported, i.e. in 37,050 cases, were "unjustified or too long".
In the systematically controlled cases of more than 45 days of illness, less than 1.2 million were 11% of "unadjusted or unjustified" cases, i.e. 132,000.
In total, this accounts for 169,000 "unjustified" cases for several million workers who have claimed a sick report.
A number that represents only a weak extent compared to, for example, that of black work.
According to UMP MEP Dominique Tian, author of a factual report on this issue published in July, this represents between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>9 and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15 billion in loss of tax profits per year, which is more than the total cost of daily remuneration, and thus significantly more than the defrauding of the latter.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adjustment plan
Greece needs a new adjustment programme to intercept its economy.
This was announced on Monday, 14 November by Prime Minister Lucas Papademos in front of Parliament, adding that the one hundred days granted to his government by the Union were not enough to complete this task.
"In order to continue efforts to strengthen the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme," the Prime Minister said in his first public speech at the opening of the debate on Parliament's confidence vote on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken on the occasion of the Euro Summit on 27 October is the "main task" of the new government, as the country's participation within the eurozone is "at stake", he added.
Accordingly, Mr. Papademos has planned to reduce the country's government deficit "by the 9%" of gross domestic product from today to the end of the year, after it was 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right rejects the new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the head of the right wing, had given his approval on Monday to the measures already approved regarding an attempt to escape the debt crisis, but had predicted that his party would not be ready for an additional austerity measure.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said on the occasion of a parliamentary assembly of his party New Democracy.
He had agreed to reduce the budget deficit and debt, as well as the fight against waste, but was hostile to any policy that would prevent the economic upturn.
Olli Rehn, EU Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who had prevented the IMF and EU from releasing the necessary loan of over <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8 billion without written guarantee from all parties supporting the planned measures, Antonio Samaras had replied that his word would suffice and he would not sign anything under pressure from foreigners.
Euthanasia and accompanied death must be legalized, according to a panel of experts
Canadians live in denial of death, according to a report from the Royal Society of Canada
The panel stated that governments, health care institutions and doctors were working together on pain-relieving treatment to provide the best pain-relieving remedies, and beyond cancer cases.
Canadian society lives in a refusal to die.
Only 9% of Canadians actually agree to talk to their doctor about conditions under which they want to die and make arrangements for that purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an imposing report by the Royal Society of Canada involving six experts linked in various fields of expertise, including ethics, law and medicine.
This body recommends the government to amend the criminal law in such a way as to allow accompanied suicide and euthanasia, where this choice is made, for patients who are deemed to be able to make such a decision.
As a prelude, the experts cite a recently published survey by the independent society EIU, which had compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the globe.
Although Canada ranked 10th in this, the study notes that “medical death care in Canada has produced a culture where people are afraid to tackle the issue of death.”
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians do not have access to painkillers, according to experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the majority of Canadians’ desire to die at home, 68.6% of them die in hospital.
From a country-wide perspective, the highest rate of hospital deaths in Quebec is 86%.
In the delicate question regarding euthanasia and accompanied suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that are opposed to the position of the federal government, which has already confirmed that it will not make any changes to the criminal law regarding euthanasia and accompanied suicide.
But now, according to the experts, all those countries whose approach has legalized or decriminalized euthanasia and accompanied suicide have also inspected, there is no evidence that such decriminalization would result in abuses in their application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or accompanied suicide by incompetent or non-consent persons.
On the contrary, much more cases of such violations are encountered, especially in countries where euthanasia and accompanied suicide are not legalized, as Jocelyn Downie, co-signer of the report, confirmed yesterday in a teleconference.
"Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Accompanied suicide is also practiced in Canada, although clearly illegal here," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians support euthanasia
According to an Angus-Reid survey conducted in 2010, 85% of Canadians have already supported euthanasia because they believe that it allows people at the end of their lives to mitigate their suffering.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia does not mean conveying the message that the lives of older or disabled people have less value.
As regards those who have already practiced accompanied suicide, 41% of respondents believe that they should not be prosecuted.
As for the maintenance or discontinuation of funds in patients, the situation is less clear, according to the report’s authors.
Likewise, they suggest in their list of recommendations that the criminal law should state that the removal of the means for which a legally valid rejection had occurred should not be considered as criminal.
The panel of experts also calls for healthcare professionals to be trained in the task of respecting a withdrawal of funds at the end of life, and to fear this without criminal prosecution.
The panel stated that governments, health care institutions and doctors were working together on pain-relieving treatment to provide the best pain-relieving remedies, beyond cancer cases.
Lastly, the Panel calls for at least consideration of the pain relief or life-end measures already widely used in Canadian health care institutions, as they were not used to reduce physical pain, nor were they used to refer to the same procedures.
Reservations from other experts
Some experts in the legal field of healthcare have already raised reservations about the conclusions of the Royal Society of Canada’s expert report.
RA Pierre Deschamps, specialist in health law, has described the attitude of the report signing experts as "extreme", among other things, as it does not set any limits to the euthanasia practice for patients in the final phase.
"This opens the doors to a situation in which anyone who is life-threatened and over 18 years of age asks another person to help him commit suicide," said RA Deschamps, who reviewed a summary of the report yesterday.
RA Deschamps also emphasizes that the authors of the report seemed to place the individual's own responsibility above all other values involved in the social fabric of society.
But now, he says, there would be “guidelines and obligations in a society”.
Margaret Somerville, a health law specialist, has also expressed “a strong resistance” to the report’s conclusions, which she called a “pro-euthanasia manifesto.”
Margaret Somerville, who herself is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, particularly doubts the reporting on the non-existence of abuses in certain countries where euthanasia and accompanied suicide are legalized, such as the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan Calls on President Assad to Abdicate
Damascus denounces a "conspiracy"
Syria is increasingly isolated
The partisans of Bashar al-Assad demonstrated yesterday in front of the authorities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Diplomatic pressure on Bashar al-Assad’s Syria, who, however, resists it thanks to Russia’s support and rejects a “conspiracy” directed against the country, has intensified yesterday.
Two days before the Arab League’s exclusion of Syria, the European Union has tightened its sanctions against Damascus, despite the position of Turkey and Jordan, Syria’s neighbors, in favour of President Assad’s resignation.
King Abdullah II of Jordan was yesterday the incumbent Arab Prime Minister who had called on President Bashar al-Assad to "put down his power in Syria," in which already about forty civilians and members of the government were killed.
"If Bashar cared about his country's interest, he would resign, but moreover, he should also create the necessary conditions for a new era of Syrian political life," the king of Jordan, Syria's neighbor, said in an interview with the BBC.
Turkish diplomat Ahmet Davutoglu, for his part, had complained that the Turkish mediation attempts aimed at the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year had not been successful.
"Those in the Middle East who are not at peace with their people and cannot satisfy them must leave," he said, referring to Syria, the neighbouring country to which Turkey is taking a steadily harsher stance.
The United States, for its part, welcomed the "reinforcement of the consensus against Assad and the machinations of the Syrian regime" as a result of the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and countries like Turkey have taken an ever sharper tone in the face of the repression in Syria," said Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of government power in the region of Dar'a in southern Syria were killed, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights OSDH.
Two more civilians were killed in "shoots and heavy bombings around Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, according to the NGO.
On the occasion of a press conference, the Syrian foreign trade minister Walid al-Muallalim nevertheless considered that the country was "taxing towards the end of the crisis".
By the way, he has reacted strongly to the Arab League’s decision to suspend Damascus from its duties, which he considers to be a “dangerous step”.
Syria "will not yield," he added, acknowledging that "the plots forged against Syria will fail."
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now investigating a "protection mechanism for civilians" and wants to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, the media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Trade Minister Alain Juppé also spoke out in favour of sending UN observers to protect civilians from the regime’s repressions, which he encapsulated in his “paranoia”.
A new meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the plan for the emergence of the crisis decided on 2 November, in particular the controversial and expected withdrawal of military troops from the besieged cities and the liberation of detained demonstrators.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov described the Arab League’s decision yesterday as “incorrect” in order to avoid endorsing possible sanctions against Damascus, even though China had already urged Syria to implement the crisis exit plan.
Italy
Monti urges markets to be patient and Italy to sacrifice
Mario Monti, future Italian head of government, has demanded a little more time from the markets to form his staff and implement a program that demands "victims" to regain the creditworthiness lost during the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former EU Commissioner had held a negotiation with the political parties yesterday before today’s meeting of trade unions and employers.
It was his job to convene a cabinet in Parliament, which is relatively strictly composed of external technocrats.
"Monti spoke of an important program with a number of victims," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the numerous smaller parliamentary groups participating in the talks, after meeting with the President-in-Office of the Council.
Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of Deputies, had, for his part, expressed an expectation that Mario Monti would give Parliament a vote of confidence until Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The agreements will culminate in the presentation by M. Monti of a deletion list that will undoubtedly range from a dozen ministers to the head of state Giorgio Napolitano.
M. Monti commented that yesterday’s nervousness of the stock markets and bond markets demanded her time.
In “a democracy, there are certain deadlines” for preparing a government as well as a government program, he stressed, remarking that it is “certain that markets will show dutifulness and understanding.”
His appointment by the president was initially welcomed by the markets, but the unrest had intensified, especially after an unexpected decline in industrial production in the eurozone in September.
The incumbent Prime Minister should establish a staff consisting predominantly of technocrats, although he had stressed that he would also like to involve "politicians".
The new government should only last until 2013, the date of the next parliamentary elections, he estimated.
According to Gianfranco Fini, the president of the Chamber of Deputies, the new government should have the confidence of Parliament by Friday.
M. Monti has committed himself, since he took up his duties, to work urgently to make Italy the "new protagonist" in Europe.
A spokesman for EU Commissioner Olli Rehn had emphasized that "our diagnosis towards the Italian economy, even considering the new government, does not change".
The EU, which is convinced that Rome will not achieve its goal of budget balancing in 2013, despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, has in particular requested new harsh measures.
Emma Marcegaglia, "chief of the bosses" of Italy, who will meet on Tuesday at Monti, also insists on the need for economic stimulus, "because a country that has no growth, cannot respect deficitary figures".
M. Monti, who is known for his competence as well as his independence as EU Commissioner (1994-2004), stands for an "epoch change" of Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconism"; the "professor" symbolizes the "challenge of trustworthiness" as well as a "other Italy", according to the editorial authors.
The big unknown here is the longevity of his staff.
President Napolitano would like to prevent early elections, as Italy will have to pay 200 billion euros in government bonds from now until April 2012.
Russian Scientist Helps Iran’s Nuclear Energy Program
A Russian scientist, Vyacheslav Danilenko, has helped Iran develop a nuclear-powered explosive capsule, an American NGO specializing in nuclear risks confirmed on Monday.
The Institute for Science and International Security ISIS is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Security Agency (AIEA) and other documents from this UN agency to investigate this scientist.
Last week, the AIEA expressed its “serious concern” about a “possible military dimension” of Iran’s nuclear program.
According to an in-depth study of AIEA documents by ISIS, Danilenko, born in 1934, had apparently been working in a Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Ural) for over three decades since the early 1960s and was involved in the explosion-produced manufacture of synthetic diamonds.
In 1989 or 1991, he was said to have left the center to start a company in Kiev that produces "nano diamonds".
The economic difficulties of his company had led him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Before returning to Russia, he worked on an Iranian program from 1996 to 2002.
In its latest report, the AIEA mentioned "strong indications that the Iranian development of a nuclear explosives system" was "supported by the work of a foreign expert who was not only highly versed in this technique, but also, as one member of the agency said, his entire professional career worked on this technology essentially directly on the military nuclear energy program of his country of origin."
Anti-Islamic Crimes and Crimes Increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes directed against Muslims have increased by 50% from 2009 to 2010, while other racist or religiously motivated violent crimes have either decreased or increased slightly over the same period, according to FBI statistics published Monday.
According to these data, the total number of violent crimes committed against Muslims rose from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, by 49%, while a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in crimes directed against Jews, and a 14% global increase in anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of "hate-motivated crimes" has risen to 6,628 cases, including 47.3% due to racial differences and 20% due to religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After a weakening in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and crimes grow again," the human rights organization Human Rights First stressed.
"Human Rights First had long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights," added Paul Legendre, a senior executive of the organization.
"The U.S. government can and should do more to combat these attacks," he added, estimating that this could be done while improving police attitudes towards the "hate crimes."
The "hate crime" presents itself in American federal law as a legacy from the era of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation was passed after Martin Luther King's death to punish acts of violence directed against race, color, religion or ancestry and now also includes crimes of sexual affiliation.
Twitter is transforming the platform and increasingly resembling Facebook
The microblogging website Twitter introduced changes in the presentation of their platform on Monday to allow its users in particular to monitor the activities of those who follow their entries, making the service once again resemble that of Facebook.
The new tab "Activity" and another "Name" allow you to better understand the activities of other "Twitterers", the Internet users whose messages ("Tweets") you are tracking and who are tracking your messages.
This enables them to find out whether they allow them to track their messages, whether they subscribe to new posts, favor certain messages, etc.
This new Twitter menu offer had been tested before its general Internet distribution on Monday "at a small percentage of users in August," Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told the French press agency AFP.
Twitter was known for its little instinctive functioning, equipped with some esoteric-looking wording (RT to referencing another person's contribution). followfriday pour recommander de suivre un autre utilitaire) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'ouvre ainsi un public plus large avec grandi un publici plus a Facebook comparable
In the network, users debated this innovation using certain "tweets" over the Internet.
“This is useless, intrusive, and too much like Facebook,” <0x40>jemb123 wrote.
“The ‘Activity’ feature will help me better track certain elements of my Flux Tweeter,” said <0x40>dannykronstrom.
Austria
Entering a "Golden Budget Rule" into the Constitution
The government of the large social-democratic/Christian-democratic coalition in power in Austria has decided on Tuesday to include a "Golden Budget Rule" in the Constitution to reduce public deficits and also to avoid possible degradation by rating agencies in Austria's top-bonity (AAA).
It was the Social-Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann who personally announced this decision of the exit of the Council of Ministers, although the public Austrian public debt is 74.6%, that is, well above the criterion of 60% set by the Maastricht Treaty, but well below the debt level of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency had not dropped from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay an additional three billion euros each year," said Michael Spindelegger, vice chancellor and Christian Democratic foreign minister.
Austria is also responding to a call from the Brussels summit of the eurozone member states on 26 October: Heads of state and government at that time would have demanded the inclusion of the reduction of public deficits by the end of 2012, as well as a return to the public accounts balance in the constitution or by passing an equivalent law.
The measure taken by the Austrian government is similar to the "German model", since Germany had been the first European country to incorporate such a "rule" into the constitution.
By 2017, the structural budget deficit should decrease by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, as of 2017, the state’s structural budget deficit should not exceed the 0.35% limit of GDP, whereas regional states as well as municipalities should have balanced budgets.
The aim is to eradicate the budgetary debt under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Agreement in the horizon of 2020/21.
Strong Yen
Noda threatens with new intervention in currency markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that if the yen continues to rise, Japanese power would again intervene in the currency markets.
"If we find excessive volatility in the exchange rate of the yen, we will intervene as we did last time," M. Noda said in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen again accelerated close to the historical levels that forced the Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo had massively sold yen against dollars in order to lower the Japanese currency value, which is about to hit a new record since 1945 against the dollar.
However, the yen has regularly risen above it, doped by purchases from investors who view the yen as a “refugee value” in these uncertain times of global economic downturn and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar fell below 77 yen on Tuesday, the euro slipped below the symbolic bar of 105 yen to close to the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was quoted around 120 yen, the euro more than 160 yen.
This straw fire of the Japanese currency is damaging to the exports of the archipelago, as it increases the cost of "Made in Japan" products and reduces the income value drawn by Japanese companies from abroad, as they exchange it in national currency.
"Japan is fighting for its reconstruction after the earthquake and tsunami that ravaged the Tohoku region on March 11," stresses M. Noda, who fears that this depreciation of the yen could already kill the weak upswing.
The third economic world power has regained traction with growth in the third quarter -1.5% compared to the previous quarter - for the first time this year thanks to the sharp increases in exports and the consumption of households "plombed" by the disaster.
The Prime Minister, however, estimates that the inflation of the yen does not reflect "Japan's economic foundations."
For its part, Finance Minister Jun Azumi has called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy committee on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to dismantle the yen.
However, Hirohide Yamaguchi, deputy governor of the institute, has notified that the BoJ has already initiated "appropriate measures", thus stating that no additional currency easing is expected on Wednesday.
On the occasion of the last meeting at the end of October, the central bank had increased its government bond purchases by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros) to pay off the 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros) of coverage it had spent on various purchases of financial securities to flood the liquidity market.
Eurozone:
Interest rates are rising, exchanges are pulling back
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis is constantly undermining European key figures.
Despite the arrival of the new heads of government in Greece and Italy and the best growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of the weakened countries continue to rise steadily.
The stock exchanges, which are still concerned about the stability of the eurozone, are also drifting a little more into negative conditions this Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris, the CAC lost 1.4% at 10 a.m. and fell to 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt declined by 0.4%, London by 0.1%.
“Due to new tensions on government bond yields in the eurozone in difficulty, global equity markets continue to issue part of their recent profits.
"Investors are nervous and too well aware of the risk of contagion," said Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange, which in turn suffers from the renewed fears of market participants regarding the capacity in Europe that the debt crisis continues, had closed with a downturn of 0.7%.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has turned its eyes to Europe, and trade is moving on a limited variation corridor as long as investors have no evidence that the situation has stabilized," Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management, said in a statement.
This resurgence of concerns about the future of the eurozone is damaging the single currency, which continues its boom on Tuesday.
The euro has been at its lowest level for a month and a half.
At 10 a.m., the European currency was worth 1.3570 dollars, so it gave by 0.4%.
According to the stock brokers, it declined after the CDU, party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, who met in Congress on Monday, approved a motion that specifically provides the possibility for countries in trouble to exit the eurozone without leaving the European Union at the same time.
The Italian and Spanish rates are well below the 6% limit.
Loan rates in Italy and Spain remain at a very disturbing level.
This Tuesday morning, the yield of the Italian bonds to 10 years reached 6.85%, that of the Spanish titles matured to 6.2%.
These tensions in interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to nurture the fears of investors.
The future Italian head of government Mario Monti called for more time from the markets to restore the situation in Italy, which is threatened by paralysis due to the debt burden.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, for his part, had confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken on the occasion of the Eurozone summit on 27 October were "the main task" of his government.
Spain is in the visor of the markets, as the parliamentary elections are held in the country on Sunday.
The interest rate shears ("spread") between the German and Spanish 10-year bonds has once again reached a new, historical high.
Expecting growth in the eurozone
From a statistical perspective, France recorded a 0.4% growth in the third quarter driven by household consumption, ergo a little better than the expected 0.3%.
The INSEE Federal Statistical Office, however, had revised the bearish figures of the second quarter, with a minus of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of a stagnation.
In fact, it is the fourth quarter that most worries the economic experts.
Germany, for its part, experienced growth of 0.5% over the same period.
A first estimate of the eurozone as a whole is expected at 11 a.m., with the EU Commission warning of the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts should prevail over dogmas
If there is an issue that cannot be addressed on the basis of short-term considerations or emotions, this is certainly energy policy.
The availability and costs of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and the competitiveness of companies.
It is reasonable to take an election meeting as an occasion to reflect on this issue as well as on the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only bear fruit if it explores the overall economic, social and environmental consequences of the options proposed.
The French should base their opinions on objective facts, rational data.
Although there are 7 billion people on this planet, demographic evolution is driving a doubling of electricity demand by the year 2050, so a huge proportion of the world’s population should not have to do without a vital element.
At the same time, it is necessary to mitigate the scarcity of fossil resources in order to continue producing electricity consistently, without forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, a topic that has disappeared from the ecological debate, in order to fight climate irregularities.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany remains isolated in its decision to refrain from nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, which subjects its decision to the need to find a substitutionable substitute, nor in Switzerland, which just intends to build only last-generation nuclear power plants.
The UK, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name just a few, continue to pursue their projects with determination.
The United States, in turn, after Fukushima, decided to join another unit in its park by re-opening the plant Three Mile Island, which had been shut down after the nuclear accident.
Although the German model, which focuses on renewable energy sources, is sometimes presented as an example, reality contradicts discourse.
The election in Berlin will take the form of an increase in the price of electricity, an increased energy dependence, especially on Russia, due to the increased use of imported gas, and an increase in CO2 emissions caused by gas and coal-fired power plants.
The entirety of these unpleasant effects will be noticeable within a few months.
The case of Denmark gives us reason to think.
On the one hand, Denmark is the European leader in wind energy, from which it obtains 30% of its electricity, and on the other hand, it is one of the strongest users of coal and gas, used alternately with wind energy; as a result, its CO2 emissions and its electricity price are respectively 65% and 50% higher than the corresponding European average.
Thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity bill compared to our French households.
Since energy prices play a key role in competitiveness in the globalised economy, as well as a stability pledge to industry on national soil, French companies have an advantage due to the lowest electricity prices in Europe.
Any significant reduction in nuclear power would therefore result in a sharp rise in the price of energy, which would make the noble statements about the reindustrialization of our country and the defense of purchasing power an illusion.
Surveys showed that this is a price that the vast majority of French people are not willing to pay as much as it shows resistance to the principle of this energy source.
Let’s remember that our country’s energy policy has made it possible to build an industry with 125,00 direct and 410,000 induced jobs.
Due to its strong export character, it brings a myriad of specialized small and medium-sized companies to the international markets and makes them creators of countless jobs.
If France decides to withdraw from nuclear power, it would be the victim of a large proportion of these SMEs, and the annual <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6 billion in capital goods and nuclear energy exports would shrink more and more.
Which electrician would commission an EPR designed to function for sixty years if the decline of its producer is pre-programmed?
In order to solve the energetic equation, one has to admit that there is no miracle agent for generating electricity, as there is no devil’s work.
The low-carbon solutions developed by Areva for the use of nuclear power and renewable energy demonstrate the complementarity of energy sources.
Maintaining the highest possible level of safety is an absolute imperative for nuclear power.
In France, we have a security authority that conducts uncompromising and transparent controls in existing plants, such as the construction in Flamanville.
Their work teams, which have made a name for themselves because of their professionalism, are just obsessed with the security concept.
Within 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious crashes.
Only one, in Three Mile Island, occurred under normal operating conditions, so it went without consequences for humans and the environment.
In Chernobyl, the drama was conjured up by reactor construction as well as inexcusable human error.
At Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was caused by two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude that caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will draw its lessons from this accident just as it did from the two preceding ones.
As a result of this approach and a cooperation between the security authorities of the French and German operators and designers of nuclear power plants, the EPR is a draft that enables it to resist such phenomena.
Since it is considered desirable among electrical engineers to build a nuclear power plant, a construction stop in Flamanville would be a fabulous gift to the competition of Areva and EDF, leaving them free to take on the leading position in the inevitable nuclear power development.
It is inevitable and legitimate to look for the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and party maneuvers dominate a debate that determines our country’s economic, social and financial situation as well.
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy led by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from many angles - overloading police, judicial and administrative bodies on the basis of a policy subject to the figures, compatibility of this policy with the status of a "country of human rights", as France had called itself.
Recently, the harassment of foreign students by the authorities had shaped the weekly newspapers, the Minister of the Interior had casually announced (see Libération of 23 May) that France "did not need talents, masons or waiters from abroad".
But this policy has rarely been analyzed from an economic point of view.
There is a broad consensus on this issue between the right and the left.
From the right side was the tone of Jacques Chirac, who had declared in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed, including over 2 million immigrant workers, should not be a problem for a country", from the left side by Michel Rocard, who had stated in 1990 that France "cannot absorb the entire poverty of the world".
The only difference is in the degree of generosity
The fear of the invasion of national soil by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared by both the right and the left in 2005.
From both camps, immigrants were perceived as a burden to the economy and French society.
The only difference is in the degree of generosity that one is willing to admit to the immigrants.
In his programme, François Hollande is confined to banalities that point out that partnership development allows us to solve our "migration problems".
This notion of immigration as a burden, as a problem, may potentially impact the elections; however, it is economically costly.
As economics experts Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in a recent work summarizing the latest findings on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 p.), there is a broad consensus among the specialists regarding the positive impact of immigration on economic growth, immigration and immigration rates.
Restricting immigration would weaken growth and damage the labour market situation.
Fears about the influence of migrants are based on the notion that they threaten to substitute the domestic workforce, especially the less skilled, by exerting pressure on their wages.
However, experience shows that immigrants are in fact much more complementary than domestic wage workers, since they focus on occupations in sectors that are unloaded in terms of employment.
The low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that attract local wage workers little, the more skilled among immigrants work in dynamic sectors where training is not aligned with job offer.
Positive wage effect
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country where there is a shortage of anaesthetists, this complementarity between locals and migrants also has a positive effect of immigration on wages and the domestic labour market situation.
Giovanni Peri has calculated in this way that a 1% increase in the flood of immigrants will result in a long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And this without regard to the fact that the diversity of ideas and economic growth brought in by immigrants is beneficial (high proportion of naturalized immigrants among American Nobel laureates; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants also contribute net to the social welfare systems, averaging about 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The World Labour Organization estimates, for example, that a person immigrating to Germany at the age of 30 contributes on average to the public budget over his lifetime a net contribution (revenue minus expenses) of around 150,000 euros.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to bring about the missing intersections "with the teeth" at the start of his mandate.
However, these teeth, which were supposed to deter immigrants, had the exact opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, now remains to think through European democracy
Democracy is a valuable asset; it is also a delicate asset.
The European continent should be able to remember for itself who, after its invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago, had allowed the whole 20th century to pass over the tragedies of the First World War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also Francos in Spain, Salazars in Portugal and the Colonel in Greece.
Some may have thought it was enough to exercise the right to vote, in the most direct way possible, to see democracy prevail over its enemies once and for all.
It has been known since Napoleon "the little one" that it was a feature of the mental attitude.
The universal right to vote, which is the necessary condition of democracy, is not sufficient for this and can just as well become an "instrument of oppression", as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot put it at the time.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, separation and control of powers, education, enlightenment, economic and social community spirit, a jurisprudence.
The crisis in Europe, in which we find ourselves, is an economic crisis, but it is just as much, and first and foremost, a political and democratic crisis.
The change of attitude of the Greek true-false referendum would have had a double enlightening character in this respect: on the one hand, the need for a powerful return of politics, and on the other, the worrying feeling of its impossibility, its inappropriateness.
This ambivalence should be considered outdated.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have shifted today, and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, are no longer aiming in the right direction.
We have nothing to win to push for the success of the national referendum, which was organised depending on the necessities and in the wrong order.
A free ticket for the European sole ruler or a leap with closed eyes into the void of nationalist retreat: a great choice for the citizen!
No, we want Hackebeil, but a collective task, out of full law, clarified and steady, an election and democracy, this time on a European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - you no longer know where to end the list - since there is only one crisis, and it prevails in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe that submits to the dictates of markets and credit rating agencies, suffering from its impotence and lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is humiliated at the international level.
One is concerned about transfers of sovereignty towards Europe - but it is all Europe that is gradually losing its sovereignty, and with it every one of its affiliated nations.
The urgency is to return the leadership of the European project to the People's Sovereignty.
It is up to the whole to see if Europeans can reduce the burden of their debt, free themselves from the markets and start a future by investing.
The exit from the crisis is conditional on European-level decisions that cannot be made without total democratic legitimacy without certainly leading us to ruin.
After this proposal has long been opposed by Jacques Delors and the Socialists, today everyone urges European economic governance to do so.
All right.
But to imagine this without political integration and a stronger democracy - as it is intended for the citizens - would be another foolishness and another dead end.
We must take on a new stage in the construction of Europe.
In order to create the Republic in France, it was necessary to "create" Republicans.
The revolution of the interests alone could not do enough here.
This instruction remains valid.
We must build a better integrated Europe at economic level.
This can only be achieved by creating a more politically democratic Europe, a truly European popular sovereignty.
We need Europeans to create Europe.
"Contactless" smart cards become a common good
The world trade fair for smart cards will open its doors in Villepinte near Paris on Tuesday in an optimistic attitude.
According to Eurosmart, 2011 should actually end with an 11% increase in global sales of microprocessor chips (EC cards, SIM card phones), with more than 6 billion units sold.
The most significant segment here is the contactless technology, which allows payments in public transport or payment of purchases by simply holding the card to a reader.
Compared to the 320 million sold a year earlier, 460 million contactless smart cards were to be sold worldwide this year!
Their market share was expected to increase further in 2012 (580 million expected units) and represent over 10% of the global smart card market (6,925 million cards).
Europe is gaining ground in contactless payment after being long behind the Asia-Pacific region.
Some 26 million Visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are rather modest: only 400,000 contactless visa cards have been distributed.
However, the consumer markets are steaming.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million contactless passport MasterCards this year.
In order to move to a higher speed, it is now necessary for the banks to equip their customers with these cards.
"Two major French financial institutions have committed to systematically handing over to their customers bank cards loaded with contactless chips in the future," said Gérard Nébouy, Managing Director of Visa Europe France.
Banks test payment by mobile phone
However, this is only a first step towards the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
So far, a tiny percentage of devices have been equipped with the NFC (Near Field Communication) technology necessary to carry out these transactions.
"They're in delay".
"But they should at least experience a real upward trend next year."
"We expect to sell 80 to 120 million units worldwide in 2012," explains Marc Bertin, Chairman of Eurosmart.
But the banks are taking the initiative.
The Crédit Agricole announced yesterday the start of a test run in Caen, which will run from December to next June.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees are to be equipped with a capsule that allows contactless payment.
The BPCE operates a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société Générale also announced yesterday that it was preparing to launch an offer that would allow its customers to make contactless payments via mobile phones.
Terrorist Front from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the relations between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the cult Boko Haram.
The long-suspected relations between the al-Qaeda terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram seem to be confirming.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel himself confirmed that Algiers had now "gained certainty" about it.
"The way in which both organizations operate, as well as the relations of the intelligence services, indicate a clear cooperation," he said, without going into further details.
Paris seems to be doing a similar analysis.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two French people in Niger last January has revealed interfaces.
Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory, kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by supporters of Aqmi, are said to have been killed the following day at the same time as several of their kidnappers on the occasion of an operation carried out by the French Special Forces.
French and Nigerian investigators say they found several phone chips belonging to the terrorists in the rubble on the site.
Category: Terrorism
The analysis of telephone calls leads to several interlocutors stationed in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), the investigators are particularly interested in the numbers of two interlocutors: one leads to a Nigerian who spent a long time in Maiduguri, a city in the north of Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram; the other leads to a man who is considered to be close to the Aqmi and the sect.
"This is a progress, but you have to wait for clearer evidence before you can speak of an operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem."
"It's conceivable, though."
"It has been known for years that the sect receives financial and intellectual support from outsiders and that it is becoming increasingly active," says Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo.
In recent months, these "supports" have become more and more visible in their course, as have the speeches and operation modes of Boko Harem, which now indicate the pulling in of suicide bombers and the use of increasingly complex explosives bearing the same handwriting as those used by Aqmi.
Since then, the international community has been putting pressure on Abuja to take account of the problems caused by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have, in fact, long regarded the grouping as a community of Illuminati, to which no special attention needs to be paid.
Fast success
Boko Haram, founded in Maiduguri in 2002 in the vicinity of a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf - which in Haoussa means "Western education is a disgrace" - pursues the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this destitute region, the merger is experiencing rapid success.
It politicizes itself and claims strict adherence to Sharia law, while its affiliated activists fight against the wicked central government.
The activists are initially targeting churches, bars and authorities.
In 2009, Boko Haram activists showed themselves particularly active with their intensified attacks against the commissariats.
However, Abuja’s reaction is, as usual, indifferent.
The army surrounds the city, with 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, who was taken captive, is killed in prison.
As a result, the sect becomes increasingly radical and leaves its strongholds in the north.
Last Christmas, she confessed to an assassination attempt in Jos, which claimed 80 lives, and then another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram is blamed for a suicide bombing that took place at the secured police headquarters in Abuja, the first of its kind.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations will become a priority international target.
Since then, the formation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which will lead from Mauritania to Nigeria and Somalia, has alarmed all security experts.
While the Aqmi has occupied Mali and Niger, the Somalis of al-Shabaab operating in Kenya, Boko Harem seems to be a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria, Alain Juppé had warned against Boko Harem and showed himself ready to "communicate all clues".
The world according to the Republican presidential candidates
Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry rival in simplifying and ignoring China, Iraq, and helping Israel.
Can a crisis-weakened America lead to a complex world with simple, not to say simple, ideas?
If you listen to the Republican presidential candidates like that, voters could almost get that impression.
For a few days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their colleagues have repeatedly made their thunderous statements as well as their statements regarding foreign policy, the traditional republican focus.
About China, Iran, and Israel aid fall slogans – often in no way underpinned.
With regard to the appointment of the "Grand Old Party", Mitt Romney threatened to cite the Chinese before the WTO and accuse them of "currency manipulation" - a leading issue in an America that has been initially provoked by the migration of entire industries to Asia.
It would have been stupid if this was to imply the initiation of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former ambassador to China under Obama and the only candidate who seems to have a mature vision of foreign policy, has almost lost his breath in his emotion-flattering gesture.
He had called for a firm but constructive exchange of views with Beijing (also Obama’s current stance).
But Huntsman is not being heard as he stagnates in the depths of opinion polls.
Reagan's image
Romney had also praised military strikes against Iran if the sanctions to stop the nuclear program failed.
"If I'm elected, I'll stop Iran," he said.
"If Obama is re-elected, they get the bomb".
In addition, he has promised Israel increased military assistance and accused Obama of remaining obliged to this partner.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second highest-ranked candidate, in turn exhibits a shameful ignorance of the file.
Recently, he called for the Chinese military threat to be countered by Beijing's "trying to develop a nuclear power" - and seemed to ignore the fact that China has been in possession of nuclear weapons since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and calls for military strikes against Iran, for his part, urges the US Army to be ready to serve in Mexico against drug cartels.
The use of torture measures against suspected terrorists, forbidden by Obama in 2009, was also endorsed by Cain, Perry and the candidacy Michele Bachmann.
One is far from John McCain, the 2008 Republican candidate, an overseas heavyweight.
To the current presidential opponents, Reagan also had simple ideas and, despite all of them, won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and had to pour water into his wine, as far as anti-terrorism was concerned.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, the premature withdrawal of his "boys" from Iraq, his indecisiveness in Libya, which also earned him the reputation of weakness.
This hostility, however, is not quite so casual.
The population is more likely to appreciate the positive balance sheet of national security under Obama, which eliminated Bin Laden.
Since Iraq, it has guarded against military interventions that lead to paralysis.
And Obama more appropriately surprised by arguing that America needs to be economically rebuilt to revive its leadership position.
Nord Stream, new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which runs on the seabed of the Baltic Sea and connects western Europe directly to Russia, has been put into operation.
It will provide gas for the equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian gas giant Gazprom wanted to celebrate this event with glamour and glory.
More than 500 invited guests, including four heads of state and government, attended the inauguration of the new Nord Stream gas pipeline, which connects Russia and Germany directly below sea level, under orchestral sounds on the Baltic coast last Tuesday.
German Chancellor Angelika Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte have symbolically turned together the control of the valve that transports Russian gas into the Western European grid.
The new gas pipeline will deliver 27.5 billion cubic meters of additional Russian gas per year to Western Europe through a first pipeline of 1,224 km in length connecting the Saint Petersburg region with Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.
A second pipeline, which allows a total supply of 55 billion cubic meters of gas - the equivalent of French total consumption - is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2012.
And you already have the possibility of building a third line on your own route.
For Gazprom, the timely and precise completion of this enormous building seems like a victory.
The project was heavily controversial in Poland and the Baltic States.
The Nord Stream pipeline will enable direct gas supply to Germany, while avoiding any crossing through third countries (Poland or Ukraine) by land.
For this reason, these two countries are losing some of their power: it is now becoming more difficult for them to put pressure on Russia by threatening to close access to Western European markets.
Warsaw, most engaged in the debate, was not afraid to compare the Nord Stream pipeline with a "new German-Soviet pact" in connection with the Hitler-Stalin alliance for the occupation of Poland in 1939.
This means that the issue is extremely sensitive from a political point of view.
Western Europe has gained even greater security of supply by endorsing this Russian project.
However, this is at the expense of depleting European energy, as the project has broken a gap between Western and Eastern Europeans.
In less than five years, Russia has succeeded in enforcing its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, which are experiencing heavy gas consumption and whose gas resources are declining.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us in an organic way," François Fillon confirmed at the inauguration of the gas pipeline, pointing out to what extent the major gas contracts are important from a political and economic point of view.
All this explains the broad smile of the Gazprom managers, many of whom are represented in Lubmin, regarding the gas pipeline.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also an outstanding technique.
The underwater pipe is made of steel with concrete sheathing to protect it from ship anchors.
It rests on the seabed, at about 200 m depth.
During its construction, minefields dating from the Second World War had to be avoided.
"Around hundreds of mines had to be removed or destroyed as a precautionary measure," said Jens Müller, spokesman for Nord Stream.
In addition, increased measures had to be taken to protect the fauna and flora.
The line is a long line of metal, heavy like 242 Eiffel Towers, that is interrupted over its entire length by nothing: neither by valves, nor maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned off the coast of Sweden, but the project managers have refrained from doing so, as the Swedes were little eager to see a Russian state-owned company settle permanently at the level of their coasts.
"In the event of an accident, we close the gas passage in less than a minute," Jens Müller explained.
In the case of a leak, the gas in the gas pipeline thus escapes into the air.
However, this case is considered by the designers to be unlikely, as the welding seams were estimated to have a resistance of one leak per 100,000 years.
The state monitoring of the gas pipeline is ensured both by an underwater robot controlled for external observation from a seaship, as well as by a device circulating inside the gas pipeline.
It has the shape of a cigar, with a diameter of one meter, is inserted into the interior of the pipeline and moved by the gas pressure.
After three full days of moving through the line at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device provides the most accurate information on possible deformations of the metal upon its arrival.
The gas pipeline was designed to operate for fifty years without having to undergo the slightest repair.
Gas circulation is easily ensured by pressure.
This is 200 bar at the access point and 100 bar at the exit point.
Five societies have joined forces to realize this project.
However, the management remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
Furthermore, the German companies E. ON and BASF are affiliated here (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have formed a joint venture called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
It is based in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased to this company the entire capacity of its gas transport, on a renewable twenty-year contract.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, no matter how large the real transported gas quantity is," Jens Müller explained.
The financing of the gas pipeline construction was secured by 30% of shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total labour costs should amount to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.4 billion for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amounted to 240 million.
However, the minority shareholders are willing to recover their expenses, as Gazprom alone bears the risk of liability.
The gas pipeline appears on a sandy, pine-wooded coastline near Lubmin from the Baltic Sea.
The 4.5 meter high valves form the gas outlet gate.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and other characteristics of the incoming gas before it is transferred to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has been supplied with one million cubic meters of Russian gas per hour.
At full capacity, this would be 3 million cubic meters per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a branded notebook.
Founded by an Italian company about fifteen years ago, Moleskine now wants to give the writing a new style.
It has a flair of adventure, hours spent at candlelight with writing.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognizable, with its black rectangular cover, its elastic band, the eggshell-coloured sides, as aged over time.
However, the Moleskine notebook as it is known today was created in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided to launch a distinguished design notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, who was a specialist consultant for the company at the time, is tasked with the market launch of the new product.
The notebook was inspired by an old-fashioned production technique called Mole Skin, which refers to a cotton coat used for covering upholstered benches, for example.
This type of notebook was in high demand among writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has revived an old and almost forgotten object that was considered an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century," explains Maria Sebregondi, now responsible for the brand at Modo Modo.
Success comes.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% and established with sales of 12.7 million units.
This is far from the usual production of the first years, in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine crosses the Italian border and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to create a phantom image of the buyers, as the notebook enthuses businessmen as well as students and professionals.
Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitan, cultivated and open-minded customers.
The small Italian company, which in its beginnings had 12 employees, now employs more than 100 people and has had two offices since 2008; one in Milan, the other in New York.
The company distributes its notebooks in bookshops, on internet portals such as Fnac, in small boutiques in the city centers and is committed to asserting its identity.
"We have followed the zeitgeist and its new writing needs, which persist despite the upswing of emails," explained Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural trait is accompanied by the development of the company Moleskine: Recently, the brand launched an exhibition called "Detour (detour)", in which architects and artists exhibited their own notebooks.
In August, the company also launched a cover with leopard pattern on the occasion of the film festival in Locarno.
Moleskine benefited from its success and this cultural zeitgeist and managed to diversify its products: bags, schedules, fillers, computer cases... The brand has the full range of items.
In the autumn of 2006, Modo Modo was acquired by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, today’s Syntegra Capital, and opened a new chapter in the history of Moleskine.
Why does the unemployment rate of disabled people remain at such a high level?
Approximately 19% of disabled people are looking for a job.
Today begins the 15th week of work for the disabled.
Despite a targeted public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate of disabled people is always twice as high as the average: 19% versus 9% of the total population.
- Disheartening?
"No," emphasises Éric Blanchet, Director General of the Adapt Association, which organizes the "Work Week for the Disabled."
"The progress made within fifteen years is considerable."
At the time, the unemployment rate was not twice as high, but three times as high.
"However, there is still a lot to be done."
However, it must be said that there are still many obstacles for disabled people to get a job.
It is more common for the elderly: 37% are older than 50 years (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% of them do not have a high school diploma and there are only 10,000 disabled among the 2.3 million students with higher education qualifications.
Finally, long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% among the disabled versus 38% on the overall average.
In short, there are so many criteria that make it difficult to get back into work and that form the "core of the problem", says Christian Grapin, Director General of Tremplin, an association founded in 1992 that helps companies recruit disabled people.
So much for the factual brakes.
The unspoken remains, the attitudes, which are certain, but still slowly evolving.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Entreprendre association for the journal La Cité stated that the managers surveyed had "a weak level of knowledge about disabled people" that was "overrepresented" by "persons in wheelchairs, mentally or intellectually impaired".
As a result, private companies with more than 20 employees still have a long way to go to achieve the employment target of 6% of disabled people, which was laid down in a 1987 law.
These latter figures, dating back to 2008, point to a 2.6% ratio.
"We are now at around 3%," reports Pierre Blanc, Director General of Agefiph, the organization entrusted with collecting contributions from companies that violate this law.
Evidence: the number of "fees paying" permanent establishments has decreased, as has the sum of the amounts paid between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law, which provides for increases in contributions, created a strong pressure on the companies," said Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also reflects a real recognition, especially among the large groups of companies."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of permanent establishments between 20 and 49 employees employ disabled people, while companies with 100 to 199 employees employ 82%.
Hazard: "What a luck"
Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens had not concealed the pleasure that the friendly brought them even before they faced the "Blue Tuesday evenings" (20:45 p.m.).
It would have been too widespread to claim that there was a secret agreement between them, but the picture speaks symbolic volumes.
Sitting side by side on the spectator stage of the Stade de France, George Leekens and Eden Hazard could well and gladly have made peace.
Five months after the temperamental gesture of his attacking player against Turkey, the Belgian national coach had reaped nothing but praise for his personality.
"I am very satisfied with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian".
"I want to look forward," assures Liller.
As for the contrast between his portrayal in club and national elf,"It's a unity that justifies everything."
"In Lille I am all year round, which is not the case in Belgium".
"It's time for me to go to the start".
Hazard will come to Saint-Denis, brought Friday evening against Romania regarding the match against France, to finally "gloss".
However, without omitting the note of "pleasure".
He has been firing the French national team since the age of 7 and led his victorious campaigns between 1998 and 2000.
“I was always supported,” he said.
This inevitably contributes to further strengthening the "unique" character of this encounter.
So much in advance: "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be there," he recalls.
"We just walked along the way."
"To be allowed to play against them means great luck!"
Leekens, for his part, sounded "proud" with good-naturedness.
"The Pride of Hosting a Galamatch".
"Pride" also to confirm - in his capacity as"neighbours" - that France "has become a team at a very high level again", and that little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc did a damn good job," he said enthusiastically.
Although Belgium will be missing in the next European Championship, the technician is very likely to share the plane with the Blues (the French national team) ... and to Brazil in 2014.
"We small Belgians are coming out big," he emphasized.
"We're planning a thing, the players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"They will notice this in the upcoming games". The game against France included.
Portugal is very confident
The Portuguese team of Paulo Bento is looking forward with great optimism to the return match against Bosnia (22:00) this Tuesday in Lisbon.
At the end of the game, both teams were lacking objectivity.
"At the end of these 90 minutes we will be a happy team and above all a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already in Poland and Ukraine.
For him there is not the slightest hint of doubt that "La Seleçao", his national team, for which he has been responsible since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 European Championship.
For Portugal, that means only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there is one match to play, and one opponent to serve, namely Bosnia.
Given the one-off game (0-0) on Friday in the Hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that the dice have not yet fallen.
Portugal clearly dominated the game for more than an hour, but the team was unable to put on the matter the so important stamp that would have taken the pressure from it.
"This is a good result, but there is a certain risk since we haven't scored an away goal."
At home, however, in their brightly glowing Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they are going to beat themselves in front of an audience that is equally likely to be at stake, even if the game was, of course, announced as "very scarce", said the optimistic but clear-sighted Bento.
"We expect a very tight match, but we are completely convinced that we can win the upper hand," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance of being in the 2012 European Championship," the successor of Carlos Queiroz relativized.
The tie on Friday in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win.
A draw can be enough for the Bosnians, who also need a goal.
"This is a good result, but there is a certain risk, as we have not scored an away goal," Bento said.
"We will be competing against a team that has high technical qualities and has players with many individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese would want to put maximum pressure on the Bosnians at the outset to "don't give them time to think."
This is a good idea, provided that it is implemented this time.
