Obama Receives Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not very friendly.
The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement, as well as about Tehran’s destabilizing measures in the Middle East.
However, the meeting will also focus on the conflict with the Palestinians and the two-state solution discussed.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been tense for years.
Washington criticizes Israel’s ongoing settlement construction and accuses Netanyahu of lack of will in the peace process.
The Obama-promoted deal on Iran’s nuclear program has further deteriorated the relationship between the two.
In March, at the invitation of Republicans, Netanyahu gave a controversial speech to the U.S. Congress, which was partly seen as an affront to Obama.
The speech was not agreed with Obama, who had rejected a meeting with reference to the upcoming election in Israel at the time.
In an emergency call, Professor confesses to shooting his girlfriend
In an emergency call, Professor Shannon Lamb told the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officers had to come to his house.
Lamb was important to emphasize that his “sweet dog” was still alive and probably excited, and he said the dead woman’s family contacts could be found on the cell phone.
Inside the house, officials found Amy Prentiss's body and a handwritten note scribbled on a white block: "I'm so sorry, I wanted, I could reverse it, I loved Amy and she's the only woman who ever loved me", according to authorities in the letter, and it was signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds where, according to police, he shot and killed a popular history professor, Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his office.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said that university staff heard the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He said Lamb made the fatal emergency call sometime after.
By the end of the day, there was another death: Lamb took his own life when the police shook him.
One day after the shooting at the university that forced students and faculty to hide behind closed doors, authorities are still trying to get an idea of what motivated Lamb.
The details published by investigators at both ends of the state, as well as what students and staff who knew him said, helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher.
Students said they were looking forward to his lessons.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or a criminal history.
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him, in which he mentioned the "miraculous people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, whose faculty comprises 17 members, and many students attended courses from both.
At the same time, there were some tendencies to problematic behaviors.
A student, Brandon Beavers, who praised Lamb, said he also seemed a little excited and nervous “as if something was wrong with him.”
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamm told him he was dealing with stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for a leave of absence for health reasons, saying he had some health problem.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university’s employment policy meant that the doctorate, for which Lamb had worked so hard, would not guarantee for him an automatic path to becoming an assistant professor.
University president William LaForge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's imagination."
These are questions Lamb can no longer answer.
After fleeing the campus, police later found Lamb's trail when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a .38-caliber gun in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parent's home on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson said.
His car was still in the driveway.
It wasn’t immediately clear why Lamb went to that house, but Johnson said she believes he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb began his work at the university in 2009, which has 3,500 students in a city of about 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedagogy.
He received his doctorate in pedagogy in the spring.
One of Lamb’s longtime friends described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through common friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy trying to teach her guitar playing for a few years.
He was the swarm of women at the time.
All the girls melted there when he was there," said Hairston, now 40, who lives in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously together for some time.
In the emergency call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there was no certificate of marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in the brick house adjacent to a bayou in Gautier.
Police said the dog was okay.
Prentiss' ex-husband, Shawn O'Steen, said they were divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends and had a daughter who was now 19 years old.
"She was totally devastated," O'Steen said of his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he never met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail, he heard that Lamb was interested in music and playing blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both appeared at a summer fair three years ago.
Later, they played one or the other gig together.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various companies online.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a poorly lit bar near Gautier, said he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night on the night of September 5 for the last time after Lamb finished his guitar and harmonica playing in front of a sparse audience.
There was no sign that something was wrong.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were cleaning up and joking with each other.
I mean, they both had a good sense of jokes.
Schmidt, the dead professor, led the first-semester seminary program and specialized in Native Americans and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his brotherhood and student committee.
At the Delta State Campus in Cleveland, about 900 people, including faculty, staff, students, and community members, attended a candlelight commemoration on Tuesday night.
Schmidt's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the vigil, while the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace".
Lessons will resume on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students to return," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story was corrected to reflect that police now say that Lamb made the emergency call after shooting Schmidt, and that while Lamm in his emergency call referred to Prentiss as his wife, there is no indication that the two were ever married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer people for Christmas
Toys R Us says it will not hire as many Christmas season employees as it did last year, but the toy and baby products retailer says it will give the currently employed employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company said it plans to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers across the country, with 45,000 more being hired during Christmas 2014.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said it will start job interviewing this month and staffing will increase from October to December.
While the holidays themselves are months away, the Christmas business is getting closer, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equip stores with employees selling, shipping, and delivering products.
Michael J. Fox Jokes About His 'Date' With Princess Diana
“Back to the Future” was a great moment for Michael J. Fox.
She was also remarkable for personal reasons.
“We were sitting in the theatre waiting for the Royals, and I notice that the seat next to me is empty, and I’m starting to realize that Princess Diana will be sitting next to me,” he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary film, “Back in Time.”
The film begins, and it comes to mind that I’m a simulated yawning and an arm’s length away from being on a date with the Princess of Wales.
"Back in Time", a documentary about "Back to the Future", presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as with director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg.
Back for the Future premiered 30 years ago.
"It's really for me," Spielberg said, "unquestionably the biggest time travel film ever shot."
"Back in Time" will be available on VOD, DVD and selected cinemas in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia’s increased military support for Syria is: “There is no military solution” to the nearly five-year-long conflict, and more weapons will only exacerbate violence and misery for millions of people.
The UN chief once again calls on all parties, including the UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said at a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the foreign ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council – the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France – on the sidelines of the General Assembly’s ministerial meeting this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the splits in the Council and within the Syrian people and regional powers "make this situation insoluble."
Ban urged the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in addressing the crisis in Syria as they demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran.
8 survey results that show that Donald Trump is to be taken seriously.
Some have tried to brand it as a flop.
Others dismissed him as a joke.
Some are waiting for a collapse.
But no matter how some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump down from the top ranks in polls, it hasn’t (yet) worked.
Ten of the last eleven national polls showed Donald Trump to lead in the double-digit range, and some are starting to seriously wonder what it means for the chances of nominating the real estate mogul.
Of course, it is too early in the legislature.
No one claims that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts emphasize that at that time in 2011, Rick Perry’s leadership was handed over to the ascending Herman Cain, none of whom won even one state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election.
But outsider groups like Jeb Bush’s Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth are now recognizing Trump’s perseverance and are starting to let their dollars flow to overthrow him.
Here are some recent survey results that suggest that the real estate mogul is not just a temporary phase:
Trump’s popularity has turned 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a Monmouth University poll showed that only two in ten Republicans viewed the real estate mogul positively.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Now, six out of ten Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative opinion.
And these numbers hold in early states.
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as a candidate.
In a poll by CNN/ORC last week, 67% of Republicans said they would either be “excited” or “satisfied” if Trump was nominated.
Only two out of 10 say they’d be “angry” if he were the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates about the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they’d be “enthusiastic” vs. 40 percent say the same about Trump).
Next in terms of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21%.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be “unhappy” or “irritated” if Jeb Bush, the establishment’s favorite, became the candidate.
A majority of Republicans don’t see Trump’s temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombastic and offensive statements, 52 percent of Irish voters inclined toward the Republicans believe the real estate mogul has the right temperament for a president, according to ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
The same number applies in the nation’s first primary state, Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality for a commander-in-chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Still, 44 percent think he doesn’t have the personality to effectively perform his office, and nearly six out of 10 independents say his temper doesn’t fit into the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republicans are getting used to the idea.
When they put on their scholarly hats, Republican voters think Trump is real.
When asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, according to a poll by CNN/ORC last week, four out of ten say Trump is the best bet.
That’s a change since when four out of ten bet their money on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Full disclosure: GOP voters have not had the clearest crystal ball in the past.
At this point in the last cycle, four out of ten Republicans thought Rick Perry would win the nomination, up from just 28% for final candidate Mitt Romney.
Nevertheless, a large number of GOP voters see Trump’s campaign as plausible.
Even if the Republicans gathered around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Trump’s leadership, while anti-Trump support is diffused across more than a dozen other candidates.
But a survey by Monmouth University in early September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump is reaping majority support.
He has 13 points ahead of Carly Fiorina, 14 points ahead of Marco Rubio, 15 points ahead of Walker, 19 points ahead of Jeb Bush and 33 points ahead of Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
It's a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to beat him?
Ben Carson would overtake the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race.
A small majority of Donald Trump fans say they have formed their own opinions.
A new poll by CBS/NYT on Tuesday shows that just over half of voters who support Trump say they have firmly cast their votes.
Of course, a lot can happen to change that, and no one can really say never change their mind.
46% said they left the door open to switch to other candidates.
Still, Trump’s strongest competition at the moment is the other outsider, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they have formed their minds are twice as common for Trump.
Six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico “rapists” in his campaign speech two months ago, immigration has been a hub in the public discourse about 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump’s bombastic expression will keep decisive Hispanic Americans away from the Republican Party and damage the reorientation efforts.
But according to Monday’s new ABC/Post poll, six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump will apparently do the same.
The frustration over the government is climbing to new highs.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now account for about half of the support of Republican voters, mainly due to their outsider status.
Six out of 10 Republicans say in the new Monday poll from ABC/Post, they prefer a political outsider to someone with government experience.
They're angry at Washington, too.
A poll by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated about the Republicans in Congress, with 54 percent "unhappy" and 21 percent "hellishly annoyed."
Munich, Sylt and Co.: The five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
Here in the Hobookenweg is the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North Sea.
In the street, a square meter of a thatched roof house costs an average of 73,300 euros.
"On Sylt, the range of objects is naturally limited," says the study - that is why the high price.
A new study shows in which special locations a square meter costs the most.
Of course, 18.70 euros per square meter for a student booth in Munich are not really little.
However, unlike Germany’s top residences, one of the prizes is like peanuts.
The real estate service provider Engel & Völkers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square meter prices at dizzying heights.
There are several tens of thousands of euros nothing - per square meter, you know.
But well, who can afford it...
By the way: Munich is exceptionally not at the top here.
Champions League: Bayern dream start thanks to Müller and Götze
Two-time goal scorer in Piraeus: Bayern star Thomas Müller just has a run.
A happy hit from Thomas Müller paved the way for FC Bayern to a deserved 3-0 at Olympiakos Piraeus - then it went.
This is a great start to the Champions League season.
The world champions Thomas Müller and Mario Götze have given FC Bayern a dream start to the "Mission Milan" in the witch's kettle of Piraeus.
The team of coach Pep Guardiola won their opening match in the Champions League with the Greek record champion Olympiakos in a hot atmosphere thanks to Müller's double pack (52./90.+2) and Götzes hit (89.) earned with 3:0 (0:0).
The twelfth start success in series is to be the first step towards the final on 28 May 2016 in Italy, where Guardiola wants to finally bring the Henkelpott to Munich in the third start.
Müller received in his 28th goal in the Champions League to the Bayern leadership kindly with the help of Olympiakos goalkeeper Roberto, who allowed a flanked shot of the world champion to pass.
"We will not underestimate them," Bayern captain Philipp Lahm had promised before the match at the Karaiskakis stadium to 31,688 hot-blooded fans - and the Munichers kept their promise.
They showed a concentrated and committed performance without shining.
Piraeus had won his latest six home games in the royal class, including against well-known clubs such as Manchester United, Atlético Madrid or Juventus Turin.
In 2011, Borussia Dortmund also stumbled (1:3).
But the Bavarians, in seven European Cup matches with Greek teams undefeated, did not want to be the next victim.
They acted courageously, but often too ingeniously in their offensive efforts.
The attacks were too often initiated by shifting the game to the left-wing Douglas Costa, who rarely made it through against the former Braunschweiger Omar Elabdellaoui.
Müller was more lucky from the right than his flank from the right half field hit in the upper left corner.
In the 67th minute, the world champion forgave the possible 2-0.
The best opportunity in half one was Robert Lewandowski.
Initially, when Olympiakos striker Ideye Brown beat the header of Poland off the line (26th).
Then by direct acceptance, the goalkeeper Roberto pared with the knee (35.).
Although the Bavarians used to raise their dominant game, Piraeus was able to put needle stitches.
Goalkeeper Manuel Neuer was trustworthy.
For example, when he steered a shot of Ideye over the bar (56.).
Before Neuer, Guardiola had a four-piece chain with David Alaba defended in the center next to Jerome Boateng, who did well.
Mario Götze, after muscular problems back in the squad, sat outside at first.
The World Cup hero has only given the green light after the final training, said sports director Matthias Sammer at "Sky": "If you want to make something different from it, that is already vicious."
Guardiola also opted against him on the first change when he brought Kingsley Coman for the beaten Lewandowski (59th).
Götze came late for Arturo Vidal (76th) and made everything clear 13 minutes later, by penalty, Müller put one more on it.
Before the game, there were riots in the stadium.
After a smaller group of partly disguised Bavarian fans in their audience block had apparently provoked the supporters of host Piraeus with words and gestures, the security forces intervened and proceeded with batons against the Munich supporters.
At least one Bayern fan was transported from the stadium injured.
Smoking has a higher risk of losing teeth
Smoking does not only harm the lungs, but also the teeth – this is what a long-term study in Potsdam suggests.
The good news is that if you give up, the risk decreases quickly.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This is the result of a long-term study by an international research team, including several employees of the German Institute for Nutrition Research (DIfE) in Potsdam.
Compared to non-smokers, the risk of losing their teeth prematurely was 2.5 to 3.6 times higher.
The scientists had observed more than 23,300 participants.
The main causes of tooth loss are caries and inflammation of the gums, the DIfE emphasizes.
For this periodontitis, smoking is a risk factor, the authors emphasize.
The link between smoking and tooth loss is therefore due to more frequent gum inflammation in smokers.
It is not clear to what extent smoking also increases the risk of caries.
However, people who quit smoking could reduce their risk within a short period of time, the researchers write in the Journal of Dental Research.
However, it could take more than ten years for the risk to fall back to the level of non-smokers, first author Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham explained.
One must convince people to become non-smokers, study leader Heiner Boeing of DIfE explained: "Smoking shortens the lifespan."
Not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and, according to our findings, also leads to good dental health until old age.
In Germany, over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years is affected by toothlessness, according to the DIfE.
Previous studies have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss.
The new long-term study confirmed the findings.
Archaeologists find remains of late antiquity on the banks of the Rhine in Cologne
Archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne.
Near the construction site for the new Rhine boulevard, archaeologists of the Roman-Germanic Museum have uncovered skeletons and remains of historical buildings, said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday.
Since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine, historians have been looking for so-called soil monuments.
For all construction projects in the city district of Cologne, the museum is always used as a specialist office for archaeological soil monument maintenance.
In the third construction phase of the Rhine boulevard, the archaeologists found their way.
It was already known from textual documents that there was a fortress at the site in the 4th century and a church in the 8th century, Trier explained.
In addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower, a cemetery with around 350 tombs, which probably belonged to the church, was discovered.
Young woman caught by freight train
After a young woman is injured at the station in Geilenkirchen-Lindern, the federal police asks the population for help.
At around 1.40 a.m. on early Wednesday morning, the woman crossed the tracks coming from the station building at the end of the platform and was caught by a freight train coming from Mönchengladbach.
By capturing the train, she has suffered the most serious injuries according to the federal police.
She received emergency medical treatment on the spot and was taken to a hospital by emergency personnel.
The investigating officers have no knowledge of the reason for the young woman’s nightly crossing of the track.
The incident may have been observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic perceptions.
Residents or passers-by of Linderner Bahn, Ziegelbäckerweg, Thomashofstraße and Leiffarther Straße (L364) are eligible.
Information on the cause of the accident can be given via the 24-hour and free hotline of the Federal Police on phone 0800/6888000 or any other police department.
EU Commission proposes new court in dispute over TTIP
To mitigate the dispute over the planned transatlantic free trade agreement TTIP, the EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system.
The controversial private arbitration bodies for disputes between corporations and states are therefore to be replaced by a more transparent system, which in its functioning corresponds to much more traditional courts.
"We want to set up a system that citizens can trust," said European Commissioner Cecilia Malmström.
The Swede intends to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US.
The German government has announced support.
TTIP is the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people.
The plans to reform the current arbitration procedures specifically provide for the EU states and the US to jointly elect independent judges for a new Investment Court.
They should come in equal parts from the EU, the US and from third countries.
For the first time, a second instance is also envisaged.
It would allow for appeals against judgments.
Up to now, the parties to the proceedings have agreed on arbitrators, there was no possibility of appeal against their judgments.
In the discussion in recent months, it became clear that citizens did not trust the old ISDS system in terms of fairness and justice, Malmström commented.
In the long term, it wants to work towards an International Investment Court.
There, for example, disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries could be resolved.
The Investor-State Arbitration (ISDS), which is mainly required by large corporations, is considered to be one of the main reasons for Europe’s great resistance to TTIP.
The traditional arbitration courts are criticized by opponents as a kind of parallel justice, through which companies can claim damages at the expense of taxpayers, outlaw national laws, or enforce a lowering of consumer and environmental standards.
In initial opinions, anti-TTIP organisations such as Campact called the EU Commission’s proposals insufficient.
It was criticised above all that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada (Ceta).
German economic state secretary Matthias Machnig (SPD), on the other hand, described the plans as great progress.
In the reform, the Commission takes into account key points that Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel worked out with other EU trade ministers in the spring.
The old system of private arbitration is off the table.
The French government also welcomed Malmström’s plans.
The European business association BusinessEurope warned against restricting the possibilities of the business by too many new rules.
Especially small and medium-sized businesses could be disadvantaged, it said.
When the talks on the free trade agreement TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) could be concluded remained unclear on Wednesday.
Negotiations have been going on since mid-2013.
However, the issue of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the United States.
Initially, a framework for the agreement should be established by the end of this year.
This deadline is deemed to be non-sustainable.
Delicate Folk by Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
Eleven years ago, Sufjan Stevens was on stage at the Cologne Prime Club (today: Luxor).
Next to him is a flipchart on which the shy-looking folk singer has recorded the picturesque US state of Michigan with a felt pen.
The entire audience, about 40 people, is almost gripped by Steven’s lecture.
He tells about his meticulously and delicately arranged songs on the basis of various places, which he repeatedly draws on the map.
Where they originated and what it looks like there, in his homeland.
Since then, Stevens has proven to be a wonderfully creative madman.
With the 2003-released and third album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State" cleverly composed songs appear, which harmoniously nestle very close to American folk of the late sixties, but can drift into the great opulent at any time.
There is a rumor that "Michigan" would be the first part of a bold series: each of the 50 states should be sung in succession.
But already in 2004 and near the Rhine, "Seven Swans" has already appeared and positively breaks certain expectations.
Reduced Stevens performs here.
Live is enough for him guitar and banjo.
A year later, the New York-based musician returns to the series.
"Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Feel The Illinoise") is a widely acclaimed masterpiece released in 2005.
Abundant in ideas and stylistic finesse.
The album enters the American Billboard charts and is missing from any of the influential music media’s annual bestsellers.
After extremely productive experiments, Stevens then uses very extensive electronic offsets on "The Age of Adz" (2010).
This sixth decent studio album is still orchestrated broadly, but carried by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effect and hall.
Long gone from the smaller clubs, the stage shows here become a colorful spectacle of neon headbands and large fluorescent stage decoration.
Currently Sufjan Stevens is touring Germany as part of a five-member band.
In the dark kept hamburger More!
In the theatre, he mainly presents the "Carrie & Lowell", which has been available since March.
Although almost 2,000 guests are now sitting in their chairs, Stevens, who has become significantly more mature, returns to intimacy and folk.
Without a word to the audience, the group of excellent musicians plays through the broadly enriched album.
From the audience you hear: The lecture is "more opulent" and you can use it to "throw the record basically away".
Only to an addition, Stevens modestly thanks, plays acoustically few older songs and finally bows under thunderous applause.
Jeremy Corbyn's debut at Prime Minister's Question Time
Since his election, Mr Corbyn's debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time is highly anticipated
The new Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn will make his debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time and will be playing with David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will rise to ask the first of his six questions shortly after noon, with his performance likely to be reviewed by the media and Labour MPs.
He called for "less theatre and more facts" at this weekly event.
He also said that he could skip some sessions to leave them to colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Corbyn’s leadership, as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TUC annual meeting on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, Labour’s decision to remain silent during a 75th anniversary celebration of the Battle of Britain on Tuesday while singing the national anthem has provoked criticism from a number of Tory MPs and is at the center of several cover stories in the newspapers.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has caught attention
A spokesman for Corbyn said he had "standing in a respectful silence" and he acknowledged the "heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England."
But a member of Mr. Corbyn’s shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC Two Newsnight program that he had advised the Labour chairman to sing the national anthem “independently” of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve on Mr Corbyn’s top team, citing differences in business, defence and foreign policy, while less than a sixth of the Parliamentary Party originally supported him as leader.
BBC Political Correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences are also “stacking” within Labour, following Mr Corbyn’s statements on the position on the European Union and the limitation of profits.
Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference that Labour is proposing changes to remove the whole idea of a limitation overall.
Hours later, Mr Smith, the shadow labor and pension minister, said the party was "very clear" that it was only against government plans to lower the limit from <0xC2><0xA3>26,000 to <0xC2><0xA3>23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour chairman to face David Cameron over the dispatch box in Parliament in the last decade since he became Tory chief.
The Labour chairman, who promised a different policy approach, says he has "crowd-sourced" ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and has been given more than 30,000 suggestions.
The Islington North MP has said that the prime minister's questioning hour is too confrontational, and that he will refrain from both "beating readiness" and fighting with bars, and instead has set out to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality, and the challenges facing young people.
Mr Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle, the shadow economics minister, will represent him if he does not participate - for example, if Mr Cameron is traveling abroad.
He also brought up the idea that other colleagues occasionally take the floor and that he approached John Bercow, the speaker of the House of Commons, to discuss the issue.
When he became a leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said he wanted to move away from politics in the style of a "casper theatre," often associated with the prime minister's questioning hour, but a few years later he admitted that he had failed.
Since it was first broadcast on television in 1990, the question hour with the Prime Minister was seen as the most important barometer of a leader’s judgment and leadership in the House of Commons and his position among his parliamentary colleagues, although critics have argued that it has become a cartoon and needs far-reaching reforms.
'Geschossen in Joburg': Homeless teenagers trained as photographers
The city centre of Johannesburg is a tough place if you are homeless.
But a group of former street children have found a way to learn a skill and make a living with it.
"I was shot in Joburg" (I was shot in Joburg) is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless youth how to take photos of their surroundings and make a profit from them.
BBC News has met one of the first graduates of the project.

Pound rises due to accelerated wage growth in the UK
The pound rose sharply, according to data indicating an increase in wage growth in the United Kingdom, while the FTSE 100 was boosted by the SABMiller bid target.
Between May and July, earnings without bonuses in the UK grew 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
This percentage has been the fastest since 2009 and provided estimates of the timing of interest rate hikes.
The pound rose more than 1% against the dollar to $1,5505 and climbed to 0.84% against the euro to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,3730.
The FTSE 100 Index closed with a 1.49% increase to 6,229.21.
SABMiller was the outstanding stock in the market and made a 20% jump following the acquisition of rival AB InBev.
A transaction would combine the two largest breweries in the world and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were 0.9% higher after encouraging news from competitor Richemont.
Richemont’s latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China – a key market for Burberry – are returning to growth.
Glencore shares rose by 5% after the mining giant said it had raised $2.5 billion from a stock sale as part of its debt reduction strategy.
The stocks of the packaging and paper company Mondi were the biggest losers on the index, with a 4.3% drop after Goldman Sachs set its rating rating rating to "sell".
JD Sports rose by 3.1% after the sportswear company reported a pre-tax earnings of 46.6 million for the half-year.
JD Sports chief says higher wages are jeopardizing the expansion.
JD Sports CEO Peter Cowgill says a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean “more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers.”
But it is unlikely that this purchasing power will offset the higher labour costs at his company, he says.
The cost could hit JD Sports’ expansion plans, he added, and that could mean there would be fewer additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in the capital: On Bieber expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, Megastar.
Lappy 21 years young, a hangover with chic frise.
The guy with the platinum-blonde hair is 100 million euros.
Or even more.
Mr. Bieber is currently in Berlin.
And the generation U17 is crazy.
Like Wiktoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard the name "Ritz Carlton".
It's okay.
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday.
Including Ewa and Victoria from Poland.
Since 7 o’clock in the morning, however, the Polish sits on the cold stone slabs in front of the Berlin luxury hotel on Potsdamer Platz.
The Bieber-Bau: Here is your idol, whose posters hang in Szczecin, since Monday evening.
The suite, where the Canadian singer lives, costs just as much a day as her mom Ewa earns in half a year.
If anything.
She says, "Actually, my Wiktoria would have to be in tenth grade in high school."
"I'm fulfilling her a dream".
Compulsory schooling?
Who's itching?
Not the fans.
Not even Bieber himself.
He took care of it anyway.
For the advertising in the Superbowl’s advertising break, he raised three million, a two-year deal with an anti-pick company flushed many, many dollars into the Bieber account.
And with every doll that looks like him and walks over the counter, Bieber also receives cash.
When Justin Bieber drinks a coffee, you’re amazed at the window pane.
More than 100 million are said to have been captured.
Some say the hype goes too far.
Others emphasize that Bieber is in the U.S. and UK with his new single "What do you mean?" at number one.
Bieber himself, whose fourth album is to follow in November, is not interested in the many zeros for the first time.
At least he does.
Pegida poster brings Lebanese to Kartoffeldöner idea
Potatoes or Döner?
It is possible to do both - in the Kartoffeldöner, which the Oldenburg snack owner Hani Alhay developed.
Inspired by the phrase "potato instead of döner" on a poster of the Pegida movement, Alhay put potato and meat together on a skewer.
He was inspired by a poster at a Pegida demonstration with the inscription "Potatoes instead of Döner", which he had accidentally seen on television.
Since then, there has been a barbecue skewer in his shop, which is stocked with meat and potatoes.
“This is multicultural for the stomach,” says Alhay.
The idea has since been registered by the Lebanese at the Patent Office in Munich.
There, according to the authority, it has recently been protected as a utility model.
Therefore, Alhay does not want to reveal how much meat and how many potatoes the skewer contains.
“It tastes even better together,” he says.
Culinary international understanding is also well received by its customers.
Metcash launches groundbreaking campaign to combat Aldi invasion
Metcash is trying to protect the IGA stores from an Aldi advance in South Australia and Western Australia.
Food Wholesaler Metcash has launched a down-to-earth campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a $700 million Aldi invasion.
While Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relationships with local food suppliers and building the IGA brand through mainstream marketing and social media marketing, as well as events such as Adelaide show.
IGA dealers and suppliers jump on board, with brands such as ice cream maker Simmo from Dunsborough distributing samples in IGA stores and store owners selling discounted tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers.
Metcash is expected to release further details of its defense strategy on September 29 as the wholesaler of food, alcohol and equipment conducts its annual Investor Strategy Day.
There is a lot at stake as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Metcash’s IGA stores and generate higher profit margins than Metcash’s IGA network in the Eastern States.
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland – more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the Eastern States.
However, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that twelve months after opening its first markets, Aldi will grab around five percent of the food market in these two states and take away sales from all existing stakeholders, but mainly independent retailers.
According to a report released this week, analyst Tom Kierath of Morgan Stanley estimated that IGA retailers could lose $360 million in revenue per year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year, generating revenue of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss in the food and groceries business and in quantities on Metcash’s high fixed-cost basis could cost Metcash around $13 million in profit before interest and taxes, Mr Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly to Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley estimates that Metcash’s food and grocery sales will drop by 3.8 percent in 2016, by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and reduce its market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, the founder of Magellan Financial Group, told at a business dinner in Melbourne that Metcash is likely to disappear within a decade.
Metcash refused to respond publicly to Mr. Douglass' comments.
But it is assumed that a Metcash board member contacted Mr. Douglass last week.
IGA’s market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and revenue from Metcash’s food and grocery trade, which supplies about 1,200 IGA retailers, has fallen by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting operational debt reduction while pressure on sales and margins.
However, the wholesaler is resisting and investing more than $150 million to align sales prices with Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products each week and improve IGA retailers in improving their stores through faster growing fresh food and delivering a better selection of private label food.
Metcash’s chief executive Ian Morrice says the price adjustments and store refurbishment programs will be on the rise, and hopes that the wholesaler will return to profit growth for the first time in four years in 2017.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is backed by President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves praise rather than criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the “collateral damages” in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves praise rather than criticism for his own behavior, according to the president of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo, repeatedly referred to as "Special Ks", came into the limelight through Kyrgios' infamous clash with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a fiery qualifying game in Cincinnati soon after, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the referee, with Harrison exclaiming, "Wawrinka should have beaten Kyrgios, and I should have beaten the kid."
While last seen smashing a tennis racket after a spasm defeated a potential U.S. Open win by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was steadfastly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth for second place in the singles behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-finals against Great Britain.
"One thing I'm pretty excited about is the fact that, in my opinion, Thanasi was a little drawn into the dispute," Healy said.
He broke a racket when he lost in the US Open due to a spasm, but he’s not the first player to break a racket out of frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know he’s not proud of it.
But, really, he behaved extremely well in the U.S. Open, even under the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of recognition.
He has a great team around him, he has a great family around him, and I think he’s been treated a little too harshly.
He is a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits into the team and so on, he has never had a problem with the other players, he is respected in the changing area, he trains hard, he is in good shape, he is a very stable and mature young guy, and I think he deserves to be judged by his own merits.
Healy also endorsed the decision not to include Kyrgios in the important preliminary ruling, which begins Friday, and he described the "joint decision" as the right one for everyone, but he assured the man from Canberra to return to the team as a long-term staple."
"First, we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not on all the controversy around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And I think Nick made the ascent very quickly, which people like Federer and Murray have pointed out. He rises in the eyes of the public, and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we try to support him, we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions. Some time outside of the spotlight where he can only think about it, I think it's the best for him, and it's the best for the team.
Europe's refugee crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes the border, holds back refugees
Hungary declared a state of emergency and closed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday, detaining all those who tried to enter the country illegally, all with the aim of stopping the influx of migrants.
Chaos followed at the border when hundreds of migrants accumulated in a no-man’s land and Serbian officials responded with outrage.
The people who had fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a strip of land on the road between the two checkpoints of the countries and built tents and settled there.
But frustrations increased.
As a police helicopter hovered over them, the migrants chanted "Open the border!" and shouted insults to the Hungarian emergency police.
Some refused food and water in protest.
Serbia's foreign minister said it was "unacceptable" that migrants were sent back from Hungary while more and more arrived from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not a collateral damage.
There must be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days," said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The turmoil on the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after the 28-nation bloc was unable to agree on a common immigration policy at a disputed meeting in Brussels.
However, the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in overwhelmed Italy and Greece, expressing their hope that eventually – next month or by the end of the year – an agreement would be reached that the EU states would take in another 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
On Tuesday, Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special summit of the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis on the continent.
However, Hungary did not place its hopes on an immediate action from Brussels or its neighbors.
The emergency declared on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis, allowing them to block roads and speed up asylum procedures.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto, meanwhile, said that his country is also planning to build a barbed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influx of migrants through the country - after ending a fence at the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners were used in the race to build the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a major bottleneck and entry point into the European Union for many refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has insisted that most arriving people are economic refugees looking for a better life, not war refugees entitled to protection – a view that is strongly inconsistent with other EU states, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, make it a crime to cross the border or damage the four-metre (13 feet) high fence that the government had erected along the southern border with Serbia, and also impose higher prison sentences for convicted traffickers.
“Due to the situation created by mass migration, the Hungarian government declares the state of emergency,” Zoltan Kovacs spokesman told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We say it very clearly: illegal crossing is a crime.
Parliament has yet to approve the military’s deployment, which is expected next week, but Associated Press reporters have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs at the border for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, state security adviser to Orban, said authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border, 15 others had already penetrated deeper into the country.
They come over by damaging the fence, they are now in police custody and are accused of committing crimes under the new laws.
The authorities are in the process of repairing the fence quickly.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a barbed-wire train wagon arrived to close the borders.
Chaos surrounded the main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, when the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container to process people’s data and pushed a crowd into it.
About 20 managed to get in, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main motorway link between Serbia and Hungary, saying they would refuse food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
2016 election: Hillary Clinton's lead to Bernie Sanders cut in half in national poll
Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit lead in the democratic race for the nomination at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders is gaining ground against her.
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of Democratic voters in the primary elections (58 percent earlier), while Sanders ranks second, with 27 percent (up 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether to run for president, receives support from 15 percent of primary Democratic voters.
More than five months before the primary elections begin, most Democratic voters say it’s too early to say that their opinion is determined on which candidate they will support.
But Clinton’s supporters are more consistent in their election than those of the other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll, Clinton has lost to a number of demographic groups, while Sanders made some gains.
Clinton holds a big lead among women and moderates, but those lead have diminished.
Their support among men has fallen significantly, and Sanders is only back by 5 points.
Clinton’s advantage among democratic voters under the age of 50 has vanished, and she and Sanders are now at the same level.
However, Clinton still has a big lead among the older voters.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders with a double-digit lead to the Liberals, but Sanders now has a five-point lead to this group.
About half of the Democratic primary voters nationwide say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if nominated by the party.
A quarter would support her with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support her because she is the candidate.
Six percent would not support it.
Perhaps not surprisingly, Clinton’s current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about her.
The views are more mixed among those who do not currently support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of primary Democratic voters say they enthusiastically support Clinton, fewer Republican voters say so about their top candidate Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton’s supporters are asked in an open question why they want her to be the candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16%), followed by the view that it is time for a woman to become president (13%) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10%).
Clinton’s supporters also mention their connection to Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Consent to dealing with the problems and eligibility are also cited.
As the vice president throws a potential for the presidential office into the balance, 57 percent of primary democratic voters want to see him in the race - even though one third believes he shouldn't.
When Democratic primary voters are asked who would be their second choice for the party, Biden is at the forefront.
More than half of Clinton’s supporters say Biden would be their second choice far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton’s lead ahead of Sanders increases from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chances of winning the election; however, that figure has fallen from 78 percent last month.
Biden is by far a second in this measurement, but the percentage that sees him as the “most eligible” has risen.
Nevertheless, when asked what is more important for a candidate, Democratic voters are calling questions about eligibility.
Similar to last month, no Democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out as unacceptable to these primary voters.
The Democratic candidates or potential candidates produce good results on some important characteristics among voters in their party’s primary elections.
Majorities see Clinton, Sanders, and Biden as honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong leadership skills.
Biden scores best in honesty among the three candidates, while Clinton’s strength is leadership.
Thirty percent of Democratic voters don’t believe Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say that about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent don’t have an opinion on him.
Democratic primary voters generally also see Clinton, Sanders, and Biden ideologically in line with their views.
In all of these measurements, about a quarter of the democratic voters do not have an opinion of Sanders.
As questions about Hillary Clinton’s use of a personal email address and a server continue to be asked during her tenure as Secretary of State, most primary Democratic voters are satisfied with their explanation of the matter, saying that it has not influenced their opinions overall.
But it’s a different story in the American public overall.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with their statement, while only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion on this issue was divided in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said the email controversy had no effect on their general opinions of Clinton, although 36 percent said their opinions of her had worsened.
It’s mostly Republicans, more than six out of 10, who say their views of Clinton have gotten worse.
Although Clinton is considered honest and trustworthy by her party’s voters, this continues to be a problem for them among registered voters overall: only 32 percent see them as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than last month, and 15 points less since May.
62% of voters do not consider them an honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55 percent of the eligible voters across the country also see Trump as not honest and untrustworthy.
Clinton and Trump, however, get good scores in leadership.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush are the best in honesty.
A majority sees Sanders as more than honest, but as with Carson, many don’t have an opinion of him.
The error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the primary is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson moves close to Donald Trump in nationwide poll
Ben Carson is close behind Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times poll
The two candidates now account for half of the voters’ support in the new poll, and others are dramatically losing hold.
Republican voters across the country continue to support Trump in large numbers, with support growing from 23% in the last CBS poll conducted before Fox News debate last month, by 27% in Tuesday’s poll.
But Carson shot from 6% to 23% in the same period.
The poll also found that Carson is well received by demographic groups and outperforms Trump among Republican voters with higher education.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, has been knocked down with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, who fell the lowest, from 10% support last month to now 2%.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are ranked third with 6%.
The margin of error in the sample of 376 people from Republican voters in this latest poll is plus or minus 6% and was conducted in September.
The latest CNN/ORC poll released last week shows Carson is rising in the polls — he ends up with 19% support among Republicans, behind Trump with 32% support.
The latest poll by ABC News/Washington Post also showed Trump clearly ahead of Carson.
Looking at a Carson rising last week, Trump found some side-slips for the former neurosurgeon, even after Carson apologized for questioning Trump’s beliefs.
“We need energy,” Trump said last Saturday during a campaign appearance in Iowa.
Pleasant bathing temperatures: The eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm.
Even if peak values are only measured in the distance, a trip to the Mediterranean Sea is enough for seafarers to find warm water.
A swim in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees.
Some people do not go into the sea anymore: the water in the North and Baltic Sea has a maximum of 18 degrees this week, the German Weather Service (DWD) informs.
The Mediterranean, on the other hand, continues to offer bathing temperatures: in the east, it even rises to 29 degrees.
In the Adriatic it is in the top 25 degrees, in France 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt is 28 degrees.
Five Brotherhood Members Accused of the Death of a Baruch College Newcomer
Almost two years after a student died during a harassing ritual of a student union in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, murder charges are filed against five people.
Members of the New York Baruch College Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during an introductory ritual in September 2013, delaying his transport to the hospital, which contributed to his death, police said.
Officials said he had been loaded with a 30-pound backpack full of sand with blindfolded eyes, and repeatedly attacked as he tried to approach a target across a frozen field.
Mr. Deng finally complained of headaches, then he fell unconscious.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood did not call 911 after Deng fainted and allegedly waited an hour before taking him to a hospital, police said.
However, they had time to change Deng’s clothes, google his symptoms, and contact Andy Meng, the Brotherhood’s national president, for advice, police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide utensils and basically put the welfare of the Brotherhood above that of Michael Deng," said police chief Wagner.
He could not be revived, and he died the next morning from his injuries.
According to an autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly injured with blunt force to the head, torso and thighs.
"Too many families have been destroyed by the bullying of the Brotherhood, and at least one student has been dying every year since 1970," Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, said in a statement.
Brotherhoods and their members must be held accountable, and this step by authorities is very important.
A Monroe County Grand Jury recommended a charge of third-degree murder for the first five members.
Thirty-two members of the Brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, are also charged with harassment and the formation of a criminal organization.
"We don't just want to blame the people involved, but if there's an organization that has - official or unofficial - sanctioned this, we will also hold it accountable," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College has banned the Brotherhood, and the National Brotherhood has revoked its affiliation to the local group.
This will happen when the Fed raises interest rates.
An interest rate hike is coming, and the upturn will shake, yields on bonds will rise, and the economy will slip into a recession.
We know that.
What we don’t know is how long it will last and how long it will last.
In particular, history provides little guidance for the economy on how to proceed.
A recession came within just 11 months of the first interest rate hike and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often, if not always, a factor in how the economy and financial investments react.
That’s why U.S. central bank representatives have stressed so heavily that investors should focus not on when it begins to raise interest rates, but rather on the period needed for normalization.
In fact, several variables play a role.
In the end, however, market participants might find that the whole excitement about an interest rate hike may have been exaggerated.
“The first increase in the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of ‘cheap money’,” said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a statement to customers.
In contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to normal highs, but still at too low levels to lead to the seismic shock that many seem to fear.
However, this does not mean that there will be no impact.
Here’s a historical trend-based look at how some areas of the economy might react:
As the market has seen last month, anticipating interest rate hikes can make things volatile for a while.
Once the increase arrives, the impact is not so dramatic.
“There seems to be a tendency for asset earnings to be strangled 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which may again reflect the delay in monetary policy,” said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happens after Fed interest rate hikes.
More specifically, the market is mostly in the upward trend over the past 35 years – about 14 percent – on the way to interest rate hikes, pretty flat in the 250 days afterwards (average gain of 2.6 percent), then back to normal after 500 days, with an average return of 14.4 percent in the past six past cycles, according to a recent analysis published by Bob Doll, chief investment strategist at Nuveen Management.
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the stocks tends to occur later in the increase cycle and the return starts to decrease.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but interest rate hikes often encourage them.
In the current case, the Fed is faced with some conditions that did not exist before and that could accelerate a recession.
It is particularly noteworthy that gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point in the Fed’s interest rate hike.
According to Deutsche Bank, for the 118 interest rate hikes since 1950, only twice the nominal GDP was below 4.5 percent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent, few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Increases in interest rates in such a fragile economic backdrop could be risky, raising the question “whether this time it’s different,” Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants have been anticipating a Fed interest rate hike throughout the year, and all eyes were on the Federal Open Market Committee meeting this week, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe the FOMC could approve an increase in this session, futures trading only indicates a 25 percent probability.
“In our study, all of the increase cycles from 1950 to today took place in a super-cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and eclipsed pre-recession levels very quickly after the start of recovery,” the report said.
In contrast, this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase.
The current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and this is 74 months so far.
Fixed income was also volatile as the market anticipates an interest rate hike, and the pattern is quite similar to that of the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than on stocks when they change their strategic course.
For bonds, yields seem to change direction as soon as the first increase/sink occurs in the cycle.
At the end of the increase cycle, bond yields fall immediately, Deutsche Bank said.
The strategists of Charles Schwab believe that the rise in interest rates will cause returns between longer and shorter bonds to come closer together and lead to flattening of the curve.
High-yield bonds often bring better returns in such a climate, although “we are still careful to expect higher returns,” said Kathy Jones, a fixed-income analyst at Schwab, in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones believes that markets have already adapted to Fed strategy expectations.
“In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy,” she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have risen, the yield curve is flatter, credit margins have expanded, and volatility has risen – all characteristics of the market as the Fed tightens its strategy.
Overall, companies that handle the greater part of their U.S. operations will benefit as interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational corporations with high debt will be worse off as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market as well as financing their debt.
"History shows that 'quality' stocks tend to respond extremely positively three months after an initial interest rate hike," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report for customers.
Companies with a strong balance sheet have exceeded companies with a weak balance sheet by an average of 5 percentage points after each of the rate hikes in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high capital returns and low volatility in their shares also outperformed their low-quality counterparts by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
Debt becomes a big problem.
Companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.
Outside of pure stock games, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savors could see profits from higher returns, even if experts disagree on how quickly this will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says Member of Parliament Andrew Bingham
The Conservative Member of Parliament criticized the station for its "stupidity"
He argues that he is increasingly indistinguishable from commercial rivals.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards and said they only imitated The Brits
Parliament's colleague Damien Collins attacked the show The Voice, saying it wasn't very original.
BBC Radio 3 is "transforming" into Classic FM, a leading member of parliament claims, increasing new pressure on the station, proving that it is doing something the private stations are not doing.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC bosses that the public radio station was “stupid” and increasingly indistinguishable from its commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like to use the word 'stupid' - but it seems to be turning into Classic FM," he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, which launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which launched last year, seem to be just under a different name.
So, if you’re trying to do something else — these are two spontaneous examples where you’re actually just imitating what’s already on the market,” Bingham said.
BBC director general denied the allegations, arguing that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and public education.
What I learn from Radio 3, I won’t learn about classical music anywhere else.
And there is a commitment to live music and making music that is truly unmatched.
"And Radio 3's commitment to finding new music and commissioning new works is really important to me," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Davey argued that there was a need to work harder to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music.
Radio 3, however, was not the only element of BBC production that was fired during the hearing in the Committee on Culture, Media and Sports for kicking the commercial rival.
Tory MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice – the BBC’s musical talent show purchased by Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated cost of <0xC2><0xA3>22 million.
See why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges - was produced "in a special BBC manner".
He added that he wished the company would “find a hit from our in-house stable” the next time it started an entertainment series.
However, he refused to exclude the order of further rows of The Voice in the future or to spend money from the fee payers on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales rose the slowest in August and Black Friday may be responsible
In the first three months of 2015, there was a 7% increase in online sales.
In the last month, there was the lowest result since the start of records in 2000.
Online sales intensified three years ago with the use of mobile phones for shopping
Experts believe that Black Friday in November slowed spending
Virtual shopping has been booming for over a decade, and many of the UK’s main shopping streets have turned into ghost cities.
But experts say there are now signs that online sales are stagnating, after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015.
Total August spending presented the lowest growth increase since the start of records in 2000, with only a five percent increase over the previous year.
Experts say there are signs of online sales stagnating after new figures indicated only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the growth rates for the previous years and fall to 2000, then that has always evolved over time," Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index, told The Guardian.
He explained that online sales intensified three years ago when buyers began to make purchases with their phones.
It meant that more people could shop online and that people could do so in different environments, such as at home on the sofa.
But now that’s commuting, and we may be experiencing a decline in growth.
The Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the decline in sales.
Experts believe that buyers are holding back their purchases before this event, which takes place on the last Friday of November each year.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers gathered around their computers to make their bargains, and some merchant websites crashed.
Experts believe that Black Friday, where buyers are fighting for bargains, could stop buyers from making purchases.
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that out of <0xC2><0xA3>5 spending, just over <0xC2><0xA3>1 was spent online.
For some products such as TVs and washing machines, more than a third of purchases are now made through web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online rather than in downtown fashion chains.
Muslims bury those killed in Mecca crane accident - Bin Laden's family is sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead are carried through the streets by Muslims at the first burials in Mecca
Saudi Arabia blames part of the collapse of the giant Saudi bin Laden group
The Ministry of Health also said a total of 394 people were injured after the crane crashed
Hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane collapsed at Mecca’s Grand Mosque.
Grievings, largely dressed in white, filled the stretch to pay their respects when the first of the dead made their final journey to the Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The mourning procession passed by the Holy Place, where just days earlier a construction crane fell through the ceiling of the mosque and then on those who prayed.
The bodies were released for burial when the Saudi king imposed a sanction on the construction company of the Bin Laden family for the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 prayers who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Mosque of Mecca were carried through the streets.
Among the dead was Qasim Akram from Bolton, Greater Manchester, father of four children, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed down.
Mr. Akram was with his parents at the Great Mosque before the beginning of the annual Hajj.
Saudi officials have already firmly pledged that the Hajj to Mecca will continue with thousands who will continue to come to the city.
Today King Salman said that the Bin Laden Group should not have left the arm of the crane when it was not used.
An Arabic version of the decree, published by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, said the Bin Laden group was co-responsible for the collapse.
The news agency’s English-language service did not report this detail, but said that the company’s management was prohibited from traveling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman pledged to reveal what caused the fall of the crane that plunged into a courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered before the Hajj, which takes place later this month.
The Bin Laden Group did not make any statements about the collapse of the crane, and its representatives were not available for comment.
The Royal Decree also blamed the group for not up-to-date security measures and for not cooperating with meteorologists.
Dozens of cranes surround Mecca’s Grand Mosque as part of the massive construction project led by the Bin Laden Group.
The Bin Laden family has been connected to the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and is taking over major construction projects.
The late leader of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was a renegade son who was expropriated by the family in the 1990s.
The crash of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain, just days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslim.
Officials said that 158 people remain in the hospital.
Government officials ordered that 1 million rials (<0xC2><0xA3>174,000) be paid to the relatives of the killed and the same amount to permanently injured.
Other injuries will receive half of that amount.
B&Q Boss says the time of cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over
British people are increasingly employing craftsmen, says Veronique Laury
The number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe has increased
This will result in 200 more Screwfix stores targeting craftsmen being opened
At the same time, Kingfisher will close 60 B&Q outlets nationwide
By Rupert Steiner, City Chief Correspondent of the Daily Mail
It is claimed that British lay down their hammers and brushes in favor of the use of skilled Eastern European craftsmen performing the work in their homes
If you can cleverly handle a hammer or brush to paint walls, you seem to be a minority nowadays.
Because Britons are increasingly employing craftsmen to perform home improvement jobs in their homes, according to the company’s boss behind B&Q.
Véronique Laury, new managing director of Kingfisher, which owns the hardware stores chain, said a major increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe who offer services at lowest prices is now outdated.
Kingfisher plans to open another 200 Screwfix shops for craftsmen and close 60 B&Q outlets.
Mrs. Laury said she wanted to employ more women in B&Q stores, as eight out of ten purchasing decisions in the store are made by women.
At the moment, men predominate among employees.
She said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households doing more renovations than in the past.
Mrs Laury said: "It still works a majority of men in our stores.
We need to shift this more towards a balance.
Basically, half of our customers are women, with 80 percent of the decisions being made about the purchase of items by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Mrs. Laury, who is one of only five women at the forefront of a UK leader listed on the FTSE100 Index, has also restructured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has exactly 50 percent of the team filled with women, including its management and CFO.
Mrs Laury said: "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
It was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board.
Kingfisher reported a decline in half-year earnings and sales after the group shouldered the cost of closing the stores.
Due to the trend, Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B&Q, will open 200 new stores.
Officials of Aich/Dob in court for infidelity
On Wednesday, two officials of Austrian volleyball vice-champion Aich/Dob were held responsible for infidelity and tax evasion at the state court in Klagenfurt.
The defendants were not guilty.
One of them had also been charged with abuse of office.
He was acquitted of this accusation in May.
The current process has been postponed.
According to Attorney General Robert Riffel, the preliminary investigation revealed that the defendants used funds from club accounts that they were allowed to dispose of in their functions for private purposes between 2006 and 2011.
The damage amounts to around 400,000 euros.
Sports officials are also charged with financial misconduct.
This fact was dismissed by the chairwoman of the Senate, Judge Michaela Sanin.
It should be negotiated at a later date.
To reject the infidelity, the defense stated that the club had never suffered a financial disadvantage at any time.
The sports officials had only charged expense compensation and the sports club, for which they worked from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money, out of the debt - the liabilities in 2001 amounted to around 600,000 shillings (approximately 44,000 euros).
"At that time we were faced with the situation: Do we keep the club running or do we lock it down?", one of the defendants, a large-scale auditor of the tax office in the bread profession, told The Guardian.
With his colleague and fellow accused, he then decided to take on this task.
With all the risks.
"We've advanced money, put our life insurance at the bank as security," he said at the interrogation.
It has been agreed with the association: you can manage the money freely, only no debts may be made.
In addition, the payment of expense compensation had been decided retroactively until 1991, if the financial success had been appropriate.
Therefore, some of the expense compensation was paid only years later, namely from 2003, when there was an increase in the account.
Therefore, flat-rate debits and not detailed debits appeared, the former supervisor explained the processes.
The accounts and savings books managed the two defendants together, the second defendant said.
Why the payments were not disclosed to the association in detail, the judge asked.
The association was not interested in the details of the financial situation, only debt-freeness was important, according to the answer.
When in 2011 investigations were started against the one official for abuse of office, an amount of 120,000 euros was transferred to the club account.
These were reserves, the defendants explained.
This securities account ran in the name of the second defendant and, according to his statement, was not known to the association.
“Why?” the judge asked.
The respondent did not know the answer for a long time.
Then he finally said that he believed that this was the best thing for the club.
If something had happened to him, no one would have known anything about that money, the prosecutor put in the room.
The co-defendant had been informed, the official justified himself.
This transfer has been formulated as "indemnification for damages".
Why compensation?, the judge and prosecutor wanted to know.
The first defendant then stated that he did not agree with this wording because the club had never suffered any damage.
But what am I supposed to do when the lawyer says, "You're all out of business with that."
"Am I a legal representative?" he asked.
Furthermore, the official said that he had never received a cent salary, he had only charged mileage and diets.
He had charged the association 1,000 euros per month on diets, but the actual expense was much higher, he added.
The defendants were unable to provide accurate documentation for the early years.
These were no longer kept after an audit in which everything was assessed as correct, they explained.
The second defendant also received mileage.
All corrections were made in cash, for which he had to drive from his place of residence Völkermarkt to the bank in Bleiburg, he explained in his statement.
The main hearing will continue on September 23 with the interrogation of witnesses.
Hewlett-Packard to cut 30,000 more jobs
In addition to the staff reduction that has been ongoing for three years, the computer giant will cut further jobs in the process of splitting the company.
The job cuts at the US computer giant Hewlett-Packard (HP) will not end.
As part of its restructuring, the US technology group plans to cut from 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer division.
This will save a cost of $2.7 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.4 billion), the company said on Tuesday.
The move will result in a special charge of around $2.7 billion, which will be incurred from the fourth quarter.
The reduction of 55,000 jobs for three years has not yet been completed.
At the end of the 2013/14 financial year, HP still employed around 302,000 people.
After-market, Hewlett-Packard shares declined 2.3 percent.
The company, which has grown up with printers in Palo Alto, California, is currently splitting up: This year, the computer and printer business will be bundled into a new company - separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services.
Both parts of the business will be listed on the stock exchange.
A further disappointing PC sales and a weaker demand from corporate customers for its services recently hit the world’s second-largest PC manufacturer after Lenovo.
In the third quarter at the end of July, sales of PCs and printers declined by 11.5%.
Sales fell 8 percent to just under $25.4 billion.
This led to revenues falling in 15 out of 16 quarters.
HP is responding to industry change with a split and massive job cuts.
The 76-year-old company led by Meg Whitman has only lately responded to customers increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and doing more and more business online.
Whitman’s restructuring plans include a total reduction of around 55,000 jobs.
Conflicts: Majority supports anti-IS training mission
A direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would, however, be largely rejected: 54 percent opposed, 35 percent agreed.
The fact that other states are flying air strikes against ISIS in Iraq and Syria is 61 percent positive.
Twenty-four percent are against intervening in the conflict.
Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad said 51 percent of respondents refused to cooperate, and 20 percent would.
29% were unable to make a decision.
Car: Second press day at the 66th IAA
The exhibition will focus on connected, self-driving cars and electric mobility until September 27.
After two press days, Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66th International Automobile Exhibition under the motto “Mobility connects” on Thursday.
The general public can attend the IAA from Saturday.
As two years ago, the organizers of the Auto-Verband VDA expect about 900,000 visitors.
Röszke: Violence on Serbian-Hungarian border
The Hungarian police have used tear gas and water cannons at the Serbian border at Röszke against several hundred angry refugees.
Euronews correspondent Dániel Bozsik has witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border checkpoint.
He reported by phone:
A group of refugees broke the border.
A police line had formed behind it and a water cannon was ready behind the policemen.
40 to 50 refugees began throwing stones, sticks and plastic bottles at the officials.
The officers initially used pepper spray uninterruptedly.
After that, the police used tear gas.
A lot of tear gas was sprayed towards the refugees.
This dissolved the group.
The refugees have now withdrawn a bit.
A pregnant and apparently injured woman was taken out of the zone.
Children who had inhaled the tear gas were screaming.
Other refugees collapsed and suffered from shortness of breath.
The press spokespersons of the Serbian police also suffered injuries from the use of tear gas and pepper spray.
Time of decision on interest rates for the US Federal Reserve
The world is watching as the Fed meets on two days, Wednesday and Thursday, to make the important decision whether or not interest rates are raised for the first time in almost a decade.
A survey of 80 economists surveyed by Reuters found that a little more than half who thought last week that the Fed would do so now thinks that the Fed will last a little longer and will keep interest rates at the current level of 0-0.25%.
It’s a historic event because it’s been seven years since the Fed set interest rates at zero.
“For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero range and start a process of normalization of interest rates,” said Angel Ubide, a senior associate at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy is on a relatively good performance level, trillions of dollars are added to the balance sheet, generating only low inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy outlook on global conditions.
It has warned markets to adjust to an increase, but the signs suggest that the odds against such a move are good.
The decision is to be announced at 8 p.m. CET on Thursday.
Delta State University Killer Leaves Apology Letter
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning — and before he shot and killed his colleague later that day — Shannon Lamb wrote a note saying that he “suffered” the first murder and wanted “he could undo it,” authorities announced Tuesday.
Police in Gautier, Mississippi, said Lamb, a lecturer in Geography and Social Science Education at Delta State University, called the emergency number around 10:00 a.m. on Monday morning.
He said he shot someone and killed someone.
Lamb told the emergency call center employee that the police had to send police officers to his home.
He said, “I shot my wife last night” and he also mentioned that there was a “sweet dog” in the house that “wouldn’t bother anyone” but would probably be excited.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he did not give it.
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots.
When police entered the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45, stating, "I'm so sorry, I wanted, I could reverse it.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me."
After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before finally taking his own life on Monday night when police surrounded him.
University president William LaForge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's imagination."
Despite reports on Monday that Lamb allegedly believed Prentiss also had a relationship with Schmidt, authorities said on Tuesday that there was "no information, no evidence" for a "triangle relationship."
Prentiss was described as a "good person" by Shawn O'Steen, who testified that they had been married for about seven years.
They were divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter who is 19 and she was "devastated."
He said that Prentiss was her daughter's "absolutely best friends."
Prentiss worked online from home, according to Linsday Knowles, who was identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who owned a dog called Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help other people," Knowles said.
Police said Lamb called relatives at some point on Monday to tell them "he's not going to jail."
When police caught him on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb drove his car to the side, fled on foot, ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot.
Lamb received a doctorate from Delta State University in the spring of 2015, according to the university’s website.
Stars who lost their lucky charm
The actor (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), had some stressful years.
In 2001, he fought against leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his longtime partner, Farrah Fawcett, due to cancer.
The actor is also reportedly struggling with drugs, and in 2008 he was convicted of drug possession.
All of this certainly takes its toll.
Eurowings: Lufthansa rebuilds the Group
Lufthansa is planning a major group restructuring.
The Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year with a better organization alone.
150 of the approximately 1,000 executives worldwide will be affected by the restructuring of the Group.
There are new negotiations with the pilot union.
Lufthansa is restructuring its corporate structure and upgrading its low-cost subsidiary Eurowings.
The aim of the reorientation is a contribution of around 500 million euros per year from cost and revenue synergies, the airline announced on Wednesday.
Among other things, Lufthansa will no longer have a board of directors for the passenger business in the future.
The low-cost airline Eurowings should be developed as independently as possible.
In future, Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings in the Executive Board team headed by Chief Executive Officer Carsten Spohr.
With the repositioning, Spohr underlines the importance of Eurowings, with which the Group intends to compete against Ryanair and Easyjet in the future.
So far, the organization of the 120,000-strong company has been complex.
The airlines operated under the umbrella of the Passage Airline Group, which represents three-quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros.
New negotiations with pilots
In the tariff conflict with the pilots association Cockpit (VC), the negotiations are to be resumed after the judicially halted strike on Thursday.
This was reported by the union.
The topic of the talks will be the retirement scheme for pilots.
Cockpit wants to achieve “sustainable results as quickly as possible in one year with a forecasted record result.”
The conflict between the union and the airline has led to several strikes in recent months.
In addition to the transitional supply of the pilots, the background is the savings concept "Wings".
It provides for Lufthansa to outsource routes to the Group’s own low-cost line Eurowings in the fight against competitors.
Under the title "Morning Train to the South" paintings by Leena Krüger can be seen in the Künstlerhaus.
The long-standing Finn, based in Göttingen, has compiled a selection of titleless works for the White Hall of the House, which encourage their viewers to travel mentally.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw can't play for months due to double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg in the Champions League defeat of Manchester against PSV Eindhoven.
While this will make the left-back cry and exclude him from playing for at least six months, Louis van Gaal does not give up hope that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The injury was caused by a reckless attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV area.
He was treated on the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double leg fracture and is in the hospital."
He will be transferred tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated in Manchester.
It's awful - a boy who comes to Manchester United at 18, has it very hard and then plays fantastic, and then that happens.
He was wearing an oxygen mask in the locker room.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it will take six months, and he won't play in the group stage.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno seemed lucky to have escaped a red card and the imposition of a penalty.
Nicola Rizzoli, the referee, did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suspected that the Italian referee had been wrong.
You can judge for yourself if I say that a penalty and a red card were due.
It was a very bad attack with both legs.
A tweet on Shaw's account read: "Thank you all for your messages. Words can't describe how broken I am, my path to recovery starts now, I'll be back stronger."
Manchester United loses to Luke Shaw in defeat to PSV
With the European Championship in France, the England defender has an additional incentive to recover by next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said: “It’s a very serious injury.”
When a player with this type of injury leaves the pitch, everyone is very sad about it.
It is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent.
Moreno suffered a leg fracture when Mexico played against Van Gaal’s Holland team at the 2014 World Cup.
"He's doing very hard because it wasn't his intention to hurt the opponent, and then when you hear that it's a very bad injury, that's not good," Cocu said.
It was not possible for me to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball moving in a different direction, so it looked like he [Moreno] had touched him, but I couldn’t see the attack on Luke.
Speaking to SBS6, Moreno said: "I know what it feels like, I know how hard it can be.
I feel very bad about it, I'm so sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital after a foul by Chris Smalling.
David Cameron knows The Lorax better.
It’s one thing all parents soon learn: if your child loves a book, it won’t be long before you know it almost by heart.
Unless you are David Cameron.
When he was asked by a provider of childcare systems to name his favorite children’s book, the Prime Minister chose The Lorax, Dr. Seuss’s 1971 environmental fable.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a message on the SuperCamps website, and continues: "Funny, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it's a book that I like to read to my kids, because it always seems to give a picture or message we've missed so far."
All is well, except that the following paragraph, in which Cameron allegedly describes the plot of the book, instead reproduces a summary of the 2012 film version, which added new characters and details to expand the fairly short original text.
"In the middle of the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams, by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree," reads Dr. Seuss, whose real name was completely unknown, but Theodor Seuss's hostage died in 1991.
As if that wasn't suspicious enough: The text presented by Cameron reads partly like the summary of the Lorax film presented on the Internet Movie Database website and begins: "In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams."
Although he admits to being a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so unfamiliar with the plot of the book. Here, an unnamed boy hears the local environment through the money-hungry, tree-cutting, Thneed knitting once-ler despite the protests of the homonymous Lorax, a squatting, mustache-shaped creature that "speaks in the name of the trees", ravages.
Most likely, such a relatively low PR task was delegated to a helper who did not read The Lorax to a child 20 times in a row.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text probably came from Cameron’s constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron’s staff, but gave no further immediate comments.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by exclusion from England's team, but it's still difficult
Joining Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but when you see the squad England selected for the tour, a repeat of the 3-0 test series defeat is not on my map.
I wouldn't rule out an away win.
Alastair Cook’s side may be less experienced than the three years ago, but there are good spin players in the batting lineup, and the community spirit is strong; they won’t wear any scars from 2012, just a youth-positive attitude.
With the ball, Moeen Ali develops as a spin-bowler and Adil Rashid, even if it represents an unknown size at test level, is an option for the attack.
Adam Lyth retires from the England Test squad and is replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to omit Adam Lyth is, of course, hard to analyze for me as his head coach in Yorkshire.
In his seven tests, there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but harsh reality is that cricketers are geared towards results.
There were no question marks at Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination, as – and I said this earlier – players are their own best pickers.
Long ago, Lyth's course would have been extended, but he had control of his own destiny.
Hopefully if he knocks out more runs for Yorkshire, another chance comes.
England coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even though he did not perform so well, and that does not surprise me; he is above all a team man.
The question of how much time a test striker gets to put his mark is difficult.
Lyth got seven chances — like Sam Robson before him — while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play home and away.
The only accusation to be raised was that England first used Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean – when Lyth was at its best – but that lost opportunity is now in the past.
Alex Hales is coming in, and he's a batter I highly rate.
He is an X-Factor cricketer, which we saw at Yorkshire early this season when he scored 236 against us on a Trent Bridge pitch, which hit us very much.
He must get at least the same chances as those before him, but of course this depends on the team line-up in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of having Moeen beat alongside Cook, which would provide an extra spin bowler and get four quicks, emerged, and I don’t mind.
I don’t see why a batsman can’t beat there, and this left-hander has already shown that he’s a devil’s dude of cricket players.
Moeen may not have done his job for his County Worcestershire, but he's a number 3 for them, and there's no big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests on the first drop, before appearing as an opener in 2001.
He made three hundred runs immediately and did not look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the squad as a back-up spinner, and in my limited dealings with him he impressed me very much as a young man.
People may look at his stats – an average of 31 with the club and 35 with the ball – and think it’s a punt, but there’s not a large number of backup spinners raising their hands and the coaches have opted for youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
Aside from the team, England has made a few clever additions to the coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the batsman from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup.
He is one of the nicest guys of the game who will bring a wealth of experience as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful commitment to the setup.
I’ve always felt that he was created for the international cricket competition, as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela, he has insights that we can benefit from.
Sometimes new voices in the locker room can bring fresh air, even if the news is in line with what was said before.
Colly’s colleague at Durham, Ben Stokes, is not used at the One-Dayers, Root got a similar break against Australia and I, for my part, have no problem with that.
Some will disagree, but coaches and team pitchers don’t set the schedule.
And you have to remember that, as with the players, their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions are not made with an easy heart.
The Brexit camp (Brexit <0x3D> Britain’s exit from the EU) could gain influx if the economy gets stuck by 2017
David Cameron’s unspoiled renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU will get deeper into trouble every day, even without the choice of the brilliant Jeremy “Is it Yes or No?” Corbyn to be the leader of Labour or the TUC, which is fiercely battling over Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat friend recently said that some member states, as deeply entangled in various crises as the EU is and not always on their own account, are tired of Britain’s self-created agenda with split concessions and disruptive treaty changes that they usually don’t want.
In Brighton, the TUC decided at its annual meeting that it also does not like them if they endanger social protection.
We could also call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
Prime Ministers and finance ministers climb to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, then come home and say they are gaining allies for reforms.
It's always about me.
My European friend, who wants an outward-looking Britain inside the EU tent - "Don't let us alone with France," says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals have come to the point where they don't care if we stay or go.
Germany’s cautiously thoughtful Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it looks bad for her, as has happened with the exaggerated long-standing ones such as Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France’s François Hollande is looking forward to his re-election or replacement in 2017.
He is also a fading force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain a left-wing government.
It’s hard to imagine that they’re going to tear out a leg to help the selfie Britons, whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland’s exit from the UK – something they don’t want either because most have similar separatist tendencies.
Therefore, some such ministers may even intentionally plan unhelpful remarks, entirely in the SNP style, during Britain’s 2017 referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suspects.
"The re-negotiation was a failure" and "The UK has gained nothing of value from the re-negotiation."
The Europeans know how predatory Fleet Street can be at their expense and what EU skeptics the oligarchy of the press barons is, but not during the 1975 Tony Benn-inspired referendum that supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2:1.
You can weakly remember Boris Johnson, the ore-euro opportunist who made a name for himself as an “EU straight banana” Brussels correspondent in the early 90s.
In all his madness, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
These included the medley of tax-fearing villains, phone-hacking foreigners, and the pseudo non-natives who own most of our big newspapers.
Actually, Tony Blair thought similarly about them, but noted that when you sit in a cage with a hot gorilla, you better distribute bananas to distract him, rather than become his lunch and dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairian than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron’s referendum swirls, because Blair had put the principle above the EU’s unapproved constitution, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, thus opening a backdoor for him.
The press never forgave him.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly slap on the back in Westminster on Monday — I told him he didn’t need to waste time for me anymore — seems in danger of repeating Neil Kinnock’s 80s boycott Murdoch strategy, a mistake then and now.
It may take time, but he needs to develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is - I kindly express it - in development.
He says we should stay in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside of Ukip’s traditional blue dye tendency and the wilder realms of Tory’s small-Englishism can probably all say yes to it.
It's what Hilary "A Benn, but not a Bennite" Benn said on radio and television this week when the scout inside him was struggling not to admit that Corbyn's appointment of provocative John McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70s when his old father tried to be disloyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues on TV without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hilary's fight was even more attractive.
But struggling to stay “under all circumstances” — Benn’s expression — wasn’t what McDonnell said, nor what JC told his fellow fighters and MPs after all reports at their exit meeting on Monday evening.
Whatever Corbyn’s stirring bottom-up image wants to convey—remember that he even stirred me—news-discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and, above all, in the whirlpool of social media, a breeding ground of paranoia and betrayal.
It’s right not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe that allows him to take Labour’s support in the referendum campaign for granted, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn’s fundamental ambiguity about EU membership – in line with their Bennite siege economy, their anti-capitalist past – is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among leftist dissidents, for whom the narcissism of small difference is a central principle of dogmatic disputes.
As with his ambiguities about NATO — Tom Watson is firmly convinced that JC will not launch a campaign to leave — foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to find a sense for their superiors at home in everything.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspicious voters - to make concessions to the British, if all this can be meaningless?
The US is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost cut in power by the Tory government, which I was reminded of when I launched something called the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Experts criticize Public Health England report on e-cigarettes
Claims by a state-funded agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people, some with ties to the tobacco industry, researchers said.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet by criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the “principle report” last month, describing it as a “comprehensive review of the evidence.”
However, some researchers have questioned the resilience of the data and pointed out the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the "extraordinarily windy foundation" on which PHE grounded its most important conclusion.
Two more researchers write in BMJ and have asked whether the claims "build on stone or sand."
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: “A fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on demonstration of effectiveness.”
They said the public expects PHE’s claim that “the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking” to be based on a detailed review of evidence and modeling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were convened to develop a model for Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) to synthesize their opinions on the harms of various nicotine-containing products; the findings of the meeting were summarized in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose managing director is said to have previously received funds from British American Tobacco (BAT) for an independent study.
He also signed BAT’s public health references into a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting stated that they were receiving funds from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding he was said to have received from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, they added.
The reasons for selecting members of the board are not provided, but this includes several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of whom also state industry funding in the paper.
Some other participants in this session are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The tobacco board of PHE also took part in the meeting.
The group’s research “confess significant” that there is a lack of “hard evidence for the damage of most products at most criteria,” wrote McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these compounds or restrictions are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that PHE's claims that "there is no evidence so far that e-cigarettes serve as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers" were premature.
Prof Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, said BMJ’s claims have been responded to before.
He said, "e-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
One in two lifelong smokers dies of addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are low in comparison, but that we continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what evidence proves and what does not, especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die each year from a smoking related illness, and smoking costs the National Health System <0xC2><0xA3>2 billion a year.
By clearly providing up-to-date evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk, but represent only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking, we are fulfilling our national jurisdiction.
BBC should give up EastEnders, former head of Channel 4 says
Former Channel 4 chairman Luke Johnson said the BBC should stop broadcasting programs like EastEnders and The Voice, saying commercial rivals would "give their right arm" for hit shows like the Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not broadcast by other UK stations.
He criticized the BBC for placing public programs, which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience, in heavily controversial windows of time against their rivals' most popular shows and by channels such as BBC4.
After BBC Director-General Tony Hall said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said he had been trying to get in touch with the BBC for six years in his time on Channel 4 without success.
"I have problems with the idea that the BBC is commissioning or broadcasting programs that would also be clearly shown by unsubsidized rivals," Johnson told the House Communications Committee as part of his investigation into the BBC's future.
If you want to keep the broadcasting fee, which I don't think is a good idea in the medium or long term, you should at least put its production on programs that others don't make or commission.
They send The Voice in a first-class window of time because they want to achieve the widest possible support for their future.
The idea that no one else would show this is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's nonsense, of course.
Johnson said: “I don’t see why a regressive tax funds programs that could be funded even without subsidies.
The Voice is one such program, EastEnders is another, admittedly both in-house productions.
Honestly, other channels would give their right arm for it.
I am trying to see how this is supposed to be public television.
I don't think that would reduce the BBC at all.
Johnson, an entrepreneur for series who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said the BBC was to blame for hunting for reviews "because of the ambitions of the people who work there, and because they believe this is the best way to secure long-term support."
His comments on the BBC’s most popular shows reflect what former Sky head Tony Ball suggested in his 2003 MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh that the BBC should sell shows like EastEnders.
Johnson said that the more public-law niche programs "should go to BBC4 where you can't quite measure the audience, but they do their duties, and they can argue when they go on their hypocritical missions to justify <0xC2><0xA3>4 billion broadcasting fees, "Well, of course, we've created all those obscure programs that no one has seen."
They put her in a window of time where no one ever wanted to see her.
On broadcasting fees, Johnson told the committee, "I urge you to find a more regressive system in terms of who can get the best value out of this.
Of course you all think, we all think you get a big value here for <0xC2><0xA3>150 a year, but for people who are a lot of money for the <0xC2><0xA3>150, ask me if that's true because they don't consume much from the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 chief David Elstein, who also testified before the committee on Tuesday, demanded that the BBC review its Reithian mission to "inform, educate and entertain."
He said little of BBC production would now be officially classified as education — he said it was 1% of their TV production and 0.1% on the radio — and she should take an example from public television stations in Australia and Canada to change this to “inform, educate and entertain.”
On the issue of partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas like those of the proms, which he said only a handful will be shown on TV, and enter into alliances with the commercial channels to make everything available online.
'Sonogenetics' Can Control Brain Cells Through Sound Waves
The video shows how the nematodes change direction the moment they are irradiated with sound impulses.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by outbreaks of sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change direction the moment they are irradiated with sound impulses that have too high frequencies for human hearing to be heard.
The impulses work by switching on motor neuron cells that are genetically modified to support the membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves.
Researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method, called Sonogenetics, in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain, heart, and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the procedure could one day replace deep-brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that releases electrical impulses into people’s brains to treat the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease.
Threadworms usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani noted that they did so when surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, he found, amplify the ultrasonic waves, which then penetrate the worms.
The amplified ultrasonic waves act on structures called TRP-4 ion channels that are found in the membranes of some of the worm cells.
The sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned, according to a report by Nature Communications.
To create ultrasound-controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically altered the worms so that some of their motor neurons carry TRP-4 ion channels.
When he applies ultrasound to the modified creatures, the sound waves are amplified by the microbubbles and transmitted to the worms, where they switch on the modified motor neurons.
The method has some similarities with Optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to turn neurons on and off with impulses of light.
But Chalasani said that Sonogenetics could have some advantages over this technique.
Unlike light that must be sent down to the desired location in the brain at an optical fiber, low-frequency ultrasonic waves can pass through tissue unhindered and thus can be sent into the brain from above on the skull.
"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus, it is possible to make the targeted human neurons temporarily susceptible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture devices - right on your doorstep!
The ads shame Britain's arms trade
Watch Amnesty International anti-weapons trade fair video.
Terrible killer drones!
Ankle-crushing leg fetters!
Cluster bombs!
And electric shock rods that cause agonizing pain, but leave no trace!
The cheerful voice and cartoon images leave no doubt that this ad for the world’s largest weapons show is a combative parody produced by Amnesty International to highlight the British government’s willingness to smash weapons to repressive regimes via the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London’s Docklands.
DSEI Weapons Fair: Authoritarian Regimes Flow to London
But a separate campaign also leads to many posters that can be seen at bus stops and in the subway trains that require a second look.
"Important Announcement: Do you ride the DLR from September 15th to 18th?" (Docklands Light Railway) read in the fonts of the London Underground and the trademark of the DLR line, which turns into the image of a tank.
In September, a swarm of arms dealers will be driving the DLR ... Customers will be asked to help stop the arms fair.
The 300 posters are from artists who exhibited their work at the Museum of Cruel Designs in Banksy’s Dismaland.
A collective called Special Patrol Group helped with the distribution in London and used "Ad Space Hack Packs," a <0xC2><0xA3>6 pack of Allen keys claimed to "get access to around a third of the bus stop advertising spaces on the planet."
Transport for London doesn't find this poster "vandalism" funny.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Crueol Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are becoming more critical and trying to bring political work to audiences outside galleries.
Many artists get to work with activists within protest movements and notice that they have to go outside into the real world in order for their art to have an impact on society.
Another of the anti-weapons trade posters greets commuters on the subway.
The Amnesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and was created by the advertising agency VCCP, which works for no-profit with the graphic artist and voiceover artist who also works for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was astonished by the silence surrounding the weapons show advertising – through an empty space on the ExCeL calendar – and thought, “Let’s give them the campaign they’re trying to avoid.”
They played with the invention of a more realistic shady company advertising, but "by bloating in bright colors and animation, it stays stronger."
“They did a fantastic job helping us raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair,” said Amnesty’s Tom Davies.
What we need now is an intervention by the British government and a guarantee that torture devices will not be illegally traded on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art around the weapons fair comes from the area within ExCeL, where exhibitors shred fantastically euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab revealed an order from the U.S. Army over "the AT4CS RS shot off the shoulder."
This includes a "uniquely shaped skull that delivers outstanding after-effect effects inside the target."
Whatever it is, it will not be pleasant.
Eight Golden Rules for Living in Student Homes
Eleven years ago, as a self-forgotten 19-year-old, I moved into a student residence, still believing in Beret and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the tense smiles of those I had annoyed - and the numerous, long-term complaints about others.
Most of what I’ve learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
Moving into student residences ranges from slightly nerve-wracking to absolutely frightening.
It's tempting to chat: people tell you where you come from, if and where you took Sabbath year, where you stand in relation to Corbyn, and why you "honestly neither love nor hate Marmite, because seriously, guys, it's just a yeast extract HAHAHA, I'm in my room."
Breathe through.
And help others do the same – ask questions and show interest.
It directs the conversation and helps you figure out the people you like as opposed to those you wouldn’t talk to, even if your eyelashes were on fire and these fire extinguishers were.
Let people.
People’s rooms often turn into beverage receptions, movie night venues, and community meeting places, but they are also the places where people dress up and straighten out their underwear.
Concerning this: Don’t think about starting a relationship at university
Introverts receive rough treatment at the university.
Your room should be a refuge, but many student residences form a room-to-room strolling culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship.
This can be hell for someone trying to recover.
Nothing in culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want our friendship to continue, but you have to go away so that I can get back the energy I used to interact with you."
Try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted from socializing - and send him an SMS instead of knocking.
Speaking of knocking, do it.
A guy in my dormitories had the idea that an unlocked door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Close friendship by baking.
Since you're starting college at the height of back-many, knocking on people's doors to imagine yourself with a plate full of brownies is less strange than the greeting of the 1950s "Welcome to the neighborhood, I baked you something. So, and now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions."
Offering homemade treats is a great way to make friends.
Your roommates feel obliged to entertain and may end up associating your face with a tasty surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent baker.
Poorly mixed lumps of flour, sugar and fat cause people to fall asleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student residences.
Of course, stealing chicken is a theft, but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too?
Check with the dairy owner.
Chances are, they say to serve themselves, even if they are cooking inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it more balanced than my roommate, who added a detergent to her milk to punish thieves.
She's in jail now.
You shouldn’t make a noise that stops people from sleeping or from work.
It’s not just about being a decent person, but that you are literally one of the people sitting in the glasshouse.
A girl in my hallway asked her neighbors if they would mind putting drum & bass a little quieter, because it was three o’clock in the morning, and she had an exam in the morning.
They responded with even louder music.
When they finally stopped at 5 a.m., she kindly let her neighbors sleep for another two hours before plastering her own music, locking her door, and heading for her three-hour exam.
Wouldn’t it be romantic if your future spouse accidentally moved into the same student residence?
Conversely, wouldn’t it be embarrassing to think of a roommate as your future spouse, to get close to her, to separate again, and then to see her every day, and perhaps see her pull all of her friends together?
Of course, the heart goes its own way - but if a hot roommate is definitely not your future spouse, at least try to convince your abdomen a little bit of reason.
In the exciting moment when you notice that someone has left their keys in their unlocked room, the boundary between an ulk and bullying is finer than it seems.
A good prank is funny, but it only takes moments before it becomes a boomerang.
By hiding, give a valuable and amusing lesson about safety - but never mess up someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Close your door, and put your keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but tackle your possessions on the ceiling no more than twice.
Semi-detached houses for refugees, single parents, low earners
The real estate contractor Markus Gildner builds terraced houses in the Eckental in central Franconia for people who do not have much money.
For example, for refugees - but also as a signal: "Not only refugees need housing, but also the single mother and the low-earning."
“I’m showing how you can still build cheaply and well today,” says the 44-year-old in an interview.
Thousands of refugees will be pushing into the housing market.
Entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes he knows how quickly affordable housing can be created: he is building terraced houses for refugees in a project.
Mr Gildner, many refugees will be pushing into the housing market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: The mass accommodation in containers or gyms has no sustainability.
People stay here for a large part.
Given the flow of refugees, we will also need enough housing in the coming decades.
A completely banal, three-storey terraced house is the solution.
Gildner: A terraced house takes up the least space.
It facilitates integration.
This is different when people are housed in blocks of flats.
Each of the six houses currently being built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers each.
Each unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a common room.
It may be that many refugees will say, it is peace again, I am going back.
Then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to the respective needs.
What are the costs?
Gildner: The price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184,000 euros, without land.
That's manageable.
The construction took six months.
That is appropriate.
Did the building regulations complicate their plans?
Gildner: In terms of construction law, I have completed my project correctly.
Particularly complicated is always the threatening Damocles sword special construction and the parking lot ordinance.
It's scary.
It is still assumed, who creates three apartments in a terraced house, needs at least three pitches.
Only in the cities there is no place for this.
Refugees and asylum seekers do not have cars.
How did the residents react to their terraced house project?
Gildner: There were some who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
Which is definitely not true.
But are you not exacerbating the competition for affordable housing?
Gildner: It is true that we have had a building boom in Germany in the last five years, but luxury apartments were built, which hardly anyone can afford anymore.
My project has the message, even the normal people need housing.
Not only refugees, but also the single mother or the low-income person.
I’ll show you how you can still build cheaply and well today.
That's what it's all about.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystems engineering in Regensburg and initially dealt with environmental analyses.
iOS 9: How to Get the New iPhone Operating System When Apple Update Is Released
The new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings app, tapping "General" and then selecting "Software Update".
When it is ready, the phone gives you the option to download and then install.
Some have encountered problems after installation because they receive an error message that tells them that "Software Update Failed".
To bypass the problem, users are advised to either wait until the rush goes back or try to update via iTunes.
The phone itself will guide you through the rest of the process.
That might mean deleting apps to make room - but Apple has made that less likely by slimming the update, as well as it will be easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and then reinstall them once the process is complete.
It is worth making sure that your mobile phone is charged while updating or is near a charger so that the battery is charged.
If the charge is too low, Apple will not allow the update to continue, as the phone may shut down halfway and this could result in the update being cancelled.

Rosberg's only motto: full attack
Nico Rosberg knows only one motto in the fight for the World Championship title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton: "full attack".
The World Cup second emphasized before the start in the decisive seven overseas races, "that I have nothing more to lose."
53 points separate the vice world champion before the night race in Singapore this Sunday from defending champion and double champion Hamilton.
The British has already won seven of the previous twelve races of the season and is also taking the floodlights Grand Prix in the city-state as a favorite.
In 2009 and last year, the 30-year-old Briton was able to win the race.
Whether the current smog in the city-state will affect the Singapore Grand Prix is still unclear.
For days, a fog bell has been hanging over the city, triggered by fires on the neighboring island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger Chess Club has a prominent member
The chess club "Schachfreunde Bad Kissingen", founded three months ago, has added another member to its ranks, thus increasing the number of members to 19 players.
The new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player who has been to Bad Kissingen for treatment more than 40 times.
Gauselmann is a recipient of the Federal Cross of Merit 1st class and an honorary citizen of the cities of Espelkamp and Lübbecke.
Gauselmann supported the chess club in Bad Kissingen with a donation, which chairman Alfred Klein accepted.
This makes it possible to record chess players who are unable to earn the membership fee.
Youth work and talent search should also be promoted.
Gauselmann wishes that the membership in the chess club and also friendly contact with the tennis club "Rot-Weiß" be seen as an expression of his connection with the spa city.
Quarter office looking for direct contact
Salutis and the Antonistift Altenzentrum have teamed up under the umbrella of the Social Foundation and opened a new contact point at Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
In addition to consultations, you can also take part in courses there.
The social foundation pulls it down from the mountain to the city center.
More specifically, the Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
A new quarter office has recently been opened there.
Here, right next to the shopping market, seniors and seekers of advice will now receive information on questions such as nursing insurance or health and nursing insurance benefits.
For years, we have noticed with our outpatient care service that caregivers are often left alone.
There are endless questions.
"It is also not uncommon for many cash register services to be used, because the complexity of the insurances is hardly understood," explained the new owner Jutta Weigand, who is also responsible for the Antonistift and the Bürgerspital as well as for the outpatient service "Amadeus" as head of the Altenhilfe business unit.
In addition to the consultations, the new district office also offers prevention, health courses and wellness.
For this purpose, the Saludis was taken into the boat.
Therefore, you can use additional services such as fall prevention, memory training or a physiotherapeutic treatment.
The offers of the Seniorenzentrum and the Saludis complement each other in an ideal way.
Saludis stands for prevention, prevention and rehabilitation.
"The senior centre for care and care," described Heike Riedel, Managing Director of Saludis.
The reason for the opening of the new quarter office in the city centre is especially demographic change.
This makes good decentralized infrastructure in the individual districts of Bamberg essential in the future.
In addition, Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) underlined at the inauguration celebrations, the district office also devotes itself to loneliness in old age: "There are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite to a regular social gathering".
In this way, the social foundation makes a major contribution to ensuring that seniors can live as independently and well as possible in their familiar environment.
The district office is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 am to 2 pm, Tuesday and Thursday from 4 pm to 6 pm and Saturdays from 10 am to 12 pm.
Eintracht Bamberg vs. Würzburg Kickers on October 6
Now it is official: After the date for the game FC Eintracht Bamberg against the third league Würzburger Kickers had not yet been set due to renovation work at the Fuchsparkstadion, the date was now set for October 6.
The match of FC Eintracht Bamberg in the 16th final of the Bavarian Football Totopokal against the third league FC Würzburger Kickers has now been finalized.
The match will be played on Tuesday, 6 October, at 19:00 in the Bamberg Fuchsparkstadion.
"We are glad that we now know when the game will go on stage, now we have planning certainty," said FCE team manager Karlheinz Hümmer, who also points out the ticket pre-sale now started.
It’s something special for our team to play against a third league.
We therefore hope for numerous spectators, and this is not without reason, because floodlight games have a special appeal.
In the round of the last 16 teams, the FC Eintracht Bamberg moved in 2010 by winning the Bezirksligisten 1. FC Oberhaid (3:1) and at home against the regional league 1. FC Schweinfurt 05 (3:2).
The winner of the competition will receive 5000 euros and qualify for the first round of the DFB Association Cup 2016/2017.
Title defender is third league defeater SpVgg Unterhaching.
The Viennese architect Karl Mang died at the age of 92
Karl Mang, one of the Doyens of Viennese architecture, is dead.
He died on September 5 at the age of 92, as the Künstlerhaus announced on Tuesday.
With Mang, the Künstlerhaus lost an honorary member and at the same time "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna", as it was said in the broadcast.
Born in Vienna in 1922, Mang studied architecture at the Technische Hochschule in Vienna with Friedrich Lehmann during and after the Second World War.
Since 1952 he worked as a freelance architect, but also as a teacher, writer and director of the institute.
From 1972 to 1983 he was President of the Austrian Institute for Shaping.
In the 1980s, he was commissioned with the establishment of the Treasury in Vienna's Hofburg and the conversion of the Lobkowitz Palace into the Austrian Theatre Museum.
Tim Wiese accuses police officer with money
Ex-footballer Tim Wiese was not well noticed in Bremen.
Footballer was once, now Tim Wiese, ex-goalkeeper in Germany and at Bremen and Hoffenheim engaged, wrestler.
According to his own statement, he wants to have gained 30 kilograms of muscle mass in the past two years.
Intellectually, however, he did not gain.
Wiese had his hair cut in Bremen’s city centre when he saw a parking guard outside issuing a ticket for his white Chevrolet Camaro.
Wiese then stormed out of the business, insulted the official and threw the due fine at her feet, as the "Bild" newspaper reports.
The allegations are confirmed by the city of Bremen, but it is not yet clear about the consequences for the unusual incident.
"The matter is still under investigation," says the city of Bremen.
Only then is it decided whether to show meadow or not.

Men beat up 17-year-old Afghans
Witnesses are looking for police for an incident in Bad Soden-Salmünster: On Friday evening, around 23.45, three young men were walking from Bad Soden towards Salmünster.
One of the group, a 17-year-old Afghan, followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters, according to the police, and called on them to wait for him.
At that time, the group was at the level of the bft gas station.
There were also three people at the gas station.
One of these men then shouted at the young man and hit him with his fist in the face.
The victim suffered a nasal fracture and bleeded heavily from the nose.
When his two friends rushed in and appeased the racket, the racket first let go of his victim.
From his friends, the injured young man was now brought home.
The perpetrator followed the group with a car to their apartment and drove there demonstratively several times.
When the vehicle was no longer seen, the injured man walked outside the building to smoke a cigarette.
There he was attacked again by the club and another male person.
With the help of a baton, one beat the victim’s face and thighs.
The injured man had to be taken to a hospital for medical care.
So far, there is only a vague description of the perpetrator.
One of the men was about 1.80 meters tall.
The second club is said to have been about 1.65 meters tall and was dressed in a jeans and a brown-white shirt.
The police ask witnesses and whistleblowers to report on the phone number 06181/100-123.
Dr. Frank Müller acquires Praxis Felstehausen and invests EUR 310000
Silvia Müller-Gongoll and Frank Müller (from the left) take over the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felstehausen.
Samtgemeinde Mayor Bernd Bormann, economic promoter Uta Seim-Schwartz and Asendorf Mayor Heinfried Kabbert are also delighted with this.
In many places in the countryside doctors are missing - Asendorf, on the other hand, is lucky: Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice in Felstehausen on October 1.
While Ursel Felstehausen retires, her husband, Karl-Heinrich, will be halfway to his successor in the next few months.
After a renovation phase, Müller will reopen the practice on 12 October, until then investing 310000 euros in the premises at St.-Marcellusstraße 6.
It was sympathy at first sight when the Felstehausens met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongoll years ago, who is currently completing her specialist training at the Verden hospital and wants to go into practice next year.
"We always had in mind that the Müllers would fit well into this practice," says Dr. Ursel Felstehausen and laughs.
"When it was time, I just called her."
The Müller couple liked the idea of running their own practice in Asendorf in the future.
"The proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us," says the 39-year-old Müller.
"We want to meet and accompany the families over the years".
He also sees an advantage of being his own boss soon.
And so it was agreed that the Müllers bought the house with the practice.
However, they will continue to live in Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
Frank Müller, a two-time family father, also grew up there, followed his medical studies in Hanover by several medical practices as well as in the hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
He is currently working as a senior physician in Sulingen, and in 2009 he was appointed senior emergency physician in the Diepholz district and volunteers in the DRK-Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
From September 19, the practice will be prepared for the new boss.
While surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felstehausen works as a general practitioner, his wife Ursel (internist) specializes in gastroenterology.
The Müllers, both internists, want to settle down as general practitioners.
"The endoscopy comes out," says 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Gongoll.
After the renovation, the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long-term and stress ECGs and need a consultation room more.
In addition, the EDP will be completely renewed.
The millers receive a grant of a total of 50,000 euros as part of a funding programme from the district (25,000 euros) as well as from the Samtgemeinde (12,500 euros) and the municipality (12,500 euros).
"This shows how proud and happy we are that the practice will continue," emphasizes Mayor Bernd Bormann.
According to Silvia Müller-Gongoll, about 2,000 patients come to the Felstehausen practice every quarter, in the northern German average practice it is about 500.
In Asendorf there is another family doctor's office.
A positive side effect of the takeover of the practice by Frank Müller: According to Ursel Felstehausen, the pharmacy remains in Asendorf.
If she hadn’t found a successor, she would have gone.
By the way, anyone who visits Müller’s office hours continues to look primarily at familiar faces: the seven medical specialists and the cleaning staff of the Felstehausens take over.
With their farewell, an era ends in Asendorf, after all, the physicians have practiced there for 30 years.
"In the beginning we only had two rooms," Ursel Felstehausen recalls smilingly.
She felt a bit of grief after a long time.
"But we still live in Hohenmoor and will certainly see many patients often," says the internist.
Her husband adds laughing: "We have a 6000-square-meter plot of land."
"I've always pushed myself for gardening, now it could be different."
The couple also has two grandchildren and likes to travel.
Croatia: "We will let the refugees pass"
"Now the border controls will also be stepped up at our southern border," said Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner.
Controls at the Hungarian border remain parallel to this.
It is still clear that anyone who wants to make an asylum application can also make this "obviously".
The care and safety of people is at the forefront.
But it is also clear that "it needs clear signals," the minister said.
People need to know that we do not accept borderless migration flows, not even across the Austro-Slovene border.
We need a controlled approach.
Croatia considers 'corridor' - Slovenia denied
The Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would also allow arriving refugees to travel to Austria and Germany and, under certain circumstances, also build corridors for the refugees.
However, this was not the view of Interior Minister Vesna Györkös Znidar in Ljubljana.
The idea of corridors is "absolutely unacceptable", Slovenia will rather intensify the surveillance of the border - especially with Hungary.
The border with Croatia, on the other hand, is already heavily controlled as the external border of the Schengen area.
However, as the Minister stressed, Slovenia does not want to lock its borders to refugees.
"Every member of the EU must fulfill its obligations, otherwise the system cannot work," Györkös Znidar stressed.
As the Croatian government announced, the first refugees had already tried in the night hours of Tuesday to pass the Tovarnik/Sid border crossing in eastern Croatia in order to evade registration.
The Croatian police were able to pick them up in the nearby corn fields.
Since then, according to local media, police vehicles with new refugees are constantly arriving in Tovarnik, Croatia.
They are mainly Syrians and Afghans, including many women and children.
Emergency services and the Red Cross are also in use.
In the coming days, his country expects about 4,000 refugees, said Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.
In addition, buses from Presevo on the Macedonia-Serbia border, which had previously taken migrants to the Hungarian border, will be diverted to Croatia, Croatian and Serbian media reported on Wednesday.
However, the government in Belgrade denied that it was it to instruct people to take certain routes: “We can’t, nor do we want to do this,” it said.
According to the media reports, at least in the morning a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Sid, more buses were expected during the day.
About Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The inmates had been traveling through Serbia all night from the Macedonian border, about 500 kilometers away.
"We heard that Hungary closed, so the police told us to go here," one of the refugees said.
They wanted to travel through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany.
This could actually lead to the postponement of the previous Balkan route Turkey-Greece-Macedonia-Serbia-Hungary to a slightly further westward route, as already predicted by observers.
Croatia: "Extensive possibilities for border control"
Croatia’s Interior Minister Ostojic had previously stressed that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong influx of refugees.
He did not mention details, but pointed out that Croatia, as a non-Schengen member, has “comprehensive possibilities for border control”.
Strict checks are carried out in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area.
Slovenia has been a member of the EU since 2007, and the EU partners have consistently provided the country with a good report on the standard of border controls.
On the Serbian side, about 300 refugees are still trapped behind the Hungarian border fence.
According to media reports from Belgrade, they had spent the night at the Horgos border crossing, which leads to Röszke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings of Horgo and Backi Breg remain completely closed.
Whether the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear.
Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to calm down Wednesday morning at a local inspection in Horgos: he considers the debates on alternative routes for refugees, after the Hungarian border is now closed, premature.
It would not be a very high number of refugees at the moment.
It is not yet possible to say whether they would continue their journey over Hungary, Croatia or another country.
Helpers Advise Migrants - Dangerous - Alternative Routes
However, private Hungarian refugee workers have already started distributing maps to the refugees, which show alternative routes through Croatia.
However, crossing the border between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous: in parts of the border area, there are still minefields that have not been cleared 20 years after the end of the Croatian war.
On Wednesday afternoon, Croatian police announced that a team of mine clearers had been sent to the border region.
Stock market hacker: Ukrainians pay $30 million
Supranonok is said to have belonged to a circle of cybercriminals who have been accused of gaining insight into unpublished financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire, Marketwired and PR Newswire since 2010.
The information obtained is said to have been used to make insider transactions on the financial markets.
In this way, according to the investigators, a total of more than 100 million dollars were stolen.
“Today’s comparison shows that even those outside our borders will ultimately be caught,” the SEC said in a statement.
The trials of 32 other accused in the case continued.
Most of the defendants are from Ukraine and Georgia.
The perpetrators are said to have acted from both the United States and Eastern Europe.
Ecumenical hospice aid Mannheim has been around for 20 years
Around the Mannheim Paradeplatz there is a lot of activity.
People take care of their errands, partly quickly, partly comfortably strolling.
You will arrive at the two stations of the Mannheimer Autosalon at Paradeplatz.
City railways stop.
Pulsating, bouncy life in the beautiful autumn sunshine and in the middle four large panels each with the title "Before I die I want to"....
With this action, the Ecumenical Hospice Aid draws attention to its 20th anniversary and is confronted with mixed reactions.
"It's about life, so we went to the city and among the people with the action," says Josefine Lammer.
The head of the Ecumenical Hospice Aid is available to passers-by for questions and conversations as well as the volunteers.
While some passers-by spontaneously grasping the chalk and supplementing the phrase "yes to my life", "can read", "ride the camper through the US", "stop the war" or "don't suffer for long", others stop for a short time, read, say phrases like "I'm not so far yet" and then move on.
Again and again, small discussions about the action itself, about life, how to deal with dying develop on the margins.
Peter Hübinger is also on the scene.
"Only when I realize that for me at some point the end of this world will come, can I live a responsible life," says the Director of the Diaconal Works Mannheim, which together with the Caritas Association is the sponsor of the Ecumenical Hospice Aid.
Therefore, this public action for the 20-year-old is good.
The fact that not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the boards, however, is understandable, after all, it is a very personal thing.
The topic of death and dying is still filled with taboos, according to the experience of Josefine Lammer, although the hospice movement in recent years has contributed a lot to the opening up of people.
An assessment that Angelika Godefroid shares.
The death and mourning companion is one of the volunteers of the first hour.
Confronted with the topic through personal experience, she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in euthanasia.
When the Ecumenical Hospice Aid called for volunteers, she immediately contacted us and was present when it was founded in 1995.
Godefroid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - who accompany the affected and relatives in private households, hospitals, nursing homes and in the hospice of Saint Vincent.
They are all carefully trained.
Angelika Godefroid is good at managing her task and the experiences and experiences she has gained.
"I see the life of another waiter, consider it precious and appreciate the moment," she says.
The outpatient ecumenical hospice service is free of charge and independent of religion.
The financial support of the health insurance companies and donations from relatives and associations enables the training as well as further training and supervision of the death and mourning companions.
Training courses for new employees are offered every two years.
The tablets described on Saturday are now on display in the House of the Protestant Church (M1, 1a) and in the House of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
There too, other personal wishes can be noted on postcards.
FedEx earnings mixed, financial outlook lowered for 2016
FedEx reported disappointing results for the last quarter, and the delivery giant lowered its earnings outlook to a full year due to weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transportation service.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
At this time last year, FedEx announced that the company intends to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
The stock fell over 2.5 percent in premarket trading 45 minutes before opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said it would make a profit between $10.40 and $10.90 in the fiscal year ending next May, 20 cents less than the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $10.84, according to a survey by FactSet.
The lower outlook comes despite the price increases, which are on average 4.9 percent and will take effect on January 4th, and despite higher surcharges for ground transportation of heavy and large parcels, which will be levied from November.
The company said it nevertheless expects earnings to increase year-on-year due to cost reductions, higher revenue and growth in online trading.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company "is producing solid returns when considering the weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade."
The plans for vacation employment were announced a day later than those of rival UPS, which plans to hire 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, roughly the same number as last year.
In the quarter ending August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 percent more than in the previous year.
Earnings per share amounted to $2.42 per share, just behind the $2.44 per share that twelve analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research predicted.
Sales increased by 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has seen a decline in international priority shipping in recent years, which stagnated sales in its Express Shipping unit.
But the boom in online shopping has boosted results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, sales in ground transport increased by 29 percent, but operating earnings were basically flat due to higher costs for larger parcels and self-insurance.
The Express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices, while earnings declined due to higher labour costs in the freight business.
In premarket trading, about an hour before opening, FedEx shares fell by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
On Tuesday, they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11.
At their most anticipated meeting in the year, Federal Reserve strategists spend two days this week sitting around a 27-foot Honduras mahogany table to decide if it’s time to raise the lead rate for the first time in almost a decade.
Threatening above them at one end of the decorated, two-storey meeting room is a mural of the United States.
The map is a reminder that Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation before all other things.
The central bank has a dual mandate from Congress: maximize U.S. employment and keep prices stable here.
But since the great recession, Fed leaders have recognized that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict, announcing on Thursday whether the U.S. economy is ready to be weaned from the unprecedented incentive by the near-zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
While most of the economy’s data shows solid growth, recent turbulence in global financial markets could scare already cautious Fed representatives to increase this volatility by raising interest rates on federal bonds — even by just a quarter of a percentage point.
"Obviously, the job market and inflation will be the most important thing they are watching," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
“But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to raise the interest rate, the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue to wait,” she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which in itself uncertainties the financial market.
About half of the economists surveyed by Bloomberg recently predicted a rate hike this week.
However, financial markets expect the Fed to wait, with a key indicator indicating only a 30% chance of an increase.
This indicates a decline in the stock market if the Fed raises the rate, unless the strategists mitigate the blow by promising that a further increase is far away.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial average jumped by 228.89 points or 1.4% to 16,599.85.
The action was triggered by expectations that Fed policies will maintain the rate this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody’s Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed would raise the rates at this point,” he said.
If she does, “she would have to go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets so they don’t panic.”
Other experts argued that a rate hike would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the Fed will trade.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed on track to raise the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of the U.S. recovery.
Yellen had said in spring and early summer that she expects an increase in the rate this year despite the complaints from liberals that more economic progress would be needed.
Although job creation slowed down in August, the improvement in the labour market was solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest in more than seven years and close to the level the Fed considers full employment.
Wage increases have shown signs of recovery.
And although inflation was constantly below the annual target of 2% of the central bank, the Fed representatives said the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension in the labor market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world shrugged at the end of last month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial average fell more than 16% below its peak in May, as investors feared a slowdown in the Chinese economy would throttle global growth.
The market has recovered slightly this month, with the Dow now almost 10% below the high of May.
For the Fed representatives, the market turbulences influence the complex calculation of when to raise interest rates.
“If the events in the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks, they would have pulled the reins in this meeting,” said Stephen D. Oliner, senior research fellow at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Fed employee.
Now he predicts that she will wait at least a month to better control the effects.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact will be on the U.S. economy, and there is almost no reliable data describing the developments in China," Oliner said.
The health of the global economy is not one of the Fed’s main concerns, so it should not be technically involved in its decision-making.
But in the end, the Fed has become the world’s monetary authority.
The influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years.
The mere hint by then-leader Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could “constrict” its monetary expansion caused confusion around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, Fed representatives can be expected to not only monitor developments elsewhere, but also consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
Their decision-making is “more art than science,” said Zachary Karabell, head of Envestnet Inc’s global asset management strategy.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA, remarked this month that “the Fed has a history of overreactions to financial market movements that are apparently not linked to the economic fundamentals.”
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee who advocates for a rate hike, cited decisions in 1998/1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to cut its key interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three meetings “despite limited noticeable impact on U.S. growth,” Lacker said.
A year later, Fed representatives reversed these cuts.
The Fed should put aspects of financial stability first only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market collapse, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England’s Interest Rate Settings Committee.
The recent turmoil is not coming close to this level, he said.
"She certainly doesn't want to get into the situation where she's afraid of a rate hike because the markets are upset," said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that is changed, I do not think it should rush ahead of time.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown.
The market/ warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
LAX-C is often referred to as Thai Costco and is a Thai wholesale market that also sells to the general public.
Yes, it's in Chinatown, not Thai Town.
The market/ warehouse is a central point of contact and offers a confusing number of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and dishes, furniture, religious jewelry and Christmas decorations.
There is even a car department if you need engine oil.
The store is huge, and it takes over an hour to stroll through the corridors.
If the whole shop makes you hungry, there is a meal for you at the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The kitchen (good and inexpensive) in this store is close to the cash registers and has various takeaway options.
What's here: Do you need anything - anything - Thai?
LAX-C probably has it.
Products are inexpensive and a number of them are sold in large quantities.
Fresh products include Asian specialties and regional Thai herbs, fruits and much more.
The meat counter is extensive, as is the fish counter - the staff behind the counter will clean and fillet the fish and even fry for you on request.
A good part of the store belongs to the massive freezer department, where you will find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and galgant, whole ducks, fish, bovine blood and bile, pork natural gut, fish balls, regional sausages, commercially prepared foods and more.
Who buys here: restaurant owners and chefs, also individual families and individuals.
The wide aisles are suitable for shopping carts and forklifts.
You will find here: fresh Monthong Durian next to the checkout.
Where it is located: The store is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the outskirts of Chinatown and downtown - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking area, along with other shops and restaurants.
Even if the store is well-attended, it is not difficult to find a parking space.
Hoyerswerda: Small Life Aid for Refugees
More and more refugees are arriving in Germany these days.
To provide you with a warm welcome is not possible without the commitment of countless volunteers.
Also in Hoyerswerda there are quite a number of people who support unselfish asylum seekers in the city.
They include Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a body and soul teacher.
Even with her 74 lenses, she still likes to teach.
Every Thursday she does it in the asylum seeker’s home on Dillinger Straße.
There she helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language.
Of course, this is quite different teaching than in a real school.
Brazil’s paediatric society Rio Grande promotes diet for healthy breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS is trying to educate women in a shocking way about the importance of good nutrition during breastfeeding by presenting images of babies sucking on breasts painted with depictions of unhealthy foods.
Breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to the additional energy requirements, pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day.
However, new research suggests that higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment mothers should make.
A recent study led by Robert Waterland, professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects their babies’ genes and protects them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet of the child can negatively affect the immune system.
Exceptions for the new Bernrieder Sporthalle
The municipal council of Bernried approved the building application for the 2.3 million euro sports hall.
And he made an exception.
The roof may be flatter for solar system.
Planning for the long-awaited gymnastics building at the Bernrieder Sportgelände is progressing step by step: In the recent municipal council meeting, the drafted building application was unanimously approved without major discussions.
Previously, the board had decided, among other things, an application for a construction law "exception" or "exemption" from the valid development plan.
The "exception" was about the permission for a special shape regarding the roof construction.
Accordingly, a "saddle roof with non-middle first and roof overhang" is to be erected.
Background of the planning is the planned use of the roof area for solar systems: "This will give us a wonderfully large south roof together," explained Mayor Josef Steigenberger in the meeting.
The "liberation" was again about the roof inclination, which should be below ten degrees for energetic reasons - contrary to what is prescribed in the development plan.
This significantly reduces the volume of the hall.
A "liberation" became necessary because the development plan with regard to the roof inclination does not allow "exceptions" - whereby the Bernried municipal council usually acts rather restrictively in the case of exemption applications.
However, gymnastics construction is not a recurring project: "We do not set a precedent," says Steigenberger.
The gym building at the Sportzentrum is a joint project of the municipality and the SV Bernried.
Approximately 2.3 million euros are calculated at costs.
Grants are expected from school and general sport funding.
In the next step of the process, the building application for the 18 x 36-metre hall will now be submitted to the Landratsamt for examination.
Clinic Peißenberg moves to Schongau
The Peißenberg hospital is to be closed earlier than planned – namely in 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) becomes the new medical director at the Schongau Hospital.
The station as well as the majority of the employees move from Peißenberg to Schongau.
This is what the surprising plans of the district’s hospital GmbH foresee, which was confirmed by the county councillor Andrea Jochner-Weiß.
However, the Supervisory Board will take a decision on this, and it will meet next Wednesday, September 23rd.
If the plans were implemented, all of the nearly 50 employees at the hospital in Peißenberg would continue to be employed.
The vast majority should move to Schongau with Fischer and the still existing Inner Station.
The rooms are available.
The employees who cannot go to Schongau should be offered a job in Weilheim, according to Jochner-Weiß.
Employees are informed of the plans.
The change was triggered by the dismissal of Dr. Andreas Eder, who has only been medical director of the Schongau Clinic since the beginning of the year and is now switching to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital.
According to Jochner-Weiß, the name "Fischer" came into play when the question of who should succeed came into play, who agreed to take over the management from 1 October and to change with his team to Schongau.
For the house in Schongau, this means in any case an "appreciation" and a broadening of the range in the field of "internal medicine", according to Jochner-Weiß.
Fischer is a specialist in cardiac pacemakers and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) specializes in gastroenterological diseases at the Internal Station.
If the Supervisory Board agrees, Fischer and his team will manage both houses temporarily for the next two years, until next year the former hospital of the shortage, which still has 35 beds, is to be closed definitively in Peißenberg after almost 140 years.
So far, the district had planned this for 2018, when the currently ongoing renovation at the Weilheim Hospital is completed.
Councillor Jochner-Weiß, who is also chair of the Supervisory Board, opposed rumors that the house, which is owned by the federal government, will be used as a shelter for asylum seekers in the future.
Jochner-Weiß could not say that there are several considerations as to how the property continues.
It currently houses a short-term care of Caritas and a day-to-day psychiatry.
"What better could not have happened to us, such an opportunity will not come again," said Fischer about the quasi-movement to the Lech, which was received by the employees "positively and very understanding".
There was no real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as a chief physician for over 30 years.
He was asked by Schongauer colleagues to take over the position of medical director.
The Peißenberg Hospital (formerly 100 beds) was constantly threatened with closure in recent decades, departments were closed, for example surgery and obstetrics.
The handball players of the Rhine-Neckar Lions will be challenged tonight at the Bergische HC (20.15 h).
Although the Bundesliga leader is the clear favourite in Wuppertal, there is no reason to be arrogant.
Last season, the Badeners suffered a painful defeat at the BHC and have something to make up for there.
Hunting accident with two injured in Pratau
Two tractor drivers were seriously injured during their corn harvest on Tuesday afternoon.
During the harvesting on a cornfield near Pratau (Wittenberg County), several hunters were in use, the police said.
After a shooting, a 63- and a 22-year-old man suffered serious injuries and were taken to hospitals.
How exactly the accident occurred was initially unclear.
Criminal police investigate.
Missing 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate victims of violent crimes
A suspect led the police to the body of the 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate, who has been missing since Saturday.
In the interrogation, the 20-year-old admitted to having killed the teenagers and thrown their body into a canal in Rockenhausen.
A 16-year-old missing since Saturday from Rhineland-Palatinate has fallen victim to a violent crime.
The body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rockenhausen near Kaiserslautern, as prosecutors and police announced on Wednesday.
A 20-year-old, also arrested on Tuesday night, who confessed to the crime and led the investigators to the location of the body.
The 16-year-old had been reported missing on Sunday morning, after she had not come home on the eve after a visit to an autumn festival in Rockenhausen as agreed.
In the search for the young woman, the investigators first encountered personal belongings of the victim.
In interviews with the friends and acquaintances of the missing people, a suspect was finally found against the 20-year-old.
The alleged perpetrator then led the police to a canal in Rockenhausen, where the body was found.
According to the authorities, the detainee admitted in the police interrogation that the 16-year-old killed and placed the body in the canal.
The 20-year-old was to be presented to the judge on Wednesday, the investigators charge him with homicide.
Further investigations should provide information on the circumstances of the incident.
Refugees need housing: study warns of housing gap
The situation in the German housing market is tense.
More and more refugees are looking for affordable accommodation.
The pressure on the housing market is growing.
Social housing is facing a challenge.
The distribution struggles on the German housing market have long since begun.
With the arrival of refugees and job seekers from the EU, more and more people are pushing for a market that is already overloaded in many major cities.
They compete with low-income citizens for the last affordable housing.
In order to meet the demand for affordable housing, 400,000 new units would have to be built each year by 2020.
This is the result of a study commissioned by the Association for Social Housing.
For comparison: 260,000 units will be finished in Germany this year.
There are 140,000 homes missing.
After the first three months of their stay, refugees are no longer obliged to live in a first-reception accommodation as asylum seekers.
Many then come across the housing market and line up in the long queues in front of the rental apartments.
According to the Federal Statistical Office, however, less than half of all asylum seekers lived for rent last year.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the increasing number of refugees.
The study also highlights significant omissions in housing policy in recent years.
Germany is facing a housing deficit that is growing from year to year.
Currently, around 770,000 housing units are missing in the metropolitan areas, complains Matthias Günther, author of the study.
For this reason, many professionals lived in apartment rooms in large cities.
Young adults stayed involuntarily longer at the "Hotel Mama" due to the sluggishness of the housing market.
In the major cities, the number of square meters per capita has decreased for the first time in recent years.
To solve the problem, the Alliance "Social Housing" proposes a restart.
New incentives are expected to boost social housing once again.
Thus, the land acquisition tax could be waived and the land tax for assisted housing could be temporarily suspended.
In addition, according to the Alliance, attractive tax depreciation options are needed.
The state bank KfW’s support programme for refugee shelters is already well received by cities and municipalities.
A good week after the launch, with 184 million euros, more than half of the approximately 300 million euros available had already been called up on Monday evening.
Now the project could even be increased.
Refugees have free passage: Croatia and Slovenia set up corridor
After Hungary is practically no longer possible, as more and more refugees choose the way through Croatia.
Zagreb announces that it will allow the passage through Slovenia to the north without obstacles.
However, the route is dangerous.
Croatia wants to reach an agreement with neighbouring Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees.
"I spoke with the Slovenian Interior Minister and if necessary, we will organize a corridor," Croatian Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic said.
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone.
Croatia is not yet a Schengen country.
After the closure of the Serbian-Hungarian border, hundreds of refugees have set out to Croatia to reach Western Europe.
500 people crossed the border at Tovarnik, the Croatian television station RTL reports.
Hungary closed its border to refugees the day before.
New laws, which came into force on the same day, make ordinary asylum procedures in Hungary virtually unnecessary.
Croatia wants to allow the refugees to pass.
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said: "You can travel through, and we are preparing for this opportunity."
These people are there, there are women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.
However, there were people who did not want to live in Croatia.
The Croatian police had taken the first refugees on the border of Serbia with the EU neighbouring country Croatia in the morning.
Most of them came from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan, according to media reports.
They came to the Serbian border town of Sid by bus and taxi.
Immediately after their arrival, they had tried to cross the green border to Croatia on foot.
At the Croatian-Serbian border, the refugees do not encounter border fences.
But the border strip has other dangers: there are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav civil war in the 1990s.
Miners should now quickly create a safe passage.
However, there are hardly any more refugees coming to Hungary after the border has been closed.
On Tuesday, police arrested 366 people.
Shortly before the goal on Monday, there had been 9380.
The new Hungarian laws classify overcoming and damaging the border fence as a crime.
In the southern Hungarian border town of Szeged, 35 criminal proceedings have therefore been initiated.
The convicts face imprisonment for up to five years and deportation from the country.
According to the immigration authority, a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday in the newly established "transit zones" at the border, almost all of them - 93 - the most important transition Röszke.
Among the applicants are 13 families with young children and two elderly people.
On Wednesday morning, 40 more refugees were staying there.
However, practically no one has the prospect of being granted asylum in Hungary.
In Hungary, Serbia is a “safe third country”.
The rejected asylum seekers should be deported there.
In front of the "transit zone" in Röszke, only a few hundred refugees gathered.
In Röszke, workers began cleaning up.
They collected the rubbish that tens of thousands of people had left on the roadside in recent weeks.
Barrier grids were dismantled and one of the reception camps in the border town was rebuilt.
No one wanted to comment on the purpose of this renovation.
After the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary, only a few refugees reach Austria.
The country has also strengthened its border controls.
According to the government, about 20,000 migrants were still in the country.
In Salzburg, about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany.
Train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning at the instruction of German authorities.
Smaller groups of refugees regularly arrived on foot in Freilassing.
Mayor drove "stranded" across the border
"We were busy cleaning up after the bridge festival on Sunday, when suddenly ten people with travel suitcases stood at the entrance of the tent," said Wernstein's mayor Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted to take the train to Passau.
But because Germany had surprisingly stopped rail traffic with Austria on Sunday due to the flow of refugees, it was the end of Wernstein for them," Stadler said, who immediately offered his help and drove the stranded people along with two other helpers and their cars across the border to the near Passau.
Previously, we had tasted the unexpected guests first, with snacks and drinks.
We said we'd take her to Passau by car.
"That was a matter of course for us," Stadler said in the O<0xC3><0x96>N talk.
You were very grateful.
One man did not let himself be taken to hand over a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire brigade.
“We were delighted,” Stadler said.
The stranded train passengers had switched from an ICE to a regional train in the direction of Passau on Sunday evening in Wels, in order to try to cross the border after the short notice that the rail traffic to Germany was stopped.
However, the regional train was stopped in front of the border in Wernstein am Inn.
In Wernstein, the crossing of borders is generally high in the course.
The bridge festival connected with the Bavarian neighbors on Sunday sociable, the day before a two-bridge run sporty - organized by the Union Wernstein and Bavaria from Neukirchen.
The fact that Viktor Orbán now sends more tens of thousands to us is a logical result of a hypocritical policy:
Instead of immediately helping in the establishment of structures that guarantee humanity at Röszke camp, our Federal Chancellor has officially and publicly pushed the attitude of the Hungarian government into the dark circle of National Socialism.
The victims of this policy are not only those Austrians who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the border areas.
The refugees will also have to find out that the "promised land" that they have invited and welcomed is nothing more than another refugee camp.
It will be a great challenge to create decent conditions for refugees in the face of the ongoing flows of refugees and the approaching winter.
And there will be an even greater one – maintaining peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad in search of 35,000 winter-proof quarters
Konrad has everything to do with the refugee shelter.
Christian Konrad is accustomed to his word having weight.
The government has used the former powerful Raiffeisen banker to set up quarters for the thousands of refugees.
The chaos in the first reception center Traiskirchen has already gotten Konrad under control.
“We no longer have homeless people in Traiskirchen,” he said of his first success.
The accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday also took place without great turmoil, Konrad said, praising the organization's "master achievement".
The Ministry of the Interior, on the other hand, spoke of a “crisis situation”.
Overall, Konrad expects a need of 85,000 quarters this year.
To meet the number, 35,000 more accommodations must be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 are to be provided by the states, 15,000 by the federal government.
If there are more refugees, we can do it.
"But it's not a barrel without ground," Konrad said.
He has already had talks with the governors.
They promised him that they would also create neighbourhoods for the upcoming refugees.
“It’s going well in Upper Austria,” said Ferry Maier.
The former VP-Mandatar supports Konrad.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn to clarify how the Church will help.
The Asylum Coordinator also sets great expectations in the ORF action "Help like us".
On the platform, individuals can offer accommodation easily.
There are also hotels that are empty in the winter.
Konrad and Maier criticized the standards for accommodation as "very high".
In times of emergency, it cannot be possible for quarter-holders to have to maintain a certain height of the towel rails or the size of the skylights.
For a limited period of time, "emergency standards" should apply.
In contrast to the Ministry of the Interior, he is more successful in accommodation, Konrad justifies with his experience.
I am an elderly gentleman, to whom one does not readily tell the untruth in the face.
Persuasion is his most important weapon.
Konrad and Maier do not incur any costs for the Republic, as they explained themselves.
You want to increase your number of employees to three to four.
The search for its own quarters has not yet been successful.
Konrad wanted to set up a container at Stephansplatz as an office.
However, there are problems with the approval.
Linz calls for a better division
For the time being, the city of Linz is not planning the opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips-Arena and Design Center to accommodate refugees.
This is not necessary at the moment, because the affected people can currently be accommodated without these measures, says Mayor Klaus Luger (SP).
However, further locations should be checked for their suitability in the event of an emergency.
The city chief criticizes the distribution of refugees within the federal state.
Other districts also have to make their contribution.
Seehofer: "The borders will not be closed"
In a long telephone call with Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU), state governor Josef Pühringer (VP) agreed on Monday on the further approach to the refugee issue.
Seehofer has assured me that the German borders will not be sealed off.
The further travel of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible.
However, there are now the corresponding border controls.
Special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer be available for the time being.
However, those seeking protection would be brought to Germany by regular trains.
Pühringer once again called for increased solidarity on the refugee issue from the other EU member states.
For Pühringer, the fact that Austria is now also reintroducing controls at its borders is "a logical consequence" of the Germans' actions.
The next Runtastic is a matter of time
The general renovation of the "New Shipyard" in the Linz Industrial Line is officially completed.
The listed IT group S&T has moved into four of the six floors of the office and production building, and the rest (2,700 square meters) will be leased to young, innovative companies in the technology sector.
“In IT, the smart minds are our raw material – and we have to try to make them work for us,” says S&T CEO Hannes Niederhauser.
He could imagine investing in start-up companies of the New Shipyard and later also to acquire some.
From the very beginning, S&T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - of which Niederhauser promises a lot: "The next Runtastic is only a matter of time".
1.7 million euros were invested by S&T in the site, 3.3 million euros from the Techcenter, which belongs to one-third of the city of Linz, the state of Upper Austria and the federal government (FFG).
The building is leased by Linz AG to S&T and Techcenter for 60 years.
30 percent of the 2700 square meters of remaining space in the building are already rented, for another 40 percent there are requests.
Lia Peroni owner opened second store in the arcade
The new shop focuses on Furla handbags.
Actually, Jutta Breit wanted to buy a dog.
This project had to be postponed by the 49-year-old owner of Lia Peroni in the pigeon market arcade: After all, she has now gained growth in the form of another business location.
In the Furla shop opposite the store, where she sells bags, suitcases, shoes and garments from various manufacturers, everything revolves around women's handbags of the Furla brand, purses are available from 75 euros.
Larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros.
The new shop has been in operation since yesterday.
It was rebuilt several weeks ago.
"But I've been thinking for a long time about whether I should open another store," Breit says.
The decisive factor for the decision was, among other things, that the Furla producers, who are at home in Bologna, were also impressed by the idea of their own location, where only their handbags are sold.
"We are the only ones in the Linz area who sell this brand," says the mother of two daughters, who herself has Italian roots.
Her fashion interest has been broadened by her mother in the cradle.
I do well when something is developing and I can show new trends at affordable prices.
Why so many women are enchanted at the sight of a beautiful handbag, even the expert woman cannot answer with absolute certainty.
Maybe it’s because a nice bag enhances any outfit.
The Brulljesmacher from Kallstadt
The Palatinate ancestors of Donald Trump came from a place whose inhabitants are called glamour.
This trait is also associated with the billionaire who wants to become president of the United States.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for excitement.
Whether he is xenophobic, rude to journalists or reveals knowledge gaps in international crisis politics - the candidate for the US presidential office is swirling the election campaign vigorously.
And cuts well with it.
This is also recorded in the Palatinate town of Kall, where the grandparents of the real estate billionaire come from.
The New Yorker with the hair dryer is known to many in the winegrower village on the Wine Road.
Some in the 1200-inhabitant town is related to it over a dozen corners.
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Palatinate: Donald Trump, here in campaign mode.
Simone Wendel made a film about Trump.
And what do the villagers think about his goal of becoming the most powerful man in the world?
"I think they find this somehow exciting, but are not so deeply impressed with their Kallstadt style," says Simone Wendel.
The native of Kallstadt has made an amusing documentary about the place and its famous offspring, which includes besides Trump also the ketchup family Heinz.
Trump, who is not known for modesty, also speaks in "Kings of Kallstadt" (2014) - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he lived in Kallstadt.
He did not bring it there to the King of Hearts.
While there is respect for the performance of the family, there is also a tendency to believe that Trump is "already a bit of a big mouth," says Wendel.
Coincidentally, the nickname that Kallstadt has in the vicinity is "Die Brulljesmacher" - in High German: die Angeber, she says.
So Trump comes from the village of the boasters.
Trump’s success story began in 1885, when his later grandfather emigrated and opened a gold mining establishment in the United States.
The foundation stone of the real estate company was first land purchases in New York.
But the lives of their grandparents were not free from tragedy: their desire to return to their homeland in the long term failed in the Bavarian state, to which the Palatinate belonged at the time.
He did not accept Trump because he once left without permission, the director of the Institute of Palatinate History and Folklore, Roland Paul, had declared the film launch.
Trump is the grandson of an “illegal emigrant.”
This stands in contrast to the sometimes striking statements of the descendants.
He had repeatedly defamed Mexican immigrants in the US and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants.
"Just as he polters, that's not as sympathetic," says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant relative of Trump ("The grandma was a born Trump, the grandpa was a born Heinz").
The retired winemaker sees the American rather distant, "he's always so outgoing."
Do you think Trump is coming?
"I can't imagine that," said the 72-year-old.
"He never cared about Kallstadt".
The pensioner Veronika Schramm mentions, like some Kallstadters, that a descendant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organs during a visit, which was generally well received.
"I can't imagine that from Donald," said the 68-year-old.
She would find it better if he didn’t win the election, because “he has such radical views, I don’t know if that’s good.”
If those who were in charge in the U.S. at the time of his grandfather had been like him, "he would never have arrived there."
"There are more interesting topics than him," says winemaker's daughter Sarah Bühler.
And as president?
"It's not my president," she says.
“The grapes will ripen even without President Trump.”
Wendel’s film, for which Trump has been interviewed for a long time, has seen 12,000 cinematographers, and interest is also awakening in the US.
The Upper Bavarian municipality of Ramsau near Berchtesgaden is Germany's first "mountain climbing village".
From the hands of the Vice President of the German Alpine Association, Ludwig Wucherpfennig, the 1800-inhabitant village in the Berchtesgaden National Park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday.
There are already 20 "mountain climbing villages" in Austria.
In the neighbouring country, the Alpine Association is responsible for awarding the award.
A "mountain climbing village" may not have more than 2500 inhabitants.
At least one-fifth of its area must be designated as a protected area.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the ratings, despite Nine's attempts to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson rush to Canberra to report on the loss of leadership by the Liberals, but it hasn’t produced any major shifts in today’s ratings.
Nine’s breakfast show was broadcast from the federal capital when Malcolm Turnbull managed to overthrow Tony Abbott.
Rival Sunrise, with hosts David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was in London as part of a one-week series of international television shows, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This disadvantage of the distance seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise averaged 397,000 viewers in the five capitals, compared to Today's 339,000.
Today recorded a slight increase over the ratings for Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its number remained behind last Thursday (343,000).
Today has closed the gap to Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today averaged 318,000 compared to Sunrise’s 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise stands at an average of 349,000 viewers to 314,000 at Today.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of change affect these morning people more than Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for checking out!

The big news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series star of Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father, who decides to settle down with his two children on the coast of New Zealand, reached a very impressive number of 1,219 million viewers.
Critics had wondered if Thomson could carry a hit show solo without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Yesterday’s answer to this question was a clear yes.
The X-Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.136 million viewers and easily beat The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven had mixed results on evening two of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17:00 to 17:30) of the new quiz show, moderated by Andrew O'Keefe, yielded an average of 446,000 viewers.
The second half-hour (17:30 to 18:00) jumped to 623,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuire's hot seat (613,000).
On Monday evening, the first half hour of The Chase Australia scored 520,000 spectators and in the second half hour, a whopping 720,000.
Hot-seat average 620,000.
The drop in second night odds from The Chase Australia will make Nine confident that Hot-Seat will ultimately prevail at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia is a substitute for Million Dollar Minute that failed to outperform McGuire’s show.

The last three agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man – but who will he choose?
Secret revealed? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unknowingly revealed who will win The Bachelor.
The woman who eventually landed Sam Wood in The Bachelor was shrouded in utmost secrecy.
And none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose.
But when we checked in with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before three became two, you may have accidentally given a clue as to who will be the winner.
Sam Wood holds his lips tightly sealed until the final on Thursday
All three women have lyrically outlined why Wood is the perfect man, citing his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positive attitude as reasons why they want to be his partner.
However, if the question is asked "If not you, who should receive Wood's last rose?", their answers could become the game spoiler who won the heart of the bachelor.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay as Wood's best partner, except for himself.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had an easy relationship from day one.
“From the moment I went into the house and noticed [Sarah’s] and Sam’s energies, I felt they were pretty compatible, and I thought that throughout the show,” Jeavons-Fellows said.
"Sarah is standing on earth with both feet, it's so much fun to be with her," Markoski added.
I saw them together, and they have the right chemistry.
They feel comfortable and comfortable together.
Sarah Mackay believes that she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple.
From her point of view, Mackay said that last week’s house visit made it clear to her that Wood could be “the one.”
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I'm now totally committed to him," she said.
And when she was asked who Wood should vote for, if not her, she was mysterious.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.
I love the remaining girls alike - it's a draw between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be broadcast on Wednesday, 7:30 p.m., on Ten.
Originally released as Sarah's first choice for Sam Wood?
Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the U.S. – and there were many other teams who sent requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a wise decision.
Some coaches would have banished Hayne to the bench for the rest of the game when he lost a fight like the Aussie rugby league convert did on his first punt return on Tuesday in the 20-3 win against Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted his husband and gave Hayne the next opportunity for a punt return and also into the ongoing game after an injury to Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true face in the locker room after the game.
Instead of grinding his rookies through the mill in front of the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly strengthened Hayne in his post-game press conference.
49ers sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget his messed up catch and take care of the next game.
Jarryd Hayne paces at a punt restored in the first quarter by the Minnesota Vikings
It certainly wasn’t the start Hayne and his massive Australian following had hoped for for his NFL debut.
Hayne left the field after the fumble and later told Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he couldn't imagine a worse start in his NFL career.
"That was a thing that happens, you just take care of the next game, and that's it," Hayne said.
Hayne compared the Schnitzer to his Origin debut back in 2007, when a pass at his own in-goal area led to a try for Queensland.
Overall, it was a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posed for a photo with fans, holding an Australian flag after the game and posting it on his Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia’s richest man, was arrested on a Siberian roadside car park with weapons.
After openly challenging President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company Yukos confiscated, and his democratic efforts halted.
Due to the high number of refugees, the Free Voters demand the recruitment of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria.
Head of party and faction Hubert Aiwanger warned at the beginning of the FW autumn clause in Großwallstadt about a serious crisis at Bavaria's schools, if there are not correspondingly new teachers for the many new students: "We need at least 1000 additional teachers to save the schools from the collapse," Aiwanger said.
"Otherwise, we will have disturbances in the Bavarian education system."
The parliamentary group of the Free Voters will meet in the Lower Franconia municipality until Friday.
In fact, there were quite different main topics planned.
But the record number of refugees now also dominates the Free Electoral Meeting.
"Of course, the issue of asylum will overlap the exit," Aiwanger said.
Aiwanger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria, as was the case during the Yugoslav Wars in the 1990s.
“That’s not how it goes, we have to look at the causes,” the Free Electoral Party chief said.
Rejected asylum seekers want to deport the Free Voters as soon as possible.
Therefore, Aiwanger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts, which are responsible for asylum claims: "We also need at least 50 new asylum judges," Aiwanger said.
The FW chief criticized the fact that several federal states were not consistent: "We need uniform standards of the federal states nationwide."
"Bayern defers, others not."
“We need to be more capable.”
But the national politics in Great Wall City should not fall under the table.
A year-long permanent burner remains on the agenda: education policy.
For the new school year, Minister of Culture Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) has started the pilot experiment "Mittelstufe plus" at 47 high schools, in which an extension of the gymnasial intermediate level from three to four years is tested - in the result it takes nine years until the Abitur.
But Aiwanger does not go far enough.
"The G9 issue needs to be accelerated," the FW chief said.
We demand freedom of choice for all high schools that want it.
Free ride on the G9 wherever you want.
More solid Wall Street helps Dax on the move
The German stock market has closed with profits after a long and nervous trading course.

The discussion about the charges from the nuclear exit has meanwhile pushed the stocks of RWE to a record low and also left deep traces at Eon.
According to "Spiegel", the German energy companies may lack 30 billion euros in provisions.
The German government denied the figures in the press.
The shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered somewhat, but ultimately lost 3.31 percent (RWE) and 6.15% (Eon).
Infineon shares increased at the top of Dax by another 3.22 percent.
According to a trader, a positive report by the US investor magazine "Barron's" after the weekend.
Accordingly, investors are currently paying too little attention to the German chip manufacturer.
Investing in future-oriented wafer technologies and focusing on the car market should pay off.
Car values were in demand: Even in the traditionally weak summer month of August, more cars were sold again than in the same period of the previous year, as the industry association Acea announced at the launch of the IAA in Frankfurt.
The papers of the car manufacturers Daimler and BMW increased by 1.34% and 2.21% respectively.

4 people killed after police shoot rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets at a crowd protesting against the proposed new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence erupted on Tuesday night in Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, senior district official, said more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside a police station, with some of them throwing stones and firebombs.
Mr. Dhakal said police used tear gas and then fired it into the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
Twenty policemen and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the rubber bullets used, which are known to kill, but which are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, apparently produced such a high death rate.
The clash was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal’s southern plains, where members of the Mdhesi ethnic group say new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would diminish their political influence.
There have also been protests in western Nepal by the Tharus ethnic group who want a state of their own.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been in violent clashes since the 10th century.
He was killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces – an important step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal that has been centrally governed for centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008, but lawmakers have accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
Legislators have voted on certain clauses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu this week, and officials have said the new constitution could come into force on Sunday.
Construction area planned in the city
The property at the Emder Jugendzentrum Alte Post is to be rebuilt.
The city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square meter area.
A mixture of commerce, commerce and housing is planned - but concrete offers are not yet available.
Emden - The city of Emden intends to market an approximately 4000 square meter property in the immediate vicinity of the Alte Post Youth Center.
Preparations for this are currently underway.
It is planned to use the grounds for a mix of commerce, commerce and housing.
We are waiting for the offer, the city says.
The question of which investor is eligible is not yet clear.
Accordingly, no contracts have yet been concluded.
The city of Emden had already bought a part of the property, which is located on the ring road / corner of Große Straße, a few months ago and had the building on it demolished.
Project Hieve: Details are on the table
The plans for the holiday home settlement on the Little Sea near Emden are taking shape.
The investor publicly presented plans for the project for the first time.
Many neighbors are still worried - they fear the sale of their leisure retreat
For months they had been negotiating, pondering, debating and drawing behind closed doors.
Now the plans for a new holiday home settlement on the Little Sea near Emden are on the table.
The interested party, the medium-sized Emder company "System-Bau", presented its plans publicly for the first time in the city development committee of the Emder Council on Monday evening.
Originally, this point was on the non-public part of the agenda.
Under pressure from the project critics and the FDP group, who accused the investor and the administration of secrecy, Ralf Behrends of the System Building Management went on the offensive: "We have not yet got an answer to all the questions," he said before the council members and more than 50 visitors.
But it is good to be able to meet all the rumors now.
The project, which is worth between 10 and 12 million euros, has been under discussion for months.
Strong reactions among sea stall owners who had come to the session evoked the pictures and new details of the desired hotel construction.
Roberto Schulz, Meerbuden owner and member of the board at the advocacy office of the neighbours, Pro Hieve, complains: "This will be a giant block that surpasses all other buildings."
In addition, he fears, like many other project critics, that traffic would increase greatly due to the intended size of the plant: "There must be entire bus loads, so that this pays off," says Schulz.
What exactly is happening on the one hectare area of the former restaurant, however, is still open.
There is no operator yet.
“First we have to have a coherent concept,” said Ralf Behrends.
Because this was still missing, the development plans were also variable.
Twin offspring with gorillas at Frankfurt Zoo
The Frankfurt Zoo welcomes offspring from its gorillas.
26-year-old Dian gave birth to twins yesterday.
Twin births are rare in gorillas.
The last in a German zoo is almost 50 years ago and was also in Frankfurt in 1967, according to the zoo.
The sex of the newborn gorilla twins has not yet been determined, as Mother Dian holds them tightly to the body.
First, the "picture" had reported.
NHC predicts 60 percent chance for cyclone south of Cape Verde
The U.S. National Hurricane Center predicted on Tuesday a wide gravity system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands, which has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours.
Another well-defined gravure system, located approximately in the middle between the Cape Verde Islands and the Little Antilles, also has a 60 percent potential to form a tropical cyclone over the next two days, Miami-based weather experts added.
Google launches doubling donation campaign to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced a doubling donation campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have overwhelmed European nations as they flee from war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google has an unusually personal approach to announcing the donation call on its blog.
Rather than having a manager make the announcement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven, wrote about her personal experiences.
"Our journey included many dark train and bus rides, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has grown, many people like my family are desperately looking for help.
The donations will go to four non-profit organizations that provide assistance to refugees and migrants: MSF, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that the first globally collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million will be doubled to $11 million on google.com/refugeerelief.
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II, largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many also flee from war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For slightly overweight diabetics, weight loss surgery can be helpful.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for mildly overweight people with type 2 diabetes may last for at least five years, according to a new study.
It is still too early to say whether mildly overweight people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those receiving non-surgical treatments.
"The mortality data take a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, a weight loss surgery expert who wrote an editorial on the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss operations or obesity surgery, use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body’s ability to absorb food.
Over the years, obesity surgery to treat type 2 diabetes has proven to be effective, but most studies have been conducted in people who are diseased obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a certain amount of weight in terms of size, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers from Taiwan’s Min-Sheng General Hospital used data they collected in a study since 2007, comparing two types of obesity surgery — gastric bypass and gastric tubing — to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.
The average BMI among those who underwent this surgery decreased from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year in this study.
Meanwhile, the BMI remained approximately the same in those who received non-surgical diabetes treatments at 29.
Among those who underwent a surgical procedure, 36% resolved diabetes completely and 28% partially.
In the medically-treated group, diabetes completely resolved in comparison to that in only one percent and in part in only about two percent.
In addition, the results in blood pressure, triglycerides and “bad” LDL cholesterol controls were “generally better in the ‘surgical’ group,” the authors found.
The researchers also monitored patient blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood sugar levels over time.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers write.
After surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c level dropped from around 9 percent to around 6 percent.
In the medical therapy group, however, it remained stable at about 8 percent.
But this better “glycemic control” — as reflected in improved hemoglobin A1c levels — did not reduce mortality in five years, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the bypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the gastrectomy group (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), achieved greater decreases in BMI (7.4 vs. 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%), and were more likely to experience a complete overcoming of diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%).
While the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, obese people who underwent obesity surgery were about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years — compared to a group who tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study showed no survival benefit in surgical patients, Blackstone said it was reassuring for individuals with a BMI below 35 who are interested in the procedure.
“That’s the critical point of this study because it says this surgery is lower in this lower BMI group,” with no increased risk of death or kidney disease, she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient is between 27 and 30 with his BMI.
"I think we're waiting too long to get people to take this seriously," she said.
I think that once they have accumulated those genetic changes that have tied their bodies firmly to obesity and diabetes, a reversal is really difficult."
Love story set in Hunsrück
It is a theme that is currently gaining more attention in fiction: a young woman, unpopular and unsightly at school, meets the swarm of her youth again after years, and he falls in love with her.
So also in the recent novel "Actually we are not so" by Luisa Binder.
In addition to the love story, the novel should be of interest to readers of Hunsrück, as it is set in boredom and the surrounding villages.
The full-time author grew up in Langweiler and is happy that she was able to set up a literary monument to her hometown.
"It is impossible for anyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe cannot accept all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the refugees’ home countries.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten-day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to ethics studies.
He demanded that, under the circumstances, the interests of humanity should be put before the interests of individual nations or even continents.
He also stressed that the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was admirable, but not appropriate to the situation.
"It is impossible for anyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama of Germany and Austria praised efforts to address the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
“Caring for several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you have to think about long-term solutions, how to create real peace and real development, mainly through education, for these Muslim countries,” he stressed.
Ultimately, we need to think about how to reduce killings in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
“The use of force has never solved these problems,” he added.
The Dalai Lama addressed the issue of violence and also commented on George Bush’s actions following the 9/11 terrorist attack, pointing out that the U.S.’s violent response has resulted in a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way to solve this problem is through non-violence.
"I know his motives were good, but he used violence, and that has produced unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
Four-fold increase in children taking hand disinfectants in the last 4 years
U.S. poison control centers report an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of twelve who swallow heavily alcoholic hand sanitizers, according to the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, cases of intake of hand sanitizers in children under the age of 12 reporting poison control centers increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
“Children are increasingly coming to these products, and unfortunately a percentage of them end up going to the emergency room,” Lopez told CNN.
He said some children deliberately drink disinfectants, while some do it to impress their friends or because of a test of courage on social media.
Videos on YouTube show how teens drink disinfectants just for a cheap experience.
Teenagers allegedly mixed disinfectants with alcoholic mouthwash to get a harder drink.
Younger children can be attracted by attractive fragrances of disinfectants.
"A child doesn't think this is bad for it," Lopez said.
Many of the more attractive (hand disinfectants) are those that are perfumed.
There are disinfectants with strawberry, grape and orange scent that are very appealing to children.
Hand sanitizers contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in young children, a few splashes can lead to alcohol poisoning.
“It’s highly concentrated alcohol,” Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the poison emergency center at the University of Kansas Hospital, told Fox 4 in Kansa City.
So, you wouldn’t leave a sip of whiskey around, but people leave these hand disinfectants within reach of children, and if children get it, then it’s a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who had recently taken four splashes of strawberry-scented hand disinfectant at school, was taken to an emergency room for treatment.
Her blood alcohol concentration was 179, twice the threshold that is legally considered drunk in an adult, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency room doctor who treated her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside of Atlanta.
Nhaijah laughed at her words and was unable to leave when she arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight at a separate children's hospital for signs of brain trauma as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had hit her head, Ritchey said.
“That was very scary,” Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah’s mother, told CNN.
It could have been fatal to my child.
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or disinfectant wipes and store hand disinfectants out of the reach of the child.
Beyond alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants were associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing hand disinfectants that contained a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Health officials suspect the product contained methanol, a lethal solution, rather than ethyl alcohol, which was listed as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth grade students in the state of New York planned to poison their "common" teacher by laying out antibacterial products around the classroom," a police report said.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand disinfectants and banished her from her room.
The police considered the defeated plan a "talk" and referred disciplinary measures to the school authority.
Villingen-Schwenningen: Three vehicles damaged
In a collision between Nordring and Auf Herdenen, a 33-year-old driver was slightly injured in a collision accident.
A 60-year-old truck driver drove on the transverse bracket towards the roundabout industrial area and noticed too late that two vehicles had stopped at the roundabout.
As a result, he crashed into the rear of an Audi with his truck and pushed this vehicle onto a Ford Fiesta standing in front of it.
The damage to the vehicles involved in the accident amounted to about 10,000 euros, the police said.
The 33-year-old’s Audi was no longer ready to drive and had to be towed.

Griffiths downplays talk about disharmony
There are rumors of disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, which was spontaneously rejected by Griffiths, who insisted that he and his teammates are not under increased control as they prepare to confront the Dutch leader.
I don’t think we’re under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
The lack of title competition in Scottish football bores Dutch - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch national Ronald de Boer has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic as there is no title rivalry with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently an ambassador for Ajax, said: "In Holland they no longer show highlights of Celtic games and why?"
It's because the Rangers aren't there.
People here aren't just talking about the return of the Rangers.
You're talking about the old firm.
They talk about both teams together and that’s what they care about.
There’s a lot of excitement in the old-firm games, and it’s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games.
I'm going to turn things around, Deila swears.
RONNY Deila has accepted that Celtic must fight, but the Norwegian boss vowed to turn things around.
After the defeat against Malmö and the subsequent elimination from the Champions League, the defeat followed against 10-man from Aberdeen, who are now clearly at the top of the table with five points of advantage.
But Deila said, "Celtic has had bad times before, and we will come back."
Now we want to get out of there as soon as possible.
I know it’s very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what’s happening.
We feel that way, but we have to move on.
We really, really need the support of Celtic because that makes the players better.
Standing together now is so important.
Warburton cautious about January transfers
Despite his comments just a few weeks ago, suggesting he was targeting some January transfers, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is cautious about signing new additions, insisting that he does not want to disrupt the unity of the Ibrox squad.
Brentford’s former chief executive said: “The January transfer window is very different from the summer window.”
The players who come this summer have this pre-season time to integrate what you’ve seen with our own group this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic target Michu with withdrawal note
Swansea striker Michu, with Celtic in talks during the transfer period, has indicated that he could withdraw if his contract with the Swans expires.
The 29-year-old has been plagued with an annoying ankle for two years and has not managed to leave Wales this summer.
Hearts suspended for SFA battle due to Neilson's comments
The Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was sent off the field and then lost 3:2, but the defender's red card was later cancelled - Collum's third red card, which was revoked in eight months.
Neilson sticks to what he said, insisting, "I haven't questioned integrity, I haven't commented on performance."
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
The incorrigible Hibee was corrected after he admitted to singing a song with offensive lyrics about ex-hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh in front of an Edinburgh derby in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a derby, and it was the heat of the moment," said the striker, adding, "It's safe to say that I won't return to Tynecastle unless it plays for Celtic Glasgow."
Tannadice Supervisory Board Trusts Dundee-United Management
Simon Donnelly insists that the Dundee United board still has confidence in the management team to turn things around - but admits that the decline must end on the pitch.
I think Stephen Thompson has faith in us.
We're going to get the guys back on track," Donnelly said.
McInnes happy to "win unsightly" against Hamilton.
Derek McInnes admits that his team from Aberdeen had to fight desperately against Hamilton Accies to see a seventh consecutive league win, which earned them a five-point lead over Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Rooney's penalties in the first half.
McInnes said, “There is no team that has won everything, in cup games or leagues, that has never won games of this kind.”
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged, while it is rising overall in the United Kingdom.
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 164,000 between May and July, while the number of unemployed in the United Kingdom as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
Scotland's unemployment rate of 5.9 percent was above that of the UK of 5.5 percent, as the figures from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) showed.
In the meantime, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 during the three months, with the number of employees now at 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0 percent in the course of the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 73.5 percent.
Secretary of State for Scotland David Mundell commented on the latest figures, saying, "The long-term plan of the government has laid the foundations for a stronger economy."
It has been almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have seen further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment.
Drunk people disrupted the process.
Since the security personnel could not pacify the situation, the staff called the police.
Only with the use of pepper spray could the officials take the disturbers into custody.
A breathing alcohol test showed 0.89 per mile in a 16-year-old.
The adolescent was picked up by his mother.
A 28-year-old had 2.15 per mile and remained in custody at first.
Why I Will Be Witnessing an Execution in Oklahoma
A little later today, except for a late legal intervention, I'm going to watch a man be put to death.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn't, I'll be sitting in a spectator gallery in the Death Chamber at Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by the poison syringe.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation was first received in January through his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day approached, I began to be afraid.
So, why would I do it?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the U.S., and as there are often more applications than places available, a macabre lottery is taking place to decide who is elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media seats from 12 to five.
Whoever is selected will watch it emotionally.
I can't do that.
I will sit next to Richard Glossip’s closest friend, with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like this guy.
We often laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of giving up my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it, and you get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she “could have formulated it better,” but she still thinks it’s wrong what I’m doing.
Richard Glossip had trouble with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn’t tell me what I have to write, and I wouldn’t do it even if he did.
I told him that he could remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to be present to write there.
If he dies, he thinks that public relations will help the movement against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a reporter for the Huffington Post, will sit next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I made.
I don't want to go back into all the details.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a beneficiary of the deed.
But I think there's a strong likelihood that he's not guilty of murder.
I certainly believe there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from that perspective, I will see him die.
I can't claim to be really objective.
There will be other reporters you can turn to for this.
What you will get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death.
Man Convinced to Come Out of the Canning River After Wet Police Persecution Hunt
The Canning Vale policeman remained dry when he persuaded the man from the Canning River.
An attempt by a Perth man to hang the police was unsuccessful when he found himself in shallow and swampy waters just a few meters away from a police officer trying to "gentlely persuade him to return to the shore."
Canning Vale police were called on Tuesday for a house-breaking incident in Beckenham.
When they discovered the suspect, he tried to escape them towards the Canning River.
But he didn't get too far.
"He stood in the water and said, 'I'm not coming out, come and get me,'" said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too enthusiastic about getting his uniform wet, so he applied a more reliable tactic - "A good cop negotiates".
"Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape," senior sergeant Castledine said.
Championship football player Ben Cousins offers an unforgettable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove his car into the ditch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but inspired locals to humorously plan a Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody claims stewards tried to spy on him and threatens to end racing
Peter Moody claims that stewards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in their stables last year and threatened to end the race immediately.
He targeted Racing Victoria’s stewards and integrity department, claiming they were conducting a personal campaign against him with Lady Tatai’s late scratching over a race day treatment, the last straw on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he’s always tried to do what’s best for racing and he’s found himself in tough conditions when it came to the positive cobalt swab sample at Lidaris that he can’t explain.
He had held back for 18 months for the espionage allegations and did not want it to “look like grapes hanging too high.”
“I was going to say nothing about it, and I’ve been sitting on it for a long time, but sometimes you’re so frustrated that everything comes out at once,” Moody said.
You know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'm gonna go home tonight and get a good night's sleep.
I want to walk with raised heads, and I want my owners to think that I am trying my best for them.
If they start to think I’m not doing that, then I shouldn’t be a coach anymore.
I have to think about what to do with my license.
In an interview with racing.com, Moody said the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable.
"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown, and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - who I'll name if I'm asked - and offered him a job in my stables to provide information about what I'm doing inside my stables," Moody said on Racing.com.
You seem to think I'm a fraud.
If that's the case, they should certainly grasp their noses because they failed in trying to grasp me.
Robert Roulston, former Chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, current President of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, were and are aware of this at the time.
Should that make me think it’s going to be personal?
Has the RVL behaved cowardly and perhaps blamed people outside coaches for what is going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I so bad for the industry?
Maybe people out there think it's me.
Maybe they'll have to take my license and violate me, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying will make them think about it now.
But I’ve come to the point where I don’t care, and that makes me sad.
That really makes me sad.
I will put pressure on them and push them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The coach's frustration levels have built up with the long-running cobalt investigation at Lidari, and the late scratching led him to say that he could "throw his license over the table."
Moody, best known for his preparation of the unbeaten champion Black Caviar, called the race day treatment rule "ridiculous" after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse's legs, which violated the rules.
“It’s against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for that," he said.
"One of my employees mistakenly applied mud to the leg.
It could have been that way last night.
Yesterday could have been the whole day, whatever it was.
But it was the same on race day.
Moody could face a three-month disqualification for treatment with the pack on race day. An investigation into this matter has been opened.
It's a joke.
People who set these rules know nothing about the horse.
“We all see that we need rules, but we’ve gone too far here,” Moody said.
Man Arrested After Driver’s Escape
Police arrested a man on weekend after a collision with a cyclist and subsequent driver's escape in Cobram.
The cyclist was taken by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Murray Valley highway.
Police said the driver continued driving without stopping to help the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia approached the police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with driving and failing to provide assistance and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in hospital in stable condition.
Melbourne storm coach Craig Bellamy strikes back against rivals for allegations of wrestling
Melbourne storm coach Craig Bellamy has described criticism of tackling his players as an "agenda setting" of two NRL Premier League favorites.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referees allowed Storm players to "ring fight" with his team during the high storm win in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a barely concealed remark on the Storm team after his team scored the final victory against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, calling the game a "pattern example" of the Rugby League, saying the two from Queensland were not "too good" in the wrestling.
Bellamy defended his team's tackle and said they were focused on their "contact" when tackling.
Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading coaches on his team is confident he does, as it means they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team.
"This keeps coming up - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when they beat us 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven’t changed anything about our defensive system or techniques throughout the year, but over the last six weeks, we’ve made our contact at Tackles a real focus, and that has turned the trend for us.
Trent has been there for three years now, and he obviously has a great team to train, so he’s probably not used to losing, so it was a bit of a shock for him.
It’s funny how this happens again and again at this time of year.
Bellamy attacked Bennett's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennett's St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "boring" football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He compared his game on Saturday night to ours on Friday night and how exciting their game was," Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010, St George was criticized as a boring team, and Wayne said he's going to take care of it.
But now he has a team that can play and we see it as exciting, especially his young players with their speed.
That’s the ball game you want to play when you have that kind of players.
He made that statement in 2010, now he wants all his kind of football to play - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play like this.
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried about having to play against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn’t think of us when it came to big games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game Storm vs. Roosters scored a higher score than the game Broncos vs. Cowboys.
The Broncos' game was probably a good game, I haven't watched it yet, but what was the result? 16:12 ?
Our game was 20:18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is this an exciting game?
Or are breaks and no points something exciting?
For me, it's the schedules.
If they mention us, it means that we will still meet them at some point.
The Storm team is free this weekend as they have won the right to receive either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks in the preliminary finals next Saturday evening at AAMI Park. Ticket sales start next Tuesday morning.
Serbian with $200,000 bail after drug charges
A man who may face a life sentence for attempting to acquire 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled into Queensland has been released on a $200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of the five men arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Solay, which came from South America via Vanuatu and landed in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was seen meeting his fellow defendants at the marina during the morning and later at Café Coomera Roadhouse, where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo.
Despite a potential life sentence for attempting to own a commercial amount of cocaine, Maksimovic’s lawyer argued that there was no evidence that he was attempting to own the entire amount and that the cafe might have been for a harmless reason.
The judge at the Supreme Court, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the danger of escape at Maksimovic.
He has clear relations with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia,” he told the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal case, he lied to the police about his whereabouts.
Maksimovic’s mother and stepfather had jointly offered a $200,000 bail as security to secure his release.
"After reading the affidavits of the two individuals, it is clear that the requirement of a $200,000 security is a real financial burden," Flanagan said.
But that alone will not be enough to stop him from appearing, he warned.
Maksimovic was released on bail, subject to the conditions that he would hand over his Australian and Serbian passports, report to the police daily, and comply with a curfew from 18:00 to 06:00.
Accident on A5 near Karlsruhe: driver's cab tears apart
In a collision with three trucks on the highway 5 near Karlsruhe, a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening.
Two of the three trucks involved had braked in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel.
The third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to turn left at the last moment, the police said.
The driver's cab of the cause of the accident was completely torn apart.
The driver was taken to a hospital seriously injured.
The A5 between Bruchsal and Karlsruhe-Nord was completely closed for over six hours until 2 o’clock.
The damage amounted to 122,000 euros.
Stevan Hogg Used Girls' Phone to Entice Pedophiles to Send Pictures
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to request pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl’s phone as it slept, logged into an online messaging service from which he received a series of indecent pictures of children sent to him by another user.
The girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping hogg.
She looked through it, found the confusing reports and immediately alerted her mother.
The police took care of it and looked at the five images, then analyzed computers found under the address and discovered "concerning" web searches that used terms to search for indecent images of children.
Hogg then claimed to the officials that he had done it, as it would lead to "pedophiles on the Internet" and he then "falsified to be a police officer to scare them."
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court: “He said it was an addiction—that he was addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that the searches on the computer were carried out by him, but said it happened because he wanted to claim to be a police officer to scare pedophiles.
He was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos.
He said he did it to lure her.
He said he was ill in the head when he drank, and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Ms. Robertson added: “When the girl found the messages on the phone, she called her mother and was trembling and crying.
She then also saw the indecent pictures on the phone and confronted the defendant with them.
The girl was interviewed and said that the defendant used computers and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, declared himself guilty in the sense of the indictment of taking indecent pictures of children on June 14 last year, violating the conditions on January 25 of this year and not appearing in court for a hearing on March 24 of this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not appear in the register of sexual offenders, as one could argue that “no significant sexual element” could be found in his offense.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the verdict until October to get background reports on social work.
Hogg was given bail in this case, but was held in custody for hearings on other pending cases.
He was added to the list of sexual offenders before the date of the verdict.
Smugglers flee small border crossings to Germany
More and more refugees are being taken away from the large checkpoints at the German-Austrian border.
Many smugglers, out of fear of discovery and arrest, left people more and more at smaller border crossings.
on the Austrian side, said a spokesman for the Federal Police.
Along the border river Inn, more than 1,000 refugees have been taken up in the districts of Passau and Rottal-Inn since Tuesday.
They had reached the German side on foot via bridges and dams.
There they are received by federal police officers and forwarded for registration.
According to federal police data, there were significantly more refugees arriving at Munich Central Station on Wednesday compared to the beginning of the week.
By 8 a.m. alone, about 700 people had arrived in the state capital, a spokesman said in the morning.
After the reintroduction of controls at the German-Austrian border, 1759 refugees had reached the city on Tuesday.
Stuttgart: Expected foothills of tropical storm "Henry" in the southwest
Meteorologists warn of storm surges in the southwest on Wednesday afternoon.
Due to a low pressure area over Western Europe, warm sea air is currently flowing into the country, the German Weather Service (DWD) in Stuttgart said.
The strong low is the foothill of the tropical storm "Henry", which has been pulled over the Atlantic Ocean from the Bermuda Islands in recent days.
Heavy storms and thunderstorms are expected especially in Baden.
According to the DWD, gusts of 60 to 90 kilometres per hour can also be expected in the Black Forest, the Swabian Alb and the Lake Constance Circle until Thursday morning.
On Friday you can see the sun again for longer.
Every two years, the car manufacturers showcase their innovations at the IAA.
In 2015, the compact cars, which are currently selling particularly well, were the main drivers.
Cars from the compact class are currently in particular demand: According to the Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA), around 28.1 percent of new registrations were made in this segment in August alone.
This is also reflected at the IAA (Public Days 17 to 27 September).
Among all the futuristic concept cars and new premium and luxury cars, many new compact models will be presented this year.
One of the biggest debuts for the German automotive industry is the Opel Astra, which will be at the dealerships in the autumn.
"The Astra is an extremely important model for us," Opel CEO Karl-Thomas Neumann said at the fair.
It is part of the core of the brand.
In order for the volume model to sell well, the new Astra should not be much more expensive.
Opel is looking forward to a start below its biggest competitor, VW Golf, which starts at 17,650 euros.
The current Astra costs from 16 990 euros.
The Astra is available with a new 1.4-litre engine with 74 kW/100 hp.
In addition, Hesse offers additional diesel and petrol engines from 70 kW/95 hp to 147 kW//200 hp, including three-cylinder petrol engines for the first time.
Unlike the main competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus, the Opel Astra is initially only available as a five-door car.
The second variant will be the Kombi in spring, which can also be seen at the IAA.
And besides the Astra, what else is going on about new compact cars at the IAA?
Renault Mégane: Renault is sending the fourth generation of its Astra competitor Mégane into the race.
At the show, the Mégane can only be seen as a five-door car in a conventional and an emphatically sporty GT version.
It will be sold at the beginning of next year, then as a station wagon.
Infiniti: New in the segment is the Infiniti Q30.
The Nissan branch wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model.
With its curved lines, the compact Infiniti fully fits into the brand’s design line.
The base model will have a gasoline engine with a power of at least 90 kW/122 hp.
There is also a diesel with 80 kW/109 hp or 125 kW/170 hp on offer.
Suzuki Baleno: New in the segment is also the Suzuki Baleno, which is celebrating its world premiere in Frankfurt.
The model is offered with petrol engines, including a newly developed 1.0-litre turbo engine and a power of 82 kW/111 hp.
According to the manufacturer, the maximum torque is 170 Newton meters (Nm).
The sale of the Baleno in Europe starts in spring 2016.
DS 4: Not entirely new, but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4, which can be seen at the IAA.
Outside, the designers of the noble Citro<0xC3><0xAB>n branch placed their hands on the front: Here, the radiator grille was re-drawn and the modified headlights were equipped with LED technology.
In the interior, the infotainment system has been modernised, the number of buttons has been reduced by a touchscreen and Apple’s CarPlay has been integrated for the first time.
In addition, a number of revisions and new variants such as the refreshed Mercedes A-Class or the Peugeot 308 GTI will be added to the IAA in the compact class.
JVA Berlin-Tegel: Five square meters of cell are inhumane
The Federal Constitutional Court has given justice to an ex-detainee of the Tegel penitentiary, who had been confined in a cell that was too small for months.
Because of the violation of their human dignity, prisoners are generally entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in too small cells.
This was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday.
According to the judges, those affected can hope for money even if they were confined in the confined rooms for only a few days (Az.: 1 BvR 1127/14).
Thus, a former prisoner was successful with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe: He was housed in the Berlin-Tegel prison between June and November 2009 in a single cell with about five square meters of floor space; the toilet was not separated.
Afterwards, the man, who according to his lawyer is now free again, had been transferred to a larger cell.
His imprisonment lawsuit for the unworthy conditions against the state of Berlin failed.
However, the constitutional judges overturned the ruling of the Berlin Chamber Court and dismissed the case for re-examination.
You see the human dignity of the man violated.
The Court of Appeals now decides on the amount of compensation
Even if, for legal reasons, only a few days of imprisonment were decisive for the compensation, there was a claim for compensation.
Otherwise, “a deterioration of the legal protection of the personality would be to be feared.”
The Court of Appeal must now clarify the amount of the money compensation.
In the past, constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners.
In April, they paid damages to a prisoner who was naked in a cell.
According to a 2011 decision, the multiple occupancy of a cell without a separate toilet is also unworthy.
Karlsruhe also confirmed on Wednesday the Berlin Constitutional Court, which in a parallel case in November 2009 had certified an inhumane accommodation to a detainee.
The plaintiff at the time was housed for three months every day between 15 to 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karlsruhe case.
Berlin prisons have also made headlines in recent weeks due to lack of staff.
Prisoners are therefore locked up again and again for 23 hours, the aggressiveness increases, even in fights it is said to have already come because of the tense situation.
According to the justice press office, 21 jobs in Tegel are not filled due to a shortage of young talent, and 19 are to be eliminated in 2016.
Angela Merkel and refugee policy: "We can do this"
Immigration of refugees is a huge challenge – the Chancellor is determined to accept it.
What is coming to Germany?
According to forecasts by the Federal Ministry of the Interior, around 800,000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year, and according to Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), Germany is even able to accept one million refugees.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: we can do this, and we can do this."
What comes to Germany is given in the following overview.
According to different forecasts, between 350000 (estimated by the Federal Ministry of Construction) and 400000 (estimated by the Pestel Institute) apartments are used annually - for the next five years.
This is almost twice as much as is currently being built (250,000 apartments).
Dramatic is the lack of housing, but especially in affordable rental properties: Every year 60000 to 80000 social housing falls out of the rental price, and these particularly cheap apartments will also apply for refugees.
Federal Minister of Construction Barbara Hendricks (SPD) therefore wants to double the funding, from currently 518 million to one billion euros.
This is far too little from the point of view of the Pestel Institute: 80,000 social housing would have to be created annually and the Federal Government would have to invest a grant of 6.4 billion per year.
Scientists and the Federal Minister for Construction agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investments in housing.
According to estimates by the Institute for Labour Market and Vocational Research, 55 percent of refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term.
However, refugees in Germany are not systematically asked for their qualifications to help them get started, criticises Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education at the Bertelsmann Foundation.
For the integration of refugees, however, it is crucial whether they can find work in Germany.
Work is the key for social contacts, for the appreciation in the host society, but also for the self-esteem of immigrants, says migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt.
According to Thränhardt, there has been a political change in Germany: from the ban on working for refugees to the recognition of work.
While there used to be a ban on working for asylum seekers of up to five years, in November 2014 it was reduced to three months, as well as the residence obligation, which restricts asylum seekers to a place of residence.
In society, the majority of people have adopted the view that refugees should be given access to the labour market faster, also because of the shortage of skilled workers.
A major obstacle to access to the labour market is a lack of knowledge of German.
So far, there is not a sufficient range of general and occupational language courses.
Studies also show that jobs are most often mediated through personal contacts.
According to Thränhardt, the establishment of networks is therefore the king’s path towards labour integration.
The Berlin school administration has found that only a few refugee parents leave their children in kindergartens, an estimated 10 to 15 percent: "For the uprooted parents, it is very important to keep the family together," says Ilja Koschembar, spokesperson for youth and family at the Berlin Senate administration.
In order to convince the family of the benefits of daycare, the administration distributes handouts in different languages.
Should the demand for female educators increase considerably due to the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacities – for example by allowing more specialist schools.
In the countries, pupils without German skills are prepared for classes in welcome classes.
However, they are not always taught by fully trained teachers, but, as in Berlin, also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language.
There is no shortage of them, says Beate Stoffers from the Berlin school administration.
The German Student Union estimates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany.
In principle, no federal state prohibits asylum seekers or patient students from studying - the only exception so far has been Berlin, but interior senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now abandoned his position.
Refugees willing to study could be facilitated access to higher education.
Refugees with a residence permit or toleration no longer receive benefits under the Asylum Benefits Act if they start studying.
The latter generally do not get a bafög, as they do not fall under the circle of persons entitled to bafög.
Patient refugees had to live in Germany for four years to be eligible for Bafög, from 1 January 2016 this span will be shortened to 15 months.
But this funding gap must also be closed, demand Steffen Krach, Berlin’s State Secretary for Science, and the Deutsche Studentenwerk.
Students should get bafög immediately.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, as many refugees are Muslims, and for many, religion is an important part of their identity.
The state should gradually grant Islam the same rights as the churches have, and develop the existing state-church right into a new state-religion relationship.
It would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare association that takes care of the new arrivals professionally.
Rights also include duties.
Thus, the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contacts and be willing to cooperate with the state in many areas and give it certain control options.
This includes the willingness to take courageous action against religious fundamentalism.
The chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be carried into Germany.
“Those who wanted to host such conflicts in Germany immediately lost their right to live here, in Germany,” he told the Bavarian Radio.
He suggested translating the Constitution into Arabic.
In the future, integration will be an issue for the whole society much more than it is today.
This will also change the majority society, the reduction of discrimination and racism becomes more pressing.
As a result of European decisions, Germany has had an anti-discrimination body and a general equality law for almost a decade.
But it is learning very slowly, as the NSU murder series showed, in which police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
Equal opportunities for all: What migrant organizations and non-white German stakeholders have long demanded and what international agreements such as the Anti-Rassism Convention oblige Germany to do, must become a reality in the coming years if the country is to remain peaceful and its new citizens use their opportunities - for the benefit of all.
In general, Germany is able to provide medical care for the previously expected refugees, says medical president Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
“As far as man-power and capacities are concerned, we can do that,” he told the Tagesspiegel.
However, additional money has to be invested in the system.
In order to avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery calls for health cards to be handed out to all arrivals immediately upon registration.
Services rendered could later be settled with the federal states.
And in the long term, it is highly questionable to dine off so many people with the limited service catalog provided for in the Asylum Applicant Benefits Act.
Otherwise, the doctors above all create the language barriers.
The Berlin-based health scientist Thea Borde has already proven that migrants are less well-informed about their diseases than other patients.
Not only in clinics, but also in medical practices, interpreter costs would have to be borne, she demands.
However, many refugees would already be helped with more general medical contact points in the emergency ambulances.
And with a different diagnostic view.
Among refugee children, for example, there are significantly more untreated disabilities, and among young people it is about HIV education.
However, with the sometimes other disease pictures, German doctors would be clear from their training, says Montgomery.
"Parasite infestations or tuberculosis are not so difficult to detect", and as for the lack of doctors, the refugees may even have relief in sight.
The Syrians have a highly developed education system, many refugees are even doctors.
However, in order to be able to practice, they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take examinations again.
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill, according to estimates of the Federal Psychotherapist Chamber (BPtK): most suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.
Refugee children are particularly vulnerable, explains Dietrich Munz, president of the BPtK.
A recent study by the Technical University of Munich shows that one in five Syrian refugee children arrive in Germany traumatized.
Anyone who has a post-traumatic stress disorder suffers, among other things, from so-called flashbacks with shortness of breath, dizziness, heart rate and fear of death.
Other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders, severe dreadfulness and emotional deafness.
To prevent the symptoms from becoming chronic, early treatment is necessary, Munz explained.
So far, however, only 4% of mentally ill refugees are receiving psychotherapy.
Although mentally ill asylum seekers can apply for psychotherapy in the social offices, the treatment usually takes several months.
In addition, in the social offices, specialists or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses would usually decide whether therapy is necessary or not.
This often leads to misjudgments, Munz says.
Manege invites you to dream
With the new production "Passion", the Circus Probst draws on the traditions of circus art.
The goal is to captivate every age group with fascinating acrobatics, animal dressage and unique entertainment.
Now the Circus Probst invites you to dream in the mansion on the brick wash.
“Our passion is the circus.”
"I can't imagine living without my circus family," says Stephanie Probst, animal teacher and junior chief.
"Passion" - under this motto is the current riding staging.
The circus has been in the hands of the Probst family for more than 33 years.
The gift of enthusiasm lies in the blood of the family.
"It is important to us to take people away from their daily routine and take them to a completely different world for two hours," the 27-year-old junior director emphasizes.
"Mountain cocktail with a cosmopolitan flair", so Director Reinhard Probst calls his concept.
50 cities on the almost 3,000-kilometre tour can now experience this flair.
The program of the circus convinces with talented artists from all over the world.
Awarded at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family captivates the audience with wit and charm.
The Castillo Brothers also understand their craft.
With the heroes of the silent films, it wants to take the Cuban duo loosely.
Lightness and agility - with these words they identify themselves.
Her humorous art at the mast is to conquer women's hearts by storm.
In addition to numerous salmon ointments, the acrobatics of the Circus Probst also fascinate with tact and flexibility.
Balancing with the unicycle on a ball?
No problem for He Yuan.
Serpents are fascinated and frightened at the same time.
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics like few others and fascinated by its agility.
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every way.
"The animals belong to our family," emphasizes Stephanie's mother, Brigitte Probst.
All too often, abuses in the keeping of circus animals are the subject of various animal welfare organizations.
Stephanie Probst also comments: "If our animals are not doing well, we are not doing well either".
Around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each caress.
The "four-legged artists", as they are affectionately called, will read every wish from the eyes if possible.
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.
If the animal does not feel comfortable, it does not want to go to the manege.
The main thing is to take good care of the animals.
Especially on their zebroid Jumbo, a mixture of a Shetland Pony stallion and a zebra mare, the Probst family is proud.
The two animals lived together in an enclosure for eight years and nothing happened.
"But then, suddenly, our little Jumbo was there," says Brigitte Probst.
The zebroid is not yet ready for the manege, but it is the unique mascot of the Circus Probst.
There should be something for every visitor.
"One thing is for sure," says Stephanie Probst: "No matter if it's five or 1,200 spectators, we always do our best and are there with all our heart."
The Circus Probst invites to its performances every day from 17 to 20 September at 5 pm and 8 pm.
On Sunday the program starts at 11 am and 4 pm.
Thursday is Family Day, for the performance at 5 pm the prices are reduced.
In addition, the animal show is open daily from 10 am to 6 pm.
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe makes false speech in parliament
Mr. Mugabe, Africa’s oldest leader, fell down the stairs from a podium earlier this year.
He remained unharmed, but the video of the case quickly spread through social media.
The opening of the parliament was also clouded by claims by opposition MPs that they had received anonymous death threats and were warned not to accompany Mr Mugabe’s speech with booze calls.
Last month, they had been busting him and interrupting him during his speech on the state of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) spokesman Innocent Gonese said seven opposition politicians received text messages on their phones warning them not to disrupt Mr. Mugabe’s speech.
"The message comes from a number that is not displayed, but it has the title 'death'," he told journalists after Mugabe's speech.
It warns the Members of Parliament concerned that the immunity in Parliament ends, and as soon as they leave Parliament, their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective.
The chief spokesman said the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai was "concerned" about the dangers to the politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to cut up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of the company’s restructuring and savings efforts.
HP will split into two listed companies later this year, separating the computer and printer business from its fast-growing corporate hardware and service business.
The expected job cuts will result in a burden of over $2.7 billion as of the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
“These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett-Packard enterprise,” said Meg Whitman, HP Chairman and Chief Executive, who will lead the unit after the separation.
“Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today, and we have a broad and in-depth portfolio of businesses to help businesses transition to a new style of business,” said Whitman.
As an independent company, we are better positioned than ever to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $50 billion in annual revenue and “will be focused on delivering unprecedented, integrated technology solutions to businesses,” the company said in a statement.
It splits a company that was founded in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to manufacture electrical equipment and whose Palo Alto garage has been called "the birthplace of Silicon Valley."
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to cope with the shift from traditional PCs to mobile devices.
HP, the world’s second-largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies, is the latest in the field, based on the belief that closely-focused companies are performing better.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says teammates must stand behind injured Jack Wilshere before the match against Dynamo Zagreb
Wenger stressed to Wilshere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan, there is no reason why he could not play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere is sure to miss at least the next four games for England and given his history, his participation in the European Championship next summer is certainly still uncertain.
The big shame with this current problem is that Wilshere had severely ended the last season after a separate ankle injury and then returned to his old swing during the pre-season.
"This type of injury does not threaten the career," Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal well.
That's not a big deal.
This was just an accident.
It was not related to his ankles or to the injuries he had before.
This may be true from a purely medical point of view, but as Wenger also acknowledged, there is the associated risk of further injuries whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
It also develops an unpleasant pattern.
Premier Injuries Ltd’s investigation has recorded 23 different Wilshere diseases since its debut six years ago.
He also played in only 65 of Arsenal's 157 league matches in the last five seasons.
The broader picture for Arsenal is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs with the most injury days in six out of eight seasons since 2007/08.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes an improvement in the injury rate will continue during the last season.
"Sometimes when you come back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain combat power," Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to overcome this.
I hope his body stabilizes, I’m confident he’ll do it and he’ll go through a career of the kind he deserves.
Arsenal begins its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Dinamo Zagreb before the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday, and Wenger is set to rotate within the team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are expected to start.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and give the players who need it a little respite," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal are clear favorites to progress through Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playgrounds with the greatest intimidation effect in Europe.
Dynamo is also unbeaten after 41 games after the "invincible" campaign launched last season.
The stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening, with measurements of 3.2 on the Richter scale.
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has learned the lessons from last season’s Champions League capitulation against Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope of leading the club to its first European Cup triumph with its management.
"This drive is immense," Wenger said.
It has never worked at Arsenal.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand, I’ve been in business long enough to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: the comedy show that gives us serious lessons about men's friendships
The absence of similar representations in shows is obvious, especially in terms of how the need for men to open up has now become even more desperate than ever before, as suicide rates among young men at a 15-year high prove.
In 2013, it was the leading cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and it remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced 2015 as the Year of the Man, with the goal of challenging the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms found that if the sufferer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "healthy mood", his chances of recovery doubled.
For those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halves the risks of mental problems.
But of course, you first have to have friends so that a friendship can work.
In the age of social media communication, with its emphasis on style over substance, the immediacy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, lively and successful, even if in reality isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of intrinsic values – our inner longing for personal development and friendship, which affects our mental health much more deeply.
And as a video game inventor and billionaire recently explained, money really can’t buy happiness.
The nice thing about Friends was that this focus was turned upside down.
Each character was defined not by his work, but by his personality, which shined through the interaction as a friend.
The humor of Joey and Chandler’s frequent hugs, moments of football watching in cozy armchairs, and Ross’s longing for Rachel – all this came from knowing that men can relate to it in any case, even if they often reluctant to fully explore their feelings.
As a telephone chaplain told me, "my listening role for people who feel depressed and at risk of suicide really showed me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference."
The men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends.
The old saying "I get along with it" has a tremendous effect, such as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness when you talk about problems openly."
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer more long-term coping mechanisms.
It clearly presents the small moments of men’s friendships.
As much as my objective outsider status over the phone may help people in moments of despair, the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so, if you’re visiting Comedy Central FriendsFest this weekend with the completely redesigned backdrop to celebrate the day, why not take your friends with you for a drink at Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone sitting around at Starbucks alone, give him a smile and say hello.
You never know what a difference your friendship could make.
Friends is broadcast on Comedy Central from start to finish - the total of 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria meets to help PSG crush Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his hit against Malmö.
Di Maria meets at his Champions League debut on Tuesday and helps PSG to pass Malmö.
Here is the game report and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on course when Paris Saint-Germain started their Champions League season with a very comfortable 2-0 win against Malmö at Prinzenparkstadion on Tuesday.
Di Maria hit less than four minutes after starting his Champions League debut as a PSG player, putting the French champion on the road, but after that they missed a number of opportunities before finally increasing their lead when Cavani scored a headball goal in the 61st minute.
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donetsk also in Group A, Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champions, as they not only aim to qualify for the knockout rounds, but an improvement on the way to the quarterfinals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, it was not a class game of Laurent Blanc's team with Zlatan Ibrahimovics missed chances before the goal. He was later replaced in the game against his hometown team and against the club with which he started his illustrious career as early as 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League, so it's a good start to win 2-0, cause problems to our opponents and look back relaxed, even if there are certain things we still have to perfect over the course of the season," Blanc said.
“This is a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, even though I regret not scoring one or two more goals."
Ibrahimovic returned to the Paris team after his injury in one of three changes, which allowed him to hold a 2-2 draw on his own spot against Bordeaux in the First League on the weekend, but he was punched out in the fourth minute by Di Maria.
The Argentine winger was referred to as the man who can take PSG to the next level in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United last month, and he hinted at why when he walked into Marco Verratti’s pass behind the Malmö defense before finishing beautifully past Johan Wiland in the long corner of the net.
However, if anyone believed that PSG would score a big victory, they were disappointed.
Malmö, who beat Celtic in a play-off to reach this level, competed at Anpiff with nine internationals on the field and was a heavy opponent with a five-man defense and two ranked deep in the midfield.
But apart from a shot from Nikola Djurdjic, who passed far past Kevin Trapp's post in the 34th minute, they offered little in the attack.
Instead, PSG sometimes gave up on itself, with some mispasses and bad finishes, not least from Ibrahimovic, who patted in the first half alone in no less than five attempts and then gave up after Cavani deployed him after restarting.
Nevertheless, he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic that Di Maria turned into a spin shot that was steered by Wiland past the post in the 52nd minute ...
The second goal finally fell shortly after the hour mark thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan scoring his sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic had fished up a left flank of Maxwell.
This ended all thoughts of Malmö coming back into the game, and only an excellent intervention from Wiland from a short distance to stop David Luiz could keep the final result low before substitute Ezequiel Lavezzi was denied a goal at the end.
The coach of Malmö, Age Hareide, later admitted that PSG played a class over his team, and the Norwegian said, "Our last Champions League game was in December last year.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, which does not have the same level.
Qualifying matches are not enough.”
Hat off to Paris!
It was a great game from them!
Glencore raises $2.5 billion through share sales
Swiss-based mining giant Glencore, affected by collapsed commodity prices, raised $2.5 billion through a stock sale on Wednesday as part of its huge debt repayment plan.
London-registered company Glencore said in a statement that it has sold new shares worth approximately <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion to pay off its own debts.
The company, which lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is struggling with falling commodity prices as China’s economic downturn squeezes demand and has a devastating impact on markets.
Issuing subscription rights brought Glencore’s stock price to the top of the London Stock Exchange in early Wednesday morning trading.
The stock jumped 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore announced last week the $2.5 billion stock sale as part of its broader plans to pay off around a third of its $30 billion debt.
The company sold the new holdings at 125 pence per share, representing a 2.4 percent discount on Tuesday’s closing price.
There were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.99 percent of the group.
Concerns about long-term inhibited growth in China have cut iron ore prices by about half, coal, copper and other commodity prices have fallen by 20 to 40 percent.
Refugees arrive in Weimar
On Tuesday at noon, 49 people reach the city council in Weimar after a mostly long flight.
The refugees come from Syria, Albania, Afghanistan, Macedonia and Somalia.
The youngest arrival is a six-month-old girl from Syria.
White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month, the White House confirmed in a statement on Tuesday.
The visit, Xi’s first official in Washington, will take place on September 25, and reciprocates President Barack Obama’s trip to Beijing last November, the statement said.
The US President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan at a state dinner this evening after the two leaders held bilateral talks.
"President Xi's visit will provide an opportunity to expand American-Chinese cooperation on a range of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, while also giving President Obama and President Xi the opportunity to constructively address areas of disagreement," the statement added.
XI, whose visit was initially announced in February, is expected to meet several U.S. technology leaders in Seattle on his way to Washington before moving on to New York City for the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to address a number of controversial issues, including Washington’s concerns regarding China’s alleged cyber espionage and its increasing self-confidence in the controversial waters of the South China Sea.
440 hp sports cars borrowed and driven to scrap
A 29-year-old wanted to fulfill a dream and borrowed a Ford Mustang.
On the wet highway came the evil awakening.
At a company in the county of Gotha, you can fulfil your dream and rent and drive a V8 US sports car Ford Mustang Boss 302 with 440 hp.
So did a 29-year-old from Gotha County.
On the A 71 near Arnstadt, the dream was over.
The 29-year-old lost control of the sports car, got into a swing on wet road and drove into the guardrail.
The sports car suffered total damage, no one was injured.
The property damage is estimated at EUR 40,000.
Xavi: Pep Guardiola prevented move to FC Bayern in 2008
World and European champion Xavi has been playing for the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015.
FC Bayern was obviously close to the commitment of Spain’s superstar Xavi, who played for FC Barcelona at the time, a few years ago.
Eight Spanish champions, three cup winners, four Champions League winners, two club world champions, two European champions, once world champions – Xavi’s title list is breathtaking.
In the summer, the now 35-year-old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar.
But in an interview with Marca, Xavi now reveals that he was already ahead of the Euro 2008 before the farewell from Barcelona.
"I was told that Barça wanted to sell me."
"Madrid won everything back then, we won nothing," he says.
This was also reported by FC Bayern.
Xavi: "There was an offer from Bayern."
"Rummenigge wanted me."
In the summer of 2008, Jürgen Klinsmann took over FC Bayern.
Guardiola was the reason Xavi didn't change
But the change did not happen.
And the decisive man for this today works for the German record champion: Pep Guardiola.
Xavi explains why: "Barça signed Guardiola and I played a great EM."
"Pep told me that I wouldn't change, that he couldn't imagine the team without me."
"He's got me."
Who knows how Bayern’s 2008/2009 season would have been with Xavi.
Xavi stood for Barca in the quarter-finals of the Champions League against Bayern over the entire distance on the lawn, knocked out the Reds (4:0, 1:1) and celebrated the royal class triumph in the end.
Matt Damon plays down diversity in filmmaking
Matt Damon confronted African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion about diversity, saying she was not needed behind the scenes.
During a Sunday Night episode of HBO’s Project Greenlight, experienced actor Brown interrupted when it stressed the need for alternative perspectives in relation to a black protagonist in the chosen screenplay of the project.
“When we talk about diversity, you do it when casting the film, not when casting the show,” Damon said.
Brown responded shocked, with insulted disbelief, and shouted "Hoo! Wow. Okay," as the actor's comments from The Martian consolidated.
Damon and Brown joined producer colleagues Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show finalists.
"I would like to encourage people to think about - whoever the director will be - how they treat the character of Harmony," Brown said.
The only black person, and she is a whore who is beaten by her white pimp.
The producer of Dear White People advocated for finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for directing rights to the film; Damon replied that their directing "may end up giving us something we don't want."
After the discussion was broadcast, social media exploded with disapproval of Damon’s comments.
Twitter user Mr. Pooni expressed his anger over the clip by writing, “Matt Damon is talking about the only black person in the room, so he can explain her diversity – this is SO WHITE that it hurts.”
The tweet earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since its release.
Damon’s comments come at a time when accurate racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion.
After teenager Michael Brown was killed by a white policeman in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement made an impact nationwide, urging lawmakers and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against colored people.
In February, singer Prince made an allusion to the movement during the launch of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards.
"Albums still matter," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still have their meaning.
More recently, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement have released a statement in response to Fox News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck’s question of whether the group should be viewed as a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter network is a love group," the leaders said.
Recently, it was announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers, producers and media moguls invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope is unclear.
American Ninja Warrior crowns first champion
Professional sports climber and accessibility Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday evening and took home the $1 million Grand Prix.
The competition show, which ended its seventh season, had never seen a competitor complete all the stages of its obstacle course.
During the season finale, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, made it to the final.
The last task included climbing a 75-foot-long climbing rope in 30 seconds.
Britten finished the challenge in time, becoming the first athlete to complete the strenuous Phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior, but Caldiero finished the challenge three seconds faster, making him the winner.
Caldiero spoke to E!News after the hard-won win, still under shock over winning the $1 million grand prize.
"I mean, it's amazing to think about it, I've never earned or had more than $10,000 to live on," Isaac E! said about his pile of money.
All of a sudden .. like I can't even imagine how that is... the future is unknown.
Lead producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the finale and why Britten, although he was the first to finish the course, did not receive any prize money.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
"If there's more than one finalist, the one with the fastest time gets it," Weed said.
How much money is a wonderful prize and changes life, he gets the great gratification.
I don't think he has any resentment about it.
He's just so happy to have done what he did.
Masses of awards he received from fans.
He's such a great guy and a family father.
He is a hero for his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If I should be beaten by someone, then I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have felt the same way if they had swapped roles.
America Ninja Warrior has been extended for an eighth season, shooting will begin in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers sneak past Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS--The second half of the season was not particularly fun for the Detroit Tigers.
Once they were one of the best teams in baseball, today the Tigers are in the final place in the American League Central.
The Tigers are reduced to their role as spoilers, but played this part perfectly against the Minnesota Twins on Tuesday with 5-4 at Target Field.
The Twins wasted a chance to rise within a game-half of the Houston Astros for the second American League wildcard spot.
For Detroit, if only for an evening, it was a return of the three-letter F-word that was so hard to grasp over much of the second half of the season.
"All wins are fun no matter how it comes," said Tigers manager Brad Ausmus.
Tiger pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) hit 6 times in the 1/3 innings and allowed three runs.
It was only his third successful start in his last nine games.
"I want to finish this year strong," Simon said.
It’s hard to throw every game in the bullpen, so I want to go into the game very concentrated.
The designated Tiger hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three-hit game since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He has swung the punchwood well," Ausmus said.
He looked good at (stroke training), looked much better in the bullpen, and he brought it straight into the game.
With three runs behind at the end of the seventh inning, the Twins had their best chance of getting back into the game.
Center Fielder Byron Buxton finished the inning with a double on the left field line.
Right Fielder Aaron Hicks reached a colorful, and Simon brought his second baseman Brian Dozier to strikeout before being replaced by left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy survived Mauer, the only man he was confronted with, in front of the designated rookie beatman Miguel Sano, who ripped right-handed Drew Verhagen a two-run.
With a pair of runners and the final run at the second, Verhagen brought the third baseman Trevor Plouffe to a double play.
It was the 27th time in the Major League this season that Plouffe beat a double play.
After Detroit added an insurance run at the end of the ninth inning, Mauer scored an RBI double against the Tigers' closer Bruce Rondon and scored 5-4.
The right-hander, however, punched Sano on three pitches for his fifth save.
Detroit benefited at the start of the game from an unmovable Phil Hughes.
The Tigers scored three runs in the first two innings against the right-handed veteran, who had been removed from the injured list prior to the game after missing for more than a month due to a back injury.
“Obviously not the start I wished for,” Hughes said, “but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would make some pretty good pitches there in the third inning.”
After receiving the leadoff in the first batter, Hushes released a single to Second Baseman Ian Kinsler.
A two-out walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez into the game, who achieved a single "up the middle" on the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez made his 0-21 success with the runners in the scoring position.
Third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single on the right, creating another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game as he tried to get to the third, ending the threat.
The Tigers added in second, scoring a one-out double from catcher James McCann and a two-out single from center fielder Anthony Gose to 3-0.
"That was a big blow," said Twins manager Paul Molitor.
He didn't hit very well, but he caught the right spot.
Hughes was in a pitch count, scoring no points in the third inning before being replaced by the relief right-hander A.J.Achter.
Hughes scored three runs with six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
NOTES: Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez retired due to an injury to the throwing shoulder.
He is examined by Dr. James Andrews, who operated on Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez, who has been on the injured list since mid-August for a shoulder strain, is scheduled to be activated for the launch on Wednesday.
With Sanchez out of the game, LHP Daniel Morris will be removed from the injured list to start against the Twins.
Norris 1-1 on four Tigers starts since he was acquired in exchange for LHP David Price on July 30
He has been missing since August 20 due to a strain in the right hip joint.
The Tigers and Twins will end their series of three games at Target Field on Wednesday
Norris (2-2,4.43 ERA) will play against Minnesota's RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73)
Hundreds of refugees in Wiesbaden
A train with hundreds of refugees is on its way to Hesse.
His arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday.
The people travelling there will then be accommodated in emergency shelters in Wiesbaden, as the city of Wiesbaden announced on Tuesday evening.
It was estimated that 450 to 750 refugees were arriving.
Several sports halls of the Hessian state capital had been prepared for this case in the past few days.
Up to 1,000 refugees can temporarily stay there.
They will then be distributed to other municipalities.
In the last ten days alone, according to the government presidium responsible for the initial reception of Giessen, 7500 people had arrived in Hesse.
Frankfurt and Hanau have also set up emergency shelters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees.
Ischinger: German military measures in Syria an option
The head of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, considers military measures with German participation in Syria to be a possibility.
"I believe that the decisive reflection on military options of action should not take place without Germany," he said.
He accused European states of "collective looking away".
Four years ago, people were glad that the chalice of military involvement in Germany had passed.
"Now the conflict is crushingly on our doorstep," he told Deutschlandfunk.
The former German ambassador to Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid on the ground for the refugees.
Austria controls its southern and eastern borders
After Germany, Austria has also reintroduced controls at its southern and eastern borders.
Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner said on Tuesday evening on the Austrian television channel ORF that no one will be sent back to Hungary.
Germany has not sent any refugees back to Austria.
"No, that's agreed," she said.
On the question of an agreement according to which Germany could accommodate a certain number of refugees from Austria per day, Mikl-Leitner said that there had already been talks on this subject between the Director-General for Public Security and representatives of Germany.
She did not mention concrete numbers and referred to talks on Wednesday in Berlin.
In recent days, tens of thousands of refugees have come from Hungary to Austria via the so-called Balkan route.
Their destination is mostly Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian colleague Werner Faymann, together with several other EU heads of state and government, applied for a special summit for next week.
Germany had started temporary border controls on Sunday.
The EU countries have so far not been able to agree on a common approach to the crisis.
The EU interior ministers want to take a new initiative on the binding distribution of a further 120,000 refugees next Tuesday (22 September) at a special meeting.
Given the strong refugee rush in Germany, the federal government wants to support the states more strongly in the initial reception and distribution of people.
The federal government will manage this together with the countries, Merkel announced late Tuesday evening after almost four-hour discussions with the prime ministers at the chancellery in Berlin.
Merkel stressed that those people who need protection would also get it.
However, those who do not have a prospect of staying can not stay in Germany either.
This view was strongly shared in the round.
The Chancellor stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a "huge effort".
Thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route.
Hungary closed its 175-kilometre-long border with Serbia on Tuesday night.
A few hours later, the government in Budapest announced that it would also close the border with Romania with a fence.
This neighbouring country, unlike Serbia, belongs to the EU.
Hungarian foreign minister Peter Szijjarto said that he wanted to prevent traffickers from looking for a way to escape via Romania.
The Romanian government immediately condemned the plan.
There were first arrests of people who had cut the fence.
In Turkey, according to eyewitness reports, thousands more migrants made their way to the Greek border.
"Cassini" spacecraft finds ocean on Saturn's moon Enceladus
Under the ice sheet of Saturn’s moon Enceladus, a global ocean floats.
Researchers conclude this from observations of the spacecraft "Cassini".
Thus, the moon staggers slightly on its orbit around the ring planet.
This turbulent movement is small, but too big for a solid solid body, according to a statement from Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, on Tuesday.
The researchers present their analyses in the journal "Icarus".
For a long time it was known that there must be liquid water under the ice sheet of Enceladus.
For example, Cassini had already discovered ice volcanoes at the south pole of Saturn’s moon in 2006, which spew water vapor and ice particles and thus feed Saturn’s so-called E-ring.
At least at the South Pole there must be an underground sea, the astronomers concluded at the time.
However, the extent of the hidden ocean was not clarified.
Rama missing 1860 Munich several weeks
The 1860 Munich must renounce offensive actor Valdet Rama for about a month.
An investigation has revealed an adductor injury in the 27-year-old, the club said.
Rama had already complained about pain earlier this week.
According to Munich’s Löwen, the diagnosis means “foreseeably four weeks of forced break.”
"It's hard for us, Rama is a terrible loss."
"Of course we have to think now," sports director Necat Aygün told the "Bild" newspaper with a view to the possible commitment of a clubless professional.
As a training guest, however, the sixties initially presented a defensive man.
The 30-year-old Hrvoje Cale was last active in Belgium and was previously under contract with VfL Wolfsburg.
"Croatia currently has the opportunity to prove its skills.
Goalkeeper Rubin Okotie can return to team training next week after his concussion.
The Austrian national player is due to start running training on Thursday.
Okotie had injured his head in the match at Fortuna Düsseldorf (0:3) in a violent collision.
Contrary to initial fears, however, he remained without a serious injury.
No diet fruit - mangos contain a lot of sugar
Mangos are exotic and juicy-sweet.
But whoever wants to pay attention to his slender line is often discouraged by them.
Mangoes contain a relatively high amount of sugar, especially sucrose.
The exotic fruits are still healthy: they contain B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. But above all, mangos contain a lot of vitamin A and its precursor beta-carotene.
Anyone who eats the fruits thus supports vision, immune system and metabolic processes in the body.
When buying, mangos should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleasant.
The shell color alone does not say anything about how ripe the fruit is - so green mangos can also taste very delicious.
They should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days.
Then they taste naturally pure or in sweet foods.
But a mango also gives hearty dishes a special touch.
It softens the slightly bitter taste of some leafy salads such as chicory and radiccio.
And a mango chutney goes well with fish, poultry, lamb and game.
UPS, the U.S. parcel service, is again hiring up to 95,000 helpers for its Christmas business in the United States.
The company has already begun recruiting seasonal workers, UPS said on Tuesday.
In particular, drivers are being sought.
As early as last year, UPS had increased its workforce for the holiday season by 95,000 relief workers.
Given the booming online business, UPS and its competitor FedEx have been making arrangements to be ready for the Christmas business since last year.
In 2013, delayed deliveries had brought harsh criticism to the parcel services.
Föhnsturm first, then striking cold front
In the coming night, the Fön breaks through in the valleys of the Alpine north side, as MeteoSwitzerland announced on Tuesday.
On Wednesday and at night until Thursday, the hair dryer blows partly with storm force through the hair dryer valleys.
After the drying on Thursday morning, a striking cold front crosses us, which brings heavy rainfall, gusts of wind and a temperature drop.
According to MeteoNews, Switzerland is currently at the forefront of an extensive depression over the British Isles in a strong southwest current.
On the north side of the Alps, the hairdryer breaks through the valleys at night on Wednesday.
As a result, the hair dryer blows until Thursday morning in the hair dryer valleys with gusts of 60 to 100 km/h, occasionally and especially in the Urnerland partly at more than 100 km/h.
The hair dryer can penetrate in some places to the adjacent plateau, and on the mountains even hurricanes of more than 120 km / h are possible.
Whilst in the north on Wednesday a stormy hair dryer provides summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees, the moisture on the southern slope of the Alps begins to accumulate.
It is raining until Thursday evening.
Altogether, south of the Alps can be expected to have more than 100 litres of rain per square meter in the next 48 hours, after large amounts of rain have already fallen in the last few days.
On Thursday morning, the hair dryer runs out of air, followed by a cold front with strong, partly violently interspersed rain rolling from west to east over Switzerland.
Together with the cold front, the wind refreshes strongly to stormy, and the temperatures drop significantly.
The following days present themselves in the north with 15 to 20 degrees in autumn, while in the south it gets sunny and warmer on weekends with up to 25 degrees.
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
Nearly 500 years after the Reformation, there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome.
In the presence of City President Ignazio Marino, a previously nameless square in the park on the Oppio Hill was christened on Wednesday in the name of the German reformer.
On the Piazza Martin Lutero he is now recognized as a "German theologian of the Reformation".
The park is located in the middle of ancient Rome, right next to the Colosseum.
The name had been requested by the working group of the Protestant churches in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome, reminded on Wednesday that the Protestants in the City of the Popes for centuries as a minority often could live their faith only in secret.
With the square, it becomes symbolically visible that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) was a young Augustinian monk who spent several months in Rome around the turn of the year 1510/11.
At that time, he saw the city as depraved Babylon.
His negative impressions are likely to have strengthened him in his later struggle against Rome, according to historians.
Luther had then initiated the division of the Western Church with his theses against the indulgence trade.
Hammer Artist invested three years in personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the crown of thorns is one of the main works that Otmar Alt painted for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts.
In the beginning was the word?
No, not with the Otmar-Alt Bible, which has now been published with magnificent pictures.
In the beginning was the picture for Otmar Alt, who formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs.
The 75-year-old has preserved his "language" with colorful colors and imaginative shapes - which is by no means synonymous with "fun" images.
On the contrary: adapted to the respective topics, this can seem quite gloomy.
For about three years, Otmar Alt has worked on his Bible project, for which he has made a subjective-artistic selection from the many topics of the "Book of All Books".
Cycles have emerged that are dedicated to topics such as the Way of the Cross, Plagues, Commandments or Our Father.
He has thus spontaneously fascinated several partners: this applies to the Luther-Verlag with its theological orientation as well as to the Kettler-Verlag with its focus on art books.
And there is above all the author Klaus Altepost, who has dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting.
He has interpreted the passages of the Bible selected by Otmar Alt and thus "translated" into the present day, into current contexts.
These texts are like verbal mirrors of Alt’s painting.
They are embedded between the original biblical quote by Martin Luther and a sentence by the artist, who formulates his very personal thoughts on the respective situation.
The jewellery cover has golden letters.
So the 75-year-old allows double a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.
This is a high level of intimacy.
Emotions were ultimately triggers for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, born in Wernigerode in 1940 and raised in Berlin, comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Lord Hunter Order.
"That's where the upbringing happened before with the cane," Otmar Alt recalls.
"I tried to work this up, perhaps to reconcile myself with the Lord Father."
His second concern is to help art become more important again in fast-moving times: "The perception of picture worlds today is shaped by advertising, and it is loud.
Symbolism is supplanted.
Artists have a different desire and delight to show things.
Pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative.
"In this respect, I am a dinosaur".
Otmar Alt wants the viewers to "fall in" in the pictures, let them act on themselves, discover and feel the power they have: "The image seeks its opposite".
Klaus Altepost confessed on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar Alt Bible at the Otmar Alt Foundation, "always" been a lover of Otmar Alt's art: "I like how he understands life with his pictures".
Alt did not take care to fully comprehend the Bible, but chose the topics that were important to him, even mysterious.
"This was not a collaboration at eye level," says Altepost: "This is about the pictures, the text merely explains".
For Hans Möhler of Luther-Verlag, this work is an invitation to “deepen his life and find freedom”.
Otmar Alt’s pictures speak for Möhler both the (biblical) language of love and that of responsibility.
Part of the originals – paper and canvas paintings – will be presented for the first time in an exhibition, which will open on 15 November at the Otmar-Alt-Stiftung.
Construction begins for BMX railway
Plans were made, space was found, companies were commissioned, earth mounds were modeled for a circular course: a year later, almost everything was finished - but even before the official opening of the BMX railway, this was already over again.
Omissions in politics and administration caused annoyance, especially among the local residents, who did not want to tolerate the railroad.
So hills pushed off, new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permit.
The approval will be received in October, the First Municipal Councillor Sabine Mosebach-Bock could now announce in the Children and Youth Committee.
"I hope that something visible will happen this year," she said.
The work on the former indoor swimming pool should then be started without a "further memorial break".
DFB intensifies commitment to refugees
The DFB is expanding its commitment to refugees until 2019, and the Bundesliga is sending a clear signal on the weekend.
Football reacts to the growing situation in Germany and ensures that politicians are helping to deal with the upcoming problems.
“I think this is our country’s biggest challenge since reunification.”
"No one can say that, in principle, it's nothing to me, I have nothing to do with it."
"Everyone should be interested in getting this topic under control," said DFB CEO Wolfgang Niersbach.
At the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin, he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively.
"I will be in the Chancellery next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State Ms. <0xC3><0x96>zo<0xC4><0x9F>uz and the Chancellor there."
"The issue will certainly play a central role," he said.
Football can and will help.
Politics, however, must set the decisive course.
The German Football Federation has therefore extended its refugee initiative "1:0 for a welcome" by four years.
"With the Egidius-Braun Foundation, we have ensured that this programme continues until 2019," Niersbach said on the sidelines of the UEFA meeting in St. Julian's/Malta.
Some federal leagues also support this program.
Already this weekend, the 36 professional clubs will send a clear signal when they will wear the imprint "We help - #refugeeswelcome" on the left shirt sleeve instead of the usual sponsor logo (Hermes).
"We also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can," Leverkusen's head of sports Rudi Völler told the "Bild" newspaper (Tuesday) and described the project as "obviously".
"The refugee drama affects everyone, no one can look away."
"We footballers can, no, we have to use our radiance, our influence and our opportunities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly," said Hertha manager Michael Preetz.
Hoffenheim's CEO Peter Rettig spoke of a "prominent sign of the league".
The women's national team invites 100 refugees to Halle/Saale for the European Championship qualifying game against Hungary this Friday.
Niersbach described the support of refugees as "a great community work of German football".
The fact that all 36 licensing associations have started their own projects in their localities is great.
It is equally great that small and small clubs are active there.
The message "1:0 for a welcome" that we have spent is lived in football.
"This is of tremendous importance," he said.
This year and next, the association, together with the DFB selection and the Federal Government, will allocate 300,000 euros each for the integration of refugees.
"The clubs have already called up the entire sum for 2015," Niersbach reported.
Reports: SAP CEO loses an eye in accident
The CEO of Europe’s largest software company, Bill McDermott, has reportedly lost his left eye due to a fall in early July.
In the accident on the stairs in his brother's house in the USA, he fell on a glass of water that he carried in his left hand after midnight, reports the "Wirtschaftswoche" on Wednesday.
“He was almost bleeding, fainted, then dragged himself out onto the streets – that’s what he told us last week,” SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner said.
McDermott could do his job.
"In early October, we will meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Walldorf," Plattner said.
The 54-year-old manager was at the meeting and “fully capable of working.”
McDermott announced in an interview with the "Süddeutsche Zeitung" (Thursday edition) that he will come back to Germany in October and continue to lead the software company.
"I'm fully there for SAP, fully in my job."
"Of course, I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman, Hasso Plattner, all the time," McDermott told SZ.
McDermott usually commutes between Germany and the USA, but since the summer he has not been at the German SAP headquarters in Walldorf.
It was important to him to go public with such a personal story, the manager of the “SZ” said: “Anyone can do something like this.”
"It's important to get up again when you've fallen."
McLaren replacement pilot Magnussen out of battle
Magnussen tweeted a corresponding photo, stating that he had suffered the injury when he fell off the bike.
He will therefore not be considered as a reserve driver for the two regular pilots Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button at the night race in Singapore on the weekend, as well as a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan.
Football: BVB without a giant against Krasnodar: Weidenfeller in goal
At Borussia Dortmund, all hopes for a comeback of Marco Reus in the first group game of the Europa League have been finally shattered.
The national player will also be missing from the Bundesliga leader in a duel with FK Krasnodar on Thursday (19.00 h/Sky).
"Unfortunately, we can't resort to him," Thomas Tuchel said on Wednesday.
Whether Reus will be back in the Bundesliga top match against Leverkusen on Sunday, the BVB coach left open: "We expect a return of him to the training on Friday."
Given the high strain on his professionals, Tuchel will not only change his tribal eleven in the Reus position.
So he announced a change in the goalkeeper position.
That’s why Roman Weidenfeller takes the place of regular keeper Roman Bürki.
"He's training at an absolute top level," the football teacher praised the world champion.
Whether Weidenfeller will be used in all Europa League games in the future, however, left Tuchel open.
He is also likely to play the second game.
The inquiry from fellow player Reus that the final entry for the BVB in the Europa League must be the goal, believes midfielder Julian Weigl understandable: "That Marco is not so wrong."
"I think we have a good chance of taking the title."
Robotic cars: government wants pioneering role for Germany
According to the will of the German government, Germany should be a technological pioneer in the transformation of the car.
On Wednesday, the Federal Cabinet adopted a strategy paper from the house of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which includes investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure.
Dobrindt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the car trade fair IAA of a "new mobility era".
Automated and connected driving will increase traffic safety and reduce congestion, Dobrindt said.
He will also discuss the issue with his counterparts from the G7 countries, who will also meet with industry representatives at the IAA.
Among other things, the Ministry of Transport’s strategy paper stresses the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a swift transition to digital radio.
To test new technology, a test track is currently being built on the Autobahn 9 in Bavaria.
In order to ensure that the driver does not face any additional liability risks, the German government intends to "examine the legal framework and, where necessary, adapt it to the new developments."
For example, Germany wants to work internationally to increase the permissible maximum speed for self-driving cars from 10 to 130 kilometres per hour.
The Federal Government also wants to advocate for an amendment to the Vienna Convention, which so far only provides for people as drivers.
With automated driving, the car increasingly takes the lead, the driver becomes more and more the passenger.
The technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds.
According to a study presented by the Ministry of Economics, highly automated driving on motorways will be technically possible by 2020.
Nevertheless, driverless vehicles on public roads are "only to be expected far after 2020."
The authors of the study estimate the added value in the area of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions at the location in Germany to be around 8.4 billion euros for 2025.
"The digital networking of the car can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic," said SPD transport politician Sören Bartol.
However, the question of liability in the event of accidents and the security of drivers’ personal data must be clearly clarified.
Yet the Germans still see self-driving cars skeptical – much more than French or Americans.
A survey conducted on Wednesday by the Forsa Institute on behalf of the audit organization Dekra found that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous cars will prevail in the next ten years, 32 percent expect only in 20 years, 31 percent do not believe at all.
In France, 21 percent of respondents expect autonomous cars by 2025, and 33 percent in the United States.
In any case, drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely entirely on a self-driving vehicle.
According to a survey by the digital association Bitkom, only seven percent would agree to leave control on all roads throughout the journey.
On the highway, this could be imagined in fluid traffic at least 15 percent, in traffic jams 45 percent.
One in four drivers wouldn’t let the car control them under any circumstances.
Boll cancels team and double start at table tennis EM
The Düsseldorfer wants to hit in the title fights from 25 September to 4 October only in detail.
The final decision is to be taken by 22 September at the latest.
"It's a huge loss for our team."
"The boys found out in the morning."
"But we are strong enough to get the title even without Timo," said Bundestrainer Jörg Roßkopf during the European Championship course in Düsseldorf.
Boll was on the flight at that time for a long-term sponsorship appointment in China.
The 34-year-old German champion is expected to return on Friday.
"Without Timo, the disadvantage is that we are no longer such a clear favourite," said single European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov.
The Hamelin, who leads the betting list in Yekaterinburg, but also reminded of the 2013 European Championships in Schwechat.
Timo was also missing at the time, and we have become European champions.
"We should be guided by that," the World Ranking Fifth explained.
English national footballer Luke Shaw of Manchester United has suffered a serious injury to the right leg.
In the Champions League match at PSV Eindhoven, the defender was hit in a tackle by Héctor Moreno and replaced after a long treatment.
The first diagnosis pointed to a shin fracture in Bastian Schweinsteiger’s 20-year-old fellow.
Gaultier feels too old for an enfant terrible
It is a mixture of a huge fashion show and a wax figure grusel cabinet: Designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition about his work in Munich on Wednesday.
The highlights: mannequins that look terribly human thanks to video projections.
They wear the spectacular creations of the French designer, who became the big star of the fashion scene with Madonna’s stage outfits, among other things – and by putting men in skirts.
“I can’t say today that I am the enfant terrible of haute couture because I have white hair.”
"It used to be bleached, but now it's real," Gaultier said.
For visitors to the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk", which will be on view in the Kunsthalle of the Hypo-Kulturstiftung from September 18, it is a good thing that the fashion designer has changed his initially negative attitude to a show about his person.
In fact, he was opposed, because: "For me, an exhibition sounded a bit like death," he said.
When you die, you go to the museum.
The impressive collection had already made a stop in Montreal, Canada, and in Paris.
"It's about so much more than just beautiful clothes," said the director of the Kunsthalle, Roger Diederen.
It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits give an insight into the hardly overlookable work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship.
Chronologically, the show is not structured, but it is an excellently choreographed overall work of art, for which a lot of effort has been made: For example, a stylist has been specially hired to dress the dolls.
According to the curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot, the makers have carved 14 tons of material to Munich.
Shortly before the start of the Oktoberfest there was a special delicacy: a lederhosen outfit with corset.
Heidi meets Madonna.
He has always been interested in strong women ("women are smarter than men") and people who are a bit different, Gaultier said.
Gaultier’s old teddy can also be seen in the exhibition.
It represents the designer’s first timid, fashionable attempts at walking.
As a child (he was not a good student and bad at football), he put on his teddy bras and dresses, Gaultier said.
Playing with a doll would not have been allowed by his parents.
He later taught himself how to design fashion.
He stole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers, as Gaultier told in Munich.
Later I bought it, of course.
He couldn’t pay the models for his first fashion show.
They didn't get anything, but they were allowed to keep their clothes.
Jewelry instead of curtains - Plauener lace as a fashion niche
In the past, the long embroidery machines in and around Plauen were all about making meters.
The embroidered fabrics and laces were created in large quantities for customers, who processed them, for example, into blankets and curtains.
This alone no longer works today, explains Andreas Reinhardt, Managing Director of Modespitze Plauen.
Instead, fashion is important again.
In the early days of Plauener Spitze, fashion played a major role, was then supplanted by the home textile industry - and is now rediscovered as a niche.
Reinhardt gives some examples: lace in jewellery, accessories such as bags and regional costumes.
In general, the so-called vintage fashion, which is based on past style eras, forms an increasing potential for orders.
Those who do not serve niches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market.
With us, they already make up half of all orders.
Together with nine other companies, Modespitze Plauen is a member of the industry association Plauener Spitze und Embroiderien.
Only they are allowed to bear the protected label.
In the last 15 years, around 80 percent of sales have been lost.
Private specialty stores and wholesale stores are almost gone.
Our products hardly reach the customers in this way.
The bulk goods are nowadays produced much cheaper in the Asian region and distributed almost exclusively via chains.
In addition, exports are weakening, currently to Russia and the US.
Enough reasons for new paths.
The industry association also tries to score through environmental awareness, as Cordula Bauer from the embroidery bead in Falkenstein explains: "Since this year, we have held a quality seal that shows that we produce ecologically and socially sustainable".
Reinhardt adds: "This also relates to the materials used".
Diploma designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberg branch of the West Saxon University of Applied Arts in Zwickau and specializes in embroidery and lace.
In order to counter the competition from the Asian region, you have to find high-quality and innovative products.
It takes time and courage.
This creates a tension between the freshest ideas of the designers and the companies that have to think economically," says Schmidt.
Therefore, an existing design is often only slightly varied to keep a customer base.
A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter revived the historic snowball tip.
The machine embroiders small balls in some places.
The Plauener goldsmith Bianca Hallebach-Krausse was inspired by this: "Before I could do nothing with traditional Plauener lace".
Now she uses the snowball tip for her jewelry.
In an elaborate process, it embosses the pattern in silver.
"Many people in the region identify with the topic of Plauener Spitze - young and old," says Reuter.
It also delivers to the USA, Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in Plauen and its surroundings and who want a souvenir.
Thus I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of the Plauener Spitze.
Disney is planning a new Mary Poppins movie
Legends are not to be touched, but Disney still dares to a new film of his classic "Mary Poppins".
According to "Entertainment Weekly", however, it is not about a new film, but about a kind of sequel, which plays 20 years after the first film with the magical nanny.
It is about the experience of the nanny with the Banks family during the Great Depression in England.
Who plays Poppins more than 50 years after Julie Andrews is still unclear.
But the director is already certain: Rob Marshall, most recently with "Into the Woods" in the cinema.
Xi urges to open the economy broader to the world
The economy needs to open broader to the outside world in order to boost growth, President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday to a group tasked with steering the reform.
"China should be committed to attracting foreign investment and know-how and improving business start-up strategies," he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Leadership Group for deepening a comprehensive reform.
Promoting new start-ups and advancing reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The management group has adopted a number of policies, including a negative list to regulate market access, relax border control policies, encourage state enterprises (SOE), take up private capital, and overhaul the residents reporting system.
After the statement, a negative list is created that identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment.
The system is tested gradually and improved by testing programs.
The initiative is significant as it assigns a greater role to the market in allocating resources, ensuring a rule-of-law business environment and making the market more open, the statement said.
The government will also loosen controls on the powers delegated to companies and ensure that companies decide how they conduct their business.
The statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
As part of an offer to open government-controlled sectors, further areas will be opened to private investment.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of debt-financed companies and provide better services to them," the statement said.
In addition, it will make it easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the “green card” by optimizing the requirements and facilitating the application process.
The right of lawyers to exercise their duties and to employ professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at a meeting.
The meeting also included Prime Minister Li Keqiang and important leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, as reported in a statement published after the meeting.
EU wants to double mercury limit in predatory fish
The European Commission wants to double the limits for mercury in large predatory fish, thereby imposing a significantly higher dose of the nerve agent on consumers.
The consumer organization Foodwatch, which has a corresponding EU working paper, sharply criticized the plans: "The risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policies are passed on to pregnant women and young children with full force," explained Matthias Wolfschmidt of Foodwatch.
According to Wolfschmidt, the limits of the nerve toxin for large fish at the end of the food chain, such as shark or swordfish, are to be raised from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish for "economic policy reasons".
However, large predatory fish are already so heavily contaminated with mercury that, on the basis of the limits still in force, about 50 percent of the catches may not be sold.
After doubling the limit values, only 14.5 percent would be unavailable.
In return for this easing, the EU wants to tighten the limits for other fish from currently 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram.
Foodwatch called this a "trick" because smaller peace fish, such as carp, are usually so low that they already meet the planned maximum levels today.
The reduction in small fish is therefore "a perfidious distraction maneuver that alone helps the economy," Wolfschmidt explained.
Mercury is a highly toxic heavy metal for humans, which accumulates strongly over the food chain, especially in predatory fish.
The German government therefore warns that "already small amounts, especially in unborn babies, can cause damage to the nervous system".
On its homepage, the Federal Ministry of the Environment declares, however, that a "health hazard to the general population" is not to be expected.
Mercury is mainly released into the environment by coal combustion.
The German coal-fired power plants produce more than six tons of mercury per year, two-thirds of the total amount emitted in Germany, according to a written report from the German Federal Environment Ministry to the Greens.
The concentration of mercury in fish in Elbe, the Rhine and the Danube, for example, has been “permanently and extensively exceeded,” the “Spiegel” had quoted from the paper in March.
Last year, Europe-wide warnings about mercury in fish were already among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU warning system RASFF.
