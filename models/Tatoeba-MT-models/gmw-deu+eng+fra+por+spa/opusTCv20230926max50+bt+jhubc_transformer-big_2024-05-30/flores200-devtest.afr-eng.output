To date, there is one test vaccine that reduces deaths from Ebola, but to date, no drugs have shown any clear suitability for treating an existing infection.
One antibody drug, ZMapp, initially promised progress in the field, but formal studies have shown that it has less benefits than is desired in preventing deaths.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp served as a control, meaning that scientists used it as a baseline and compared three other treatments to it.
U.S. Gymnastics supports the U.S. Olympic Committee's letter and accepts the absolute need of the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the USOC’s statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs, and their sport, can be better served by taking a step forward with meaningful change in our organization, rather than the deprivation of certificates.

This not only confirms that there were at least some dinosaurs that had feathers, which is already a widespread theory, but also provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that this animal's feathers have chestnut brown on top with a pale or carotid-colored bottom.
The invention also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, also called the rhachis, but they have other feathers characteristics – shaft feathers and side branches with beards – and the researchers concluded that the rhachis may have been a later evolutionary development than these other characteristics.
The feather structure suggests that they were not used in flight, but rather for temperature regulation or rejection. The researchers suggest that even if this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult feathers and not a chick’s downs.
The researchers suggested that even if it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the monster shows adult feathers and not chick downs.
A car bomb exploded yesterday morning at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two police officers and injuring more than 20 other people.

The work done is mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the galaxy's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts an attraction on Earth, causing the tides, so the Milky Way also exerts an attraction on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary material does.
This theory says that most of the dark matter around a star cell is found in a type of beam, and consists of very small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll has discovered extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
In an interview, he said the new cultivar was "very highly disturbing and disturbing because of the very high death rate."
Some patients may have picked up the germ in the hospital, Dr. Moll thinks, and at least two were hospital health personnel.
In one year, one infected person will infect 10 to 15 close acquaintances.
Although, the percentage of XDR-TB in the entire group of people with tuberculosis still appears to be low; 6,000 of the total 330,000 people infected at any particular moment in South Africa.

Their thermal behavior is not as moderate as large caves on Earth that often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but it is consistent with these deep holes that are in the ground," says Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astro-geology Team and of Northern Arizona University located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting was a traditionally low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a box, and then put a pre-printed sheet of paper indicating the candidate of their choice in an envelope.
After officials confirmed the elector's identity, the elector drops the envelope in the polls and signs the voter list.
French election legislation has codified this procedure quite strictly.
Since 1988, polls must be transparent so that voters and observers can testify that no envelopes were there at the beginning of the election and that no envelopes were added except those that were counted and by registered voters.
Candidates can send representatives to follow each part of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under heavy supervision, according to specific procedures.

Her other race, the Grand Slalom, finished in tenth place in the sedentary women’s group with a combined running time of 4:41.30, 2:11:60 minutes slower than the first place athlete, Austrian Claudia Loesch and 1:09:02 minutes slower than the ninth place athlete, Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary.
Four skiers in the women's group failed to complete their runs, and 45 of the 117 skiers in the Giant Slalom failed to rank in the race.
The Madhya Pradesh Police have recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phones.
Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya said, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and found her mobile phone and laptop back."
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the defendants appeared in court with covered faces.
Although three people were in the house when the car made an impact, none of them were injured.
As a result, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed as emergency services rescued the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was transferred to Addenbrook Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been indicted in the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court for the murder of her son.
She is in custody in anticipation of her charge and trial, but any eyewitness evidence may have been affected because her image has been widely published.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the UK but Scottish legal systems work differently and courts have seen publication of the photos as potentially detrimental.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists cross a dangerous line if they publish photos etc of suspects."
Crown Office, which is in total control of prosecutions, has indicated to journalists that no further comments will be made, at least until charges are filed.
The document will, according to the informant, refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants should be based on the borders prior to the 1967 Middle Eastern War.
Other topics reportedly covered include the future state of Jerusalem that is sacred to both nations and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demands a sustained military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement has been signed, while the PA agrees to leave such presence only for five years.
Fieldkeepers carefully supervised shooters in the supplemental pest control trial, as the trial was monitored and evaluated effectiveness.
In collaboration with the NPWS and the Sports Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers have been recruited under the Sports Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the NPWS's Acting Director of Park Conservation and Heritage, the four shotguns selected for the first shooting operation received detailed safety and training instructions.
Martelly swore in a new Provincial Election Council (CEP) of nine members yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission proposed the previous CEP’s resignation as part of a package of measures to move the country forward to new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the lack of elections, some owed since 2011.
Around 60 cases of overheated iPods have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with mild burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economics, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
METI announced Lass Week that Apple had informed them about 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called "non-serious."
The minister's office responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "very sorry."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 a.m. local time (09:19 a.m. GMT Friday).
The Northern Marianas Emergency Management Office has declared that no damage has been reported in the nation.
The Pacific Warning Center also said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Philippine policeman held Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been reported as deceased so far.
Six hostages, including kidners and the elderly, were released early, as well as Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly woman as she had to use the bathroom. Mendoza was shot dead.
He followed in his father’s footsteps and started a career in medicine.
He studied for a midwife and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Lightgins began researching premature births in his spare time.
His research has shown that, if hormones are administered, it will accelerate the baby's fetish lung development.
Xinhua reports that the state's investigative team recovered two "black box" flight cameras on Wednesday.
People are also paying tribute to the moon.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first Queen of Extremes. My first manager Luna died on the night of two moons. Very unique just like her. Strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was just as strange as me... maybe even more...love her and will miss her...hopefully she's in a better place."
Out of the 1,400 previous voters in the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic have grown by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election that she believed Australia would become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II’s reign.
34 percent of those in the poll share this view, their will that Queen Elizabeth II should be Australia's last monarch.
At the extremes of the poll, 29 percent of respondents believed Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medal holder, had to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle, and in three relays to the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his fitness was questioned.
He could not use the medicine he needed to overcome his pain because it was banned from the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25.
Several people confirmed the discovery by using different hardware or software at the beginning of February, and it was announced Tuesday.
Comets may be a source of water delivery to Earth along with organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets originate, especially how Earth was formed, since comets collided with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his governorship earlier this year and signed a bill that legalized same-sex marriages.
He referred to the rumors as political gossip and foolishness.
People speculate that he will make an attempt in the 2016 presidential election.
NextGen is a system that the FLA claims will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of liters of fuel annually and cut carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of older ground-radar-based technology to allow air traffic controllers to pin down the aircraft with greater precision and give pilots more accurate information.
No extra transportation is available, and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and stop-and-driving facilities are not available on the ground.
Fears of a loss of transport have increased the possibility that the game is forced to be played behind closed doors and without the team's supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the emergence of a new species of bird on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the species adapted in only two generations, although this process was believed to take much longer, due to breeding between an endemic Darwin finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed in all kinds of shapes. It can also be rolled into small shapes.
It can be pulled out into a thin wire, which can be twisted or braided. It can be stretched out or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and attached to other metals. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called a chemical’s pH. You can make an indicator by using red cabbage juice.
The cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen (the H in the pH) ions in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons whose electrons have been retrieved (as hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Turn the two dry powders together and then press them into a ball with clean wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, it will feel funny and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-dara had a flush toilet in almost every house, and it was attached to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remains of drainage systems have been found in houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women were in mixed company together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it back, almost immediately.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth’s atmosphere distorts our light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket of over 100 feet high to put a satellite or telescope in the outer space.
The wheel has changed the world in amazing ways. The biggest thing that the wheel has given us is much easier and faster transportation.
It brought us the train, the car and many other transportation devices.
Among them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey such as rabbits and goats.
Lastly, there are many small kittens (including loose pet cats) who eat far more small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a niche, each cat has a special job that prevents them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats, who live in large groups known as herds.
Lion troops consist of one to three related males, along with as many as thirty females and young.
The women are usually closely related to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion herds act much like a flock of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly close to lions (but not to other big cats) in action, and are also very lethal to their prey.
As a well-rounded athlete, the tiger can climb (although not good), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the fullest roar of a lion, but more like a sense of snarling yelling words.
Small wildcats love to eat small animals. They will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that hunt the wildcat are smaller than they are.
Scientists think that "ozelots" follow animals (prey) and find by smell. They sniff on the ground to find out where the animals were.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and they also move unseen. Pardelcats hunt their prey by melting with the environment and then jumping on their victims.
When a small group of living things (a small population) are removed from the main population where they come from (such as when they move over a mountain range or a river, or when they move to a new island so that they cannot easily retreat) they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were before.
The new environment has different resources and different competition, so the new population will need different features or adjustments than they previously needed to be a strong competitor.
The original population has not changed much, they still need the same adjustments as before.
Over time, as the new population began to adapt to their new environment, they began to look less and less like the other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different that they cannot even be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which only means the formation of a new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants make oxygen that people inhale, and they absorb in carbon dioxide that people exhale (that is, exhale).
Plants make their own food from sunlight through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We use plants to build our homes and to make clothes. Most of the food we eat are plants. Without plants, animals would not be able to live.
Mosasaurus was the predator at the top of the food chain of his time, so it feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
His long jawbone has more than 70 sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the roof of his mouth, which means there is no way out for anything to cross his path.
We don’t know for sure, but he could have had a forked tongue. His diet included shell roads, big fish, mosaic and he could have been a cannibal himself.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like a T. rex would not be able to cope with it.
While much of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their own share of strange or unusual festivals involving wild pig, paw, snail, and a type of marsupial known as a Hazel Mouse.
Another difference was that while the poor people and the woman eat their food while they sit in chairs, the rich men prefer to hold banquets together where they lie on their sides and eat their meals.
Ancient Roman meals could not have included food that came to Europe from America, or from Asia in later centuries.
For example, they did not have corn, or tomatoes, or potatoes, or cocoa, and no Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the home of the deity.
People would offer sacrifices to the gods and the priests would try to satisfy the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner room where only the priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, also enough ziggurats, are built to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family happened in the open air.
Women cooked in the garden; shops were just open counters overlooking the street. Cliffs were used to build houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan not so much wood was very expensive.
Greenland is sparsely populated. Norwegian sagas tell that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and as he traveled further west, he found Greenland and called it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes already lived there.
Although each country was "Scandinavian," there were many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie National Treasure, you may think that there is a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Nevertheless, this is not true. Even if there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Inscribed on the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776". The text appears upside down, at the bottom of the document.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in his life, the large parking document (it measures 293<0xE2><0x81><0x84>4 inches by 241<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 inches) was rolled up for malfunction.
So, it is possible that the notation is simply added as a label.
The D-Day landings and the battles that subsequently broke out freed the north of France, but still the South was not free.
It was under the "Vichy" French control. They were French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting with them.
On the 15th of August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was known as "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and French forces liberated southern France and turned to Germany.
A civilization is a single culture that is shared by a significant large group of people who work together and live and work as a community.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or like a city, and it also defines the size of society.
City-states are the forerunners of nations. A civilized culture that carries knowledge across many generations, an ongoing cultural footprint and fair distribution.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states formed a weak central government – with Congress as its only component – under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress did not have the power to enforce taxes, and, because there was no national executive or court, they relied on the state authorities, who regularly did not want to cooperate, to carry out all their acts.
It also had no authority to exceed tax laws and tariffs between states.
The Articles require unanimous consent from all states before their can be changed and states take the central government so lightly that their representatives were regularly absent.
Italy's national football team, along with the German national football team is the second most successful team in the world and was the FIFA World Cup winners in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, screen, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller skate and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the Northern regions, with Italians participating in International Games and Olympic gatherings.
Japan consists of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Japan is often referred to, from a geographical point of view, as an "archipelago" because of the garments/group of islands that Japan has.
Taiwan began long ago in the 15th century when European sailors passed by to take up the island's name as Ilha Formose, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East Indian Company established a base southwest of Taiwan, and a transformation into indigenous grain production practices by appointing Chinese workers to work in their rice and sugar plantations.
Qing dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas in 1683 and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Shimonoseki Policy, thereby transferring sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they originally appeared.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was orcharded, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common silent image photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size by the end of the analogue film era.
It is still manufactured today, but more importantly, the aspect ratio has been inherited by digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format is actually, somewhat confusing, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS family of formats) are equivalent to or close to this aspect ratio.
The much-abuse and frequently ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates movement while maintaining a degree of order in an image.
It says that the most effective place for the main topic is at the intersection of lines that divide the image vertically and horizontally into thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which became rich and powerful, was placed under the spotlight.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian faith has united European states despite language and cultural differences.
Its all-pervading power has affected everyone, from the king to the community.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the monetary discovery of the church is there specifically for this reason.
For more than a thousand years the central authority of the church has been in Rome, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question this premise.
Shortly after the outbreak of riots, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy has been effectively proven; it has cut off vital military and civilian supplies, even though the blockade has broken widely accepted international laws through several international agreements of the last two centuries.
Britain mined in international waters to prevent any ships from entering large parts of the ocean, which would pose a danger even to neutral ships.
Since there was limited response to this tactic, Germany had expected a similar response to its unlimited submarine warfare.
Throughout the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents to his name, a book of poems, and a recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager in his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different time periods; each stage of China or each family that was in control was a separate dynasty.
There was also an unstable period of divided provinces between each dynasty. The most-known of these periods of the Three Kingdoms period that took place in the 60 years between the Han and the Jin Dynasty.
During these periods there was severe warfare between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in Ancient Chinese history; with thousands of people dying in the struggle to sit at the highest seat in the grand palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to one single ruler.
After the Revolution, vocations were also open to male applicants who allowed the most ambiguous and successful to pass.
The same applies to the army, since the army range is now based on caliber, rather than class.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people from other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mohammad was deeply interested in events beyond this earthly life. He regularly visited a cave that became known as "Hira" on the Mount of "Noor" (light) for reflection.
The cave itself, which survived for a long time, gives a very clear picture of Muhammad’s spiritual tendencies.
The cave is entirely isolated from the rest of the world, and rests on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca.
In truth, it is not easy to find, even if one knew it existed. When one is in a cave, it is an overall isolation.
Nothing but the clean, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains can be seen. Very little of this world can be heard from within the cave.
The Great Pyramid at Giza is the only one of the seven wonders still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century AD, the Great Pyramid is one of the very large pyramid structures built to honor the death of Pharaoh.
The Giza Plato, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (of which the great pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples and the great Sphinx.
The large pyramids were created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and relatives.
The "arc" marker looks like a V and the "arc" marker looks like a stammer or a square without its lower side.
On means you have to start at the point and press the bow, and down means you have to start at the frog (this is where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
An on-bow usually creates a softer sound, while an off-bow is stronger and more valid.
Feel free to write down your own marks, but remember that the printed line marks are there for a musical reason, so they should normally be respected.
The fearful King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced to flee back to Paris from Versailles on 6 October 1789, by a crowd of market women.
In a carriage, they travelled back to Paris as they were surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and threatening against the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open their carriage windows wide.
At one point, a member of the protesters waved the head of a royal killed at Versailles in front of the frightened Queen.
The war costs of U.S. imperialism in conquering the Philippines were paid by the Philippine people themselves.
They are obliged to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to settle much of the expenses and the interest on securities was driven by the Wall Street banking houses on behalf of the Philippine government.
Of course, the super-profits obtained from the protracted exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the basic gains of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Temple Servants, one must understand the context that led to the establishment of the order.
The era where the events took place was commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ended around 1500.
Technological determination is a term that involves a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological pressure or the technological necessity in a strict sense that human destiny was driven by an underlying logic coupled with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interruptions of technological provisions share two common ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, produces “effects” on society that is indigenous rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one might say that the car necessarily led to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for only a handful of cars, so new methods of production are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass vehicle ownership also leads to accidents on the road, which in turn leads to the invention of new techniques in health care for the repair of damaged bodies.
Romanticism contained a large element of cultural determinism, taken from authors such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romance, the physical environment shaped individuals, and over time customs and cultures arose that were associated with that environment, and these things, which are in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily-imposed laws.
In the same way that Paris was known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its celebrity for being an epicenter of luxury began in about 400 A.D. and lasted until about 1100 A.D.
The status declined during the twelfth century mainly due to the Crusaders returning with gifts such as silk and spices whose value was higher than offered by Byzantine markets.
It was at this time that the transfer of the title of Fashion Capital from Constantinople to Paris was made.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
The wear was at first strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
Due to the slow communication channels, styles can be left behind in the west at 25 to 30 per year.
Near the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop their own style. One of the greatest developments of the time was due to the crusades that people began to use buttons to fasten clothes with.
Livestock farming is farming that is done to produce just enough food to satisfy the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Existing agriculture is a simple, often organic system that combines preserved seeds peculiar to the eco-region with alternating cultivation or other relatively easy techniques to increase yield.
Historically, most farmers are involved in subsistence farming and this is still the case in many developing nations.
Individuals with similar feelings of neglect by community standards are brought together by subcultures, and allowed to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures are characteristic because of the members' age, ethnic origin, status, location, and/or gender.
The characteristics that clearly determine a subculture may be the linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often indicate their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of styles, which includes fashions, manners, and informal language.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is by focusing on the few unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults through neglect, adverse circumstances, or intentional abuse while the children were growing up.
Such children are labeled as "running away" or wildlife. Some wild children were enclosed by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, this abandonment is attributable to parents' rejection of a child's severe intellectual or physical constraints.
Wild children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before leaving or running away.
It is claimed that others were raised by animals; some lived on their own in the wilderness.
When a wild child is wholly raised by non-human animals, it exhibits behavior (within physical limits) that is almost wholly like that of the particular caring animal, such as the fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should make it easier and more interesting to learn, scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning, but rather a tool that provides support to individuals who are starting to use a new learning method, such as a new computer program or the start of a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual or real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding but so is the small slider male in Microsoft Office.
Virtual Steers are in the software and are intended to question, accelerate, and explain procedures for students who would find the process difficult to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a wide range of reasons ranging from neglect, abuse, and even exploitation.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educating, but that is the reality.
We see the nursing care system as a safety zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
Nursing care is supposed to provide all the necessities that have been lacking in the home from where they were previously taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The characteristic characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of usages and rewards approach.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are proposed as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
When Eighmey and McCord (1998) examined audience responses to websites, they identified their "personal engagement" and "continued relationships" as new motivational aspects.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretations of micro-expressions, facial movements that hold a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is mentioned that one can pick up when a person lies by correctly interpreting the micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his document, The President's Speech, indicated how people who were unable to understand the speech because of brain damage were still able to accurately estimate sincerity.
He even suggested that such abilities to interpret human behavior are shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Research from the twentieth century showed that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
The mutation process adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination mix variation back and forth between the two pools of each generation.
On the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to satisfy his amino acid needs with the plants available there.
Furthermore, failure to do so has serious consequences: suppressed growth, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The easiest accessible plant sources would have been the proteins,which are found in leaves and legumes, but it is difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal fats (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but they provide high-quality protein that contains all the essential amino acids.
All in all, we should not be surprised if our ancestors have solved their own "protein problem" in a way similar to the way some chimpanzees on the savanna today.
The interruption of sleep is the process of knowingly waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep again for a short period of time (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you back to consciousness without fully awakening you.
If you catch yourself setting the clock in your sleep, it may be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to put it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking lots of fluids, (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic), before bedtime, which forces a person to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace that a person possesses correlates with the amount of tension in one’s body and mind.
The lower the tension, so much more positive is the life force present. Each person has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been expanded by the Mahayana path of love and by many techniques from Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is stimulated by yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various gods, the energy channels are cleared, the chakras are activated and the enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a joint enemy in World War 2, led by the USSR and USA. With the end of the war and clashes of system, process and culture that led to the countries that had fallen out.
Within two years of the end of the war, former allies were present enemies and the Cold War began.
It was the last for the next 40 years and would really be fought, by insurgent troops, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defences had already been broken and the only hope was to retreat and re-organize along the Roman bridgehead.
How ever she had served out these plans overnight, when 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after entering the eastern regions of Polland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish No-Aggression Agreement and international Bilateral Agreements.
The use of ships to transport goods is by far the most effective way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The work of the fleets has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move your people and goods, while at the same time interfering with your enemy's ability to move its people and goods.
One of the most remarkable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic Expedition of WWII. The Americans tried to get troops and stockpiles across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, which mostly used U-boats, tried to stop traffic.
If the Allies failed, Germany would probably be able to conquer Britain as it could conquer the rest of Europe.
Goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to hold them for easy access to milk, hair, meat and skins.
Domesticated goats were commonly kept in herds that walked over the hills and other grazing areas, and after being cared for by goat herders who were multiple children or teenagers, similar to the more widely known shepherds. These methods of nursing are still used today.
Waspore was built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although wax pores mostly consisted of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses they dragged forward to do so at greater speeds and with greater loads than it would take to do it on the nearly coarser roads of the day.
Crossbars were installed fairly early to keep the tracks in place. Gradually, however, it was realized that the tracks would be more effective if there was an iron strip at the top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused more finishing of the wood wheels of the wagons.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels, and in 1767 the first pure iron railings were introduced.
The first known mode of transportation was walking, people began walking upright two million years ago with the rise of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man).
Their predecessor, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright normally.
Bipedal specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 - 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus has already walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start to live a more friendly life towards the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to combat future suffering to a certain extent.
It is like the symptomatic treatment in many cases. If we are not only looking for a temporary solution, then we should find the root of the problems, and we should make them harmless.
It is clear enough that the world has changed a lot as a result of humanity's scientific and technological advances, and problems have become bigger as a result of over-population and humanity's excessive lifestyle.
After the adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap’s print shop.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap broadsides."
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon at the site of the Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which had it read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap whips that still exist are known as the oldest copies of the document that still exists. The original handwritten copy did not survive.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and still live today. We call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
There are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary numbers - or bits, to use computer terminology.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Symptoms such as vomiting are common enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or household chemicals.
Look at the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term insect is used by entomologists in a formal sense for the group of insects.
The term is derived from an ancient familiarity with bed beetles, which are insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both Assassin-bugs and Bed-bugs are nidicolous, adapted to live in a nest or house of their host.
Across the United States, there are about 400,000 cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the largest neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, the spine and the optical nerve.
Research finds that women are twice as likely to get MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interest, or in the best interest of their child, to raise a baby.
These couples can choose to set up an adoptive plan for their baby.
With an adoption, the birth parents terminate their parenting so that another couple may adopt the child.
Science’s main goal is to find out how the world works through a scientific method. This method in fact accompanies most scientific research.
Although this is not alone, experimentation, and an experiment in a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, ask questions, and take observations also direct scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, have been accepted.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from their Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many have observed rhythms in physiology and behavior is often highly dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just responses to external periodic signals, have been recorded for most living creatures, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological bells are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue a period of free-running cycles, even in the absence of external cause.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main proposals that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments that marked either the DNA in the phage with a radioactive phosphorus or the proteen of the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the cells affected are germ-line cells.
Only mutations in germ-line cells can be transmitted to children, while mutations in other places can cause the death of cells or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of enjoying the environment, including the plant and animal life.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks and studies of information about the ecosystem.
An example is to visit Borneo and learn about oarangotangs and photograph them.
Every morning, people leave the small towns in cars to go to their workplaces and are passed by others whose workplace is the area from which they have just moved.
In this dynamic shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to and supports a transportation system based on private cars.
Science points out that this massive carbon economy has affected the biosphere's stable conditions that have supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in the community and uses the transport systems. Almost everyone complains about the transport systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or bridges falling flat.
Why do transport systems grow such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transport engineers just inappropriate? Or is something more fundamentally going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, a study of traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers act within a fairly consistent range; and thus traffic flows have a fair consistency and can be roughly mathematically represented.
To better represent traffic flow, ratios are achieved between the 3 main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of drive-level facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly helped them to avoid their enemies more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage that they are able to fold their wings back on the body.
This gives them a wider range of small spots to hide from predators.
Currently, the only insects that can't fold their wings back are the conifers and one-day flies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System orbits the Sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many people believe the opposite; that the Solar System is moving around Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
It seems meaningful, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries more than 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, at times six miles wide.
A full 20 percent of the water flowing into oceans from the planet’s rivers comes from the Amazon.
The main river of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles). It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although pyramid construction in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and technical excellence of construction.
New Kingdom Ancient Egyptians were amazed by their predecessors' monuments, which were then well over the thousand years old.
The Vatican City's population is about 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the daily language used by many who work in states where Latin is frequently used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People knew about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper from ancient times, and these can all be found in nature in their basic form and are relatively simple to mine with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, has theorized that everything consists of a mixture of one or more of four elements, namely earth, water, air and fire.
These were more like the four stages of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he had a theory that they could change into new forms that we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There may also be alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them can fit at that point at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil was a good friend to many when it came out.
Unfortunately, as newer writing methods were used, the status and use of the pencil diminished.
People now write messages on account screens, and do not need to get close to a sharpener.
One can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when something newer passes by.
A fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It’s almost like pushing a heavy wagon up a hill. The splitting of a nucleus releases that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they break apart with little or no incentive.
The surface of the Moon is made of stones and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70km thick on the nearest side and 100km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the oceans and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more maria on the nearest side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are centered around what motivates or pleases people.
These theories assume that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they mature.
These theories look at what it is of certain people that causes them to want the things they do and the good in their environment that makes them do or not do certain good.
Two of the most popular theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
In general, two types of behavior can emerge as managers begin to lead their former colleagues. One side of the spectrum is to remain "one of the men" (or girls).
This type of manager struggles to make unpopular decisions, to carry out disciplinary actions, to evaluate employee performance, to designate responsibilities, and to hold employees accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, a person turns into an unrecognizable individual who feels like he or she needs to change everything the team was doing and make it their own.
After all, the leader is responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often causes a break between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often function as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members as their teams gather at different time zones that may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a visual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each of the members report. The invisible team sets the standards there for each member.
Why would an organization go through such a time-wasting process to establish a learning organization? One goal of putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively used across functional departments of an organization, creativity and sensitivity can come through.
As a result, the process of an organization works together to overcome the stumbling block and can lead to a new innovation process to serve the customer’s needs.
Leadership must create a culture of creation, as well as shared knowledge and organized study before an organization can be innovative.
Angel (2006) explained the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of work performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to examining cognition. So it narrows the research area and makes it more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, traumas, fissures, and tumors affect actions and, in some cases, alter some mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see the brain structures and processes and examine them like never before.
This provides us with a lot of information and materials to build simulation models to help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although Al has a strong connotation with science fiction, Al forms a very important branch of computer science, which has to do with behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in AI involves making machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer client diagnoses and questions as well as handwriting recognition, voice and face.
Such things have become separate disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to real life problems.
The AI cyst is now commonly used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and military units, and is also built into various home computers and video game software applications.
Excursions are a big part of any classroom. A teacher often wants to take her students to places where a bus trip is not an option.
Technology offers the solution with virtual field trips. Students can watch museum artifacts, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful art while sitting in class.
Sharing a virtual outing is also a great way to reflect on an outing and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a webcast about their ride to the state capital, every year the website is remodeled, but old versions are kept online and serve as a scrapbook.
Web journals can also help improve students’ writing ability. While students start arranging their web journal experience with junk language and spelling, the presence of observers usually changes that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the web journalist begins to pursue improved writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging "forces student to become more proficient about the world around them.) The necessity of feeding the interest of the crowd inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blog is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to take learning far beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs can empower students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of others' writings, as well as to change their own perspectives on particular issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital and contains a collection of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south is Niagra Waterfalls and the north houses the pristine natural beauty of the Muskoka and surrounding area.
All these things and more characterize Ontario as being considered genuinely Canadian by outsiders.
Large areas further north are very sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
For a population comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans living in the U.S. than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean near the east coast of Africa.
When it comes to wildlife, Madagascar is by far the largest and a continent on its own.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or have been associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the countries, and this took a strong hold in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, as the explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any women travelers say they are married, apart from their actual marital status.
It also helps to wear a ring (as long as it’s one that doesn’t look expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences may cause them to feel harassed, and that it is not uncommon to be chased, to be grasped by the arm, etc.
Be firm when pointing men away, and don't be afraid to stand on your rights (Cultural differences or not, it doesn't fix it!).
The modern city of Casablanca, founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and the Merenids as a stately port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to leave it again after the earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya and it was given the name Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the less interesting shops to go shopping in all of Morocco.
To the old Medina it is easy to find places that offer traditional Moroccan goods, such as Moroccan cooking pots, pottery, leather goods, hookahs and a whole spectrum of surpluses, but it’s like for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist city of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the Far East near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano that buried most of the town's streets, especially the city center.
While Goma is fairly safe, any visit outside Goma should be researched to understand the state of fighting in the Northern Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point to climb the Nyiragongo volcano, along with the cheapest mountain gorilla trails in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to explore Goma. The normal (local) price is <0x7E>500 Congolese francs for the short trip.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" is now used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished town, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of world heritage sites at risk due to the dangers of the desert sands.
This was one of the main stopping points during Henry Louis Gates' special PBS program, Wonders of the African World.
The city is in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities, as it has more of an Arabic flair than that of an African.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is in the north-eastern part of South Africa and follows the border of Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different eco zones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African National Parks, there are daily conservation and admission fees for the park.
It may also be beneficial to purchase a "Wild Card" that allows access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the area of Hong Kong its name and it is the place many tourists consider to be the main focus.
The parade of buildings that make up the horizon of Hong Kong has been compared to a dazzling column chart accentuated by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see Hong Kong's best scenery, leave the island and travel to the Kowloon waterfront on the other side.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's rural development is packed tightly on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is the place the British colonizers took for themselves and so if you’re looking for evidence of the area’s colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world and stretch 80 km (50 miles) to the interior of the Bangladesh and Indian hinterland from the coast.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest that falls into Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just halophyte swamps - they include some of the last remaining stands of mighty forests that once covered the Gangese plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one-third is covered in water / swamp areas.
The Sundarbania has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now about 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted goats in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those going in an eastern direction, depart between 06:30 and 07:30 to Jakar/Bumthang.
Since inter-district buses are often full, it is suggested that you buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by Japanese Coaster Buses, which are reliable and sturdy.
Shared rental cars are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby locations, such as Paru (Now 150) and Punakha (Now 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable bridge that spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters and are 378 meters long and have two lanes of 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical gap under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, it was not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September of 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most remarkable indigenous group inhabiting the area now known as Eastern Paraguay, and they inhabited the area as semi-nomadic hunters who also applied subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering food and catching fish.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as "The Great Province of the Indians", was born as a result of the battle of Spanish conquerors with the local indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the colonization period that lasted for three centuries.
Since the creation of Asunción in 1537, Paraguy has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo games, check out the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official Falkland currency is the Falkland pound (FKP) whose value is equivalent to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands located in Stanley overcand the FIC West store.
British pounds will be generally accepted everywhere in the islands and within Stanley credit cards and United States dollars are also regularly accepted.
In the remote islands, credit cards may not be accepted, although British and United States currencies will be taken; ask owners in advance to determine what the accepted payment method would be.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside of the islands, so exchange money out before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it's summer there when it's winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and so on.
Montevideo is in a subtropical region; in the summer months temperatures above +30°C are common.
Winter can be misleadingly cool: temperatures barely go below freezing, but the wind and humidity combined make it feel colder than the thermometer says.
There are no specific "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, nature is nevertheless wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, stay at least 100 meters away from bears, wolves, and 25 meters from all other wild animals.
No matter how smoothly they appear, buffaloes, deer, American deer, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, thousands of visitors are injured for not keeping a proper distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so they give their space.
Be aware that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking fragrant food and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The town is on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of an infamous naval rank in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the US, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk, except one British warship. Nearly 200 American and German lives were required..
During the fight for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the village caused the death of the chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, due to the fact that Auckland stretches over two ports. The most popular are in three areas.
North Coast beaches (in North Port District) are off the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches with safe swimming spots, and most have shade spots provided by the pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Rylan beaches are on the Waitemata Harbour, in the luxurious suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
There are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good range of shops on the edge of the beach. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is ‘Number One’, it is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called “Manta”.
There are many French wines available, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be better transported.
The local tap water is very safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you're afraid.
For Australians, the idea of "flat white" coffee is alien. A short black is "espresso," cappuccino is served with cream accumulated (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is equivalent to Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips are undertaken to the coral reefs throughout the year, and injuries to the coral reef due to any of these causes are rare.
Yet, take advice from authorities, obey all notifications and pay attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear near beaches and near river estuaries from October to April north of 1770. They can be found on occasion outside of these times.
Sharks exist, but rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles don't really live in the ocean, their primary habitat is in river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Discussing in advance gives the traveler peace of mind that they will have somewhere to relax when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have similarities with specific hotels, although you may find it impossible to book other types of accommodation, such as campgrounds, through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include mornings, transport arrangements to/from the airport and even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold the reservations for you if you need time to think about the offer or to get other documents for your destination (e.g. visas).
Any changes or inquiries, however, must go through the travel agent and not directly through the hotel.
For some music festivals, the largest number of attendees decide to camp on the site, and most see it as an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you will have to come in early to find a campsite near the music.
Remember that although music may come to an end at the main stages, there may be sections of the festival that will continue to play music until late at night.
Some parties have special camp areas for families with young children.
When the Northern Baltic region is crossed in winter, make sure of the location of the cabin, as it causes a great noise, for those most affected to go through the ice.
Saint Petersburg boat trips include time in the town. Ride passengers are exempt from visa requirements (make sure of the terms).
Casinos usually make a lot of effort to maximize the money spent by guests. Windows and bells are usually absent, and exits may be difficult to find.
To stick to their starting point as well as to keep guests in a good mood, they usually have special offers on food, drinks and entertainment.
Some places offer free alcoholic drinks. However, drunkenness affects your judgment, and all good gamblers realize the importance of staying sober.
Anyone going over mountain passes at high latitudes should consider the possibility of snow, ice or temperatures below freezing.
Friction on ice and snow roads is very low, and you can’t drive as if you’re on a bare tar road.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall quickly in a short period of time to keep you stuck.
Sight may also be limited by falling or wind-bearing snow or by condensation of ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the largest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The popular term safari refers to overland travel to see the beautiful African wildlife, especially on savannahs.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get too close to cars, and standard equipment will allow for good viewing.
Lions, leopards and leopards are sometimes shy and you'll see them better with viewers.
A step safari (also called a "forest step", "loop safari", or going "step") consists of a walk of a few hours to a few days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be hosted in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, after they hosted the games in 1964.
If you have booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement has been announced, you may have a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies differ, but as of late March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend until June 2020 for when the Olympics are scheduled.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between <0xC2><0xA5>2,500 and <0xC2><0xA5>130,000 with typical tickets costing around <0xC2><0xA5>7,000.
By ironing damp clothes, it becomes dry sooner. Many hotels have a flat iron and ironing board available to borrow, even if there is no one in the room.
If an iron is not available or you do not like to wear ironed socks, then you can try using a hair dryer, if one is available.
Be careful that the material does not get too hot, (otherwise, it can shrink or, in extreme cases, be scorched).
There are many ways to purify water, some are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is enough, in others it takes a few minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you have concerns, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a well-known company.
Travelers may find animal plagues that they are not familiar with in their home areas.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force, usually do not qualify as pests.
Doane free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods, exempt from taxes and excises in certain places.
Travelers to countries with heavy taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The piece between Point Marion and Fairmont gives the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, where it regularly goes into abandoned inland terrain.
If you're not used to driving on rural roads, keep your distance: steep gradients, narrow lanes, and sharp curves dominate.
Speed limits are remarkably lower than in previous and subsequent sections – usually 35-40mph (56-64 km/h) – and strict obedience to them is even more important than otherwise.
Strangely enough, the cell phone service here is better than many other parts of the route, e.g. the Pennsylvania Wilds.

They provide greater stability for the rider, but may pose safety risks due to the possibility of the rider's feet stuck in them.
If a horse throws down the rider and his foot is stuck in the stepping rod, he can be dragged together if the horse runs away. To reduce the risk, there are several safety measures that can be taken.
