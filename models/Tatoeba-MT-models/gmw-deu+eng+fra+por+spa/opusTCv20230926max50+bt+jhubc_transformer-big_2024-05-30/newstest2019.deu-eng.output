DFB CEO Grindel sees no basis for <0xC3><0x96>zil comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for a return of Mesut <0xC3><0x96>zil to the national team.
“That’s a question that naturally depends on getting into conversation, talking to him about why he apparently felt one or the other, as stated in his statement,” Grindel said in the football podcast Phrasenmäher.
Despite the months-long debate over the photos of <0xC3><0x96>zil with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets the resignation of 92-time international <0xC3><0x96>zil.
"I would have been happy if Mesut <0xC3><0x96>zil had continued to play for Germany.
I also assumed up to a certain point that this would be the case," Grindel said.
The 29-year-old had declared his resignation from the DFB team in July and also justified him on the grounds that he had not defended Grindel against racist hostilities during the World Cup.
The head of the DFB repeated his criticism of <0xC3><0x96>zil that he was not ready for a conversation with Bundestrainer Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn’t want to build pressure, but he knows it from football so that when you leave a team or change a club, you talk about it with your coach and I think it’s a pity that this conversation hasn’t come about so far.”
Linz: Garden hut in Schrebergartensiedlung burned
At 2.13 pm, the professional fire brigade Linz was alerted to a fire in Angererhofweg.
Because a high-voltage line leads directly over the schrebergart settlement, there was a risk of delay.
The professional fire brigade moved out and found the hut on arrival in full fire.
The roof had to be removed practically in its entirety and fire debris removed to an absolutely necessary extent.
According to the owner of the burning garden hut, he had a battery for charging at lunch.
This could possibly be the cause of the fire.
According to the fire department, the charger was in the range of the highest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire still needs to be determined, as well as the cause of the fire.
However, it should be considerable, because the owner had many collectibles in his garden hut.
Angry mother fights: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family on open road
What led Lindsay Lohan to this strange action?
She apparently wanted to snatch the children from an alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded") has herself streamed live how she apparently wants to snatch the children from a family in Moscow.
This is reported by the US portal "TMZ" and published a partial recording of the stream.
"Kissing Fortune" with Lindsay Lohan
The clip shows Lohan getting out of a car and going to a possibly homeless family, who wants to have her as a refugee family from Syria.
When the family almost flees from the actress, Lohan pursues the parents and their children.
She accuses adults of trafficking in children.
For all of this, she does not provide any evidence in the clip.
"The whole world is seeing this right now," Lohan can be heard in the video as she continues to follow the family down the street.
Apparently, she is trying to separate the children from their parents.
At some point, however, it seems to be enough for the obviously angry mother.
It looks like she turns around and Lohan misses a slap.
In tears, the actress then confesses how shocked she is - and she holds her cheek.
What moved Lohan to this action is currently completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This task has "Mascot" on the asteroid
The Hayabusa2 probe was launched in Japan in December 2014.
It is supposed to approach the asteroid Ryugu so much that it can suck in material from its surface and bring it to Earth.
The lander "Mascot" will stay on Ryugu.
Foreign ticker: number of deaths on Sulawesi rises to more than 400
After the severe earthquake of magnitude 7.5 and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 420 people have died.
The number of victims could increase even further.
The rescue teams have not yet penetrated the devastated and cut off from the outside world.
Elon Musk resigns as Tesla Supervisory Board Chairman
In the beginning there was a tweet.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk caused unrest in the stock markets at the beginning of August when he announced a withdrawal of the electric car manufacturer.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued him for fraud, but now both have agreed.
Tesla and Musk have to pay, and the Tesla CEO is withdrawing from the Supervisory Board, but he is allowed to remain Chairman of the Board.
Congress of the British Conservatives
Closely guarded - the Congress of the Tories
Birmingham becomes the stage of a power struggle.
The conference will focus on foreign policy, trade issues and development policy, but the four-day conference will be overshadowed by the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and the Brexit hardliners, at the forefront of former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson.
Referendum on a new state name
The Foreign Ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already agreed
Macedonia is a state in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been arguing about these names for years.
Now they have agreed.
The state of Macedonia is to be called North Macedonia in the future and the population will vote on this Sunday - whether it is okay?
Protests in Brazil against right-wing populists Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" - meaning Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before the presidential election in Brazil, the mood in the country is divided.
Thousands took to the streets in several cities to protest the right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro.
The “Trump of Brazil” gives up as an anti-system candidate and is thus at the forefront of the polls.
His strongest competitor is Fernando Haddad of the Left Workers’ Party.
Audi: "Dieselgate" reprocessing takes longer than planned
"The diesel task force still exists," development board member Peter Mertens told the industry magazine "Automobilwoche".
The detained and on leave of absence Audi CEO Rupert Stadler had announced in December 2017 that the task force will be disbanded soon.
"In the first quarter of 2018, all engine/gear combinations are expected to be tested," he said at the time.
Mertens said: “At the beginning of July, we reached an important stage in addressing the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analysis of our VTDI engines.
The task force was founded in September 2015 after the discovery of the diesel scandal at Audi’s mother Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the automaker had made “grave organizational changes” so that such a scandal would never occur again.
The VW Supervisory Board had postponed a decision on Stadler’s future on Friday and wants to discuss further this Tuesday.
The investigative authorities accuse the Audi chief of having approved the sale of diesel cars with false exhaust values after the emission fraud became known.
He was aware of the manipulations or deliberately ignored them.
Bram Schot is currently managing the company as Chief Executive Officer.
Due to the change to the new exhaust gas and consumption test standard WLTP, there are production failures at Audi, Schott said of the "Heilbronn voice".
Basically, he sees a declining demand for sedans such as the Audi models A6, A7 and A8, which are produced in Neckarsulm.
“The segment itself is difficult,” he said.
Schot focuses on electromobility.
The e-tron, the first Audi electric car, already has 15,000 reservations.
Grindel aims for re-election - Lahm to join the DFB presidential board
Mainz (dpa) - Reinhard Grindel wants to run for office as DFB president again next year despite criticism of his person after the World Cup and the <0xC3><0x96>zil affair.
"I'm doing my job and I'm trying to make them as good as I can," Grindel said as a guest at the ZDF's "Current Sports Studio" early Sunday morning.
You always have to seek re-election, I will.
And then we have to see if the support is there.
According to his own words, the head of the association would find it "strange" if he did not have "pleasure to work on the future project" after the award for the 2024 European Football Championship.
Grindel has been head of the association since April 2016 as the successor to Wolfgang Niersbach, who was overthrown over the summer fairy tale affair.
In autumn 2016, he was elected for a first full term of three years.
The next vote will take place at the DFB Bundestag on 27 September 2019.
According to Grindel, the future head of the European Championships, Philipp Lahm, will be working on the DFB presidency.
"I would be delighted if my colleagues in the Bureau agree that he will continue to advise in this role in the Bureau in the future and, of course, will be cordially invited to provide his experience in sporting matters," said Grindel.
He did not want to participate in speculations about whether Lahm could become his successor as DFB chief.
As a consequence of the affair around the photos of Mesut <0xC3><0x96>zil and Ilkay Gündogan with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that in the future an international player without a migration background should become an integration ambassador of the DFB.
Currently, Brazilian-born Cacau and Celia Sasic hold this office, the latter having family roots in Cameroon.
“If someone with no immigration background clearly influences society and football and says, ‘The topic is important, we have to take care of it’, that would also be an initiative to provide a better foundation for our local clubs where integration must work,” Grindel said.
Proper weight loss with half-smart scale
I've had a new toy for four weeks.
A scale that not only measures my weight, but also the body fat percentage.
Muscle and bone mass can also indicate them.
The thing also calculates the body mass index, but it's more for the sausages.
Doesn't he say anything about whether I replaced fat with muscle?
Basketball Bundesliga: Clear start successes for Berlin and Oldenburg
Berlin - ALBA Berlin has started the new season of the Basketball Bundesliga with a clear victory.
Against Science City Jena, the vice champion easily won with 112:55 (52:31) and offered a convincing game over 40 minutes.
Rokas Giedraitis was top scorer of the dominant Berliners with 20 points.
The international Johannes Thiemann (18 points), who was hired from Ludwigsburg, also showed an appealing performance in front of 9113 spectators during his obligatory game debut.
Ex-champion Brose Bamberg won at the obligatory game debut of coach Ainars Bagatskis with 84:80 (39:37) at s.Oliver Würzburg.
Augustine Rubit was the best pitcher among the guests with 24 points.
Würzburg professional Gabriel Olaseni scored 14 points.
Last year’s playoff semi-finalist MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg defeated the Fraport Skyliners from Frankfurt with 83:76 (41:34).
New national player Karim Jallow was the most accurate shooter on the team of coach John Patrick with 24 points.
The EWE Baskets Oldenburg started the new season with a clear success.
At the basketball club Löwen Braunschweig there was a clear 100:64 (48:30) and the first two points.
The new game maker Will Cummings surpassed the Oldenburgers with 25 points.
The Braunschweig, where NBA star Dennis Schröder has been majority owner since the start of the season, was disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26:1 run of the baskets quickly ensured clear conditions.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an opens mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an officially opened the Ditib Mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
During his three-day state visit, Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an had previously met with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, among others.
Criticism of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an called on the German government to extradite supporters of the Gülen movement living in Germany and take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens no matter where they live.
We will not allow sympathizers of the PKK or Gülen movement to shake our citizens and harm German-Turkish friendship," he said.
Before the opening of the Ditib Mosque, the city centre of Cologne had been partially closed.
Several thousand policemen were deployed, including snipers.
The Islam association Ditib is criticized for being considered an extended arm of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival": Music Against Poverty: Stars, Buhrufe und Schrecksekunden
Musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have promoted greater engagement in the fight against poverty and disease at a concert in New York Central Park.
"Engage wherever you can," Mendes said at the festival on the night of Sunday in front of around 60,000 spectators.
Thank you for coming here, this is a dream.
Cardi B appeared in a red outfit with fringe and golden microphone.
I'm nervous, I'm sweating, but it's okay, because I'm here and ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and aid organizations also appeared on stage at the multi-hour spectacle.
In between, however, there was a second of terror when many spectators thought the sound of a falling metal barrier was shot, got scared and tried to escape.
Suddenly there was a panic, people were confused.
Seven spectators were slightly injured, organizer Hugh Evans said.
However, the New York police and musician Chris Martin then calmed the people from the stage.
“No one is trying to hurt anyone,” Martin said.
You're all safe.
Tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available free of charge on the Internet, as every year.
Anyone who wanted to get one had to read and disseminate texts, photos and videos on the Internet about the global fight against poverty and disease.
For the numerous musicians and actors there was cheering and applause from the audience - buh cries for the Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
Together with his Democratic colleague Chris Coons, he spoke out on the stage for more equality between men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake spoke out in the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as Supreme Court judge, pushing many women to the head.
At least three women have filed allegations of abuse, including attempted rape against Kavanaugh, which he rejects.
Flake called for an FBI investigation of the allegations after two women, who claimed to have experienced sexual assault themselves, confronted him in an elevator on the way to the committee meeting.
"You can also come with me in an elevator at any time," Flake told the crowd at the concert in New York.
Freedom of the press: German government defends journalist's expulsion
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert has defended the expulsion of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an.
At the chancellery, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had put on a T-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription "Freedom for journalists" and had gone to the first row.
The T-shirt was not the problem, Seibert told Bild on Sunday.
It was a disruption to the course of the press conference.
The action of the journalist caused a strong unrest, which was unacceptable.
He ordered the person-protectors to take the man out.
Seibert said that it is not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellery.
This applies completely regardless of whether it is a legitimate concern or not.
The rules are the rules.
Many journalists are in jail in Turkey.
Many of them are accused of alleged espionage or support or membership in prohibited parties or the Fethullah Gülen movement.
The Turkish leadership blames the movement for the failed coup attempt on July 15, 2016.
Some of the accused journalists face several decades of imprisonment.
Even foreign journalists are not safe from the Turkish authorities: Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested at the beginning of September.
Most recently, the cases of detained journalists Me<0xC5><0x9F>ale Tolu and Deniz Yücel had caused a stir.
Although they were released and were able to return to Germany, trials are still underway in Turkey against the two.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
His fans usually know him as fresh and good-looking: Florian David Fitz.
There you have to look twice: Yes, this is really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The NDR-produced talk show "Inas Nacht" is known for humid conversations at the bar of the Hamburg harbour pub "Schellfischposten".
Moderator Ina Müller meets with her guests some beer, some wine or even high-percentage drinks to relax the mood and tongues.
Not a few celebrities also drink up courage for the mandatory singing inserts.
On Friday, another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time: The actor Florian David Fitz known from films like "Men's Hearts", "Terror - Your Judgment" or "The Horniest Day".
The Municher got the trip in the high north, but not at all good.
On Saturday, he posted a selfie - his face is completely crumpled on it, his eyes only two small slits left.
The bed selfie shows a completely drained Florian David Fitz.
But he is not sick, he only has a powerful hangover.
To his fans he posted some – probably not quite serious – insights that he has now gained: “Rule one: NEVER go to Inas Night.
Rule two: Never drink the black sow.
And Spritz.
And let go of the round of egg liqueur that Ina throws at half past three.
Alcohol consumption is truly written in the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans immediately posted a few tips to combat the aftermath.
They ranged from instant broth, fish buns or – probably the most targeted – headache tablets.
Others simply amused themselves at the sight of the usually attractive cinema star.
How Ina Müller survived the nighttime drinking is not yet known.
Since she has been moderating the TV fun at the counter since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be significantly more tried and tested...
A beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa struggles with vandalism and debris
The entrance to the 36-kilometre-long railway cycle path in the Little Red Riding Hood country in Treysa is difficult to find and garbage.
Recipes against the rampant vandalism are sought, but solutions are barely apparent.
Shards, cigarette tips, rubbish and rubbish, demolished trash cans and meanwhile dismantled signage - this is how the entrance with a seating group to the cycle path on the Haasse hill in Treysa has been present for a long time.
For the flagship railway bike path in the Little Red Riding Hood country a more than unfamiliar sight.
Members of the ADFC local group Schwalmstadt, but also others, have been involved in the topic for a long time, according to the cycling officer of the city of Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem has already been addressed in the Cycling Advisory Board.
There is no solution yet.
The proposals ranged from the relocation of the seating group to regular emptying of the waste containers and cleaning of the areas at the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the order of the day - regardless of possible further activities," says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that the topic has also been brought into the local advisory board.
It is not only the garbage that drives cyclists and local residents around - the seating group is a regular meeting place for celebrations on weekends.
Not only is it often loud, but it is also destroyed: posts are torn from the earth, trash cans are demolished, signs are bent over, seating furniture is smeared.
Volunteers have cleaned up more often, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
But the actions are only the proverbial drop on the hot stone.
They are annoyed that the resting place on the cycle path in Treysa is a meeting place for drinking.
"Along the entire cycle path, the focus is clearly on the Haasse hill," confirms the cycling officer, who is now also concerned about the new cycle site in Ziegenhain, which will be opened today.
"If they suffer the same fate, it will be really expensive."
Another idea is video surveillance on the hill: "Maybe this sets the threshold significantly higher for engaging in common property.
However, this would presuppose that a police strike would then pass by in a timely manner.
Basically, Wüstenhagen wants a development of the Haasse Hill.
It needs to be made more attractive.
With the frequency of the cycle path so far, one can be very satisfied.
Tourist marketing is still expandable.
Our bike path is of very high quality compared to others in Germany," said the ADFC members.
ADFC member Susanne Klippert assesses the situation in the Asheröder Strasse in Treysa as an extremely critical area of danger.
There is no turnaround on the Haeße hill.
With busy traffic, cyclists may have to wait in the middle of the road between the traffic flow on both sides," she explains.
This is not a problem for sporty drivers, but for the elderly and especially for children.
Music contest at the Kulturbahnhof: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and together.
"D to offer a song for Hiltrup" is the appeal of the district offensive Hiltrup, in the "Music Contest for big and small, young and experienced musicians".
A contest "with a wink in the sympathetic Hiltruper family", as Karl Franke put it.
In fact, it was soon a family reunion at coffee and cakes from the volunteers of the Kulturbahnhof.
Seven formations took place, from the one-man band to the big ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long-lived albatener living in Hiltrup, the nine of the "Hiltruper Starfarben", three members and three generations of the families Trenkamp and Claus, an ensemble from the Kindergarten Wemmerland and finally the Wemmerland.
This contest, District Mayor Joachim Schmidt said, is a novelty.
We have not seen this in other parts of the city.
What did the writers see connected to?
Among the places the Hiltruper See and the Marktallee were mentioned particularly often.
Rolf Ihmig chose the avenue in his smuggler-like song to be "Kö von Hiltrup".
The cultural station was also honoured.
Again and again it was about experiencing together in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke animated the short conversion breaks with short interviews with the performers or hints about her work.
Thus, Humberg learned that he had actually studied chemistry, but now also teaches guitar.
From sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann Franke was able to report that he recently appeared in Ludwigshafen - at a large event of BASF with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And Alvin Jasic, meanwhile, has placed all sorts of things on YouTube.
"It's not about winning," Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper gastronomy.
However, there was something special for the jury’s favorites – so that others could also hear their songs.
Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied can record an entire CD with sound engineer Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Himig with his Hiltrup-Schlager, which impressed Franke especially with his musicality, and the "Lummerland-Rudel": "a very nice performance" with ten children and two teachers on guitar and cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone else, the children performed again to the final - and even sounded "truly good" without electronic support, as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, catchiness of the melody and recognition value.
The jury included Gisbert Keller of the Westphalian School of Music, Andreas Klomfaß of the KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers of the Wirtschaftsverbund as well as Jan Kaven, chairman of the district offensive.
The district offensive had launched the event on the occasion of its tenth anniversary.
She regarded the event as a success.
Everyone was "very satisfied" and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon very full cultural station.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the game test
Players make up two teams facing each other.
For each page there is a screen, in which four cards with keywords, which you can decipher - the old trick with the red foil - only after you have inserted them.
This ensures that the other side can not read anything, even by mistake.
On the maps, for example, read from left to right: "1st Renaissance.
2nd window.
3. Dice.
4th Feast".
These are the terms that need to be encrypted from now on.
It is not the concepts that are to be guessed here, but codes.
In turn, one player per team is the encryptor.
He gets a code card that says "3.4.2".
In "Decrypto", the terms behind the secret foil are not to be guessed, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case: he should - in this order and in this example - describe the terms "die", "fest" and "window" - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team as far as possible does not; because this wins the game if he manages to crack the code twice.
So the encryptor writes down and reads aloud: "Throw" for the dice, "Lose" as an opposition to Fest; here, of course, something like "Party" and "Prague" would also be possible because he watched in school and knows the window crash there.
This is how it goes round by round, team by team.
Although you do not know the terms of the opposing side, it can be better combined with any hint that the encryptor gives there.
As mysterious as possible, but not too crazy, the descriptions should be so, otherwise you make it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
The most cryptic thing about "Decrypto" is unfortunately the rule booklet.
The players will probably have to study it for a long time before they can finally play.
The explanation video at decrypto.info on the net makes it easier.
But whoever gets started will be fascinated by how much feeling there is in this inconspicuous game.
Overall, however, "Decrypto" is not quite as conclusive as predecessor and genre prime "codenames", which also puts an agent theme on a game with fewer words, but is much better to play in small groups.
And if you’re just guessing and not winning points, you can easily invent a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man shows police Hitler salute and harasses guests in the pub
A 48-year-old man employed twice the Kulmbach Police Inspectorate on the night of Saturday to Sunday.
First he showed Hitler's greetings in the Upper City in a passing police patrol, then later he also noticed in the Upper City in a pub when he was harassing other guests.
After he clearly alcoholized did not comply with the given place assignment by the police, he had to spend the night at the police inspection Kulmbach in the detention cell.
In a sober state, he must then also answer criminally for the use of license plates of unconstitutional organizations.
Betriebswerk Pressig was home to the Schubloks
For decades, the railway plant in Pressig was the hub in the Frankenwald.
In 1991, a piece of railway history ended.
"When buffers hit buffers, you heard it in all the press," recalls Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and the station.
It didn't bother anyone.
Then the brakes squeaked and the carriages cracked.
It was pure railroad.
Statements emblematic of Dinkel’s home Pressig.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald was a place so shaped by the railway.
Here was the starting point of the steep ramp mountain route to the north, which has its peak in Steinbach am Wald after an ascent of about 220 meters.
To cope with this, former train and push blocks were needed, which had their home in Pressig.
In 1901, the Bavarian state parliament approved the construction of a railway workshop with 21 locomotive sheds, apprentice workshops, interconnection and railway mastery.
"Heartpiece was the hub, which had a diameter of 18 meters after a conversion in 1899," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, railway historian and professional railroader for 47 years.
Locomotives for the secondary lines Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben were also operated by the Bahnbetriebswerk (BW) Pressig, which was subordinated to Bamberg in 1968.
On 15 July 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported on a staff of 160 men; 13 steam and eight elloks were stationed in Pressig at the time.
The electrification of the line in 1939 already minimized the need for train and thrust blocks.
Since 1977, they have only been used in freight trains.
By 1991, at least 10,000 weighing units were still ranked per month.
Parts of the plant were discontinued in 1982, the rest in 1991.
Heidrich: "It is regrettable that we have not envisaged a better use of the site, also in terms of freight transport."
Even at Pentecost 1989, the Nuremberg Railway Directorate celebrated a pompous station festival in Pressig on the anniversary of "50 years of electrification Nuremberg - Saalfeld".
"There were 10,000 enthusiastic spectators here," recalls Georg Dinkel.
A little later it's off.
On 1 June 1991, the last 30 men were withdrawn, and the Pressig station was history.
"The rangers and hemming shoe lagers did the most difficult work in train traffic," recalls Dinkel.
Any mistake would have had fatal consequences.
Why the station Pressig-Rothenkirchen led to the reversal of the hierarchy of the two places and many other historical and current pictures can be found here in the infrankenPlus article.
Kerber wins the China Open
Peking (dpa) - Wimbledon winners Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the second round of the tennis tournament in Beijing, as before Julia Görges.
Kerber won the China Open 6:2, 6:2 against the French woman Kristina Mladenovic.
The next opponent of the world rankings is either Julia Putinzeva from Kazakhstan or the Spanish Carla Suarez Navarro.
Siegemund led 6:3, 4:2 against Darja Kassatkina when the Russian number 13 gave up.
The Schwäbin is now dealing with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
As part of the series "Kunst und Genuss", a special exhibition was opened in Mittelehrenbach on the weekend.
With great relief, registered organizers and visitors watched the ideal weather when the Special Vernissage "Windspiel-Performance" was opened in the outdoor area of the estate Dahlmann- Schmidt, Mittelehrenbach.
It takes place under the umbrella of the tourism association "Rund ums Walberla" as part of the series "Kunst und Genuss".
It opened its doors in the 15th year.
A great visitor reception showed the fascination of the exhibition.
21 copies of 20 artists can now be visited in Mittelehrenbach.
Landlord Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to the opening of the vernissage.
He has been there since the first hour.
Like Volker Hahn, who made a name for himself as the main organizer and artist alike.
Somewhat surprisingly, however, Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
Together with Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, however, he placed his task in proven, young hands with good future prospects.
Both have already participated actively in the selection of artists in the past and contributed to the design of flyers.
Once again this year, on the occasion of Kunst & Genuss, a special 70-cent stamp designed by them will be available at every art station.
This year's poster "Betzn austanzen", designed by Volker Hahn, can also be purchased there for eight euros.
Hahn was delighted with the high reception of the special exhibition.
For the musical frame Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg could be won.
As you walk through the spacious garden, the visitor quickly realizes that the title "Windspiel-Performance" literally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses it in a playful way.
These are works of art made of metal or ceramic, often with colored accents.
Already at the entrance of the property, the visitor is waiting on the right side of the "Glücksbaum" by artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a tree stump, brightened in color, playfully equipped with 20 windwheels, 24 horseshoes and 24 aluminum tubes as a sound piece.
With the sun flashing through the bush in the background, the object seems fairytale-like and invites you to linger.
From Eckental comes Barbara Waschneck, who prefers to dedicate 15 years of K&G to the event in three-dimensional letters.
There are many parts in motion in the wind.
Halfway through, Siegrid Frey from Eckental exhibited her work "The Wind the Heavenly Child".
And at the end of the area Volker Hahn shows his colourful imagination of clay, cement and stainless steel.
The theme "Windspiel-Performance" for strolling through the versatile art exhibition.
The special exhibition can be visited until 31 December 2018.
50 years of MGV 68 Albachten: Singer celebrates 50th birthday
1968 - that was the time of protest and the student movement.
And the Albanese people also breathed their displeasure at that time.
At least five of them.
They did not want to accept that after the dissolution of the church choir "Cäcilia" there should be no more singing life in the district.
In the meantime, it has become a legend: At a bank in the tin bush, they raised the MGV 68 alabasters from the baptism.
That was 50 years ago.
The anniversary was celebrated in the "House of Encounter".
"It's going to be full today," Chairman Jürgen Holstiege guessed, and he should be right.
There were 150 guests, a real success for the singers of Albacete.
On the occasion of their anniversary, they had revived the Foundation Festival.
For years it was a tradition, then there was a break.
Just in time for the 50th anniversary, the traditional festival was back.
An elegant ball was given to it, for festive clothing had been requested beforehand.
The guests were not sitting in rows of seats as usual in the "Haus der Begegnung", but comfortably at tables.
In the meantime, movement was required: DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln pulled the controllers and asked for the dance floor.
The singers of MGV 68 Albachten made the voice sound themselves.
For the occasion, joyful songs were required.
Almost set: "A day like this, as beautiful as today."
Matching the exquisite grape juice that many had in front of them, there was the "Rüdesheimer Wein".
In reference to another cool drink, "Humulus lupulus" sounded, which is the Latin term for "hope".
The choir leadership of Richard Homann, who is one of the five who were in the Tinnenbusch at the time, was once again sovereign.
"It's just fun to sing under his direction," said Holstiege, "he has such an easy way, it's a masterpiece that he does." By the way, this time not only men presented themselves singing.
The women's choir "Hohes C" was also a guest, whose repertoire includes mainly evergreens from the 20s to the 60s.
Finally, there was poetry.
Singer Theo Weber had sat at the desk until three o’clock in the morning to create his own rhymes.
And also Andreas Winterhoff presented well-sounding poetry.
There was also a big tombola.
The proceeds will be used to finance a visit to the All-Weather Zoo for the children of the Albatros Youth Centre.

Volleyball: 3rd league women: USC II wins high-class derby against BW Aasee
The ascender is marching.
Three matches, three wins - the reserve of the USC Münster under the auspices of Axel Büring is quite well in the third league.
No trace of shyness or frack sauces, the independents do their thing.
And that at 3:0 (25:15, 25:23, 26:24) against city competitor BW Aasee really well.
"That wasn't crystal clear, but we have already left an impression," says the somewhat satisfied coach.
BWA coach Kai Annacker immediately agreed: "This is a defeat with which we can live very well.
We are not dissatisfied." On the contrary.
In the evening at a subsequent birthday party of Ronja de Boer, the mood was good, the game ticked off.
Yes, the result is indeed an optical illusion.
In the third set, the guests had a set ball.
"If they get to the finish, a game like this can tilt," Büring knows from years of experience.
Eventually, the USC made everything clear with its routine forces and brought the full yield to the finish.
“We all know who’s on the other side of a derby like that.
That won't break our neck.
I have seen really good volleyball in phases," Annacker did not argue with the 0-3 - and immediately moved on to the agenda.
Where the journey goes for the independents seems unpredictable after just three match days.
"It's just too early for that," says Axel Büring.
Only in one he feels confirmed: "The 3rd league has an incredibly good level.
With regional league volleyball, this is not nearly comparable. In the fourth league, they do not want to look down anyway.
If the vest is not soiled in the next few weeks, they have to look up.
However, a first balance sheet can only be drawn after ten, eleven games.
On Saturday we go to Emlichheim.
Aasee takes place in Essen on 14 October.

About their marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
On the "dream ship" Heide Keller became a star.
Now she speaks openly about the fact that the series may have been involved in her marriage with Hans von Borsody.
Her role as the chief hostess Beatrice von Ledebur on the "dream ship" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 1, 2018 she left the ship forever.
The series that made her a star could be part of her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929-2013), with whom she was married for ten years.
“That could have been a reason, too.
Because I grew up with this work, traveled around the world with a suitcase alone and many of my admired colleagues perceived me on an equal footing," says Keller in a conversation with the "Bild am Sonntag".
At first, she had always been just "the wife of Hans von Borsody", but that had changed with the "dream ship".
Because now the journalists only called Heide Keller.
"Whether he liked it so well, I don't know."
She thinks it is possible that her husband at the time might have been quite envious, but "how many men also shyed away from Hans' conversations about problems and feelings."
Keller always tried to be the only one for Hans von Borsody and he didn’t want to know my fears, my weaknesses.
That means in good German: I have disguised myself", as she explains further.
She always felt like she wasn’t good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman that I never really was, even though I sometimes appeared bold and courageous on stage.
I wanted our love to be forever."
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller said yes again, "although I was afraid that it could go wrong a second time."
The day before the civil wedding, I sat crying in the wardrobe and wanted to cancel everything.
Borsody's marriage also failed.
Why didn’t they ever work with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
At that time, Keller had the love “as imagined in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not suitable for everyday use.
I have approached love far too naively."
The night butterfly, who regularly explores the nightlife of the city at the NZZ resort Zurich, has this time ventured to the ZFF opening party.
Our butterfly is not a moth, but a bit shy.
And the shining glow in which a green carpet is immersed on the Sechseläutenplatz blinds him excessively.
But it’s still a film festival, where more or less celebrities want to sunbathe in the spotlight.
So on this late Thursday evening, he torqued over the square to relax briefly in the "Aquaclean toilet oasis".
This is the name of the public toilet facility sponsored by a large sanitary company, which celebrates its premiere at the festival: The need facility on the ground floor of a new pavilion makes a lot of effort to exude a luxurious ambience.
That night, however, it stinks to heaven in the oasis of men for some reason.
So get out of here, over to the other side of the street: invited guests, who in the cinema next door the opening film "Green Book" has entertained at the best level, celebrate the beginning of the festival with a party in the three-storey department store as every year.
Its name fits perfectly with this film festival: as is well known, the works shown come from all over the globe.
What do you not have to think of in an article about this festival in order not to fall into sneak advertising for its 190 partner companies.
The butterfly ties a tie around the sensors, which has a good fairy to it, and two bully doorkeepers actually wave him in generous.
Inside, the guests push themselves, they dance to live music far after midnight or let themselves be presumed by DJ rhythms to which they shout at each other, and flush down with exquisite snacks with Cüpli.
In the delicatessen shop in the basement, oysters wait for swallowing mouths, next door the incomparable raw ham Culatello di Zibello is freshly sliced, a chocolate fountain is bubbled.
And the hammer is: All the sales shelves full of exclusive products have not been cleared for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to work without major losses.
You have to love this country for it!
The butterfly studies the sign at the escalator: "Wear a long dress, please be careful on the escalator".
If these are two separate instructions, he has gone wrong in the dress code.
But it is more of a conditional construction, and it has certainly saved lives.
In the household goods department on the upper floor, the winged one tilts a cocktail prepared with espresso called "Golden Eye", in line with the festival award.
The price for the best drink is not necessarily given to this mix, with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself.
And George Clooney, who has been promoting that brand for years, is not here that evening either.
But there, between local prominence, cash desk and kitchen items, a face passes by that seems familiar to the observer: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
His main character may not be far away.
And really: Viggo Mortensen walks right through the crowd, almost acting like a choir boy, with soon sixty.
He is not chatted, not caught, you shield at most stealthily.
Especially for this restraint, often misunderstood as a stalemate, international stars love this film festival.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with Cumbia dance
Trainer and former football star Diego Maradona is delighted with his team’s victory.
Argentine football legend Diego Maradona seems to have settled well in his new home country, Mexico.
After a 2-0 victory for his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57-year-old coach danced with a player in the cabin to cumbia rhythms, as shown in a video released on Saturday.
In the 15-second clip of a team member, Maradona dances in a yellow jersey, cheered by the players.
The Mexican second league defeated the Leones Negros 2–0 on Saturday.
After the game, Maradona called to a TV camera, "Always with my boys, always."
The 57-year-old has been training the Mexican club since the beginning of September.
Handball: Verbandsliga 1: ASV Send to last-minute crash "devastated"
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the Handball-Verbandsligisten ASV Senden, could hardly believe it: "So a bitter defeat". His protégés were "devastated" after the unfortunate 29:30 (12:14) - bankruptcy - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday evening at LIT Germania 2.
As in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst, they had not played badly over long periods, the broadcasters.
Only the initial phase "we have totally slept," the ASV coach was angry.
The landlords quickly led with 8:1, even the early break, which Bieletzki had taken, initially did not bear fruit.
"But then suddenly a ruck went through the team," Bieletzki summed up the second quarter-hour.
At the break, the backlog was only two goals.
Especially Sending's best, Marius Hintze, hit in the stage one time over and over again.
After the change, it became even better from a visitor’s point of view.
After 33 minutes, David Ernst balanced out at 15:15, after which the relay change almost continuously performed.
Four minutes before the siren, the lead was still seemingly calming three hits (29:26).
And then what?
Take the impartial into action.
Bieletzki usually avoids blaming others.
But: The 120-second time penalty, which Steffen Mühlhoff received, "was a joke".
LIT laughed well and hit four more times until the end - while the decimated ASV failed in the last attack.
The boys fought great, stood well against seven men at the back and threw again and again on the empty gate.
Only they can buy little for the compliments.
"Now a goddamn victory has to come," said Bieletzki.
ASV-Tore: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).
Hugging (1).
Bavaria: Woman missing for 30 years - police dig after parts of bodies
More than 30 years after the disappearance of a then 18-year-old from Naila (county of Hof), the police are looking for the woman’s remains.
Emergency forces dug up a street at Marxgrün on Saturday.
For this purpose, the street pavement and several layers below it were removed, as police and prosecutors jointly announced.
According to new findings, the missing person may not have been buried far from where she lived at the time.
The woman has disappeared since November 4, 1986.
At the time, the investigators did not rule out a crime.
Since last year, the Criminal Police Court has been working intensively on the case together with the public prosecutor’s office.
Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian Monument Protection Authority, the investigators encountered an abnormality under the road at Marxgrün using a ground radar.
With the help of a dog trained on the smell of human bones, the officials confined the site to a few meters.
The results of the excavations should be announced during the afternoon.
The hacker attack on millions of Facebook users shows the dangers lurking on the net.
However, users themselves can also provide additional security.
Instead of complicated letter sequences, users should prefer to use passphrases to secure their accounts on the net.
In addition, security updates, such as for Windows, should be installed quickly, and it does not hurt to equip computers with anti-virus protection.
Elon Musk, founder of electric car manufacturer Tesla, has escaped his impending dismissal as head of the multi-billion-dollar company.
He and the SEC filed an out-of-court dispute over misleading Twitter messages in which Musk could have lost permission to run listed companies.
As part of the agreement, Musk and Tesla each pay $20 million, and Musk also resigns from the position of chairman for three years, a position comparable to that of the German Supervisory Board.
Chief Executive Officer may remain against it.
In the settlement, which has yet to be confirmed by a court, neither Musk nor Tesla admitted misconduct.
The SEC had sued the world-renowned manager before the U.S. Federal Court in Manhattan for fraud.
Musk, who also heads space company SpaceX, is the public face of the losing electric car pioneer, which is now valued at more than $50 billion on the stock exchange.
Musk is not aware of any guilt.
Musk said he had done nothing wrong and was saddened and disappointed by the lawsuit.
He has always acted in the spirit of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7, Musk wrote to his more than 22 million Twitter followers that he might take the company off the stock exchange, paying $420 per share, the financing is secured.
Tesla was valued at $72 billion.
Later, Musk ruddered back: Tesla remains on the stock market.
Following the agreement, Tesla now has to find an external chairman, appoint two independent board members, and also set up a committee to monitor Musk’s communications.

Polls: 46 percent do not want Merkel as Chancellor by 2021
After the quarrels of the past weeks, GroKo receives several survey lows.
The SPD falls behind the AfD in a survey - Angela Merkel is viewed critically.
The AfD has overtaken the SPD in the Emnid Sunday trend for the Bild am Sonntag for the first time nationwide.
In the weekly survey of the opinion research institute, the AfD increases by a counter to 17 percent, the SPD gives a point compared to the previous week and ends at 16 percent.
The CDU and CSU also lose a counter and only reach 27 percent.
This is the lowest value to date for the Union in the Sunday trend.
The Greens reach 15 percent, the Left 11 percent and the FDP 10 percent.
If elections were held on Sunday, the ruling parties SPD, CDU and CSU would get only 43 percent of the vote together, according to Emnid.
Thus, the large coalition has currently lost the majority on the Sunday question at all major research institutes - with the exception of Allensbach.
The ruling parties consistently get 43 to 45 percent of the vote (Allensbach: 51 percent).
In the 2017 federal elections, they received a total of 53.4 percent.
For the other parties, the bandwidth is also large: The AfD, the second most powerful party in several polls, comes to 15 to 18 percent.
The Greens have 12.5 to 17 percent of the vote.
The left stands at an average of 10 percent, the FDP at 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, such surveys have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 percent upwards and downwards depending on the percentage of votes.
But the support for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in the population has also declined significantly since the 2017 federal elections.
Currently, only 48 percent of citizens believe that Merkel is the right person in the Chancellery, as the Emnid survey on behalf of the BamS revealed.
According to the survey, only one in two (50 percent) would like the big coalition to hold until the next regular federal election in three years, and 41 percent would be in favour of a new election.
In a further survey published on Saturday, there were also significant losses in popularity for Merkel.
Divided, the Germans also judge whether Merkel should run again for the CDU chairmanship in December.
According to Emnid, 47 percent are in favour and 44 percent are against.
Accordingly, 64% of the Union supporters want a candidacy, 35% do not.
Poster at Aldi: Reduced price to love happiness
Will Aldi become Tinder 2.0?
Who says that in the time of Tinder there are no more romantic get-together stories - he should talk to Aldi about turkey meat.
In times of digital "fast food dating" by Tinder and Co., the supermarket as a place to get to know the great love almost radiates an anachronistic romance.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced turkey meat, boxer short bargains at the Wühltisch or the favorite pudding is still in doubt a better story for the later grandchildren than a mere swipe to the right.
The Tinder app has a reputation for being less a contact but rather a slippery exchange.
We have dared the test: how do women react when you don’t talk about hot porridge for long in the first message?
Here is the amazing result.
It has real Hollywood love story potential when love happiness is preceded by an out-of-eye-lost-and-recovery plot.
If the guy then also contacts his worshippers at the e-mail address bio-putenfleisch<0x40>gmx.de, then that sounds very much like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and consorts - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
So it is the creator of this ad in an unknown Aldi store to wish that she will also find her dream man, with whom she has briefly talked about the "30 percent reduced organic pudding meat".
For the belief in the magic of analogue getting to know her, she definitely deserved her happy ending à la Hollywood.
Billerbeck: 500 lids for a life without paralysis
Since the beginning of the new school year, the Ludgeri School has been participating in the action "Cover against polio - 500 covers for a life without polio".
Polio is the abbreviation for poliomyelitis, an infectious disease caused by polio viruses.
The disease, referred to in German as polio, leads from paralysis symptoms to death.
In Germany, polio is considered to be eradicated, but there are still three countries worldwide where the disease occurs.
The cause of poliomyelitis, the polioviruses, so far can only be curbed by vaccinations, as stated in a press release.
Football: Reus and Zorc call for peace for Götze
Leverkusen (dpa) - BVB sports director Michael Zorc and captain Marco Reus have called for an end to Mario Götze's public discussion on form and fitness.
"We should stop worrying about Mario.
That's not good for the boy.
And that doesn’t do us any good,” said the giant, who was a friend of Götze’s, after the 4-2 victory in Leverkusen on TV channel Sky.
Zorc had already stressed before the game.
For him personally, this is not an easy situation.
Football: Eberl: No haste at contract talks with Hecking
Mönchengladbach (dpa) - Manager Max Eberl from Borussia Mönchengladbach sees no hurry in a possible contract extension with coach Dieter Hecking.
We have not even talked about a treaty yet.
There is no fixed date when we will do this.
"But there will certainly be a moment when we sit down and talk," Eberl told Sky on Sunday evening.
Football: Bezirksliga: VfL Wolbeck's appearance against SC Altenrheine is courageous
There were moments in this still young season, when Alois Fetsch went to court with his own.
Wortkarg, the coach of the football district league VfL Wolbeck, retired (internally) to reflect on the lack of willingness to perform on the green.
It's all history.
In the meantime, it runs around the Brandhoveweg again.
Taufrischer Beleg is the 1:1 on Sunday against SC Altenrheine, in the last season only breath-thin scraped past the climb.
Yes, I am very happy with the performance.
"We have tightened the spaces and put pressure on the ball.
That could be seen," Fetsch praised his boys and looked up each individual after the game to simply say "thank you" for so much resistance to the ambitious guests.
The coach had to make a system change after 26 minutes.
After the injury of Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - for him came Luca Rehberg - it went from the 4-4-2 almost seamlessly into a 4-2-3-1, in which Niklas Thewes waited for balls in the front line.
Wolbeck had significantly more play shares in the first section.
And chances.
But Frerichs before his out (17th), the substituted Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroer (38th) missed the lead.
Almost this would have avenged itself when the SCA in Minute 41 twice in the person of Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer dangerously beat up in front of the Wolbecker box - Tormann Damian Hallas proved to be the master of his profession.
After the break, the VfL rudely took full control.
Thewes from 18 meters narrowly failed.
Schroer came too late after 58 minutes at a Thewes entry.
With the change of Miles Geske missed Fetsch of the left side again a fresh cell cure.
When Altenrheines Chris Naberbäumer fell in the 70th minute Robin Westhues, there was an indirect free kick for the pitchers 18 meters in front of the guest housing.
The foul man stepped in and demonstrated his dangerousness at standards.
Westhues" thing with the right slap hit in the bottom left from the shooter's point of view - 1:0 (71.).
Twenty minutes left, which should be damn long.
And then that: VfL captain Florian Quabeck unhappyly flew the leather in the penalty room in the 80th minute.
Referee Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79.).
Bange minutes Wolbeck had to survive in the final phase, before Geske in the 87th minute from twelve meters still had the victory hit on the push.
Maybe it would have been too much of a good thing.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75th Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26th L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66th Geske) - Thewes

Eintracht Frankfurt wins 4-1 against Hannover 96
Starting position: Four points after five match days - that was not enough for coach Adi Hütter.
Against Hannover 96, Eintracht Frankfurt finally wanted to secure the first home win.
Stürmer Ante Rebic, who was in the starting elf for the first time after an injury, should help with this.
Also midfielder Luca Torró was there again after a pubic injury and should with his headball strength prevent the SGE from collecting further goals according to standards.
Reading material before the game: How Eintracht Frankfurt wants to crawl further up, which construction sites Eintracht Frankfurt has to close quite soon - and how Allan Souza somehow still wants to prevail at Eintracht Frankfurt.

Helicopter crashed in Kottingbrunn
During the landing, there was an accident at the airfield.
The four inmates were slightly injured.
Around 2 p.m. on Sunday, there was a drama at the airfield in Kottingbrunn.
The landing of a helicopter caused turmoil, as the police confirmed to oe24.
The helicopter was caught by a gust of wind, crashed on the ground and came to a halt on the side.
Immediately police, rescue and fire brigade were notified.
With a large squad, the emergency forces came to the accident site.
The <0xC3><0x96>AMTC emergency helicopter was also called for caution.
Inmates are only slightly injured
Fortunately, everything turned out to be largely harmless.
There is only one property damage.
The four inmates were only slightly injured and were able to go home on their own.
The exact circumstances of the accident have not yet been clarified and are the subject of investigation.
According to fire brigade spokesman Franz Resperger, there was a small fire, which could be quickly extinguished.
Report from the Allbright Foundation: Women remain a rarity in corporate boards
As a result, only 8 percent of the board members were female as of September 1, according to the report "Die Macht der Monokultur" (The Power of Monoculture), which was officially presented by the Allbright Foundation this Monday and was available to the German Press Agency in advance.
"The companies will have to position themselves differently, otherwise the international competitors will pass by them," said Stiftungs-Geschäftsführer Wiebke Ankersen.
In the US, the UK or Sweden, purely male-staffed leadership teams – with few exceptions – are no longer conceivable.
In comparison, the backlog makes German competitors less diverse, innovation-friendly and future-oriented.
It is a different corporate culture.
The slight increase in the proportion of women among the German stock exchange companies was also due solely to positive impulses among the companies of the medium-sized value index (MDax).
According to Allbright, only 6.8 percent of executives are female.
In the previous year, however, the value was still at 3.8 percent.
Among the 30 Dax companies – pioneers in recent years – the proportion of women stagnated.
Last year, 26 women worked on the boards.
"I'm sure the Dax companies will be recruiting more consistently women again next year - in their own best interests," Ankersen said.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement have signaled that they will continue to make no commitment to increase the share of "zero percent" so far.
Another picture emerges from the supervisory boards: As of September 1, the proportion of women was 30.5% - 45 more women and 68 less men than a year ago.
“If you recruit as many women per year for the boards of directors, a share of 40 percent would already be reached by 2023,” the report said.
Some even make messes: luxury cars: which manufacturer earns the most per car?
Ferrari deserves the best.
The Italians earn <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>280,000 with every Ferrari sold and make <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>69,000 operating profit.
Big cars, big profits: This slogan still applies today - in most cases.
Who among the noble providers makes the most profit per car.
Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How much do the luxury manufacturers collect per car they sell?
"Autopapst" and economics professor Ferdinand Dudenhöffer have dealt with this question.
His study shows that the differences are massive.
In the first half of the year, Ferrari made a profit of 69,000 euros with every car sold - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, only comes to around 800 euros, Tesla and Bentley even put on every car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are well in the race with prices ranging from an average of 33,000 to 38,000 euros per car and around 3,000 euros of profit before interest and taxes.

At the start of the anniversary, the officials moved under the sounds of the playman's train from Wiesenbronn through the village to the festival square.
The chairman of the tourist association, Wolfgang Starz, the mayor Jürgen Schulz and wine princess Lisa Kursawe welcomed the guests in the already crowded tent. "60 years to do something like this - this is an insane achievement for a small town with 800 inhabitants.
You can be proud of that," Starz thanked all the helpers.
Wine Princess Lisa II later symbolically approached the guests from the stage.
"It's nice that so many people have found their way to us after Abtswind". Later "Die Troglauer" provided a mood.
On Sunday, when the Abbotswinder Kirchweih was also celebrated, the club had set the beverage prices on the occasion of the anniversary in the afternoon as 60 years ago.
A festive evening for the 60th Wine Festival will take place on Friday, 5 October, in the guest’s house, before it goes into the second round a day later in the festive tent.
In Bonn: Emergency car power in Taxi
An emergency car is severely damaged next to a road.
In the collision of the emergency vehicle with a taxi, a 27-year-old passer-by was fatally injured.
When emergency doctors are called, they should help - best even save lives.
Such a rescue trip in Bonn took a deadly end for a 26-year-old.
In Bonn, a 26-year-old pedestrian was fatally injured in the collision of an emergency car with a taxi.
The taxi driver, the emergency doctor and their driver were seriously injured, the police said.
The 46-year-old driver of the emergency medical car had crossed a red traffic light on Saturday afternoon with blue lights and Martinshorn.
He then stumbled upon a crossroads with the taxi that was driving at Green.
After the collision, the doctor's car hurled against a traffic light pole and a tree.
He captured the passer-by who still died at the scene of the accident.
Emergency car driver and taxi driver seriously injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and the driver of the emergency car were severely injured and locked in their vehicles and had to be rescued by emergency personnel.
The 29-year-old emergency doctor, who was also seriously injured, was able to free herself, but the pedestrian could no longer help her.
Another emergency doctor tried to do this, but without success.
The three seriously injured were taken to hospitals.
The police, in close consultation with the Bonn prosecutor’s office, investigate who is responsible for the accident.
Manchester United loses again, for Mourinho we are uncomfortable
Manchester United has lost in the 7th round of the Premier League.
Against West Ham United, ManU is subject to 1:3. The way of the defeat is likely to be still to be talked about.
The scene was emblematic in the 74th minute, when recovered Marko Arnautovic scored 3-1 for West Ham; only three minutes after Marcus Rashford allegedly led the Red Devils back into the game.
Since they suspected an offside on Mark Nobel's pass, all Manchester defenders stopped, leaving Arnautovic all the time in the world to shoot the ball past helpless David de Gea.
It was the negative highlight of a previously insufficient performance over long distances.
Currently, the mood is quite different for United’s city rival Manchester City.
Citizens, trained by Mourinho’s great competitor Pep Guardiola, came out against Brighton & Hove Albion with an undefeated 2-0 victory.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling broke the side's defensive bar for the home team for the first time.
After a good hour and a double pass with the former goalkeeper, Sergio Agüero secured the sixth win in the seventh game, and thus also the jump to the top of the table.
Liverpool no longer table leader
Three days after the 1-2 defeat in the League Cup, Xherdan Shaqiri won a 1-1 against Chelsea with Liverpool in the Premier League.
Eden Hazard was the best man at the Londoners.
The 27-year-old's hit in the 25th minute remained the only hit of the game until the final phase.
Shaqiri, who came to the field in the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah, narrowly missed the match after 70 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge did better in the 89th minute with his Schlenzer.
After the Reds started the week with an impeccable record, Chelsea was not beaten for the second time.
First, the Londoners eliminated the team of Jürgen Klopp in the Cup, by the draw in the league the Blues Liverpool now also fell from the top of the table.
Like City, the two London City clubs Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) celebrated 2–0 wins.
The fans of the Gunners, in which Granit Xhaka played through, had to wait until the 81st minute for a success message against the surprise team from the County of Hertfordshire.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford defender Craig Cathcart was unhappy with Alex Iwobi’s entry into his own goal, only two minutes later Mesut <0xC3><0x96>zil made the decision with his third goal of the season.
Thanks to its fifth consecutive victory, Arsenal moved past Watford and is now immediately behind the big rival Tottenham in fifth place.
The Wolves remained unbeaten at the 2-0 against Southampton in the league for the fifth time in a row and occupy the 8th place.
VW’s core brand is missing: Paris Motor Show under the banner of diesel debate
The Paris Motor Show takes place every two years in alternation with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially not an issue but omnipresent: The diesel scandal and the struggle for driving bans and retrofits should not let go of the German car companies at the industry meeting in Paris.
At the 2018 Motor Show, they will show their innovations in the French capital from next week together with the competition from all over the world.
Diesel no longer plays a major role.
However, the possible exchange and retrofit offers for diesel owners in Germany, which are yet to be negotiated with the government in Berlin, should still be an important topic at least behind the shining scenes of the trade fair stands.
A big name is missing in Paris: the Volkswagen Group is there with Audi, Porsche and other subsidiaries, but not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are here and have, among other things, their first purely electric models with them: the e-tron of the Ingolstädter is to be released on the market at the end of the year, the EQC of the Stuttgart 2019.
Both have been officially presented.
BMW’s iNext will only be launched in 2021.
The focus in Paris is on the new 3 series.
In total, more than 250 exhibitors will be present this year from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to car companies, motorcycle manufacturers as well as numerous mobility service and software providers are each present in their own halls.
The trade fair, which celebrates its 120th birthday this year, takes place every two years in alternation with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, there were over a million visitors.
At least 380 people were killed in the severe earthquake and the following tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Dozens are still missing.
In addition, there are more than 500 injured.
The island was shaken by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first quake had a magnitude of 5.9, the second a magnitude of 7.4.
Communications and traffic connections have been damaged, enormous property damage has been caused.
After the quakes, the tsunami broke in across the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal town of Palu, hundreds had gathered on the beach for a party.
It is feared that the number of victims is still going up significantly.
So far, the numbers are only from Palu.
However, numerous other municipalities are also affected - along Sulawesi's west coast.
About 150 Bikers Celebrate Worship in Werdohl
Motorcycle pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated Sunday with a team of helpers the final service for the motorcyclists in the Peace Church in Eveking.
Werdohl - The square in front of the Peace Church in Eveking belonged to motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the graduation service for the bikers was on the program.
Frank Schröder is the motor pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and thus responsible for the pastoral concerns of the PS-strong two-wheelers.
Between April and September, the traditional motorcycle service (MoGo) is held at the Haus Nordhelle on the last Sunday of each month.
The bikers traditionally celebrate the end of the season at the Peace Church in Eveking.
About 150 bikers gathered there on Sunday to perform anything other than ordinary worship.
As early as 10 a.m., the cars were lined up in front of the entrance gate of the church.
At first, the biker breakfast was on the program and it could be strengthened with coffee and cake or even with a delicious curry sausage.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were also present.
The sermon was held during the biker service by pastor Dirk Grzegorek.
Singer-songwriter Valerie Lill provided the musical underpinning.
"Although bikers prefer blues rock, Valerie Lill prefers to use poetic-quiet tones," says Reverend Frank Schröder.
Yesterday, too, this was certainly a novelty in the history of motorcycle service.
Füchtorfer Heimatverein celebrates big feast: After the apple comes the milk
And during the actual day of action, Borisch was also active.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerge also aroused great interest.
He had his apple press in his luggage and demonstrated to his astonished spectators step by step the process from ripe apple to apple juice.
Then and when Hartmann-Niemerge left the field to the children and had them fill the apples in the big funnel.
With a little muscle strength, the apples became a finely crushed mass.
Not many of the children could imagine how it would turn into a tasty drink.
But they were also able to take a look at this important step of work on this late Friday afternoon.
Packed in moulds and wrapped in nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerge stacked the little pieces of apple layer by layer, looking a little like chopped goods.
Thanks to a certain amount of technical support, the final step was no longer so difficult.
The freshly squeezed juice gradually ran into a large container.
But the farmer had already bottled specialties with him.
So he opened his "treasure box" and presented the elderly visitors the latest feather whites.
The demand for the good drop "Made in Füchtorf" was correspondingly high.
In a cozy atmosphere, the parents got into conversation, while the children could not only follow the process of pressing apples, but also discover the built bouncy castle for themselves.
Activists of the Füchtorfer camaraderie of former soldiers also participated in the festival and invited to entertaining games at some stations.
In the coming year, the home club will also offer an action day.
Then, however, as Gregor Krützkamp emphasized, the home house in the heart of the asparagus village will not be the place of action.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also obvious due to the topic: after all, it will be around the milk.
1:4 against Frankfurt: Hanover with fourth season badge: "Fucking situation"
Frankfurt/Main After the fourth consecutive Bundesliga defeat, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed professionals from Hannover 96 around him and gave them courage.
A lot of positives were not seen before in the 1:4 (0:2) of the table last at Eintracht Frankfurt.
"It's a shitty situation, but you have to get out of it as a team," 96-football professional Pirmin Schwegler said, pushing after: "This is of course disappointing, because you always take a lot of action."
The still victorious Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslija (86.) hit the connection, stands with two counters at the bottom and are in their current constitution a descent candidate.
Led by the outstanding Ante Rebic, on the other hand, Frankfurt celebrated its first season home win.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45.+1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59.) and Luka Jovic (89.) scored the goals for the DFB Cup winner in front of 46,300 spectators, who advanced to the table after the successful rehearsal for the European League match against Lazio Rome with seven points in the midfield.
Croatian deputy world champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive action of the Hesse during his starting eleventh debut and never got to grips with Hannover’s defense.
The striker, long beaten after the World Cup, showed with his pace and assertiveness why he is so valuable for harmony.
In addition to Rebic, the Brazilian Allan, loaned out by FC Liverpool, also stood for the first time in the initial formation of the Frankfurters, who started vibrantly.
Lucas Torró (17th)'s fake header on the goal net was the first time that he was in danger.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped in a promising position at the last moment by the 96-defence around the Brazilian Felipe, who replaced the short-lived Kevin Wimmer (back).
The leadership for the landlords fell almost inevitably and completely deserved.
Filip Kostic lifted the ball into the penalty area after a blocked corner, Haller extended his head in front of the goal, where Ndicka only had to hold his foot.
It was the first Bundesliga goal for the French second-league defender AJ Auxerre, who came in the summer.
And Frankfurt was down before the break.
This time, Haller matched his storm partner Rebic, who skilfully tanked himself and gave 96-goalkeeper Michael Esser no chance.
In the halftime, Hannover coach Breitenreiter reacted to the weak idea of his eleven and brought in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt two new offensive forces.
The Lower Saxony now played forward a bit more courageous, but igniting ideas remained unchanged until just before the end, when at least the follow-up hit was still successful.
The Hessians were much more efficient.
After just under an hour, Rebic started a solo and then crossed on De Guzmán, who only had to push the ball into the empty goal.
The rest was only show running for the Frankfurters against overwhelmed guests, Jovic also hit a minute before the end.
The Morlaixplatz becomes the party mile
Despite cool temperatures, there was a good atmosphere at the Oktoberfest in the city center.
The Munich Mayor Dieter Reiter made it before millions of audiences at the opening of the 185.
Munich Wies'n last week with two strokes.
Geisingen: Geisinger Christians celebrate Holy Cross Festival
The Geisinger Catholics celebrate the Holy Cross Festival on September 14th or on the Sunday afterwards.
The festive service takes place in the city church, followed by a procession to the Holy Cross Church with the final blessing.
The Church of the Holy Cross is home to the shot Christ, who originated in the 30-Year War and is said to have been shot at by a Swedish soldier according to legend.
Then blood flowed out of the gunshot wound.
This resulted in a great pilgrimage to the Shot Christ, which then also led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church.
This is still not finished, only the altar room stands, the missing long house is indicated by the trees.
In his homily, Reverend Adolf Buhl reminds us that the Cross is a sign of hope, comfort and life.
The service was poorly attended despite the importance for the Geising parish.
After the service, the procession to the Church of the Holy Cross took place and with the final blessing the church part of the feast of the Cross ended.
For many years, the Catholic Church Choir has been inviting the secular part of the festival to the Catholic parish house.
The choir members provided the visitors with hearty food as well as a wide selection of cakes and weather adapted, farm ice cream.
Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger, on behalf of the parish, informed visitors about the damage to the facade, roof, sandstone works and windows as well as the upcoming construction measures, which will continue until next year.
After the scaffolding has been in place for some time, the damages could be determined more precisely and the individual tenders could be prepared more concretely.
It is certain that the renovation will be more expensive than planned, because the damage already existing a few years ago has become larger, but more have also been detected, which was only made possible by the inspection by means of scaffolding.
The base plastering work has been completed, the natural stone work is to be started before the winter and we hope to be able to complete more than half of these work this year.
Inauguration: New residence in the Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße
Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens a new residence for people with disabilities in Münsterblickstraße.
That in the Münsterblickstraße "a very special house" is now handed over to its destiny - all those present agreed on the inauguration date.
After all, the twelve wheelchair users who have already lived in the Danube-Iller residence for some time depend on the special architecture of the new building.
Larger corridors, hallways and doors, larger rooms and barrier-free access for all areas, architect Rudolf Bader has taken into account in his concept.
The first plans began about eight years ago, when the former officer building of the US Army was put to the test for the residents with Handycap: "The house had come into the years and no longer up-to-date in the equipment," Bader explained in retrospect.
In 2016, the excavators moved on to tear down the house.
The new building should be as friendly and bright as possible, so that the residents can feel comfortable in it, according to the architect.
Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens new residence
Life Aid invested around 4.6 million euros in the new building.
The Free State contributed 2.4 million euros, the district of Swabia 450,000 euros.
According to architect Bader, the construction works have remained within the planned framework - both in terms of time and financially.
The managing director of Lebenshilfe, Jürgen Heinz, also thanked him for this.
The balancing act between an accessible and at the same time fireproof construction was not always easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had erected a home with the many requirements, which allowed the residents to experience the freedom to move even without help from others.
Gertrud Kreutmayer, head of the social administration of the district of Swabia, said: "The house is oriented to the special needs of its residents, who need tools to be mobile."
The homeliness and functionality were well combined, Kreutmayer said.
And further: "The property in this position is a real fortune, because it is no longer possible to acquire it in today's situation."
Overall, the new residence in the Münsterblickstraße offers almost 1500 square meters of space for 30 people with disabilities, which are divided into three residential groups.
Lebenshilfe Managing Director Heinz is proud of the eleven full-time employees, all of whom are employed by tariff.
Germany: Schwesig laments differences between East and West
Berlin - Before the day of unity, the deputy SPD Federal Chairman Manuela Schwesig appealed to all compatriots not to accept the disadvantage of East Germans.
There are differences that hurt after almost 30 years of unity.
We cannot be satisfied with these differences," the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern told the "Tagesspiegel am Sonntag".
The goal must remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country.
It is unacceptable that East Germans on average worked longer than the people in West Germany, but would receive 15 percent less salary.
"I can't explain that to anyone almost 30 years after German unity," Schwesig said.
North Korea: Will this cute dog end the Korean conflict?
The one-year-old Pungsan hunting dog is said to smooth the waves between the two Koreas.
In an effort to relax relations with Seoul, Pyongyang has given South Korean President Moon Jae as a gift to two North Korean Pungsan hunting dogs.
According to Moon's office on Sunday, the two about a year old dogs reached their recipients on Thursday.
They passed the border town of Panmunjom along with three kilograms of dog food to "facilitate the acclimatization" of the animals.
The dogs with the thick white fur, pointed ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They are part of the national cultural heritage of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The North announced the gift of friendship at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in mid-September in Pyongyang.
The two countries also agreed to participate in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympic Games and to jointly apply for the Olympic Games in 2032.
In the course of the mutual rapprochement, Kim also agreed to close the test facility Tongchang Ri for rocket propulsion.
Austria’s Moving History in the Mirror of 99 Documents
What is Austria?
On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated in this commemorative year for almost ten months, numerous new books have been published, which usually answer this question in retrospect to the past hundred years.
Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and director-general of the Austrian State Archives, puts it quite differently in the magnificent "Bilderbuch" Austria, which will be published on 1 October.
New Week, New Opportunity for the Government
This is the unofficial motto for the working week of the Great Coalition which begins today.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech, in which the Chancellor and her ministers from CDU, SPD and also from the CSU last did not summon the "return to work in kind" mantra.
This may have led some craftsmen, doctors, cashiers and other working citizens in this country to the legitimate question, what is actually the difference between work and technical work, but be it that way.
If the federal government is now ready to re-dedicate itself to its mission - to governing - it should not be deterred by conceptual debates.
Whether the Union and the SPD can actually achieve something together after the provocations and blasphemies of the last weeks will probably already be shown on Monday.
In the evening, the leaders of the ruling parties meet to form the Coalition Committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to convene this round regularly to defuse conflicts early; a lesson from all the dispute.
First of all, however, with the diesel retrofits and the skilled labour immigration law, conflicting topics are once again on the agenda.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants to let the car companies get away with exchange premiums, SPD and CDU see the manufacturers in the duty to technically retrofit older diesel.
While the diesel crisis has marked an approximation over the weekend, the Union and the SPD are still far apart in the planned skilled labour immigration law.
The SPD calls for a stay perspective for rejected asylum seekers who work or train.
The Union is strictly opposed to the "change of track" from the asylum system to the labour market.
So there will be another conflict among the coalition partners – and how could it be different?
Not Equal and Equal joined forces at GroKo, but three partners with sometimes very different social views and priorities.
Dispute is good.
Without controversy, a society marked by such diverse, sometimes contradictory, interests will not progress.
In order to be constructive, however, disputes must not be exaggerated again for party tactical reasons on the question of being or not being.
It’s still about politics, not theater.
Union and SPD should argue - but always have the reality of people's lives in view.
What is feasible and beneficial to many?
With this guiding question, both the diesel and the lane change question can be clarified pragmatically - and thus regain confidence.
This is what the popular parties must fight for now.
Pilz checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister in the Visor
Does the Minister of Labour infringe the current law?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look at this.
“Really day and night” her legislators had been working on the social security reform, reported an exuberant social minister at the presentation of it two weeks ago.
In the case of list mushroom mandate Daniela Holzinger, the statement of Beate Hartinger-Klein (FP<0xC3><0x96>) comes astonished - she now brings the matter to parliament via inquiry.
She assumed that the minister was only expressing her enthusiasm for her team’s efforts and in no way wanted to announce violations of applicable service law in front of current cameras.
Nevertheless, she now has questions in order to be able to acquitte Hartiner of any suspicion.
Police toss a street in search of women’s bodies
Marxgrün - For a long time, the police did not want to comment on this.
Now there is a confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, the state road between Naila and Bad Steben has been dug.
The route will be closed in the Marxgrün area until Monday.
Previously, the investigators had previously used an archaeological dog.
The dog, specially trained for the smell of old human bones, was finally able to narrow down the relevant area to a few meters, together with his guide, in repeated use.
In addition, together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the top Bavarian Heritage Protection Authority, a soil anomaly was discovered in the area of the aforementioned road section.
For more than a year, the prosecutor’s office and the criminal police court have been working on the missing case.
Again and again, a cycle path was closed at Marxgrün and examined with sonar devices, because the investigators suspect that Heike’s body may have been shredded here in the course of the new construction of the state road 30 years ago.
Colour powder and eggs: riots in Barcelona before Catalonia's anniversary
On Monday, the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia will be celebrated for the first time.
But before that, there are riots.
The separatists did not forget the police operation in autumn 2017.
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum on October 1, 2017, clashes between separatists and the police have occurred in the centre of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked with color powder by the independence advocates, among other things, when they wanted to prevent them from approaching a demonstration by the national police and the civil guard.
Around 3,000 police officers from the Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil wanted to honor their colleagues who were deployed in the polling stations last year during the illegal referendum.
At the time of the attempt to prevent citizens from voting, there had also been violence.
The Catalan police had formed a chain to keep the demonstrations separate from the separatists and central state security forces, Spanish media reported.
However, some of the approximately 6,000 separatists had then attempted by force to break the police chain, and the officials threw, among other things, color bags and eggs.
Six people were arrested and 24 others were slightly injured, according to the authorities.
This Monday marks the first anniversary of the independence referendum.
After the vote and a subsequent decision to secede the wealthy region of Spain, the central government in Madrid had put Catalonia under compulsory administration in autumn 2017.
The then regional president Carles Puigdemont fled to Belgium in exile.
Other politicians also moved abroad.
On the other hand, several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement remain in U-detention.
New elections were held in the region in December.
Following the assumption of the new Catalan government in May, the forced administration was terminated.
But the new regional president Quim Torra also insists on the "right to self-determination" of the Catalans.
Football: Oberliga Westfalen: Gathered perplexity: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen split goals
Red-white Ahlen continues to step on the spot.
Also at FC Gütersloh it was only enough to a 0-0 draw.
In front of 438 spectators at the Heidewaldstadion, they turned out to be a assembled perplexity.
The first half was very manageable by the entertainment factor.
Those who would rather get a beer or a bratwurst could do so without worries.
There was no risk of missing an opportunity, as there was virtually none.
First shot after half an hour
Gütersloh's Nick Flock was responsible for the first (harmless) goal in the entire game in the 28th minute.
The Ahleners had the best - and in principle only real - opportunity when Cihan Yilmaz FCG goalkeeper Frederic Westergerling forced a parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the penalty area limit.
The hosts were even more harmless.
Their most effective action was an early change.
Stürmer Lars Schröder had to be replaced due to injury, for him came Sinan Aygün.
After the change, both teams decided to do something about the growing boredom.
In the 48th minute, Sebastian Mützel from 18 meters just above the case and after an hour, the Gütersloher also appeared for the first time offensively.
After a baller conquest by Matthäus Wieckowicz, it was fixed.
Nick Flock (62nd) "crowned" the quick-released counter over Sinan Aygün with a slack shot in the arms of RWA goalkeeper Bernd Schipmann.
In addition, they played with a header from Wieckowicz (66th) after a cornerball from ex-Ahlener Tim Manstein.
RWA interim coach Angelo Daut responded, bringing first Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60th) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70th).
It did - nothing.
The Ahleners did not achieve more than optical superiority thanks to their own initiative.
It was only in the 91st minute that Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but neither did it.
Angelo Daut then tried to highlight the positive: "I like that we played to zero", but unfortunately the zero was also in the front.
"We were not as dangerous this time as we were against Holzwickede, even though our opponent did not want to play here," stated RW Ahlens interim coach.
Offensively, “everything slipped a little bit” against a team that just wanted to defend.
At least I didn’t feel like we could get a counter goal,” Daut said.
To his dismay, however, as a spectator, he did not feel like his team could score a goal.
The idea was too poor for that.
Reckenfelder Thanksgiving Market: Fortunately there are enough Kreimers
Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfelder table publishing office, for whom these donations are intended.
The volunteers assure: "These donations will also remain in Reckenfeld."
At the opening, the sky was shining blue, but the space was still a bit empty, but that was to change over the course of the day.
Because: "It's so sociable here, that's why we're here today," said one visitor.
Organizer of the festival Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed the guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit as always with a decent pinch of humor.
For the couple Brockmann, who was supposed to be weighed against food, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer jumped in at short notice.
Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has fallen ill.
But there are plenty of Kreimers.
And the "replacement" was not enough to entertain musically the increasing number of visitors in between.
This was so well received that at a later hour some folk songs were sung along.
"Just great," said Marcel Kreimer.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to accommodate the opening date in his schedule this time.
He is pleased with the many actives with their stalls, including mainly clubs.
"Actually, there should be no such thing as a table at all," he nevertheless thanked the action of the men's choir.
Andreas Hajek praised the commitment of all those who were in action at the booths and also included the other festivals held in September and the "Clean up" campaign.
Our garden town gives itself a colorful coat of paint - here goes something.
Then the maikranz was taken off by Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück with the help of the fire brigade and brought to the winter quarters.
Many stalls were worked for the physical well-being.
From sweet to hearty, everything was there.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only lived in Reckenfeld for a year, became creative with his scrubber saw.
He had veneer work, beer covers with stretch fields motifs and a lot more on offer.
Three beekeepers offered a specialty: "Reckenfelder Honig", brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschlüter.
The latter has a specialty.
Honey cake in glass, of course with honey from my own production.
As little Elsa had to access again and again, the cake tasted so good.
It is the conviviality that then allowed the visitors to stay for a long time until the evening hours, even without a stage program that does not exist at the autumn festival.
Lubrications with local political message: No successful advertising for skateboarding
In Lengerich, unknowns have advertised for the construction of a skate park in a barely conducive way.
In several places there are corresponding lubrications, says Jürgen Kohne of the city administration at the request of the WN.
In at least one case, criminal charges have been filed against the police for damage to property.
The three words "Skatepark für Lengerich!" are printed in large letters on signs at the Gempt Hall and the Old Town Hall, among others.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that already after the professional selection fair on September 19, a corresponding lettering was discovered on the advertising sign on the staircase to the gempt bistro.
Since the short message was apparently left "only" with an edding at the time, it could be removed without any problems.
"A few days later, it was there again, this time sprayed up," says Rottmann.
He assumes that the corresponding advertising sign must be replaced.
This particular case gets a special touch by the fact that several large companies from Lengerich are also mentioned on the board.
If the skate facility is built, its realization will also be made possible by sponsors.
There are already promises, explains Jörg Hesselmann from the municipal department of school, sport and culture, without giving a name.
It is possible, however, that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that are on the smeared board.
For years, local politics and administration have been dealing with the subject of skateboarding.
After the old at the fiber clinic had been dismantled, the search for an alternative location began after some time.
Finally, the Council voted in favour of the parking lot for firefighters.
However, this intent was not implemented - too many factors apparently spoke against a construction at this site.
At the end of June there was a turnaround.
The members of the Main and Finance Committee voted unanimously for the Gutenberg School area.
Jürgen Kohne says about the state of affairs that the administration is currently in the middle of concrete planning.
The last word is the city council.
He expects a decision to be made this year, so that it could be built with a positive vote in 2019.
Air traffic congestion gets worse
After the European air traffic chaos this summer, German air traffic controllers see no signs of improvement in the coming year.
“This year we had wind, in 2019 we will have strong winds, and then comes the storm,” said Matthias Maas, head of the air traffic control trade union, to the German press agency before the aviation summit in Hamburg on 5 October.
An important reason for the numerous delays and flight failures is the long-known shortage of personnel in European air traffic control systems, for which there is no quick solution.
"The airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the coming year, but training new pilots will take four to five years," the trade unionist said.
Europe-wide, the market for ready-trained pilots is swept away.
Around a hundred people were missing in the center of Karlsruhe alone to monitor the upper German airspace.
Maas again criticised the fact that various aviation trade unions were not invited to the summit.
In the Hanseatic city, representatives of the federal, state, air traffic control, airlines and airports will meet on Friday to address the causes of the delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work densification and overtime, that will not be possible without us," explained the head of the GdF, which has many members at the German air traffic control company.
Maas again blamed the EU Commission for the pilot misery.
Traffic forecasts for the regulatory period up to 2019 were far too low.
The resulting cost targets and personnel savings in national air navigation services are now fully in line with the operational business.
Maas appealed to the Federal Minister of Transport, Andreas Scheuer (CSU), to advocate in Brussels for regulations that "do not cut the air farther".
Currently, the EU targets are being agreed by 2024 and further tightenings are to be feared.
The EU is subject to constant lobbying from the airlines.
"Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary and his colleagues are now harvesting exactly what they have sown in recent years," Maas said.
He hopes that the high delay costs incurred by the airlines will lead to a change of thinking.
The GdF will only contribute to the improvement of the situation if the German Air Navigation Service (DFS) offers a “voting training and future pact,” Maas said.
The so far announced admission of 120 pilot students per year over the next five years is just enough to compensate for age-related declines.
The necessary personnel build-up is not yet connected with this.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board approves Group restructuring
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board voted unanimously in favour of the plans for the restructuring of the Group.
According to the will of Thyssenkrupp interim chief executive Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed as CEO at the meeting on Sunday, the crisis-stricken group is to be split into two independent companies.
Both companies will be headquartered in Essen and listed on the stock exchange.
There should be no additional reductions in personnel beyond the already known reductions in the administration.
After two resignations, the control body only has eight members on the capital side.
This is faced by 10 employees.
However, the final decision is expected to take a general meeting in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG will include, among other things, the 50 percent share of the merged steel business with Indian partner Tata.
In the second company Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG, the business with elevators and supplies will be bundled.
Barcelona: Violence at demos by police officers and Catalan independence advocates.
At two simultaneous demonstrations of Spanish police and Catalan independenceists in Barcelona, there have been violent clashes with numerous injured.
According to the city administration, about 3,000 police officers from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, as well as about 6,000 independence advocates demonstrated.
The Catalan police tried with a large crowd to keep the two protest trains away from each other.
According to the forces, however, independence advocates repeatedly tried to break the security barrier.
They would have attacked the officers with paint and throwing bullets.
There were also riots between the participants of the various protest movements.
According to emergency services, 24 people were injured.
Police said there were six arrests.
Better salaries and appreciation of colleagues
The police wanted to pay tribute to the colleagues who had taken action against the independence referendum in Catalonia, which was banned by the Spanish central government almost exactly one year ago.
At the same time, they demanded better salaries.
Members of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil feel it is unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers earn significantly more than they do.
The protesters felt it was a provocation that the Spanish police were demonstrating in Barcelona.
"Why did they come here to protest?" asked the 55-year-old Catalan protester Manel Perez to AFP.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they drowned us a year ago.
A 31-year-old policeman from the Balearic Islands, who only wanted to give his name with Daniel, rejected the accusation.
"Of course, we want to support our comrades, who did only their duty last year: defend the law," he said.
But the demonstration is there to enforce our rights and we are doing it in Barcelona because it is a big European city and there is more echo here.
But he and his colleagues "didn't come to provoke," the policeman assured.
Breakdown allowed access to personal data of British ministers
A vulnerability to a cell phone app has resulted in the personal data of ministers and MPs of the Conservative British Tory party being temporarily accessible to everyone on Saturday.
According to British media reports, several ministers received phone calls from unknowns after the breakdown became known a day before the Tory party meeting in Birmingham.
Two people trapped on B217
The Hanover police report on Sunday morning a serious traffic accident on the Bundesstraße 217, Hamelner Chaussee, at the exit of Wettbergen in the direction of driving Ronnenberg.
Two people were killed when they drove their car against a tree.
The car is currently on fire.
Emergency personnel are on the spot.

Football: Juve coach praises top game: Ronaldo's best game
The Portuguese star striker "played the best game together with half an hour of Valencia this evening," praised Juve coach Massimiliano Allegri after the 3:1 (1:1) victory of the record champion against the SSC Naples.
For the coach, the expensively bought star was the decisive man in the important game against the pursuer, even without his own goal.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and is doing well," Allegri said.
Even though we started with tactical mistakes, Ronaldo was very good at our first goal - and from that moment on we have grown.
Thanks to Ronaldo's three goal assists, Juve turned the game after the early lag by the hit of Dries Mertens (10th minute) and suspended the worst chaser for the time being.
The goalkeeper picked up by Real Madrid initially put on former Bundesliga professional Mario Mandzukic, who took the lead with a double pack (26th/49th).
And after a corner by header, Ronaldo also did the preliminary work to the goal of defense chief Leonardo Bonucci (76th), who just had to push in just before the goal line.
“There are a lot of them,” the coach praised.
But of course Allegri also wants to see goals from the attacker, who is the record scorer in both the Champions League and the Portuguese national team.
"We need to be even better at serving him," the coach said.
Best Juve scorer is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three on the account.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than 100 million euros, the supremacy of Juventus seems to be even more overwhelming.
Seven wins in seven games is the flawless series in Serie A. With 21 points, the champion of the past seven years has already six points ahead of Naples.
The second-place finisher, coached by former Bayer coach Carlo Ancelotti, was not without a chance against Turin.
But at the latest after the pitching of the already warned Mario Rui (58th) the top game was decided.
The Portuguese had to get in too hard against Paulo Dybala with yellow-red off the pitch.
"We played well against a good Naples," commented the coach from Turin.
Emre Can was also able to feel addressed there.
The German national player has prevailed at Juve.
The professional came from FC Liverpool was in use in all seven league matches.
The midfielder also played in the Champions League match against Valencia, which Allegri with the "half hour" said: Ronaldo had flown from the square in the 2-0 victory of the Turiner and is blocked for the home game on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West Changes His Name
With a particularly quirky appearance, rapper Kanye West has attracted attention on the US TV show "Saturday Night Live" on the weekend.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume caused frowns and question marks among the spectators.
In addition, the 41-year-old announced a name change on time for the release of his new album.
Henceforth, he should only be called "Ye", according to the musician.
"The creature that used to be known as Kanye West," he tweeted after the late singer Prince took his stage name.
The pseudonym is not news.
His tenth album was released under this name.
In an interview with the radio station KRRL, the artist had stated that "Ye" had a religious meaning for him.
“I think ‘Ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means ‘you’,” the rapper said.
Football: Kreisliga A1 Münster: Finally!
Got it!
Hoetmars coach Averhage made no secret of his disappointment.
It was a weak game for us today.
The opponent was simply more grippy, we almost never had any problems with him.” Accordingly, the list of Hoetmar shot opportunities reads thinly.
Grade two goals in 90 minutes, so games can rarely be made positive.
Fußball-Kreisliga A1: SC Hoetmar is subject to SG Sendenhorst with 0:2 (0:1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
The SG also had only two options in the first round, but the first used Maik Krause from an acute angle to lead early (7th).
In the 43rd minute Steffen Uphus could have raised, but after great preliminary work by Krause, he rearranged free standing.
The hosts had only a double opportunity when Moritz Höne first failed to Torsteher Jos Schuhmacher and in the aftermath Jan Blome also found his champion in the Sendenhorster Keeper.
After the break, the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49th), Julian Turl (61th) and Heinz Linnemann (69th) all forgave.
Niklas Eilmann was also unable to use a trade mark - Louis Kortenjann had saved on the goal line with his hand and saw red - for the guests (75.).
Only when Nils Berheide pushed the ball over the line was the game decided (81.).
"We had criticized each other hard before, and that was different today than in the last few weeks," concluded Florian Kraus.
Sendenhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77th Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90th Leibig), Turl.
Goals: 0:1 Krause (7th), 0:2 Berheide (81st).
Red card: Kortenjann (75./Hoetmar).
Football: Kreisliga A2 Münster: Spectacular football in Albachten: GW Albersloh is subject to Concordia with 3:4
“I don’t know what to say about it,” he argued.
"We didn't get any access to them," he allegedly meant the wing tongs with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but also all the other green-whites who stood out with a collective offensive urge.
He could still laugh: "A dirty victory," he said, smirking cheerfully and pulling away from his players, on the other hand, the relief was that they had pulled out of the affair with three points.
Remember, after a duel of two teams, one of which, namely Albachten, plays for the championship and the other, Albersloh, fights for class preservation.
With understandably mixed feelings, GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back on the 90 minutes behind him.
"It was by far our best season," he said.
"How we come back after the 0-2, how we keep against one of the top teams in the league over the entire game time, that was already really phenomenal".
The more bitter it seems, that you now have to drive home with empty hands.
Top goalkeeper Lars Zymner led the hosts with his 12th season goal (24th).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this goal.
He scored the 2–0 over the left side for Fabian Fröhning (39th).
We knew that, but you can’t take such a player completely out.
"It was crazy what he did," Lewandowski envylessly acknowledged the quality of the opponent.
Shortly before the change of side, his own elf made the balance: McGill's free kick from the left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia goalkeeper Hinkerohe through the long torque (45th).
After the change of side, it was again McGill who scored the compensation (59th).
Then it went back and forth.
It was a crisp, action-packed game.
Nübel shocked Albachten again (64th), only five minutes later Patrick Horstmann (69th).
Despite being overnumbered, Albersloh was no longer able to counter the last Concordia hit (80th).
We need to concentrate on Wednesday.
"The game against Schapdetten, that's what we have to win now," Lewandowski said.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87th Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87th Bareksai).
Goals: 1:0 Zymner (24th), 2:0 Fröhning (39th), 2:1 McGill (45th), 2:2 McGill (59th), 3:2 Nübel (64th), 3:3 P. Horstmann (69th), 4:3 Jülkenbeck (80th).
Yellow-Red: Atalan (74./Albachten).
Football: TSV Straßberg wins point against Primus
There was no winner in the Landesliga duel between TSV Straßberg and FV Biberach.
The leader had actually arrived for three points, but the team of coach Oliver Pfaff was very good and in the end the game ended 0-0.
Media: Resignation of the entire Dynamo Dresden Presidium
The entire presidium of football second league Dynamo Dresden has resigned according to media reports.
In the evening, several media outlets agreed on a joint letter from the Saxon Board.
At first there was no confirmation of the association.
The reason for the withdrawal should be internal power struggles in the former Bundesliga.
Erdogan in Germany: Politics instead of pomp
I'm glad he's gone.
There are few state guests whose departure in Germany provides as much relief as that of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
For three days, the Turkish president was a guest in Berlin and Cologne, and many had thought that he should not have been invited.
Evangelische Akademie Tutzing: Prominent guests and new offers
The Evangelical Academy of Tutzing offers about 80 conferences by the middle of next year.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has signaled that he wants to collect the tolerance prize personally in Tutzing.
The term of office was too short for Christian Wulff: as Federal President, he was not in Tutzing's Evangelical Academy.
But before and after, Wulff was a guest there.
For example, Academy Director Udo Hahn took him into account when he proudly said: "All the Federal Presidents and Chancellors were already with us". That at the Academy in Tutzing Palace celebrities appear again and again, but was also a topic at the presentation of the annual programme.
At the end of October, singer-songwriter Konstantin Wecker attends a conference on spiritual experience in a philosophical perspective; on 29 September, the writer Frido Mann attends a conference on his grandfather Thomas Mann.
Meanwhile, France’s President Emmanuel Macron has also pledged: He wants to personally receive the “Tolerance Prize” awarded to him by the Academy in Tutzing, which also receives television presenter Dunja Hayali in another category (we reported).
The approximately 80 conferences by mid-2019 are all about it.
"The pension is not safe!" is the title of the conference.
"SOS at Europe's borders" - this is how the academy describes the "risk and deadly route across the Mediterranean".
"And to a meeting on Syria: "Barbarity without Limit".
Weapons Deals, Destruction, Torture, Death - War mocks every human idea".
The spectrum extends from structural racism in society to the gap between rich and poor and the radical change in work through digitalization.
Academy Director Hahn was convinced: "A free democracy needs places where a civil society can come together to look for solutions or at least partial solutions."
At a meeting on the 200th.
Karl Marx's birthday is soon expected to be one more visitor to the direction of capitalism-criticism, the other more a tendency "from the left to the center".
What about neutrality?
“We are 100 percent a daughter of the Evangelical State Church,” said head of the study, Dr. Ulrike Haerendel, “so we are not 100 percent neutral.”
Musikkabarett: Gender Understanding with Heart - Wolbeck - Westphalian News
"Suitable for both adults and men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of the Christuskirche in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret artist, Teubner aimed at gender understanding, not only with humor and warmth of heart for the (feeling) woman and the (feeling) man and what else there might be, but also with music.
She used the mini-guitar and mastered her violin.
On the wing was Ben Süverkrüp.
On the one hand, he is the male sparring partner, who sometimes even speaks to the end of the movement, on the other hand, a true pianist: Süverkrüp Teubner accompanies Süverkrüp so congenially harmoniously that some may have wished for a solo.
That was also the case, with Beethoven and Chopin, but differently, namely, as it fits the Red Thread of the evening.
Then Teubner had brought a paradox into play: the satisfaction of the man comes when he has a partner, but she does not open the door.
A closed door without a partner, on the other hand, does not bring any benefit.
The piano solo now demonstrates the same: What would have arisen from Mozart’s composition if “the Nannerl” had unexpectedly opened the door?
For example, Süverkrüp glides over in improvisations, from Bach's "O Head full of blood and wounds" into the "Song of Death", and from Mozart's G minor symphony into a playful dance.
There were big applause and "Bravo" from the full hall.
Flowers presented Karlheinz Kleintje, treasurer of the association, to the chansonette.
But the chairwoman Heidemarie Markenbeck did not take an extra thanks.
She had the idea to give the duo not only performances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt but also one in Wolbeck.

Bruchsal.
After a bus accident on the A5 in Baden-Württemberg, the police have slightly corrected the number of victims down.
Ten passengers, instead of fifteen, were injured.
Everyone has since been discharged from the hospital.
The French bus driver had stayed in the hospital for observation for one night.
He will be released in the course of the day, said a spokesman for the police.
The cause of the long-distance bus accident at Bruchsal is still unclear.
On Saturday morning, the long-distance bus crashed against a guardrail.
Handball: Damen-Landesliga: Ahlener SG keeps the white vest against TV Wattenscheid
The Ahlen women had problems especially with the third league player Carolin Stallmann, who alone marked ten goals.
“I was really happy with the defense, only one player scored too many goals.
We haven't gotten that under control," said ASG coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But he was more annoyed by the many odds.
The focus in the final made his team miss this time.
The ASG therefore ran behind almost until the end, laying behind at the pause with 11:12 and later with 15:18 (45.).
Only towards the end did the wider bench of the hostesses become decisively noticeable.
In addition, Aydogdu placed Merle Klement on the left, who then made "extremely clever the decisive goals" (Aydogdu).
ASG: Buschkötter, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pumpe, Exner, Klement (5), Colbatzky (5/3), Drewes (1), Schlautmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek, Ruschhaupt (4), S. Fitzek.
Volleyball: 3rd league women: top performance of BSV Ostbevern in top game at VC Allbau Essen
Thanks to a top performance in the top game, the volleyball players of the BSV Ostbevern have once again established themselves in the top group of the 3rd League West.
In the second league downhill VC Allbau Essen, the blue-whites won by 3:1.
“It was a big step for a cool season.
It makes Lenz to play in the top third of the league.
This is what we have now worked out," said coach Dominik Münch after an almost impeccable performance of his team at the downed leader.
The first round was dominated by the guests almost at will.
Over 4:1, 16:10 and 22:12 he went to the vice-champion of the previous year at 25:15.
Food has accepted in the two-piece bar, but has not come into play.
We've been busy with them.
Our opponent has hit with a high risk, but also produced a lot of tickets.
In the second set, the BSV already led with 12:8. "Essen has switched the adoption to three-bars.
We couldn't keep the impact pressure.
Food has sucked away, and we have let ourselves in a bit," Münch continues.
At 18:17 for the first time the women from the Ruhr area had the nose ahead.
Although Ostbevern defeated four set balls at 19:24, the fifth attempt found its goal.
"The game was now a class better," said the practice leader to the rising level.
Maike Rüdingloh and finally Wiebke Silge contributed significantly to the BSV turning the table in the third section from 14:16 to 25:21.
He added: “We played consistently and quietly.
Over 7:3 and 15:13, the Blue-White brought pass four with 25:22 to their side.
Vera Horstmann was chosen as the most valuable player, but Maren Flachmeier also had an excellent day.
BSV-Women: Eggenhaus, Rüdingloh, Lea and Anna Dreckmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch-Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
Turkish Community: Mosque Opening as Missed Opportunity
The Turkish Community in Germany (TGD) has criticized the way in which the major Ditib mosque in Cologne was inaugurated by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
"The opening of the mosque in Cologne has left a pile of fragments in the German-Turkish relationship, which can only be put together with difficulty," said the chairman of the TGD, Gökay Sofuoglu, the editorial network Germany.
Both the Turkish and German sides would have missed the chance for a joint, reconciling appearance.
"Instead of underlining the affiliation of Muslims to Germany alongside German leaders, Erdogan has used the date for his purposes," Sofuoglu said.
The widespread exclusion of the German public has "enhanced many reservations".
Home Association Nottuln: Offer has already been established
After the long summer break, it is finally time for Folktreff again.
On October 18th (Thursday) at 7.30 p.m., the Nottuln Home Association is already organizing its fifth Nottulner Folktreff in the fireplace room of the Alte Amtmannei.
Almost exactly on the day, it is then a year ago that we performed a folk meeting for the first time.
In the meantime, this event has become an integral part of the musical event calendar in Nottuln," says Hanns Moormann, chairman of the Nottulner Heimatverein.
I didn’t think that our Folktreff would blew up in Nottuln so quickly.
Whether stormy deep Friederike in January or heat wave in July, the fireplace room of the office was always fully occupied.
"The program at the next Folktreff is, as always, a colourful mix of German folk, hiking and seafaring songs, folksongs, evergreens and old hits," says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who always invites friends musicians to Nottuln.
For the first Folktreff "birthday" Klaus Spellmeyer promised with his accordion.
For many years he was a member of "Gaitling", a group from the neighbouring district of Steinfurt, which played music with German lyrics.
Now he's out with an Irish folk band.
The makers of the Folktreff gladly remember the last event in the summer, when Christoph Schulz of Folktreff Emsdetten with his international version of the song "Frösche in der Nacht" thrilled the listeners and sent them home with an earworm.
"We are expecting many happy guests to spend a sociable and humorous evening once again," says the invitation of the home club.
Anyone who plays an instrument and has a desire to participate actively is invited to participate.
Since the coveted seats are always occupied quickly, it is advisable to be there early enough.
The Folktreff starts at 7.30 pm, but admission is already at 7.00 pm.
China approves planned merger of Linde and Praxair
For legal reasons, all open questions must be clarified by October 24.
FrankfurtLinde and Praxair are taking another step forward on their way to becoming the world’s largest industrial gas company.
The Chinese competition authority has approved the proposed merger, Linde said on Sunday.
The multi-billion-dollar merger still has to be approved in South Korea and, as the biggest hurdle, in the US.
Recently, according to an insider, the chances of approval there had improved because Linde had pledged to sell additional parts of the company.
For legal reasons, all open questions must be clarified by October 24th in order for the merger to succeed.
From pure orchard cultivation to ecology
With a gala in the Dr. Stammberger Hall, the 125th anniversary of the Kreisverband für Horticulture und Landespflege was celebrated.
On 29 September 1893, with a fruit show in the Kulmbach Association House, the last founding impulses for the Kreisverband für Gartenbau und Landespflege Kulmbach were set, and exactly 125 years later he celebrated a great anniversary on Saturday evening in the Kulmbach City Hall.
Of course, he was called differently at the time: As "District Fruit Building Association Kulmbach City and Country" he was raised from the baptism by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa in 1893.
The purpose of the fruit growing association also differed from today's work - it was actually purely about fruit growing, no one was thinking about flowers and horticulture at the time.
"At that time, in the era of the Enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elites," explained district home caregiver Günter Dippold in his lecture.
Fruit trees should line highways, so-called industrial gardens were created at schools.
Fruit cultivation is still the task of the 55 horticultural associations in the district of Kulmbach, which comprise almost 7,000 members.
But the spectrum is far from exhausted.
Natural horticulture, biological plant protection, village embellishment and nutrition play an equally important role as the transmission of knowledge, a healthy diet and youth work.
The members of the Hutschdorf youth group "Maulwurfe" showed on stage how diverse the tasks of a horticultural association are.
"Youth work is urgently needed, especially in the digital age," said district chairman Günter Reif, and OB Henry Schramm also stressed how important experiences in nature are for life.
The collection of chestnuts was a huge thing for us children, I doubt that you can collect a similar amount of joy with smartphone & co.
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with Landrat Klaus Peter Söllner for the anniversary.
"Where they should be, it is the district association that decides," added Landrat Söllner, stressing the special importance of the horticultural associations for the villages.
The association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green spaces in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the county left no doubt about this, even district manager and specialist consultant Friedhelm Haun.
He guided the many visitors with a picture lecture through the long history of the Kreisverband and reported, among other things, on the need for self-sufficiency after the war.
In the past, everything came from the garden, for the winter it was boxed in.
At the end of the 1950s, however, the garden was transformed into an ornamental and residential garden.
"Nature has persisted, it was already there before us and we have to orient ourselves to it," the expert for fruit and walnut trees pleaded.
That is why the horticultural associations are encouraged not to give up, so that our homeland remains beautiful and worth living.
It is also part of welcoming the new citizens to our associations, added the president of the Bavarian state association, Wolfram Vaitl.
"We must stop the blatant decline in insects, we owe this to our children and grandchildren," concluded Günter Reif at the successful ceremony, which was solemnly framed by the turret windings of the music club Thurnau.

Priority to Nafta talks: Canada’s Foreign Minister relocated UN speech
Mexico’s government wants clarity on Nafta: they are giving both trading partners an ultimatum to reach an agreement.
Canada's foreign minister now gives absolute priority to the trade agreement - and postpones her speech before the United Nations.
Due to the pressure on time in the struggle for a new edition of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the US and Mexico, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland has postponed her speech at the UN General Debate in New York.
Instead of speaking on Saturday, the minister will speak before the United Nations General Assembly on Monday, her spokesman Adam Austen said.
In the meantime, she is focusing on renegotiating Nafta.
Mexico's economy minister Ildefonso Guajardo said on Friday that the negotiators of Canada and the United States had 48 hours to agree if Canada actually wanted to join the trade agreement already reached between its country and the United States.
The U.S. and Mexico agreed in August on a recast of the Nafta regional free trade agreement.
U.S. President Donald Trump suggested that Canada could be excluded from NAFTA in the future.
The talks about a new edition have been going on for over a year.
By Sunday evening (local time) they are now to be completed, Trump’s administration wants to submit the agreement to the US Senate before October 1.
In the event of a failure of the negotiations, Mexico’s elected President Andres Manuel López Obrador had announced on Friday that he would seek a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protests against Bolsonaro presidential candidate
Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, who was injured in a knife attack, has left the hospital.
The far-right ex-military wanted to fly to Rio de Janeiro, where he lives, according to a report by the daily newspaper "O Globo".
After his dismissal, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will make public appearances in the South American country last week before the presidential election.
The politician had been attacked on the open road in early September during an election campaign event in southern Brazil.
Meanwhile, in several Brazilian cities, thousands of people took to the streets to protest against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele não" (in German: "Der nicht"), mainly women's associations had called for protests against the ex-military.
In the social networks, the associations also mobilized against Bolsonaro’s racist and contemptuous statements.
In the economic metropolis of São Paulo, several thousand protesters were expected.
In the capital, Brasilia, the protests mixed with a rally of the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Labour Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He took the place of former President Inácio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to 12 years in prison for corruption and was therefore not allowed to run.
The presidential election in Brazil is on October 7.
As the former mayor of São Paulo, Haddad was far behind Bolsonaro, a far-right candidate.
Although the "Trump of Brazil" has long been involved in politics, it has recently presented itself as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates reach absolute majority in the first round, a second round will be held on October 28.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not emerge successfully from this - no matter who he is competing against.
Bolsonaro is known for his hatred of homosexuals and blacks and for glorifying the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
Again and again he shocks with verbal derailments.
Another time, he said the supporters of Lula’s left-wing Labour Party should be shot.
Europe wins Ryder Cup title
Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines - Just an hour from Disneyland, European golfers have written another Ryder Cup fairy tale just outside Paris.
The outsider team of Captain Thomas Björn dethroned the favourite defending champion USA for a toothless Tiger Woods in front of more than 150,000 spectators during the three days at Le Golf National with great punches and outstanding team spirit.
After a long illness, Danish rock legend dies
Danish rock icon Kim Larsen has died.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jeppesen announced on Larsen's website.
On the deathbed, Larsen was surrounded by his wife and six children.
The musician had been in treatment for prostate cancer since the beginning of the year.
Larsen had become acquainted with the band Gasolin', which was enormously successful in Scandinavia in the 1970s.
Their songs were influenced by international musicians such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the band's dissolution in 1978, Larsen was successful as a solo artist.
He sold about three million records in Denmark.
His 1983 album "Midt om natten" is still the best-selling album in Denmark.
Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen praised Larsen in a statement on Sunday as a “street boy” who was “against everything, but in all hearts.”
The head of government also recalled that the monarchy opponent Larsen had appeared on the 70th birthday of Danish Queen Margrethe II in 2010.
Rock Night at the Shoe Factory: Volume at Pressure Hammer Level
The band names of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" suggest such a description of the rocky live music experience on Saturday evening in the hall of the Bürgerzentrum Schuhfabrik: hard rock pure by three other bands with one another.
After the sound check and shortly before the start of the concert, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
There is no trace of lamp fever.
Afterwards, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surrounding area - all in conjunction with the booking agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - inspire with their bands the around 120 visitors of the "Mint Mosquito" rock night visibly.
The quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika already knows how to convince at the start of the concert evening with newest, unknown tracks from his own pen and the upcoming CD.
In front of the stage, the band dances to the vocal and powerful interaction during the performance.
Although "Addition" calls can not be overheard, "Tiger Bonesaw" then leaves the stage to the trio "Here We Stand".
Guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich on bass and drummer Kai Hölscher demonstrate that hard rock is not the same as hard rock with their alternative sounds, sometimes reminiscent of classical rock of the 1970s.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers", "Here We Stand" also uses a synthesizer in addition to the guitar rock.
Not only the longing, almost ballad-like "Take Me Home" captivates with the switch from melodic passages to the guitar-heavy rock riffs of the multi-layered songs.
However, the quartet "The Ignition" from Tönnishäuschen has gained a special degree of recognition since its founding in 2005.
Full of agility, the band presents their hard rock on Saturday.
The fact that "The Ignition" has special stage experience with her performances in front of a very large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the tour in China of 2017 - is obvious and unheard of.
Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann, in conjunction with the band, also sets his own accents on the only covered song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s.
In addition to the sound that feels even higher than before, guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers a cheerful solo while walking through the audience.
A certain volume belongs of course to one such hard rock concert due to the genre: At the "Mint Mosquito" rock night, according to the information of the mixing console team, the three-piece concert of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" is about 98 decibels.
This is, for example, at compressed air hammer level, but is thus still clearly below the controls of the "Wacken-Fesitval", which "The Ignition" refers to on their website.
Ear-dubing 120 decibels in jet-drive volume as usual at the annual metal stand in the north of the Republic, the Ahlen audience does not need this rock night.
After just under four hours, the three bands of the harder, rocky gait have long since impressed with their sovereign, virtuoso play and their own compositions.
"Here we stand, took the bone saw and ignited a concert evening with the power of a tiger," all three groups, of course in a figurative sense, can say at the end.
And above all, enjoy the great applause of the visitors.

A dead man in a plane crash at Essen/Mülheim airport
A fatal accident occurred at Mülheim/Essen airport.
A glider crashed on Sunday in a parking lot at Mülheim/Essen airport.
The pilot died in the accident.
Near the Mülheim/Essen airport there was a fatal accident on Sunday.
As the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" reports, a glider had crashed on the exhibition car park at the airport.
The pilot was killed.
As the "WAZ" further reports, the flight student was alone on board - the airliner is said to be a single-seater.
The plane was already approaching landing at the time of the accident.
The crash site is only a short distance away from a party tent on the airport grounds.
There has been an Oktoberfest since this weekend.
The Mülheim/Essen airport is located on the city boundary of the two cities of the Ruhr and directly at the entrance to the motorway 52.
From the car park there is a Park&Ride offer for large events at the Messe Essen or the Gruga-Halle in Essen.
Trump to Kim: "And then we fell in love"
It is no secret that North Korea’s president Kim is well-intentioned despite the nuclear crisis.
But now Trump has made a true declaration of love to his colleague.
It also has to do with Kim's "beautiful letters".
At the tender age of 72, the married US president has confessed to a new flame.
The tragedy is that it is a long-distance relationship.
On Saturday, Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
In front of supporters in the U.S. state of West Virginia, Trump found almost tender words for the half-old offspring of the ruling dynasty from Pyongyang, despite the fact that in the struggle for North Korea’s nuclear disarmament, it proves to be quite tough chunks.
“I was tough, he was too, and it was going back and forth between us,” Trump said.
And then we fell in love.
Okay, okay?
No, I'm not.
And it wasn’t just the conversations with Kim that would have melted his heart.
He wrote me beautiful letters, they were great letters.
Their personal connection has also borne fruit politically: Trump referred to Kim’s announced halt of all nuclear and missile tests, even though critics see little more than lip service so far.
The US president seemed quite aware that the affection for the infamous "Rocket Man" - as Trump nicknamed Kim - might not be familiar to everyone.
At least, he anticipated the expected criticism of it during his appearance in a large sports hall in the city of Wheeling: “Donald Trump says they fell in love.”
How terrible, how terrible is that?
That's so unpresidial.
Trump then pointed his index finger at the crowd: “I’ve always told you, it’s so easy to be presidential.”
But then there wouldn't be 10,000 people pushing into this crowded arena out there, but we would have only 200 people standing outside.
Oktoberfest attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler Ideally visited, atmospheric and also spoiled by the sun: Very varied and with a good shot of Oktoberfest flair, Baesweiler's city center has been cleaned out on Sunday.
For the first time, the Oktoberfest took place not only in the festival tent at the fire tower, but was extended by the trade association on Sunday to the city.
Refugees rescued from Libyan prison thanks to video
Nigerian refugees have used a mobile phone video to point out their catastrophic detention conditions in Libya and thus enable their rescue.
The group had filmed the recording in their cell in the coastal town of Sawija in July under threat of death and distributed it online.
"They refuse to send us back," said a man in the video message.
We suffer here, we die here.
The recording was sent to the France 24 Observers website, whose editors alerted the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were finally flown to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Without the video, we probably wouldn't have been able to return to Nigeria," Efe Onyeka, who recorded the video, told AFP.
The 25-year-old was arrested in Libya in an attempt to cross the Mediterranean to reach Europe.
With the video, he said, he was in danger of his life.
One of his fellow soldiers had been beaten almost to death by the guards, said Onyeka.
In general, the detention conditions were disastrous: "They beat us all with pipes and sticks."
They gave us nothing to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM organizes the voluntary return of refugees stranded in Libya.
Approximately 2,700 migrants from Nigeria were sent back to their homeland this year using the program, IOM spokesman Jorge Galindo said in the West African country.
The case of the Nigerians who have now been rescued is not unusual in view of the poor conditions in Libya.
However, he has not yet heard of a call for help via mobile video.
International organizations have long criticized the conditions in Libya’s refugee camps as inhumane.
The North African state, which is largely dominated by militias, is the main transit country for migrants on their way from Africa to Europe.
When a teacher went to the primary school site on Sunday afternoon to prepare her lessons for Monday, she surprised a burglar.
At 4:50 p.m., the teacher entered the building via the main entrance.
In the front of the first floor she saw a man who immediately fled.
First through a door, then via the roof terrace and from there via a staircase to the ground floor or the forecourt.
The teacher informed the police that had opened the investigation.
Whether things or money have been stolen cannot yet be said.
Perpetrator description: about 16 years old, black, very short hair, slightly darker appearance, dark pants, dark t-shirt.

German was trapped in his own car for days
A 75-year-old in a forest area in central France has had to stand out in his car for several days and nights after he had stuck the car off all forest paths and a tree blocked the car door.
Rescue personnel accidentally discovered the car on Saturday afternoon not far from a meadow and freed the missing since Tuesday night, police said on Sunday.
The 75-year-old from Pleinfeld was reportedly in good health despite the cold nights and the long time without care.
He said he was looking forward to his home.
The pensioner had been reported missing by his family after he had not returned from a drive with his off-road vehicle over the local meadows and fields on Tuesday.
Despite intensive searches, the whereabouts of the man had remained unclear for days.
Laschet calls for rule of law in Turkey
Cologne NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) has called for the rule of law in Turkey in conversation with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
The relations between the two countries are currently "overshadowed," Laschet said on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne airport.
This mainly concerns arrest waves, freedom of the press and religious freedom.
He therefore made it clear to Erdogan that if relations are to normalize in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, the rule of law is a very important prerequisite for this.
Laschet also addressed the cases of Germans who are in prison in Turkey.
He expressed the expectation that freedom of expression would be respected.
Erdogan once again insisted on the independence of the Turkish judiciary.
The conversation between Laschet and Erdogan had been moved to a building of the Federal Ministry of Defence’s flight readiness at Cologne Airport in the short term.
It was originally supposed to take place at Schloss Wahn - but the castle owners had rejected this out of political conviction against Erdogan.
Erdogan traveled on to the opening of the Ditib Mosque in Cologne.
Laschet had cancelled a joint appearance in the building.
But he said, “The Muslims who go to this mosque are also citizens of our country.”
And we are also their point of contact - and not the Turkish president.
Lack of confidence in the US: North Korea calls for disarmament
While US President Trump will not tire of emphasizing the successes in the negotiations on North Korea’s denuclearization, the East Asian regime represents conditions more sober.
Secretary of State Ri calls for Washington’s compatibility.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has accused the U.S. government of blocking negotiations for a nuclear-weapon-free Korean peninsula with its ongoing sanctions at the UN General Debate.
“The recent stagnation comes from the US relying on coercive measures that are deadly to building trust,” Ri said in New York.
Disarmament is unthinkable for North Korea in these circumstances.
“Without any trust in the US, there will be no trust in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no way that we will be the first to disarm ourselves,” he said.
That sanctions could "force North Korea on the knee" is "a wishful dream of people who don't know us."
In order to build confidence, however, his country stopped its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear test facility, Ri stressed.
However, there were no "corresponding reactions" from the US side, the minister criticized.
North Korea’s nuclear and missile program has been subjected to three sanctions by the UN Security Council over the past year alone.
US President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have urged the United Nations in recent days to strictly comply with the sanctions.
At the same time, the US government is working on a rapprochement.
In June, Trump met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for the first time.
After the first summit in Singapore, the US president is aiming for a second summit meeting with Kim.
In October, Pompeo is scheduled to return to Pyongyang for talks about ending North Korea’s nuclear weapons program.
The HoT serves: New kitchen with donations from the community
That they were actually in a youth meeting, the many visitors of the house of the open door HoT got nothing with: white blankets and flower decorations on the tables and a large buffet waiting for the guests after the Thanksgiving service.
The young people of the HoT had enchanted the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.
The institution was financed by donations from the community, for which the young people wanted to thank with the food.
The start with the new facility was not exactly easy, as Henriette Westbuer, the head of the HoT, recalls.
We had already filled our refrigerators with food and ingredients before the summer break and were well prepared for the big day.
But then, on the first day after the summer break, the bad surprise came: a power outage had put the huge two-piece refrigerator out of operation, the food was spoiled and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start all over again: we did get a lot of support from friends and neighbors, but the children and young people wanted to make it all by themselves," says Westbuer.
And that's how everyone got involved.
The result was impressive, the guests were enthusiastic.
"Coachs can't do better, either," praised one visitor impressed, while Hokkaido pumpkin soup was served or guests were allowed to serve quiche, liver cheese or cake.
"It's really great what the children and young people have put on their feet," emphasized priest Frank Beckmann, while wizard Stephan Lammen with card tricks and other feats caused astonishment.
Jürgen Sator leaves the board of directors of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia
Out of frustration over criticism from his own ranks, the head of the Essen Tafel, Jörg Sartor, resigned his post in the Landesverband.
Sartor had become known nationwide because the Essener Tafel had introduced an admission stop for foreigners.
He resigned as vice-chairman of the NRW boards in July, Sartor told Welt am Sonntag.
Too many fell in my back.
The head of the Tafeln-Landesverband NRW, Wolfgang Weilerswist, expressed his appreciation for the decision of his long-standing deputy.
The sharp criticism took Sartor with it.
"I can understand his step - that's where people expressed themselves who didn't know exactly why the Essener Tafel is doing this."
But Sartor is still active for the Essener Tafel - "six days a week, nothing changes about that," Weilerswist said.
Sartor again criticized colleagues from other panels in the "Welt am Sonntag".
One should not take the approach, "without us, the people in the city are starving."
It is the responsibility of the state to ensure that people do not starve.
The Essene did not attend a conference of the Tafeln on Friday in Berlin.
"I'm told too many sweet treats," he said.
There are all these social fuzzies who criticized me that way.
Play SF Lorch 2:0 lead - Gmünder Tagespost
Fußball, Bezirksliga Lorch loses to Neuler 2:3 - TV Heuchlingen wins in Kirchheim after behind - Bettringen beats Lauchheim clearly.
With 2:0 Lorch was already in the lead in the home game against the TV Neuler - in the end it was 2:3 and the disappointment with the sports friends was great.
In Kirchheim, the TVH quickly came behind with 0:1, but won after 90 minutes with 2:1.
Gladbach plays twice - Schalke without embolo with first win
Borussia Mönchengladbach has to wait for a away win in Wolfsburg.
At 2:2, the foals lose a lead twice.
Schalke comes against Mainz for the first win of the season (1-0).
(sda) Four times in the first five league matches Schalke has manoeuvred himself offside with early counter goals.
Now, the team of Domenico Tedesco once again demonstrated the strength with which it took first place behind Bayern last season.
Alessandro Schöpf brought the home team in the eleventh minute after strong preliminary work by Evgeni Konopljanka per head in the lead, subsequently the hosts preserved the mini cushion with a compact defensive performance.
Thanks to an extraordinary comeback, Borussia Dortmund is greeting new from the top of the Bundesliga.
The team of Lucien Favre had traded a 0-2 defeat against Bayer Leverkusen until the break, but came in the 2nd half to a 4-2 victory.
Jacob-Bruun Larsen (65th) and Marco Reus (69th) equalled with a doublet within four minutes, Paco Alcacer, who was replaced by Favre in the 63rd minute, ensured with another doublet in the final phase (86th/94th) the crowning completion of the performance increase after the break.
VfB Stuttgart also won for the first time.
Werder Bremen, which was decimated before the break due to a yellow-red card against Milos Veljkovic, had to fear the Stuttgarters in the meantime.
Borna Sosa and the inattentive goalie Ron-Robert Zieler manufactured a curious one-way goal, which helped the guests to balance in the 68th minute.
Seven minutes later, Gonzalo Castro led the VfB to the first victory.
In Wolfsburg, Michael Lang did not experience a completely successful debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
The Gladbacher, who competed with the Swiss quartet Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang, gave up a lead twice, ultimately played 2:2 and have been waiting for a away victory in the VW city since 2003.
Renato Steffen was responsible for Wolfsburg's 1:1 match with his second Bundesliga player.
Yann Sommer was powerless in the flat shot from 20 meters of the Aargauer, as was in the second match after an hour.
Nevertheless, the trends at Gladbach are quite promising.
Alassane Pléa turns out to be a goalkeeper in the storm of the foals.
Against Wolfsburg, the French purchase from the OGC Nice hit the record for the third time in a row and for the seventh time in the seventh mandatory game.
After seven laps, Gladbach finished in 4th place.
Within 40 minutes, the previously unbeaten Werder Bremen maneuvered against VfB Stuttgart into an uncomfortable position.
After 19 minutes, the team of Florian Kohlfeldt was surprised by a Stuttgart counter, which the ex-Luganesi Anastasios Donis finished with his first goal of the season, after 36 minutes Milos Veljkovic continued to tackle his team: The 23-year-old Serb cashed after a jersey sacrifice against Daniel Didavi yellow-red.
Although Stuttgart defenders Borna Sosa and goalie Ron-Robert Zieler brought the Bremens back into the game by a curious pitching goal (68th), a quarter of an hour before the end, Gonzalo Castro shot the Stuttgarters, who were overnumbered, back to the victory road.
Nuremberg decided the duel against Düsseldorf 3-0 sovereignly for themselves.
After half an hour, Hanno Behrens put the home team on track with foulpenalty.
Macedonians vote on new state name
Around 1.8 million people in Macedonia are now voting on whether to change the name of their country in North Macedonia.
With a yes, the nearly three decades-long conflict with neighboring Greece could be resolved.
Athens had insisted on a name change because of its northern province of the same name and blocked any approach of Macedonia to the west.
The voters therefore also decide on the future Western integration.
The U.S. said it could quickly become a member of NATO if the referendum had a positive outcome.
Syrian in U-Haft.
The refugee attacked three women.
A Syrian man brutally beat three pensioners, some of whom were severely injured.
The 41-year-old asylum seeker had raided around 10 p.m. on Friday in the Fluchtgasse in Alsergrund.
When the police arrived, they responded to the accused, who went with his fists clenched at passers-by and tried to attack them.
The Syrians then tried to beat the officials and step on them.
Shortly afterwards it turned out that the suspect had just hit three elderly ladies (65, 67, 75) with his fists to the ground in Währinger Straße near a tram stop.
He also kicked the trio with his feet.
The pensioners were partly seriously injured.
They suffered haematomas, bruises and concussion.
The asylum seeker was also seriously injured "for an unknown cause," according to the police.
He was taken to the hospital and monitored throughout treatment.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his boyfriend
Almost exactly one year after the entry into force of marriage for all, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his longtime friend Christoph Rohde.
The two of them said yes to each other in Hamburg on Saturday.
A registered life partnership was not in question for her, Kahrs had previously told the "Bild" newspaper.
"If we get married, that's right." He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a fiscal spokesman for the SPD parliamentary group and one of the spokesmen of the Seeheimer Kreis, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals on June 30, 2017, Kahrs had stirred up a stir with an outcry.
For example, he had accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having stumbled on the topic.
"That was your Schabowski moment," he said in reference to Günter Schabowski's accidental announcement of the GDR border opening.
As of October 1, 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example in the law of adoption.
Garden day: 400 meters hedge cut
There was a lot of work ahead of the members of the Citizens' Association of Children's Home and the Society for Leprosy.
Because about 400 meters hedge around the gardens of the residents of the Pründnerhaus should be cut.
Supported by the residents, it went to work for about twelve supporters.
"We are doing this to reduce costs," said the chairman of the Citizens' Association Walter Schröer.
And so much has accumulated.
Due to the hot summer we are late this time, but fortunately it is now only a shape cut.
Because already in the spring, the hedge has already been shaved.
The breakfast that always follows the work has also a long tradition.
"Everyone should stay strong," said Walter Schröer.
World Championship in Rio: Hannes Aigner wins gold at the canoe slalom world championship
Augsburger Hannes Aigner has won the gold medal at the end of the World Canoe Slalom Championship in Rio de Janeiro.
The 29-year-old made a perfect run on the Olympic track on Sunday.
Two years ago, he missed the Olympic bronze by three hundredths of a second.
I was well prepared, had enough rides here at the facility and everything fit today," said the Olympic third of London in 2012.
At the finish, he threw his paddle away with joy and held both arms up victoriously – knowing that it would be enough for at least one medal.
After all, he had number four.
But the six remaining starters were unable to surpass his fabled time of 89.69 seconds.
Czech Jiri Prskavec was second ahead of Russian Pavel Eigel.
The Gauting Police Inspectorate reports the first attempted burglary into a single-family house this autumn.
Fortunately, the perpetrators failed.
The days are getting shorter - burglars want to take advantage of that again.
The Gauting Police Inspectorate reported yesterday the first attempted burglary this autumn.
The fact that it remained during the attempt at the single-family house on Königswiese Straße is thanks to the alarm system.
It started when the perpetrators laid hands on Friday just before 8 p.m.
The burglars knew the residents were not at home.
However, the alarm system apparently surprised them so much that they fled without prey.
Notes to PI Gauting, phone (089) 8 93 13 30.
Bankruptcy at Hertha: Reached by reality: Bayern against Ajax challenged
The predicate is unbeatable: the defeat in Berlin does not want FC Bayern "to let himself down".
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first interim conclusion for the term of Niko Kovac.
The first small performance dilemma under the new coach Niko Kovac is by no means to increase for the Munich to the larger autumn low.
“A week ago, we felt like we were invincible.
Now a bit of reality has caught us up," Thomas Müller stated after the deserved 2-0 defeat at Hertha BSC and demanded a reaction for the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
Anyone who knows us knows that this really annoys us and that’s why we are heading for Tuesday.
For the first time in more than a year, no goals were scored, as at the same time of the pre-season two matches in a row without a win, the leader in the Bundesliga for the time being lost to Borussia Dortmund.
The overall situation is far from as dramatic as the final stage of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, but the record champion must be warned.
The FC Augsburg in the 1:1 with its running-intensive man-on-man tactics and the Berliners through their playful needle stitches over the outside have delivered within three days two blueprints, as the last appearing overpowering Bayern can be cracked.
"Those who know FC Bayern know that we are not going to let this happen and we will do everything we can to be successful again," Kovac said.
Otherwise, however, he was surprisingly gentle with his losers in his native city and shifted his first defeat as a Munich coach only to the once again lack of dealing with opportunities.
A victory against Amsterdam and against Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would still make the first interim conclusion of his term of office positive - otherwise the tone is likely to get worse.
Kovac did not take any extraordinary measures before the second king-class appearance this season after the 2-0 at Benfica Lisbon.
After the free day on Sunday, the short preparation for the second preliminary round game against Ajax, who had also defeated Athens with a 3-0 victory at the start of the AEK, begins as planned.
"Now it caught us in two games, but we will also make our goals again," National Team captain Manuel Neuer announced.
As already after the losing cup final against Eintracht Frankfurt at the same place, Joshua Kimmich spoke clearly.
The lawyer acted in the role as a reminder.
"I don't think that's all bad luck, we have to work it out again, because we don't make the many opportunities and make the mistakes at the back," the 23-year-old stressed just before leaving the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh day of the previous season, Bayern were already behind Dortmund with five points, which has now taken the lead again with one point of lead.
And so Kimmich, with a wink at least positively, that now the public debate about the supposedly unbeatable Bavaria has come to an end.
"Yes, that's good," said the international.
It’s good for the league.
DFB boss in line of fire: <0xC3><0x96>zil-Causa: Sharp attack by Erdogan on Grindel
Turkish President Erdogan denounces the exclusion of Mesut <0xC3><0x96>zil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.
DFB President Grindel sees mistakes, but defends the association line.
A new post is now to be created.
Berlin - On different stages, Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for interpretive sovereignty in the permanent dispute topic Mesut <0xC3><0x96>zil.
After the Turkish President heavily criticized the handling of the former world champion in Germany at the opening of the large Ditib mosque in Cologne, the head of the DFB defended the association line.
Early Sunday morning, Grindel, personally attacked by <0xC3><0x96>zil, announced consequences from the cause at the Mainz ZDF "Sports Studio".
"We have to draw very accurate conclusions in the future - because we also have many players with a migration background in the U-teams - that such a thing will not repeat," said the 57-year-old and wants to win an international player without a migration background as further integration officer.
At the same time, Grindel again stated that Erdogan does not stand for the values of football and the DFB.
He had sharply denounced racism against <0xC3><0x96>zil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Our Mesut <0xC3><0x96>zil, born and raised in Germany, and our Ilkay.
They excluded them from this society because they were photographed with me in England," Erdogan said on Saturday in the cathedral city.
Honestly, as their president, I could not digest the fact that our two young men, who have ascended to the German national team, were marginalized.
Grindel referred to Gündogan's statement that, unlike <0xC3><0x96>zil, he felt "reasonably treated by the DFB" after the World Cup affair, which began with photos of the two with Erdogan.
At the same time, he announced that he wanted to stand in front of players in the future.
That someone says: If I win, I’m German, if I lose, I’m a migrant – that’s not possible.
"I am very sorry that he has such an impression," Grindel said.
We should have defended Mesut more, I've always said that.
However, he does not see a basis for a return of <0xC3><0x96>zil to the national team.
As a result, an additional integration officer will be appointed alongside the Brazilian-born Cacau and Celia Sasic, who has family roots in Cameroon.
"If someone with no immigration background clearly influences society and football and says, 'The topic is important, we have to take care of it,' that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our clubs on the ground, where integration must work," Grindel said.
Despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the <0xC3><0x96>zil affair, he wants to run for office as DFB president again next year.
“I do my job and try to do it as well as I can,” Grindel said.
Year-old builds three accidents in three hours
Coburg/Rödental - According to police reports, the 75-year-old caused the accidents on Friday between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m.
First, the 75-year-old driver was approached by a lady at the red traffic light in the area of Lauterer Höhe.
She told the pensioner that he had driven against her car.
However, there was no personality exchange, as the 75-year-old could no longer find the lady in the parking lot.
A short time later, the police received a telephone report about a driver who had left the road and driven against a guide post.
When asked, the man did not want police on the spot and then drove away.
Then the Rödentaler went home.
However, the pensioner has moved in his place of residence, where he has lived for decades, and rammed a construction vehicle when turning.
Eventually, the police were able to find him and stop him.
His car suffered significant accidental damage.
The 75-year-old made a mess and couldn’t remember much anymore.
The damage is about 1300 euros.
Moorbrand in Meppen: Almost 1000 emergency personnel are still on duty.
Approximately four weeks after the outbreak of the moor fire on a Bundeswehr site in Emsland, 980 emergency personnel are still employed in the extinguishing work.
This was announced by the Bundeswehr on Sunday.
As the situation continues to develop stable, according to a spokesman, 70 volunteers have recently been withdrawn.
A further reduction in the number of emergency personnel is planned, it is said.
On the night of Sunday, an above-ground fire had been discovered and extinguished.
Last week, the disaster, which had been declared a week earlier on September 21, had been lifted because of fears that the flames could endanger adjacent forests and settlements by wind and sparks.
Thursday, it was then said, an attack on the fire on neighboring communities is no longer threatening.
At times, more than 1,500 on-site forces tried to get the large fire under control.
The Luftwaffe continues to support the work on the Bundeswehr test site at Meppen with a transport helicopter.
There are also reconnaissance flights with drones of the Bundeswehr.
According to the Bundeswehr, reconnaissance flights with "tornados" are also planned for 2 and 5 October.
The fire was triggered by test rockets fired by Airbus technicians.
The smoke flag of the Moorbrand had been drawn at times up to a hundred kilometers far over the northwest of Germany as far as Bremen.
On Monday, the Bundeswehr wants to set up a contact point to receive claims reports.
Initial claims for damages had already been announced by hoteliers and holiday home owners.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his boyfriend
Johannes Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde leave the main church of St. Katharinen in Hamburg after their wedding.
Almost exactly one year after the entry into force of the marriage for all, the politician married his longtime friend in Hamburg.
They have been a couple for 25 years.
Almost exactly one year after the entry into force of marriage for all, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his longtime friend Christoph Rohde.
The two of them said yes to each other in Hamburg on Saturday.
A registered life partnership was not in question for her, Kahrs had previously told the "Bild" newspaper.
If we get married, that's right.
He has been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a fiscal spokesman for the SPD parliamentary group and one of the spokesmen of the Seeheimer Kreis, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals on June 30, 2017, Kahrs had stirred up a stir with an outcry.
For example, he had accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having stumbled on the topic.
"That was your Schabowski moment," he said in reference to Günter Schabowski's accidental announcement of the GDR border opening.
As of October 1, 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example in the law of adoption.
Macedonian referendum on new state names has begun
In Macedonia, the highly anticipated referendum on a new name for this small Balkan state has begun.
Around 1.8 million voters are expected to decide whether their state should be named North Macedonia in the future.
This is because of its northern province of the same name, the neighboring Greece.
As a means of pressure, Athens had for almost three decades blocked any rapprochement of Skopje with the EU and NATO.
If the citizens vote yes, they will also give the start to the Western integration of their country.
Elie Wiesel, The Author Who Saves the Shoah from Forgetting
Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel would have been 90 years old on September 30.
The 1986 Nobel Peace Prize winner dies in 2016 in the United States, leaving behind a work that preserves the horror of the Shoah for posterity.
Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The register is intended to facilitate organ donation and relieve family members in stressful situations.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs may continue to be removed only with express consent, Swisstransplant emphasizes.
(dpa) Switzerland is launching an electronic register for organ donors this Monday.
This should facilitate organ donation and relieve family members in stressful situations.
People who want to make their organs available in the event of death can register there.
Your wishes can then be retrieved by Swisstransplant if necessary.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs can only be removed with express consent, as in Germany, Swisstransplant emphasizes.
It is assumed that 15 percent of Swiss people have a donor card, says Franz Immer, director of the Swisstransplant Foundation.
But only in five percent of cases a card is found at the decisive moment with potential donors.
In more than 60 percent of conversations, the relatives do not know the deceased’s wish.
"They then have to decide on behalf of the deceased, which is often very burdensome," says Immer.
A similar registration system already exists in the UK.
In Germany, there are considerations to store information about possible organ donation on the health insurance card, as the spokeswoman of the Federal Center for Health Education, Marita Völker-Albert says.
"There is no register in which people can register their wishes - pro or contra organ donation," she says.
Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn has voted in favour of a new regulation on organ donation.
According to his proposal, everyone would initially be considered an organ donor, unless he or relatives disagree.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.
14-year-old student becomes world champion in head computing
The 14-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is world champion in head computing.
He prevailed on the weekend in Wolfsburg against 39 competitors.
This was announced by Martina Flame-Jasper from the Science Museum Phaeno, the venue of the competition, on Sunday.
The 16-year-old Wenzel Grüß from Germany took third place.
The youngest participant in the World Cup was a twelve-year-old Japanese student, the oldest a 74-year-old retiree from France, as chief referee Ralf Laue said.
The computer science professor from Zwickau (Saxony) organizes the competition every two years.
Previous tasks were, for example: 14,130 214 x 17,981,822 or 57,809,355 + 28 x 16,448,333.
As spectators were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon, where participants competed against guests from the audience with calculators.
Wenzel Greetings from Lastrup demonstrated how he holds a ball with his head in the air while calculating.
He is one of seven Germans in the competition.
A total of 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for the competition.
Greetings was already two years ago when the 14-year-old was in Bielefeld.
With terms such as superbrain, genius or miracle child, organizer Laue can do little.
"Head computing can be trained," he said.
Many participants practiced several hours a day.
In India or Singapore, there are even stadium-based computing competitions.
The disciplines include, for example, drawing square roots from six-digit numbers.
With versatility computing, candidates get surprise tasks, for which they need to quickly find a solution strategy.
The Germans also have good chances here, the chief referee said.
Otherwise, Asians often have an advantage because there, early in childhood, brain computing is learned more intensively and with other, effective methods.
Urgent Appeal: Video with Naked Serena Williams: It's About Breast Cancer Early Detection
Tennis Ass Serena Williams shows up from her emotional and sensitive side.
With this video, the 37-year-old wants to point out breast cancer and advocate for early detection.
It is about life and death, but also about courage and enlightenment.
Serena Williams sings upstairs without the song "I Touch Myself" from the group "The Divinyls" - only her hands cover their most intimate places.
Singer Chrissy Amphlett has died.
The emotional video is part of the “I Touch Myself” project, which is about breast cancer early detection that can save lives.
Serena Williams died almost a year ago.
At the birth of their daughter Alexis Olympia, there were complications.
An emergency surgery was launched to save the baby’s life.
In a subsequent CT, blood clots were discovered in Serena's lungs.
Just in time...
Government wants to ban more extremist symbols
The German government is planning a significant extension of the ban on the use of extremist symbols.
Next week, the turquoise-blue coalition will send a corresponding bill on the so-called "symbols law" into review.
The aim is to significantly increase the number of terrorist or comparable groups covered by the ban.
Polar cold air brings fresh snow to the mountains in the west
Ms. Holle will shake her beds in the west for the first time next week: Polar cold air reaches Vorarlberg, North Tyrol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to the meteorologists of the Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snowfall limit falls at the beginning of the week to 1,500 to 1,200 meters - in narrow valleys, it can snow down to about 1,000 meters at strong intensity, it said.
From the Bregenzerwald to the Hohe Tauern, 20 to 40 centimeters of fresh snow can be expected above 2,000 meters.
On higher pass roads (Arlbergpass, Timmelsjoch, Bieler Höhe, Brennerpass, Gerlospass, Felbertauern, Großglockner Hochalpenstraße) the road conditions are therefore wintery.
Farmers are allowed to start the annual kink care on Monday
Schleswig-Holstein’s farmers are allowed to start the annual kink care on Monday.
The "green ramparts", which are unique in Germany, have shaped the landscape of the low-forest state for about 200 years.
The up to five meters wide tree and shrub hedges are "Waldersatz" and for many animals and plants the last retreat rooms.
Knicks connect living spaces scattered as corridors, through which the exchange of organisms can still work, as the managing director of the Naturschutzbund Deutschland (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski, said.
Knicks are living fences
The Knicks were created by order of the Danish king Christian VI in 1766, who ruled Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only field boundaries and livestock fences, they also supplied the farmers with firewood and beams for their half-timbered houses.
His name "Knick" also comes from that time: The dense, intertwined demarcations could develop through the "kinkling" of the branches.
Today, some 45,000 kilometres of hedges stretch between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, giving the image of a woody, diversely structured landscape.
According to the NABU, they are now used by around 7,000 animal species as a substitute habitat.
Up to 1800 different species could live in one kilometre of bend and breed up to 30 pairs of birds.
However, the kink can only fulfill its ecologically important function if it is properly cared for in winter.
Otherwise, it decays into a light row of trees, which, in addition to biodiversity, also loses the wind protection effect, said Ludwichowski.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, kink care may only be operated outside the breeding season from October to March.
After the tsunami in Sulawesi Indonesians talk about situation on the ground
The local Radika Pinto describes in an interview with the editorial network Germany (RND) the situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquakes and the tsunami:
Were you there during the tsunami?
No, I was in Jakarta on the island of Java at the time.
When the earthquakes came, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I learned about the tsunami, I immediately set out on my way back to Sulawesi.
I arrived on Sunday morning because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight, because the airport on Palu was closed at the time.
What is the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that relief supplies can also be flown in.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, all of which were completely destroyed.
Our office of "World Vision" has also been destroyed, but we have temporarily set up something where we have also accommodated other people.
Where are the people living in Sulawesi now?
Many have run to surrounding hills, where they still stand out for fear of another tsunami and earthquakes, and where they have no access to water and food.
Some are staying in front of their homes, there are still aftershocks.
Because many grocery stores and petrol stations are completely closed, people sometimes steal food and gasoline.
The public service is completely shut down, the national government is helping out.
A prison has also been destroyed, the prisoners are partly walking around freely and the search for them is difficult.
There are still many bodies around, many people have not been found and are missing.
How is the communication and information on the island?
At the moment we have mobile phone reception, but before that did not work and we only got information via the radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors and other people they don’t know if they live or where they are because people were on the road during the earthquakes, not at home, but at work, for example.
The tsunami warning system did not work properly.
Do you have any information?
We don't know the reasons for this, but when the unwarning came, many thought, "Okay, no tsunami" - and then he came.
In other regions that were not hit by the tsunami, there was misinformation that a tsunami hit the region and they ran onto the surrounding mountains.
Is an island like Sulawesi, located on the Pacific Ring of Fire, not prepared for earthquakes?
Yes, there are earthquakes every day, but this one was the worst.
We usually know how to react to earthquakes and we also train evacuations.
But the entire infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake has hit a lot of people.
Muscle injuries against Werder: VfB has to forgo Aogo and Donis for a long time
Anastasios Donis and Dennis Aogo will be missing from VfB Stuttgart with severe muscle injuries for a long time.
Aogo suffered a muscle fissure in the rear left thigh at the 2-1 match against Werder Bremen on Saturday, the football Bundesliga announced on Sunday.
In Donis, the doctors diagnosed a muscle bundle tear in the thigh.
Both players are definitely not an option against Hannover 96 on Saturday and will probably miss games even after the following international break.
VfB Stuttgart did not make a forecast for the downtime.
A muscle bundle tear usually heals within six to eight weeks, a muscle fiber tear usually heals a little faster.
Triumph of Hyperrealism at the San Sebástian Film Festival
San Sebastián - With the Film Festival of San Sebastián closes annually the recitals of the most prestigious European festivals.
In spite of all the singing off to the cinema, 2018 was a remarkable year for the film.
After a convincing competition in Cannes, especially with strong contributions from Europe and Asia and a Venice that attracted a lot of attention with Oscar candidates from Hollywood, San Sebastian also delivered one of his best competitions in recent years.
On Sunday morning, the fire brigade in Olching tried to catch an injured duck.
However, the action lasted for some time.
Even a boat was used.
Olching - Walkers on Lake Olching noticed a white, injured duck on Sunday morning.
She was in the water station.
To help the animal, the passers-by called the police and the fire department.
However, the first attempts to capture the duck went wrong.
Despite the injury, she was able to dodge the forces again and again.
In the end, she fled to the lake.
With a lifeboat, the fire brigade could encircle the animal and push it back to shore, where it was then placed in a transport box after almost an hour by a firefighter with a brave handle.
The chest-injured duck was then taken to the LMU veterinary clinic in Oberschleißheim.
But according to the first estimates, their chances of survival are rather low.
Biathlete Julian Eberhard aims for World Cup medal
Fourth place at Olympia was biathlete Julian Eberhard long in the stomach.
Next winter, the Saalfeldener wants to make up for the missed precious metal at the World Cup in <0xC3><0x96>stersund.
The last shot cost the 31-year-old in the Olympic Sprint of Pyeongchang the to grab near medal.
Seven tenths of a second was missing on bronze.
"I deliberately gave myself time to process this," says Eberhard at the opening of the MyGym gym in his hometown of Saalfelden.
A medal was the goal, I was in top shape, but it just didn’t want to be.
All the more motivated is the Pinzgauer to catch up with the missing precious metal in the new season: "The goal can only be to come back to a major event with the Constitution, to win something.
At some point you have to hit.
The World Cup track in <0xC3><0x96>stersund (SWE) is Eberhard: "I have already closed the track in my heart", he remembers with joy his fourth World Cup place in the individual race last year.
Immediately after Olympia, he celebrated the only single win for Austria in the mass start competition of Kontiolahti (FIN) in the past World Cup winter.
With the season he ran in Oslo (NOR) in second place.
Brett Kavanaugh: FBI investigation at turbo rate
Time is extremely short and the number of planned interrogations is severely limited.
With an FBI investigation at turbo rate, the Republicans in the US Senate want to secure the ultra-thin majority for the controversial judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh for coercion allegations.
President Donald Trump has set the investigators a deadline until Friday to clarify the alleged incidents more than 30 years ago.
The most recent turn in the drama around Kavanaugh’s vocation, accompanied by a cultural struggle, was triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing of Kavanaugh and the first prosecutor, Christine Blasey Ford, during which the lawyer cast furious tirades against the opposition Democrats, the Senate Judiciary Committee should clear the way for the final confirmation of the arch-conservative judge at the Supreme Court.
The majority of Republicans seemed assured when suddenly Senator Jeff Flake, contrary to his original announcement, declared he would agree, but demanded an FBI investigation.
After tumultuous scenes, his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who had called the serious reservations on Thursday a "shot", initially abstained from further attacks on the women and, on the contrary, spoke of "luck in misfortune".
In this way, final doubts could be eliminated, he said.
Later, Trump attacked Democrats at an election rally for rejecting Kavanaugh: “They’re trying to block and destroy.”
Trump orders FBI investigation into Kavanaugh case
The White House has also severely restricted investigators’ powers.
“We will investigate the known accusations of two women, nothing more,” a government official told the Wall Street Journal, “they are not going on a fishing trip.”
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses will be heard.
According to the municipality, the mobile radar device of the municipality of Ried, installed in a "civil vehicle", to monitor the speed limit, will be stationed on the Gartenstraße from Monday, October 1.
There is also the Federal School Center.
The municipality also operates several fixed-installed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: You felt the fear
Trainers Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated their first win of the season against Mainz.
The relief at Schalke is great after the first win of the season.
Nevertheless, against Mainz, the factor of time also played a role.
Gelsenkirchen - It is now well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist in football matches.
This was no different in the home game against Mainz 05.
“I saw every ball in there.
And there were a lot of corners and a lot of balls in our penalty area," said the Schalke 04 sports board - and breathed up.
After all, the Königsblauen had managed to bring the narrow 1:0 against the Rheinhessen over time and thus the first victory of the season under the roof.
In fact, it could have been different.
After the lead by Alessandro Schöpf 11 had given the team of head coach Domenico Tedesco security Tedesco: "In total, the first half was good, both playful and from the pressing".
Not really a headball monster.
"The last ten minutes felt like two hours for me," said Heidel: "If the team was half as nervous as I was on the bench, I can understand that."
The boys were afraid to give it out of their hands and therefore retreated further and further.
And defended with man and mouse against Mainz.
To save the first three points of the season.
"We have all fallen a huge stone from the heart," said Schöpf, who had no insignificant share in his headball hit: "I am actually the worst headball player in manship."
But in the end, only victory counts.
The relief was felt throughout the arena, of course also at Tedesco.
"We wanted to start pressingly in the initial phase and turn it into a fireworks display," said Schalke's chief coach.
Victory was important.
We can finally enjoy a few hours.
I am very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We played intelligently, quietly and bravely, so we have to tackle games over 90 minutes
Probably the biggest flaw of the afternoon: Königsblau missed it, rather to care for clearer conditions.
The possibilities were finally there, for example by the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who hit the bar twice 59./72. or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it wouldn't have been a trembling victory," Tedesco said: "You've already felt the fear a bit."
So I'm glad we won.
He was not the only Schalker.
Fischbachau: Smoke column in the Leitzachtal 2 km visible
The smoke was not to be overlooked.
From around two kilometers away, a hiker observed a fire in the Leitzachtal on Sunday at around 13.30 pm.
Now the police are investigating.
Fischbachau - Police and fire brigade soon found out the cause: An unknown person had lit garbage on a two-square-meter area at Gschwendner Berg.
According to police, it seemed that he had monitored the fire for a long time, but then left the flame unattended.
And that near the forest.
30 Fischbachau firefighters were busy with separating and extinguishing.
Police are now investigating for arson.
Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: A discussion on an equal footing
In front of them is the author, Professor Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani.
He has repeatedly accepted the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
"I have made it my mission for many years to bring interesting people to Greven," explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfelder Treff" - the association that cooperates with the alliance "Kulturpolitik" in the organization of the evening.
El-Mafaalani enters the reading very loosely, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the subject in an understandable way.
With a lot of gestures, solid numbers and some jokes, he brings the audience closer to one of the most conflicting themes: migration and integration.
Why are conflicts growing despite successful integration?
The Syrian-born author uses a metaphor to answer the question.
At one table is the German society, at the cat table the migrants of the first generation.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to sit at the table.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they have always sat at the big table and now want to help determine.
This leads to conflict.
It is therefore not decisive whether one is politically on the right or on the left, but: "Am I for or against an open society?" he emphasizes.
At first rather behave, then the discussion round starts more and more actively.
And there is a need for speech.
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, two teachers tell how they see successful or unsuccessful integration among students.
El-Mafaalani is in front, not on stage, a symbol of the discussion: it is on an equal footing.
The sociology professor does not impose his opinion, stressing that he speaks of the average, not of individual fates.
He is pleased that there is interest in the issue, because "only when we understand what the problem is, we can find solutions," says El-Mafaalani.
During the subsequent signing session, he also kept an open ear for the questions of the guests and also in the foyer, with prepared Kurdish specialties, intensively discussed further.
Basketball: Bonn and Giessen win opening games
The Giessen 46ers and the Telekom Baskets Bonn have finished the first matchday of the Basketball Bundesliga (BBL) with a home and away victory.
Giessen prevailed in a hard-fought match in his own hall with 91:84 (43:46) against the Central German BC.
The ambitious Bonners won at the BG Göttingen with 86:79 (49:47).
The first leader of the season is Alba Berlin after the 112:55 Gala on Saturday against Science City Jena.
The German champions Bayern Munich and the former series champion Brose Bamberg had significantly more trouble at the beginning of the new season.
Munich already struggled on Friday to a 83:77 at ratiopharm Ulm, Bamberg on Saturday won the Frankenderby at s.Oliver Würzburg with 84:80.
Building in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 plots
The demand is apparently huge: over 100 interested parties have applied for the purchase of one of the plots in Landsham-Süd.
The municipality of Pliening has sold the first land in the newly built Landsham-South area on the free market.
Mayor Roland Frick said.
In addition, the application phase has been completed for those 20 plots that the municipality offers at more favourable terms and prices - similar to the previous local model.
About 100 applications have been received, according to Frick.
"Currently the documents are being reviewed" with regard to the application criteria, completeness and correctness.
According to the mayor of Plieninger, the aim is to have the applicant ranking for the 20 plots drawn up by the end of the year and to submit it to the municipal council.
After that, the award can be made.
A total of 50 plots for single and semi-detached houses will be created on the site in the south of Landsham, as well as four areas for multi-family buildings with eight residential units each.
The development is now almost complete, the roads and paths are to be paved soon.
A single plot and two of the multi-family houses belong to a private person, the rest of the municipality of Pliening.
It sells the majority on the free market, 20 plots in a socially compatible model.
According to Frick, the two multi-family houses of the municipality are to be built as affordable housing.
With a total of 16 income-oriented apartments funded by the Free State.
Space for 200 people
The area of the newly built Landsham-Süd area is roughly estimated to provide housing for about 200 people.
Not only that: Now, at the beginning of October, according to Frick, the start of the new construction of a daycare center is taking place there.
It will house three kindergarten groups and three crib groups as well as a multi-purpose room.
The opening is scheduled for September 2019, the start of the next kindergarten year.
This is how Schalke's Naldo "big sport" also succeeds on the bench
For the third time in a row not in the starting elf: Nevertheless, Naldo thanks Schalke coach Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues had sat for the third time in a row not in the Schalk starting elf, but on the exchange bench, the understanding would have been great for many people, if the almost two meter tall Brazilian had really talked the frustration of the soul.
But when the Schalker players gathered as usual in the middle circle after the 1-0 victory over the FSV Mainz 05 and head coach Domenico Tedesco thanked all his professionals, the 36-year-old, who is all called Naldo for simplicity, turned in and said: "We have to thank you, coach!"
"It was very emotional, it was a great sport," Tedesco later said about the reaction of his deputy captain, who had no resentment despite his re-servist presence.
Probably Naldo, who was celebrated last season as the best Schalker, knows that he did not actually get on the track with his coach - but gets a break for good reason.
One reason called "tax control".
It was not easy to tell him
"It wasn't easy to tell him that, I'm telling you quite honestly," Tedesco said of the moment he told Naldo that he wasn't in the starting eleven.
He is an important player, he is an important person.
But it’s always about the thing, it’s about the club,” Tedesco said.
Naldo played against Bayern and Porto for 90 minutes.
He is 36 years old.
It is important that everyone can get through at the moment.
And that we all keep in the boat," Tedesco explained the rotation, which recently caught Naldo.
And to which the Brazilian responded with the wisdom of his advanced age: by also showing himself on the bench as an exemplary team player.
The mood in Austria’s industry continued to accelerate in August compared to the eurozone.
The Purchasing Manager Index (PMI) was at a 37-month low with 46.7 points.
Austria still has the third-best mood in Europe, behind Ireland and the Netherlands, the Markit Institute announced on Monday in its survey of 3,000 companies.
Unlike in Austria, the PMI of the euro zone rose by 1.1 to 45.1 points, but the index is still below the mark of 50 points for the 13th consecutive month, which indicates growth.
Only Ireland’s industry hit this threshold in August with 50.9 points.
At the end of the day, the Greeks scored 42.1 points.
In Germany, France and Spain, the mood barometer declined, but slower than in the previous months.
In Spain, the index reached its highest level since March with 44.0 points.
"While the slightly weakened descent could mean that the worst has passed," Markit economist Rob Dobson said.
However, the industry remains - in the third quarter anyway - growth brake number one.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: export orders in the eurozone have not fallen as strongly as since November 2011.
The companies therefore cut jobs for the seventh consecutive month.
In China, industrial production fell more than initially expected in August.
The mood barometer fell from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts had initially expected 47.8 points.
The Purchasing Manager Index is based on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial companies.
Among other things, developments in sales, employment, warehouses and prices are collected.
Tuchels PSG team wins in eighth league game
29 September 2018 at 19:45
Nice coach Thomas Tuchel rushes from victory to victory with Paris Saint-Germain in France’s football championship.
At the OGC Nice, the defending champion won thanks to two goals from superstar Neymar with 3:0 (1:0) and was thus also successful in the eighth league game.
The last time Olympique Lyon had made such a good start to the season in France 82 years ago.
Brazilian Neymar put PSG in the lead after 22 minutes and set the final score in the aftermath.
Christopher Nkunku (46th) won the 2–0 win.
Paris also made the rehearsal for the groundbreaking second Champions League group game against Red Star Belgrade on Wednesday.
At the start of the championship, Tuchel’s team had to accept the 2-3 in Liverpool the only defeat so far this season.
