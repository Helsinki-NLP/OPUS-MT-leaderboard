The Prague Stock Exchange collapses at the closing of business.
After the steep fall in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange was able to correct the losses.
Transactions with the shares of <0xC4><0x8C>EZ reached almost half of the normal day-to-day business.
The Prague Stock Exchange started trading on Tuesday with the fall of Monday, when it fell by a further six percentage points.
This time the reason for the break-in on Wall Street.
In the Czech Republic, too, the reaction of the market to the result of the vote of the American House of Representatives, which had refused to support a stabilization plan for the financial sector there.
Fall of shares in Asia
A dramatic fall occurred on Tuesday in the stock markets in Asia, although the indices were able to offset some of the losses over the course of the day.
The Hong Kong Hang Seng Stock Exchange index lost nearly four percentage points over the course of the business day, but was later able to offset some of the losses, thus reducing the decline to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which monitors the movement of Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong stock exchange, fell 3.8 percent, while the markets in Shanghai were closed.
The shares on the Sydney stock exchange lost more than five percent, but then reduced the losses to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan Stock Exchange declined by 3.6 percent after the Taiwanese index.
“The timing for the U.S. rescue operation is uncertain and will affect financial markets around the world,” Hong Kong Monetary Authority chief Joseph Yam said in a statement.
Hong Kong, although it belongs to China, determines its monetary policy itself, that is, independent of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are at the same level as those in the United States.
U.S. lawmakers should return to the negotiating table as soon as possible, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, and adopt the draft to support the financial system.
Otherwise, it threatens that other countries would also be affected by the burglary.
A bloodbath of American stocks
The U.S. House of Representatives on Monday rejected the plan to support the financial system, which should be spent up to $700 billion (almost 12 trillion K<0xC4><0x8D>).
Legislators thus ignored President George Bush’s request to support the plan.
In Bush’s view, the plan would regulate the underlying causes of the financial crisis and thus help stabilize the entire economy.
U.S. stocks experienced a bloodbath on Monday, and key stock indices recorded the biggest drop in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones Index declined by almost seven percent, a similar decline it had last recorded in 1987.
The index had already fallen before the vote, but there were hardly any indications that the draft would not pass through in the House of Representatives, the index experienced a free fall.
Congress makes concession: U.S. government is allowed to pump $700 billion into banks
The top representatives of the U.S. Congress and the administration of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of an agreement on financial assistance to the U.S. financial system.
This is to be voted on early next week.
American lawmakers made a breakthrough in talks about the adoption of a $700 billion (about 12 trillion kronor) bailout plan in the form of financial aid to the American financial system.
However, this does not mean a victory.
The congressmen have to negotiate some details of the agreement before they can publish the final version of the law and vote on it.
The plan to support the financial system will be negotiated in the U.S. Congress on Monday.
On Sunday, the chairman of the Banking and Financial Services Committee, Barney Frank, told Reuters.
According to various figures, the Senate could probably vote on the plan at the earliest on Wednesday.
According to economists, an announcement that the plan will be adopted should be the first significant psychological factor for a revival of financial markets.
Afterwards, however, there is a "disillusionment" due to the complicated mechanisms of how to help the markets in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
“We have made significant progress.
We have clarified our differing views on what a package to stabilize the market should look like," Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
According to them, there could be a final vote on Sunday.
Representatives of lawmakers met with U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Sunday night to give the government fund its final shape.
This provides for a purchase of unselling mortgage assets from financial companies, which plunge financial firms into heavy losses and endanger the stability of the entire system.
"We are on the verge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and that must also be effective in the market.
You have to continue the recovery plan even further, but I think we're on target," Paulson said.
A signal for business in Asia
The global financial crisis is also significantly reflected in the stock markets, which are falling sharply.
According to Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers are striving to reach a final agreement in Congress before Sunday.
This is to reassure investors of transactions on the Asian financial markets, which are in the first time zone, where a decision by Congress could affect the business on Monday.
So far, however, it is not entirely clear when both chambers of the American Congress will vote on the law, and there is also a lack of clarity as to whether negotiations at the last minute could still fail due to a problem.
Legislators hope it will be adopted in the next few days.
However, the law will undergo some changes.
The total amount intended to help the system is to be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion should be made available as soon as possible, as President George Bush demanded.
But Congress can block the distribution of the remaining money if it has the impression that the program is not fulfilling its function, with another $100 billion and later the final $350 billion.
Bush says progress in negotiations is positive
The President has the right to veto this decision, but Congress can override his veto.
However, despite these changes, the basic idea of the program, which was based on obtaining finance for buying bad mortgage securities, whose value has fallen, has remained, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer able to repay their mortgages.
“We worked out everything.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday, the Senate on Monday," Republican Senator Judd Gregg said.
American President Bush was also pleased with the progress.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, said Bush was satisfied with Saturday’s progress and “appreciates the mutual effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy.”
Restriction of golden parachutes
Senate Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, the senior negotiator, said lawmakers had agreed on a responsibility for the money program, protecting taxpayers from losses, closing perks, and a schedule for funding the plan.
The new law also aims to restrict the so-called golden parachutes for directors of the companies involved in the program and establishes a committee to supervise the fund.
This is to be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on it and made great progress towards an agreement that works and is important to the market and to all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also anticipates help for homeowners who have trouble repaying their mortgage.
The government should negotiate new installments on mortgages it buys up, with the goal being to lower the monthly costs for the debtors and allow them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological help
According to the chief economist of Patria Finance, David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but the implementation will be very difficult.
"It is because you do not know by what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets are bought up.
This will be critical to how the financial sector and the government divide the losses among themselves," Marek told the server iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan will be adopted now or early next week is not decisive in Marek’s view.
“It is much more important for Congressmen to agree to support the plan and to adopt it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of the agreement that there will be an adoption is the most important thing at this moment," Marek stressed.
Duel on knife edge: MP3 player against mobile phones.
We advise you on your choice
While almost any mobile phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can still make phone calls.
Therefore, of course, it looks like it’s better to buy just one phone.
Despite all this, there are plenty of reasons why you should acquire an independent player.
The choice depends entirely on the type of use and the claims of the future owner.
Surely you hardly buy a great expensive turntable at home to listen to the latest album by Maxim Turbulenc.
Once such musical novelties do not appear on LPs, and from a qualitative point of view, there is no objective reason for this.
However, if you have LPs with art rock, jazz or blues on the shelf, you probably dream of at least one.
This is also the case with music when traveling, i.e. with compressed music, in simple terms - music in MP3 format.
Here, too, there are price and quality categories.
For some it may not be acceptable to spend eight thousand kroner for a player, but a pink-floyd fan will probably not be able to handle headphones for twenty kroner from the market.
Two extremes, between which there is enough space for everyone.
The selection is wide.
The life of the batteries is also crucial.
Some good music players can play much more than just music, but what mobile phones can do they don’t even create insinuatingly.
No modern device can be used as universally as the phone.
In addition to the primary functions, calling and simsing, it can play music and videos, record both, it has a better, sometimes a worse camera and maybe can also navigate.
And if you still include the smartphones and communicators, you almost have a small computer in your pocket.
It’s a small miracle, because no refrigerator can grill and no TV can photograph.
But the universality of mobile phones also has disadvantages.
However, the more features you use on your phone, the more often you will have to reload it.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy eaters.
Few phones can play music for longer than ten-twelve hours, usually much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the simplest ones) are much more powerful.
That’s why you should expect cheap phones to be able to play music no longer than a few hours.
If you still make phone calls from time to time, you would rather buy a charger for the office for safety - this also applies to more expensive devices.
With MP3 players, you won’t have this problem, even the less good ones will last at least 9 hours of continuous operation with one charge.
Another problem is when you want to transfer the music to your phone.
Unfortunately, only a small part of the devices have a USB connection, and not every phone can be connected directly to a PC without special software.
Of course, you can transfer the music directly to a storage medium, but only a few card readers can handle the tiny memory cards used in mobile phones without any reduction.
Players do not require special software except for exceptions (iPod).
You only need to feed the device via USB port with music from your PC.
Most mobile phones and players create a music library themselves, ordered by the name of the performer, the title of the album, the genre or, for example, the rating by users.
Some devices only map the tree structure of the address directory, similar to Windows Explorer, some can do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Players are easier to use, mobile phones can do more
When choosing a specific device, you should inquire about the life of the battery, the storage capacity, the quality and type of sound and, of course, the ease of use.
If music is mainly a backdrop for you and you only hear it briefly every day, for example in the tram, then any mobile phone that plays MP3 files is enough.
What almost any cell phone can do.
You also don’t have to control which music formats a mobile phone or a player can handle.
MP3 creates all, and most of the music you get will be in this format right now.
The format is one of the most widely used, and most devices can also play music in WMA format.
Less common is AAC (a format that Apple and its iPods use).
Better mobile phones also allow you to buy music online.
You only need to access the corresponding pages of a provider (or another provider) via the mobile internet, and you can buy a song or album.
This service can in itself be a striking argument for why you should buy a music phone.
Unfortunately, the offer of the providers is poor and is mostly limited to fast radio hits.
The prices are also not the lowest.
In general, however, it is assumed that this kind of selling of music (whether via GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most of them carry their phones with them.
If you feel like listening to something, grab your phone in your jacket pocket while the player is forgotten at home.
However, it matters whether you carry headphones or at least a wireless hands-free device.
If not, you can access the built-in speaker that almost every phone has, but only the fewest MP3 players.
Probably the biggest advantage of music phones will be the price for many.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than three thousand crowns.
For three and four thousand crowns you get a decent walkman.
The biggest handicap for most will be that there are no normal headphones.
The best and most technically sophisticated phones with a 3.5mm opening for normal headphones cost up to fifteen thousand crowns.
The advantage of the player, in turn, lies in the ease of use.
The simplest - and not necessarily the cheapest (see selection) - player can really be used by anyone.
A minimum of functions, the similarity in operation with the previously normal cassette recorder or, for example, the turntable, is obvious.
There is no threat of a collision in the form of an incorrectly employed mobile internet and a subsequently horrendous invoice for data transmissions.
Which device should you use?
Even the cheapest phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable storage media (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even if you buy a corresponding card, two thousand crowns are enough.
But beware.
In the basic models, only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are usually supported.
Only the most expensive can read 8GB memory cards.
If you already own a mobile phone and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, then go to Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (maximum 2 GB), you do not have to put more than 1100 crowns on the table.
Be among the more sophisticated listeners, prefer specialized phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some from Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have standalone control buttons for MP3, and the ease of use comes close to that of a single MP3 player.
The widest one is Sony Ericsson, whose phones from the Walkman series have the same user interface as the individually sold MP3 players.
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand kronor, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery life (usually 15 hours, up to a maximum of 35 hours) provide you with MP3 players from the above manufacturers.
The first virtual provider will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite mature, the Czech providers offer virtually all the services offered by their partners in Western Europe.
Nevertheless, something is missing here - a virtual provider that forces the classics to lower prices.
Maybe he won’t be waiting for long.
The fact that the Czech mobile operators work among the most expensive in Europe, we have often reported on Mobil.cz.
By the way, this was also confirmed by the Telecommunications Authority <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, which pointed out that the price of an SMS here is higher than in the rest of the European Union.
Following the final steps of the European Commission in regulating roaming fees, this is likely to lead to a paradoxical situation - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
Why are prices in the Czech Republic so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition, which really makes a battle claim.
Perhaps it sounds paradoxical, in the Czech Republic there are three mobile networks and a penetration of far more than 100%.
Mobile operators, on the other hand, like to taunt the fact that there is an extremely high level of competition in the Czech market.
This is often agreed by the Chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (<0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>), Pavel Dvo<0xC5><0x99>ák, who in the past had often said that there was no room for another provider in the Czech Republic.
It is likely that a traditional provider with its own network no longer has many opportunities (by the way, it would probably hardly find frequencies).
But there is one more possibility - a virtual provider.
It was precisely the entry of virtual providers into the mobile phone market that resulted in a significant price reduction, to which classic mobile phone providers also had to react.
Even before companies such as Tesco Mobile and Virgin Mobile entered the market in the UK, there were similar voices to those in the Czech Republic.
However, it has been shown that there is room for such providers and that they can really be successful.
By the way, it doesn’t take long to look for examples.
In February this we reported about the launch of the virtual provider Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, this provider managed to attract more than 100 thousand customers and thus become the fifth largest provider in the country.
Behind Mobilking is the financial group Penta, which owns U:fon in the Czech Republic, among other things.
The advantage of virtual providers is that you can focus on a much more concrete target group.
In order to function effectively, virtual providers need far fewer customers than a traditional provider.
They do not need relatively high costs for the construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network.
In the world, virtual vendors usually stand out as low-cost companies - they offer cheap phone calls and SMS, which is often accompanied by a less extensive range of services.
In the UK, for example, Tesco Mobile offers SMS at least half the price of its competitors.
However, as the example of mobile gaming in Poland shows, it can also be a fairly good move to bet on a non-stereotypical target group.
This provider is specifically targeted at men.
"Real guys choose Mobilking - the provider they like and can trust," said David Seibert, the CEO of the Mobile Entertainment Company, the operator of this virtual provider.
It is difficult to say whether a similar concept as in Poland could also gain a foothold in the Czech Republic.
Vodafone spokesman Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> also doubts this: "The Czech market is relatively small for a market segment on which most virtual providers are based.
In addition, it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the service offering."
In the Czech Republic there is no chance, the mobile operators mean
However, it is almost certain that if a virtual mobile carrier conquers the Czech Republic, it will not be mobile.
"We are talking about an expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not look very hopeful.
Mobilking is more likely to enter the market in other countries in our region," said Jana Studni<0xC4><0x8D>ková, press spokeswoman for Penta Financial Group, in a telephone conversation for Mobil.cz.
Indirectly, she confirmed that the current mobile operators in the Czech Republic are not particularly inclined to this idea.
On the contrary, they are trying to do everything they can to avoid creating a potential competitor.
The GTS Novera Group has long been demonstrating its interest in launching a virtual mobile service provider, which wants to take another step to become a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the business segment.
"We have a great interest in offering our customers not only fixed-line but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner, the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this option with all Czech mobile operators.
With some of them, we have already been able to achieve negotiation progress," said Pavel Kaidl, a press spokesman for the group.
Maybe better times are coming.
Non-official information indicates that the first virtual provider may be expected by the end of the year.
So far, however, this is surrounded by an insurmountable wall of silence.
"At this moment, we do not assume that there is room for a full-fledged virtual provider in the Czech Republic.
The Czech market has large specificities compared to other markets.
So far, no subject has addressed us with a complex and serious project in this area," says Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88> from the Telefónica O2 press department in his statement to Mobil.cz.
Other suppliers also point to the specificity of the Czech market.
Martina Kemrová, T-Mobile’s press spokesperson, rarely agrees with O2’s statement: “So far, we haven’t found a viable and mutually beneficial project to build on.”
And she adds: “There will be hardly a virtual provider on T-Mobile’s network by the end of the year.
At this moment, we would have to have a concrete offer already in place in order to be able to think in such a short term."
Vodafone focuses its attention more on meeting the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> says: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual providers, especially in the area of cost sharing and infrastructure.
This is exactly what we see as the best from the customer’s point of view.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for a fast mobile Internet."
The responsible authorities - with the providers hand in hand
The approach of the mobile operators is easy to understand, another provider would be more competition, this would lead to lower prices and thus also to a decrease in profits.
So why should such a competitor make it easier to enter the market?
The fact that the providers can pull together when it comes to something is also evidenced by the long back and forth around the creation of U:fon.
Probably the strongest pressure towards <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> was from T-Mobile at the time when U:fon was launched.
This is also confirmed by the publicly available information from the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> websites.
Now, however, U:fon is suitable as an argument, why you should not allow a virtual provider.
Martina Kemrová commented: "The competitive environment of the mobile market has also recently been strengthened by the entry of a fourth mobile operator.
Taking into account the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that a new player would place high demands on the market itself and, above all, its services."
However, in view of this approach of mobile operators, the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulators is astonishing.
This is not just the attitude of the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, which unfortunately does not have the competence to intervene in economic competition in the Czech Republic, unlike in the UK and other highly developed countries.
It is owned exclusively by the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (<0xC3><0x9A>OHS).
This, however, related to this whole problem its very typical attitude.
"The entry into the market of a virtual mobile provider would be possible after a contract has been concluded between a mobile provider and a virtual provider via the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
So far, no such contract has been concluded, because the offer of potential interested parties was probably not sufficiently interesting for the traditional providers", according to his response to our request Kristián Chalupa from the Department of External Relations of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
Such a wording would not come as a surprise from the representatives of the providers.
This is more than worrying from an authority that represents consumer interests and, among other things, ensures that no one abuses its position in the market.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "Abroad, where virtual providers work quite normally, it can be seen that their entry into the market has contributed to a reduction in the price of mobile phone services."
Probably, however, pressure on the correct functioning of the market and a price reduction are not part of the interests of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
What is really shocking about this case is the almost touching harmony between the three mobile operators, which results from their reactions.
The question of whether this is really just a coincidence is obvious.
Just as the absolutely same gasoline price at the gas stations is certainly just a coincidence and the result of a tough competition.
"The Authority has not discovered in this matter any indication of anti-competitive action, and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way in the matter.
None of the providers has a dominant market position, so they do not have the corresponding increased responsibility for their trading in the market.
The necessary tools for opening up the mobile market to virtual providers are probably missing from the regulatory authority for telecommunications," Chalupa said in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of many controversial points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets, drawn up by <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, according to which telecommunications is a single market from the point of view of economic competition.
In such a market, of course, none of the Czech mobile operators hold a dominant position.
However, some legal experts offer a different view - for the market entry of a virtual provider, the consent of the network operator is always necessary.
And the mobile operator has - logically - the monopoly for its network.
This means that he necessarily occupies a dominant position in a certain segment.
However, even if one does not go along with this argument, it should at least be a warning for the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS that three mobile operators act strikingly similarly.
Complaints from a number of interested parties (including the aforementioned company GTS Novera) prove that they encounter very similar obstacles in negotiations with all providers.
The transfer of responsibility to the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> is then a quite common trick in telecommunications services, with which the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS distances itself from the whole matter.
This has already been observed in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, the recently adopted amendment to the Telecommunications Act failed to enforce the extension of the competences of the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> to the area of economic competition in telecommunications, although a number of experts had promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS need to know this all too well, but they probably have other interests.
It's okay if no one's looking
First of all, the functioning of any pseudo-virtual providers, of which there are several in the Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
They are companies that issue their own price lists for mobile telecommunications services, but are only partly public.
Usually these are companies that operate in the field of multi-level marketing.
Own mobile phone services offer, for example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others.
The price lists of these companies usually only reach the chosen ones.
The joke of the matter is that the company acts towards the operator as a classic corporate customer who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, he then receives special price offers (and other offers).
The problem is that the terms and conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit similar resale.
"If there are cases that you describe, it may be a violation of the contractual terms that we will then deal with, which may lead to a termination of cooperation with the relevant company," Martina Kemrová replied to our question about this problem.
However, it is quite unlikely that such a thing will not get around to the people in charge of the mobile phone providers.
Especially in the case of the three companies mentioned, it can be thousands of customers.
However, no operator opposes such a procedure.
In fact, profits from the activities of these companies are not to be neglected and, at the same time, unlike the actual virtual providers, they are not affected by the actual official marketing.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> draws attention to possible problems: "The law allows such speculation, despite the fact that the services of these companies are only used by a very small percentage of customers.
They must also accept that the SIM card in their phone does not run in their name, so they cannot have full control of it like the normal customers of the mobile operators.”
This alone, however, would at least seem strange to the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>.
In addition, another question opens up for the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
If the mobile operators close their eyes to such a procedure, why are they locking themselves against a virtual provider?
It should be added that the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS has quite strong competences to detect such activities, and if it does not want to do so, it does not have to be satisfied with the statement by the providers that they know nothing about them and their terms and conditions would prohibit this.
When the Czech Republic is no longer the most expensive
As has already been stressed several times in the text, the entry of virtual providers into the market resulted in a significant price drop in the various services.
In practically all countries where virtual providers have emerged, the traditional providers have tried to prevent their emergence practically more or less.
The arguments they used were virtually identical - a market that was too small or too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
In the most advanced countries, however, it was precisely at these moments that the regulatory bodies intervened, which were not trying to protect the interests of mobile operators, but those of their customers.
Whether it was through formal measures or non-formal pressure, they achieved the first virtual operator, and this was followed by more.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators are throwing the whole case like a hot potato.
Based on our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that ambiguity in the competences is more than favorable in these cases.
But let’s not throw the gun into the grain.
If the background information is correct and soon a virtual provider appears, the Czech mobile market may soon start moving again.
If a provider allows the emergence of a virtual mobile provider, the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS will not remain idle when it comes to rejecting (discriminating) other interested parties.
And the Czechs will finally make phone calls no more expensive than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best from
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, on the occasion of Czech State Day, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new recordings of the national anthem Where is my homeland.
The anthem was newly recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Ji<0xC5><0x99>í B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlávek.
There are four versions available - with male or female solo singing, in choir version and in an instrumental version.
The singing version was performed by Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>ínková and Adam Plachetka.
The hymn versions are edited by Otakar Jeremiá<0xC5><0xA1> and Jaroslav Kr<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
On the iHNed.cz server, you can listen to all four versions.
For B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlávek, the Czech national anthem is one of the most beautiful hymns.
He had previously told the Czech Radio that he had chosen singers with young, representative voices for the solo versions, which are striking and popular.
"From the beginning, I tried to keep a clear diction with both and then with the choir, so that you can understand the text well, so that a harmony can be created," the conductor said.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov m<0xC5><0xAF>j first sounded in 1834 on the stage of the Ständetheater in the original Czech play Fidlova<0xC4><0x8D>ka by Josef Kajetán Tyl, the music was by Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek <0xC5><0xA0>kroup.
It became popular, and people spontaneously accepted it.
The first verse of the song became an organic part of the national anthem after the emergence of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
It remained one of the seven state symbols even after the emergence of the independent Czech Republic.
What is the "new" hymn?
The Prague transport companies will also transport on a chip for the first time on Wednesday
Wednesday, October 1, 2008, will go down in the history of Prague’s transport companies as a date when the first passengers will board a subway, tram or bus carrying an electronic coupon in their pocket instead of a paper ticket.
These can currently buy about one hundred thousand people who own the chip card Opencard.
Passengers can purchase a 30-day, a 90-day or an annual coupon (valid from 1 January 2009) and have it added to their smart card at the same time, at the information centres and branches of the transport companies at the subway stations Muzeum, M<0xC5><0xAF>stek, Nádra<0xC5><0xBE>í Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice, And<0xC4><0x9B>l, Rozadahrby, Kozkály and M<0xC5><0xAF>stek.
The coupons are also available via the Internet on the website of the transport companies www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by more than four hundred customers until the afternoon hours.
Those who use internet sales can really forget the spending window in the subway stations, where they have had to wait regularly in long queues for their paper tickets.
You buy the coupon over the Internet, it is played on the opencard in one of the thirteen branches of the city library.
"At these places, the travellers also have a counter with trained staff at their disposal, which advises interested parties on internet purchases and also adds the coupon to the card," said Martin Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD>, spokesman for the project.
In addition to the libraries, the electronic coupons can also be played on the opencard at self-service machines, which are attached in some subway tubes.
What do such machines look like?
They are red, reminiscent of ticket counterparts, the passengers may have noticed them in the metro stations Roztyly, Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"There are currently five of these in the city, but by the end of the year they should be eighty," Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD> adds.
A vending machine controls the coupon instead of the driver
Operating the vending machines, which will work from tomorrow, is easy.
All you have to do is introduce the chip card, and the previously purchased coupon will play on its own.
The electronic coupons will be valid from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the surrounding area.
So in the suburban trains and on the bus lines with the numbers 300 to 499, with which mainly the inhabitants from municipalities of the region of Central Bohemia get to the capital.
"In trains belonging to Prague Integrated Traffic, train attendants have reading devices that allow them to check the validity period of coupons by time and zone," explains Filip Drápal of the Ropid Ticket Control organization. This organization compiles the timetables for the Prague Transport Companies.
The suburban buses have card readers at the driver’s checkout.
When boarding, the smart card must not only be presented to the driver, but the open card must be placed at a marked point on the side of the checkout.
This allows the driver to check the validity of the displayed coupons.
“If a passenger wants to verify the validity of the coupons played up, nothing is easier than asking the driver for this information,” Drápal said.
A passenger who does not travel on suburban buses and does not know when the coupon will end can in turn go to the self-service machines, where the coupons will be displayed on the card.
Here, the information about the validity of his documents is displayed on the display of the device.
The Sudeten demanded a referendum from the United States.
In 1945, the Sudeten Germans had requested the annexation of the Bohemian Forest to the United States.
This is evident from a letter that is stored in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the auspices of the United States of America.
With such a wish, some groups of Sudeten Germans would have turned to the US President in 1945.
This is evident, among other things, from a letter that has been preserved in a private archive and that is now preserved in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
The Germans of Krumau in the letter asked the American president not to allow the return of the "Sudetengau" - which was taken by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Agreement - to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly and really want to be sure of the words that the American units are entering German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," the letter reads, signed with the words "people who care about the fate of the Sudeten."
Since the connection to Czechoslovakia makes the Sudeten Germans - in knowledge of the Czech national character - suspect that they would expect brutality, ruthlessness, incomprehension, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American president to take over the patronage of the Bohemian Forest for today and forever.
"We cannot believe that, regardless of the view of a quarter of a million inhabitants of this area, you are addressing a foreign state to us, which is trying to oppress and eliminate minorities and has contributed nothing to the victory of the Allies," the letter read.
The reason why the authors are unable to sign is allegedly the fear of revenge cravings of the "Czech oppressors".
If the US president has doubts about the attitude of the Germans of the Bohemian Forest, it would be sufficient if he would initiate a referendum in the Bohemian Forest region on whether the residents would become part of the United States or want to live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound a bit naive in today’s knowledge of post-war history, it does, in the opinion of some contemporary witnesses, draw a good picture of the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at the time.
Even though the Bohemian Germans had at least had to suspect that they would be negotiating their deportation from the Republic, few of them admitted such a possibility at all.
Some were waiting for the United States and Britain to negotiate some kind of autonomy for the Sudetes.
Still others believed that they could simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who comes from Budweis.
He was used in the war as a Budweiser German in the navy on the Baltic Sea.
When, at the end of the war, he came into British captivity and was taken to a prisoner-of-war camp in Holstein, dozens of other Bohemian Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that if they came home, the Czech would suit them," Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners of war who had lived in Czechoslovakia before the war believed that he would be expelled from the republic on the basis of the Bene<0xC5><0xA1> decrees.
Don't you think - then pay!
An emotional campaign aimed at drivers
Most expensive action on road safety in Czech history.
This is also how the emotion-laden media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport wants to launch on Wednesday, could be characterized.
Minister Ale<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0x98>ebí<0xC4><0x8D>ek’s authority promises to dissuade drivers from dangerous behaviour behind the wheel.
The campaign for 150 million crowns will run on television, radio, cinema, the Internet, but also on flyers.
It is intended to dissuade drivers from driving too fast and alcohol.
And also remind them to dress up before starting the ride.
The campaign aims to raise awareness among young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
What is shown in the spots?
Especially stories of people who appeal to emotions.
The "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign testifies to this:
Don't you think - then pay!
The words "do not think" are in capital letters on a license plate.
And in a pool of blood there is the word "pay".
This means that you can pay for a moment of inattentiveness with your own life.
The spots will "shock" viewers until 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where you can normally see pictures with drastic shots of accident victims.
It is expected that this will reduce the number of accidents and the number of road fatalities on the Czech roads.
The spots were compiled by the agency Euro RSCG.
Sugar bread and whip for the drivers
"The motto for the drivers is sugar bread and whip.
Sugar bread means that when you drive red, for example, you save time.
The whip is then the threat of a penalty or an accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk," says the traffic psychologist of the hospital Na Homolce Martin Ko<0xC5><0x99>án.
And that is why information campaigns in the press and, above all, negative advertising are necessary, according to the psychologist.
In his opinion, even less effective are panels that alert drivers to a danger.
"If you set up a static board that warns of a danger, it will probably soon disappear with the environment, and the drivers will no longer notice it," Ko<0xC5><0x99>án says.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
The chairman of the provisional Israeli government, Ehud Olmert, has called for the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, if peace can be made with Palestine and Syria in exchange.
He emphasized this in an interview printed on Monday by the daily newspaper Jediot Achronot.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) territories, if not all," Olmert told the newspaper.
"We keep a certain percentage of these areas, but we will have to hand over to the Palestinians a similarly high percentage (Israeli territory) because without this there will be no peace," he added.
He admitted that a possible return would include East Jerusalem.
“Those who want security in Jerusalem and, above all, don’t want tractors or bulldozers rolling over their legs, as one of my best friends has done, will have to do without a part of Jerusalem,” Olmert noted, alluding to two attacks in the city in July, in which several people were killed and dozens were injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the temple bearer and sacred and historical places" located on the territory of the Old Town.
“Anyone who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It will not work," he continued.
Departure from the Golan Heights
Olmert advocated a withdrawal of Israel from the Golan Heights, which he believes is an indispensable condition for entering into a peace treaty with Syria.
However, this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"My proposal is not to make peace with Syria solely on the basis of a withdrawal from the Golan Heights," Olmert said.
"The Syrians know all too well what to do without in order to regain the Golan Heights.
They will have to renounce their current relationship with Iran; they will have to renounce their relationship with the (Shiite) Hezbollah movement; they will have to renounce the constant support they provide to the terrorism of the (Shiite) Hamas movement, the terrorist network Al-Khaida and the Jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq," the Prime Minister said.
Questions about the accident: Are stewards on the bus unlawful?
The law does not know them, in a long-distance bus it is not allowed to wander around.
In connection with the tragic accident of a bus operated by the Student Agency near Padua, Italy, the question arises as to whether stewards and travellers are allowed to go back and forth on the bus.
"If we wanted to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of a steward would be contrary to the road traffic law," said Karel Hanzelka, spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The accident, which killed a twenty-two-year-old stewardess last week, was probably caused by the driver of the truck crossing the bus.
The young woman was sitting next to the driver at the least safe place in the car at that moment, although she had two more seats available.
However, a bus can also have an accident or slow down sharply when the steward delivers coffee or newspapers.
A role also plays in whether the bus is also equipped with standing places according to the vehicle letter.
If this is not provided on the bus, the passengers must sit.
Student Agency long-distance buses have no standing places, as confirmed by the director of the company, Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, to Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz.
"We discussed this with the Ministry, and this first did not agree with the movement of travellers.
Later, this was taken back and we reached a consensus that travelers are allowed to go to the toilet while driving if they have their seat," he said.
The law does not know a steward.
“There is no clear legal interpretation for the role of a steward – no legislation describes that role.
However, there is no legal provision prohibiting the carrier from providing services.
The Road Traffic Act only knows the term “vehicle companion”, but it does not define its rights and obligations,” Hanzelka added.
On the other hand, Josef Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, Director of the Road Vehicles Department of the Ministry of Transport, believes that the law covers this issue retrospectively.
"It depends on whether the bus also has standing places in the product approval.
That’s all,” he emphasizes.
Buses are divided into city buses where there are standing spots and the maximum speed is limited, local buses with standing spots and a higher permitted speed and long-distance buses without standing spots with the highest permitted speed and seats equipped with seat belts.
As in an airplane, says the expert.
BESIP road safety specialist Jaroslav Ho<0xC5><0x99>ín sees no fundamental problem in the movement of stewards on board a bus.
"With a fluid driving style, there are not many dangers, the situation is comparable to the service on board an aircraft.
Again, it’s not sure when turbulence will come, and the flight attendant may be headstrong.”
"But if a bus brakes sharply, then the laws of physics also apply.
Just like on a city bus or on a tram.
The safety of the stewards must be clarified by the carrier through internal regulations," he says, and also believes that this problem is not completely solved from the point of view of the law.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura is ready to cancel the services
Student Agency is the only bus company that offers services from stewards.
The company employs about two hundred people in this role.
The director does not consider her profession to be risky even after the accident.
"But as soon as I get the impression that the steward's profession is risky, I'll delete it.
Travelers can get coffee and newspapers on board.
This would also reduce costs," he said.
Interested in security, the director of Asiana Alexej Litvin explains the absence of stewards in his buses, but his company operates only a fraction of lines compared to Student Agency.
"We don't have stewardesses, but we've been fighting them from the beginning.
Sooner or later, this ends with some fatal accident," he said for T<0xC3><0xBD>den.cz not quite a year ago.
It was an incredible tragedy.
In the accident of a bus to Naples, a young flight attendant from the Pilsen region, who had worked for the company for two years, was injured.
The Slovenian truck had probably turned away from the stand strip without flashing and had blocked the bus from travelling.
The driver of the bus tried to avoid by a sharp maneuver, but collided with the right front part of the truck.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura denies that the two seats were sold for the stewards.
"These places cannot be reserved for long-distance connections, they are blocked."
The company wants to sue truck drivers.
With compensation for the young woman’s family, the agency will not wait for the court ruling, but will also expect financial compensation from the culprit.
A change in the law?
Not in sight
A more precise regulation of the movement of stewards on board a bus could bring about a statutory regulation, on which a thirty-member team of experts from the Ministry of Transport has been working for over a year.
"This, however, has not yet reached a concrete conclusion.
Buses are also not necessarily on the agenda, rather the point system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile phones when driving," says Ho<0xC5><0x99>ín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of the stewards to be something that could substantially jeopardize the safety of travellers," Hanzelka said, with the control of the safety of the buses being the competence of the police and the occupational safety authorities.
Düsseldorf's hopes rest on Frankfurt
There is no shortage of big words in the letter from the WestLB board of directors to the staff of the house.
By merging entities of the Düsseldorfer Geldinstitut with the Frankfurter Deka-Bank, “the central capital market house of the Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe” could be created, according to the letter, which became known on Monday.
The WestLB would bring a "competence block" with sustainable profitability into such a business.
And in general, such a link could be the decisive impetus for further bundling in the state banking sector.
This is how it reads when a board wants to demonstrate its ability to act in difficult times.
Because the struggling WestLB is still under enormous pressure.
Not only on the part of the EU Commission, but also by the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, which the North Rhine-Westphalian state government has only recently made clear that it is time to find a future solution.
However, a kind of connection between the Deka-Bank, which savings bank customers know because of their investment funds, and the WestLB has been being talked about for some time - also on the Frankfurt side.
While Deka-Bank-Chef Franz Waas made the half-year figures at the end of August, he did not see any sense in a merger of the house on the Mainzer Landstraße with a Landesbank, such as the Helaba or the WestLB.
However, the Board of Directors of the Deka, which is each half supported by the Landesbanken and the savings banking associations, has instructed the Management Board to hold discussions with WestLB about joint business activities.
This could be about the capital market business or parts of it.
The talks, it is said at the financial centre, have just begun.
The Deka-Bank, which is one of the most important employers in the financial centre of Frankfurt with its 3,000 employees, is not the first time when it comes to consolidation in the savings banking sector.
In 2003, it seemed for a moment that the Deka-Bank could merge with the Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and the Helaba.
However, nothing came out of this threesome.
As soon as the plans had become public, the Hessian state government opposed Helaba’s involvement in them.
The other two houses did not find each other.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz went instead to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
But there have always been games of thought about a connection of the Deka-Bank with Landesbanken.
Most recently, however, Günther Merl, CEO of Helaba, had spoken out against planning games about a joint venture with his house.
Regardless of this, however, the realization seems to be ripening that the various houses of the public sector need to be brought together.
Now that the state elections in Bavaria are over, the first step could be a connection between the BayernLB and the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg.
This is not necessarily good news for the Helaba.
If the pressure for further mergers increases, the partners will gradually run out of it.
In the south, she would only be a junior partner, although she has endured the financial crisis far better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
In turn, the Sparkassen- und Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen, which has an 85 percent stake in Helaba, put a stop to the merger with the West LB at the beginning of the year.
It was the Nord LB.
However, such geostrategic considerations are only one side.
On the other hand, the question is how the different business models of the individual houses fit together.
In June, Merl stated that the decisive question of which business model should ensure the future viability of the Landesbanken had not yet been answered by the German Savings and Giroverband.
In the end, there could also be a dismantling of the West LB, which, of course, is not desired there.
Thus, the letter of the board of directors there is also mentioned that a "complete solution" for the house is in any case aimed.
How this can be reconciled with the merging of individual units with the Deka-Bank will be shown.
The second Wiesenweekend is known as the "Italian Weekend"
For Elena, this is the first time, for Luca, the third or fourth time.
But this time, Elena is with him as his girlfriend, and so everything is different, he says.
Behind them, at the five-liter beer barrel of the Kaiser brand, stands a massively built beard tiger and proves to the about 200 Oktoberfest travellers what deep tones his throat can produce.
Elena gives Luca a slap first, then a kiss.
From Bologna they came to Verona.
From here, the bus parking next to the Puorta Nuova train station, four buses, "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", depart this evening at 11.45 pm, arrival expected at 6.30 am.
Three buses are reserved mainly for Italians, with one bus travelling exclusively for Brazilians.
In a corner of the parking lot, the South Americans are already singing next to their flag, they have already celebrated in the night.
And so loudly, Marco Guarda says, that's not for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with fur lining and glasses with wide silver temples, belongs to the buses.
They have been going to Oktoberfest for five years, three tours this year alone.
Back at night, during the day on the Wiesn, at 10.30 pm.
Staying overnight would only mean unnecessary expenses, Marco says.
The trip costs 75 euros, the welcome drink with Kaiser beer, brewed in accordance with the Bavarian purity law, health insurance and the German-language tour guide - Marco has attended a language course in Frankfurt - included.
And already the buses roll into the night, on the autostrada towards "Brennero".
There is no beer, not yet.
It quickly becomes quiet in the bus, the travelers sleep.
All right, they'll still need their powers.
It is maintained in Brixen and in Holzkirchen, where a number of other buses with Italian license plates on the highway 8 just before Munich take a break again.
When Marcos group finally arrives at the parking lot near the Theresienwiese at half past seven in the morning, the 50 other buses from all over Europe are already there.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco makes a final speech, explains the plan of attack.
First, put on the yellow cap.
On the left is "Oktoberfest", in fracture, next to the internet address of Marcos travel agency: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Secondly, "When the doors open to the beer tent, it's called running!", Marco calls in the morning.
"Running!" Running and occupying the seats at the back of the tent.
"Not in front, otherwise we block, and not all yellow hats on the same benches, spread in the room!"
The measure, shouts Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget tips.
"The security guards are showing us that we are behaving well!
As soon as you leave the seats, they are gone!"
Thirdly, "Tonight I'll get back here at 11:30 p.m.!"
And now we're going to the meadows.
Along the way, a yellow cap ties as waymarks to the trees, to signs and even to the election poster of a large Bavarian People’s Party.
They want to be prepared for withdrawal.
It is the second Wiesn weekend, known as the "Italy Weekend".
There are no exact figures; we are talking about 50,000 who make their way across the Alps and invade the beer tents, 10% of all visitors are supposed to have come from Italy this weekend.
The Munich police is reinforced by seven police officers from South Tyrol, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which maintains a nation statistics in which the Italians take first place in front of the British (about 60 missions) and the Austrians (about 80) with about 200 medical supplies.
Particularly popular among Italians is the Hofbräutent.
Sleepless Nights for Hypo Real Estate Creditors
The German banking system is relatively stable, stressed Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück only last week.
It is good that the politician used the word "relative" and also implied that the German banking sector would not be spared from the crisis-stricken developments.
Because it happened this weekend.
The Munich-listed real estate financer Hypo Real Estate (HRE) is receiving a billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to shield itself from the turmoil in the markets.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that the loan aid amounted to up to 35 billion euros.
Hypo Real Estate only has to pay interest on the part it takes.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
Background are losses at the daughter of Depfa.
According to a newspaper report, the state financer had refinanced himself for long-term projects for which he lent money at an extremely short notice - which is no longer possible because of the mistrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s cash reserve shrunk by 95 percent to EUR 2.37 million, and the equity ratio also slightly declined from 1.6 percent to 1.45%.
Current earnings and net income from financial transactions fell to zero compared to the same period of the previous year, while earnings from exposures and certain securities, as well as from the dissolution of provisions in the credit business, fell by more than 70 percent to EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to higher income from reimbursements of downstream settlement costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa Group as well as from the reimbursement of interest under the Tax Code and from the business provision for group companies, the earnings downside at around 16 percent had been moderate.
After his privatization in 1990, the former state financer had initially speculated on commercial real estate loans, which had then been segregated into Aareal Bank.
Because there was too little income in classical state financing, the Depfa had then become increasingly involved in infrastructure projects and the financing of joint projects of private investors and the state (Private Public Partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally.
On the value of the subsidiary, the Hypo Real Estate now has to make depreciation, which will have a "substantial material effect" on the profit and loss account of the group, it is quite indeterminate.
The fact is that the dividend has been cancelled.
As early as 2007, it had been cut by two-thirds.
Since the acquisition of Depfa, Hypo Real Estate has been a major state and infrastructure funder.
It is more dependent than other institutions on refinancing on the interbank market as it has no client deposits.
With the collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, lending among the banks has again largely dried up as the banks hoard their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term refinancing funds for a part of the Depfa’s loan portfolio – around 50 billion euros – each year.
According to the Hypo Real Estate, the group’s financing needs are covered with the loan for the foreseeable future and the company is “shielded from the influence of the currently largely inoperable international money markets.”
It can be heard from other sources that, thanks to the funds, refinancing is secured by the end of 2009.
On the other hand, HRE CEO Georg Funke said that the Hypo Real Estate Group will no longer have to use the money markets in the foreseeable future.
The Bundesbank and the Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht (BaFin) assume that the marketability of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now secured.
This stands for shareholders and creditors of the bank to hope.
But given the dynamics and uncertainties of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even unthinkable that funding does not have to be used to its full extent.
But the opposite is also not to be disregarded.
After the bank was still in bankruptcy late Sunday evening, the at least preliminary rescue is not able to calm the minds.
The share price fell by 75 percent to EUR 3.30.
The bond prices, on the other hand, are holding quite well.
While the priority debt is barely moving, the prices of the subordinated bonds show a more pronounced decline.
The bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and, understandably, the maturities beyond 2009 are affected in particular.
If hypo-real-estate bonds were formerly a speculative investment alternative, their value must be regarded as dependent on the stability of the international financial system after the sharp exacerbation of the banking crisis and the institution itself, which had only brought the crisis into the house with the takeover of the depfa.
As long as central banks, governments and less vulnerable commercial banks are ready to support the system, pensions can be repaid on time.
Or it happens what hardly anyone dares to hope at the moment - that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, in view of the overlapping reports with partial nationalisation, the probability that is bordering on security has now become only a legitimate hope.
This is likely to prepare long-term creditors for some sleepless nights with the decision whether they should separate from their commitments.
At least short-term investors can use a final dash to make a loss report for future repayment tax payments on price gains of later years.
Sylvana and the Secrets of the Bento Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, is due to introduce herself at Tachibana High School on the first day of school, the girls start to giggle: The German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from manga - in the new exchange log she tells about Japan.
"The first day of school in Japan.
I was excited.
Even before I went to school, I had bamboo.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and drive for 40 minutes by train to Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way alone, fortunately I did not get lost.
The beginning of lessons at the Tachibana does not seem to be as strictly fixed as at our home in Lower Saxony.
The pupils arrive at 8 o'clock, until at 8 p.m. a brief meeting with the teacher begins, the 'home room'.
But before class began, it was my turn to introduce myself.
I’m not the type of person who likes to talk to people, especially to a class of 40 students.
Because I didn’t have a school uniform yet, I put on an old skirt of my host mother, plus blouse, blue knee stockings and black leather shoes.
So in this elevator I stood in front of the desk and tried to say everything right: 'Sayonara Where she Sylvana...' - my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and I have my birthday in a week.
At that moment, I was very happy that I had already started learning the language about two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class all whispered, sighed and wacked and I heard the word "Kawaii" all the time.
I knew that from my manga.
It belongs to the vital vocabulary of Japanese girls and means 'cute, sweet'.
Then I hurried quickly to my place.
The girl next to me grinned quite wide, she found it an honor that the exchange student should sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was quite quiet, but when the gong sounded, I was assaulted.
Everyone was talking and giggling and asking me holes in the stomach - but it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
During the break, everyone unpacked their Bentos.
My mother-in-law had made me such a lunch box - this is something different from the desolate German breakbread.
I had rice with herbs, small sausages, salad of cucumbers and algae, fruit and some kind of meat in the tofu coat.
I usually have no clue what I eat here in Japan.
Things look strange and taste completely new.
It’s clear that everything is really delicious.
Well, except for the salty pickled plums maybe, brrrr!
The Bentos are not just lunch at Japanese schools.
It sometimes happens that a girl gives a boy a self-prepared bento, which she then produces especially artistically - in the hope of getting to know the boy better at the break snack.
I read about it in my manga comics.
I wonder if I can watch this too.
‘Why Japan?’ my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always said:
"Because it fascinates me."
I have been reading manga for years.
And to get a better understanding of the comics and the culture in them, I also started learning a bit of Japanese at some point.
It was clear to me that I would have to travel here at some point.
Because I also have a passion for traditions, customs and customs.
And they are very important here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I haven’t felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I’ve ever seen.”
Rats also have feelings.
A rat or a locust flees in danger, does that mean that she also feels fear?
Neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
But how can we check if they feel the same way when they behave like us?
The Internet magazine "Edge" has been publishing contributions by famous scientists for several years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents a series of selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else being able to prove this so far, where we can’t even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, we can at least hope, since all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we turn to other species and tackle questions of feeling or, more generally, of consciousness, we enter rough terrain because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same thing as many other animals: it kills itself, flees or attacks.
Humans behave in a similar way, from which some scientists conclude a similar subjective experience.
But I don't believe that.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to that of animals.
On the one hand, the circuits almost always associated with human consciousness include the lateral prefrontal cortex (because of its involvement in short-term memory and in the execution / control functions).
This broad region is much more developed in humans than in the rest of the primates and seems to be completely absent in other creatures.
So at least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including knowing who we are and the ability to plan and decide, there is reason to believe that man is even different from the other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity may lie in the linguistic nature of man: since such a large part of his experience is connected with language, it is often said that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness does not depend on language, it would certainly influence it, so that animal consciousness, whatever it may be, is probably very different from most of our states of consciousness.
Therefore, it is difficult to determine what consciousness may look like in other animals.
If, as something internal and subjective, it can neither be measured nor, because of the special hardware, analyzed on the basis of our own experience, its research presents us with great problems.
Most of my comments relate to the content of conscious experience, but there is another aspect of consciousness that should be more scientifically accessible.
One could study the consciousness processes of animals without regard to their contents, and that is exactly what happens with studies on the short-term memory of primates, especially with the example of visualization.
But with this approach, followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, one relates more to the neural correlates of consciousness than to the causal mechanisms: both may or may not be identical.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of the prefrontal cortex for the emergence of visualization.
What happens to the sensations?
I attribute it to the fact that an emotional system like that of fear is activated in one of its own conscious brains.
So what we call “fear” is the mental state we are in when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) occupies memory.
From this point of view, sensations are closely linked to the regions of the cortex that characterize primates and especially humans.
In connection with the linguistic nature, fine gradations of feeling arise because we can differentiate and categorize states with the help of words and grammar in order to attribute them to others besides ourselves.
In contrast, Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that sensations from more primitive activities in the body-feeling regions of the cortex and brain stem are similar to Jaak Pankseep, who, however, focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it could well be involved in cross-generic sensations.
In purely theoretical terms, I cannot disagree with this, but I consider it unproven.
Pankseep argues that what appears to be fear in rats and humans is likely to feel the same way in both cases: but how can you check if rats and humans feel the same when they behave in a similar way?
A lobster flees in danger whether she too feels fear?
In my view, mere similarity of behavior cannot yet prove equality of experience.
Although the neural comparison helps further: rats and humans have similar brain strains, cockroaches, on the other hand, do not even have a brain.
But is the brain stem responsible for sensations?
And even if you could prove this to humans, how would you prove it to rats?
I believe that rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who knows?), have sensations.
But I don't know how to prove it.
And because their sensations are probably fundamentally different from ours (because human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore the emotional behavior rather than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, progress on the neural level is wavering here, as long as you measure the same in rats and humans.
As I do not investigate language and consciousness in rats, nor do I do sensations, I do not know if they exist.
You might think that's short-sighted, but I'd rather go ahead than run against a wall all the time.
I am a practical emotionalist.
UEFA President Platini: grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Wasjunik said the preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and Prime Minister.
"The government sees the decision of UEFA in Bordeaux as a sign of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to host the European Championship together with Poland," Wasjunik said.
“This is not an amnesty for our country.
Work has just begun and there is still a lot to do in both countries.”
In the schedule for the construction or renovation of the stadiums, roads, hotels and airports, the two hosts are lagging behind.
Perhaps even the number of EM stages will be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We have to work at maximum speed now," said Ukrainian President Grigorij Surkis.
UEFA will keep an eye on us all the time.”
An even more radical move was taken in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish association PZPN has been suspended after numerous scandals by the National Olympic Committee and replaced by the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission had met at the request of Sports Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
"There is a serious danger that the PZPN will not be able to act according to the rules," Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
"We have assured UEFA President Michel Platini in a letter that preparations for the Euro 2012 will not suffer."
Several first league players had been sentenced to forced descent for manipulation alone last season, after all, even the league start had to be postponed at short notice.
Infuriated Dennis Quaid strikes back
She wanted to promote a new film, spoke about privates in the interview - and now has trouble with the ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan outlated her ex-girlfriend Dennis Quaid as an adulterer.
He foams - and strikes back.
Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors now have an unpleasant quarrel with each other - in public.
In an interview with InStyle magazine last week, Meg Ryan said: “Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, and that has been very painful.”
She did not know the extent of the fraud until after the divorce.
The reason for the soul striptease was Ryan's press work for her new film "The Women" - being told the story of an adultery.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his outing as an unfaithful husband was clear: "Monstrous" it was, the 54-year-old told the New York Daily News, that "Meg chews back and resettles the history of our relationship again and again."
It is also "sorry" that the 16-year-old son Jack is again "publicly reminded of the pain and upheavals that mean a divorce for every child."
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid is married again and recently became the father of twins.
And so his admissions conclude with the slap on the side: "My life continues anyway.
I’m happy to have a wonderful family that is doing well.”
Prices for airline tickets and hotels fall
In the first half of 2008, flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, according to a recent study, flights were even up to 50 percent cheaper.
Flights and overnight stays in hotels have once again become cheaper - this is the result of a study by the travel and financial service provider American Express.
The company analyzed its accounting data for the first half of 2008 and, following a rise in prices in the first quarter, found a significant decline in the second quarter.
After prices on the hotel market have risen for years, overnight stays in many places have already reduced.
From January to March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed increased by an average of 6.9 percent compared to 2007.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
The most significant trend was in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
American Express believes that the reason for this is the weak dollar exchange rate, which has led to a “declining desire to travel among American tourists.”
Financial centres such as Frankfurt or London are also more affected by the fall in hotel prices than industrial sites such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices even hold the record in Europe with an increase of 26.3 percent.
In terms of airfares, the trend in the first quarter also showed upwards:
Due to the kerosene consumption, passengers in the economy class had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, fuel-intensive long-haul flights were even up to 29.2 percent more expensive.
From April to June, prices for Economy-Class air tickets fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but in Business and First-Class, price changes were far lower.
In Germany, prices fell even more strongly than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices rose by 11.9 percent and fell by 23.6 percent in the second quarter.
On German domestic flights, prices have even halved, according to the study.
On the one hand, the reason for the price drop is the slowing economic growth, the company explains.
Demand in many segments of the air travel market is crumbling.
On the other hand, the open skies agreement, which liberalises air traffic between the US and Europe, increases competition pressure.
A sign of the tense situation is the cancellation of unprofitable routes at airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that had filed for bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - in Europe alone, this was 24 airlines.
HSV beats Gladbach 1:0
With a goal and simple methods, the Hamburger SV becomes the table leader.
At the Borussia, Luhukay still fails to find a working elf.
By Kristoffer Klein Enlarge break landing for international player Marko Marin.
The Gladbacher only came into play late and failed with a lift to the bar.
His message was precisely formulated, it went over his lips convincingly.
He simply knew he was right.
"We need the second goal," said Hermann Rieger in the cabin aisle of the Hamburg Arena.
There was not much going on in the catacombs, the half-time break was over and most of them were back in their seats.
Rieger has been a physiotherapist at the HSV for nearly three decades, and he enjoys a higher reputation as a former actor.
And so his request was heard in the responsible place.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and raised his thumb.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg's head coach Martin Jol.
His command will have sounded similar: Come with gate two!
The implementation was not done.
"There was not everything nice to look at today," Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhardt would have liked it to be more relaxed.
The hamburgers owe the 1:0 (1:0) to Mladen Petric's header (11th) and the fact that very weak Gladbachers could not hurt the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," Martin Jol summed up.
The Hamburger SV will be 121 years old on this Monday.
On Saturday afternoon, the spectators celebrated themselves, the blue sky over the arena and the lightning table on the video wall, which designated their club as a class prime.
It will be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to do that," said Marcell Jansen.
He suspects that the tabular interim certificate stands more for the unpredictability of the league than for the dominance of his HSV.
The team with its late-committed accesses - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goalkeeper Petric and the Jansen recruited by FC Bayern - is slowly finding itself, but it is not yet able to shine.
“We need more flair and more dribbling,” Jol said.

However, the sum should not be paid out at one stroke, but gradually.
In return, the state should receive share option certificates from the financial companies, which could be redeemed with appropriate price development in order to reduce the burden on the state treasury.

Dark Matter Affects Flight of Space Probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has been causing perplexity in research: dark matter influences the speed of spacecraft during so-called swing-by maneuvers.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity may not be entirely correct.
For nearly 18 years, the spacecraft "Ulysses" flew through space.
Due to the fact that fuel lines are freezing soon, she is now threatened with cold death.
Among scientists, a mysterious phenomenon has caused confusion for years - the swing-by anomaly.
The swing-by is a flight maneuver of spacecraft in which they gain additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, such as Earth.
This allows the probes to save a lot of fuel.
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the solar probe Ulysses.
However, what has surprised the researchers for years is that the missiles do not behave 100 percent as one would expect according to the ancient law of gravity.
Rather, there are irregularities in the speed.
The probes become unexpectedly faster or slower.
So far, the physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
They called him Swing-by-Anomaly.
Some experts fear that even Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which describes the attraction of matter by a curvature of space, may not be entirely correct.
The American physicist Stephen Adler from the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton continues to believe that Einstein was not wrong, and is trying to explain the swing-by anomaly using the so-called dark matter that astronomers in the universe have identified.
"The cause of the anomaly could be dark matter, which could also be very close to Earth," he writes.
Space scientists have only known about the existence of dark matter for about ten years.
Obviously, it produces an attraction whose effect on other celestial bodies can be observed.
It itself, on the other hand, is completely invisible, that is, it does not emit and reflect any kind of electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to the calculations of the scientists, dark matter makes up a good fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Kidnapped tourists in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their hijackers, the tourists abducted in Egypt should be free again, the Italian foreign minister confirmed.
The kidnappers from Sudan had demanded several million euros in ransom money.
In a shooting before the release, six hostages were killed.
Five Germans have been kidnapped in southern Egypt.
The ransom negotiations are already underway.
Again and again Germans get in the sight of kidnappers.
WORLD ONLINE describes the most important cases.
European tourists displaced in the Sahara are apparently free.
This was reported by Egyptian state television, the Arab TV channel Al-Arabija and Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release according to reports from the Italian television channel Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been freed.
We are currently checking their health condition," Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian and their eight Egyptian companions are well and safe, Egyptian state television reported.
The 19 participants of a desert expedition are already on their way to Cairo.
According to an Egyptian security official, the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping before the Sudanese army surprisingly killed six of the kidnappers.
“The problem was solved.
They agreed to a ransom," the official said.
It was “just about taking the hostages,” when suddenly “this surprise” came.
Sudanese soldiers shot six of the kidnappers on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt and arrested two of them.
The hostage holders had demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money was to be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily "El Masri El Jom" reported, citing a German mediator, that the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers want to release the female hostages after paying the ransom.
The men were to be detained until the hijackers had a safe escape route.
The German embassy in Cairo declined to comment on the report.
Abuse of stepfather "leads to suicide"
The years of abuse by her stepfather has resulted in a woman killing herself, was reported to a court.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, received a six-year prison sentence after confessing to eight cases of sexual abuse.
The Truro Criminal Court learned that he regularly tied up his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession, "I feel responsible for her death."
The court learned that Ms. Randle committed suicide at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she was a child living in Coventry, Trerise had tied her up and closed her eyes before performing sexual acts while her mother was away to work at a restaurant.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s and he moved back to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, the court learned that Ms. Randle, who spent much of her time volunteering for the National Trust, was persecuted for abuse she had been inflicted twice a week.
Prosecutor Ramsay Quaife told the court that friends had said Ms. Randle, who had been a zealous surfer and cyclist, had been "emotionally dead" since 2006 and had "given her life"
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
She is believed to have killed herself by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a letter of confession ending in this way: "I used to tie her up and bind her eyes."
“I didn’t sexually force them.
I feel responsible for her death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: “You are an extremely strange fetishist and for her victim it must have been frightening, especially since she was only seven.
This unpleasant story ends with the victim's suicide.
Worse yet is the fact that it is very unlikely that the matter would have ended in court if she had not done so."
He added: “I note the impact, according to Stephanie’s description of her father and mother, their act has had on her daughter over the years.
Otherwise, she would have been clearly a promising, successful and happy young woman."
Officials responsible for lost data are charged
The BBC has learned that the Cabinet official, who lost strictly confidential documents in a single train in June, will be charged under the "Public Security Act".
The man was posted to the Department of Defense when he lost two highly confidential documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It is the weakest indictment within the law and there is no indication of criminal intent.
BBC defense correspondent Frank Gardner said the action was a surprise for many in Whitehall.
He said, "They would have thought that this would be dealt with internally at the Department of Defense and Cabinet."
The employee, whose name cannot be named, will be charged in accordance with paragraph 8.1 of the law, the clause dealing with the secure retention of information.
The Royal Prosecutor’s Office recommended that the officer be charged by the Metropolitan Police for the highly sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he published included classified assessments of al-Qaeda and the capabilities of Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was taken from his home to a secret place.
Housing companies look at B&B costs
British housing companies could face costs of more than <0xC2><0xA3>80 million in the house after the rescue of Bradford and Bingley Bank.
The government provided <0xC2><0xA3>14 billion to protect Bradford & Bingley’s 2.6 million customers’ deposits.
The interest on this loan is paid by all companies that receive money from investors, including the 59 construction companies.
The director general of the Association of Housing Companies (BSA), Adrian Coles, said it was "unacceptable" that the companies and their members would have to pay.
The 14 billion loan will ultimately be repaid once Bradford & Bingley’s loans are repaid.
But the interest accumulated in the meantime is credited each year to the 700 financial firms that accept deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Program confirmed to the BBC that the 59 housing companies were included in this number.
It is bitter that those institutions that have behaved prudently ... are now called upon to take over some of the costs of those institutions that were far less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It said that each company would have to pay in proportion to the deposits it would hold, and that the companies together would have to pay about 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that the interest on the loan will amount to 450 million pounds in 2009.
This means that companies will have to raise <0xC2><0xA3>81 million for the first year’s interest.
Adrian Coles, the director general of the Housing Companies Association, told the BBC that he believes this is unfair.
It is bitter that those institutions that have behaved prudently during the real estate upturn are now called upon to bear some of the costs of those institutions that were far less prudent.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since the existence of the records in 1945.
"We will be watching all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to see what alternatives there are to protect housing societies and their members from potentially significant costs."
Interest rates due in 2009 cover the seven months from the end of September this year until the end of March.
In 2010, interest is due for a full year and that could be almost twice as much.
Since construction companies are mutual entities without shareholders, their members will have to pay for the costs either through higher fees or lower interest on savings accounts.
Milk will cost 5 pence per litre
The people of Jersey are faced with having to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that it will raise the wholesale price of its milk by another five pence per litre from Monday.
It is the second price rise this year, after a two pence increase in February, and comes after investigations have been conducted by a consulting firm.
Retailers should decide for themselves whether they want to pass on the price increase to their customers.
Before the price increase in February, the wholesale price of Jersey milk last changed in 2002.
Bangladesh's former prime minister is denied bail
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a bail application from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, which means she could be arrested if she returns to the country.
Her defendants said the court refused bail regarding the charge of extorting 50 million taka ($729,700) from a businessman while she was prime minister.
The case is one of several pending accusations of corruption against her.
Sheikh Hasina’s longtime political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is due to return to Bangladesh in the coming weeks, but her party, the Awami Alliance, demanded that the military-backed transitional government first grant her full freedom.
The correspondents say that although her detention has been granted to go abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear as part of her release if she will be able to remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers say she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Supreme Court.
"The upper court has rejected Sheikh Hasina's bail request because it says she does not need to be granted a bail because she is already on detention abroad to be treated abroad," her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq said.
We will file a legal complaint against the Supreme Court."
Her lawyers argue that she needs bail to return to the country from abroad in order to prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after October 17, said an Awami Alliance party chairman on Sunday.
She was detained last year after the Army-backed transitional government took power, but had been released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against themselves.
Fears about the anti-polio initiative in Afghanistan
In the recent anti-polio initiative in Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children have not been vaccinated due to the violence associated with the Taliban, according to the United Nations.
The United Nations implemented a vaccination program in six provinces last week.
However, they were unable to reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
According to a UN spokesman, this was the case despite the Taliban’s promise not to attack or hinder the thousands of staff carrying out the vaccinations.
BskyB loses lawsuit in ITV case
BskyB has lost its action against the Competition Commission’s decision to reduce its stake in the competing channel ITV.
The Court of Appeal has ordered BskyB to reduce its stake in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
Previously, the Commission had claimed that the share of BskyB distorts competition and enables it to have an unfair influence on ITV.
BskyB acquired its stake in 2006 by successfully preventing NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from acquiring ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that the purchase of the share in ITV by BskyB raised doubts about the independence of ITV, which prompted the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
Virgin Boss Sir Richard Branson, Consumer Groups and Communications Office Ofcom have voted against the purchase.
BskyB argued that the pressure to reduce its stake in ITV was an unreasonable and exaggerated measure, especially because BskyB had announced that it would give up its voting rights.
New investigation into the US prosecutor's case
The U.S. Attorney General has commissioned a special investigator to deal with the dismissal of the nine U.S. prosecutors in 2006.
The occasion was a report by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Justice criticizing the actions of the administration staff.
The report criticized White House officials, lawmakers and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was driven by fears that the lawyers had been dismissed for political reasons.
Special Investigator Nora Dannehy is now to clarify whether the officials interrogated during the investigation lied to the investigators in order to obstruct the judiciary.
Serious allegations, including criminal actions, have not been fully investigated or clarified, Inspector General Glenn Fine said in his report.
The appointment of a special investigator with the authority to force the witnesses to testify was one of his main recommendations.
The conflict began when the Department of Justice removed nine U.S. prosecutors from their offices in December 2006.
At that time, the ministry argued that the prosecutors were being fired due to poor employment.
However, it was later found that the dismissed prosecutors had not been judged worse than many of their colleagues, which led many observers to view the dismissals as politically motivated.
Some of these prosecutors were involved in the court prosecution of high-ranking Republican congressmen, while others had refused to investigate the allegations of election fraud by Democrats.
U.S. prosecutors are tasked with investigating and prosecuting court cases for the government.
They may be dismissed at any time, but may not be dismissed for political reasons.
Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, then head of the Department of Justice, was under fire for the redundancies and ultimately resigned.
A number of Justice Department officials have also resigned.
The inspector-general’s report has particularly critically addressed the role of Gonzales, bearing the “main responsibility” for the dismissals, “abandoning” his leadership role, and showing himself “extraordinarily disinterested” in the process.
Other officials, including former chief adviser to President Bush Karl Rove, were criticized for the lack of cooperation with the investigators.
Meat Loaf's epic song to be honored
The rock star Meat Loaf will be honored during the music award ceremony "Q Award" for his epic hymn "Bat Out Of Hell".
The singer, who will receive his special golden prize in London next week during the ceremony, said he was honored to be recognized.
The song, which lasted nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track to Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
"Coldplay" leads the nominations for this year's awards after being shortlisted in four categories.
Editor-in-chief of Q Magazine, Paul Rees, said there are some songs that go beyond such subjects as time and genre, and "Bat Out Of Hell" is certainly one of them.
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a powerful voice delivered by Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental part that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was released as a single in the UK in 1979 and reached number 15 on the charts.
However, Meat Loaf's "Bat Out Of Hell" has spent about nine years in the charts and sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf, whose real name is Marvin Lee Aday, has suffered from serious health problems in recent years, including surgery in 2003 for irregular heartbeat after he collapsed on stage.
In 2007, he had to cancel concerts due to an acute laryngitis.
Later it became known that he had a cyst on his vocal cord.
Obscure street in town, often forgotten and possibly for sale soon
New York City has thousands of main roads, avenues, side streets and other bypass roads, some of which are famous and others are only convenient.
Still, even for experienced taxi drivers and longtime locals, it’s hard to tell where Extra Place is located, simply because most have never heard of it.
This tiny street is located in the East Village and runs north from First Street between Bowery and Second Avenue without reaching Second Street.
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks more like a dusty alley than an actively used passageway.
There are also no road signs.
It is virtually impossible to find them on a standard road map.
This street still has its admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company that has recently built luxurious buildings on First Street.
It intends to re-patch Extra Place to create a clean passageway to the stores and boutiques expected in the new buildings.
Other admirers include the long-standing neighborhood, which says it is fascinated by the short alley, simply because it is one of the remnants of the block’s past.
But the city administration department, which is responsible for the protection and construction of the residential buildings and is responsible for the road, has no interest in obtaining them.
During a meeting of the Land Use Committee of the Municipal Council this month, representatives of the City Council and Avalon Bay drafted a proposal for the purchase of the road by the construction company.
Nevertheless, the committee prefers the street to remain in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new plan to be presented next month, said Susan Stetzer, the district official in the City Council 3.
“Very little space has remained in the city’s possession and we want Extra Place to continue to belong to the city,” she said.
"There could be offers on how to repair and operate the road, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want public access to remain guaranteed."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that it would be re-paving the small street and setting up seats, among other things, for a café that the company would like to rent space to.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the road was made public for the first time during the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said the company wanted to use the street, but it didn’t necessarily want to own it.
“The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renovate this decayed alley and make it a public meeting place,” she said, adding that the city itself had proposed the sale.
Seth Donlin, spokesman for the Department of Building Protection, said it was actually the city’s desire to sell the street, and stressed that the department’s task was to develop the properties rather than manage them.
Compared to its colorful neighbourhood The Bowery, Extra Place has retained some of its historical impression.
Some believe that the street got its name in 1802, when a large farm owned by Philip Minthorne was divided between its numerous children and a narrow strip of land was not claimed by anyone.
The back door of the CBGB music club, the punk rock monument, which closed in 2006, opened to the Extra Place and the street is certainly best known as the backdrop for the photo on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
The patch was great, said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones who took the photo in November 1976.
The road was full of scrap, rags and parts of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes.
Some residents, including the bloggers who write about the gentrification of the East Village, have rejected the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that this public property, as modest as it is, should continue to remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rarity – a virtually unchanged fragment of the city that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs the blog called "Jeremiah's Disappearing New York" (subtitled "The Book of Lamentations: A Bitter Nostalgic Look at the Extinct City"), has published part of the city's story talk about Extra Place, which appeared in The New Yorker magazine in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote at the time: “Extra Place is a small narrow cul-de-sac that remains dark even during the day and is characterized by rusted metal doors of warehouses, closed windows and weekly newspapers flying past rain gutters.”
With a few exceptions, the street looked just like this recently on one evening.
A rat ran through the back of the road, not far from the door that used to lead to the CBGB, where today there is a more expensive clothing store.
Graffiti were on the walls and an empty beer bottle lay on the floor not far from a fresh bundle of discarded newspapers.
Some passers-by said they rarely thought about Extra Place, but suggested that the road could be slightly polished.
Fields, added that in his opinion, some people underestimate the appeal of the road in its current state.
The best years of my life, he said, were in the places that were dark, wet and disgusting.
Debate on bilingual education: Education in an English-speaking environment
In this issue of "Education Watch", Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of candidates for bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, senior research associate in Caliphonic Studies and senior director in the Department of Educational Science at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book "Not as good as you think: Why the middle class needs a school selection".
Addressing Hispanic voters is a complicated task.
Barack Obama’s proposals on education are a typical example of this.
Obama’s election campaign mentions that “the likelihood that African-American and Hispanic students will successfully complete school is lower than that of white students” — which is true.
To close this gap, Obama’s education plan specifically recommends, among others, a bilingual transitional period in education for those who are learning English first.
Nevertheless, the question to Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which focuses on teaching languages other than English, contradicts his interest in reducing the gap in school performance.
Take as an example "Sixth Street Prep", a primary school in eastern Los Angeles.
The majority of students are Hispanic and come from low-income families.
More than one-third of students, many of whom are recently in the country, are learning English.
Nevertheless, in 2008, amazing 100 percent of fourth grade students passed the state exam in math at a good level.
Also surprisingly, 93 percent of children from the fourth year of school were rated as good in the English exam.
This astonishing success was achieved with different methods than those preferred by Obama.
The Sixth Street School places its emphasis on review and practice, on constant control of knowledge and an attitude that tolerates no exceptions.
In addition, the school practices the approach of training in an English-speaking environment, which is exactly what Obama should take into account, according to school principal Linda Mikels.
This approach places emphasis on the almost exclusive use of the English language in specialist teaching.
Ms. Mikels, who rejects the idea of bilingual education, told me that the school had a remarkable success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico. 12 months later you would enter the classroom and be unable to recognize him.
"It works," she remarked, "it works for us."
Would Obama take a school like the "Sixth Street Prep" as a model for other schools with a large proportion of Latin American and other English-learning students?
The school’s achievements would make the answer to this question easy, but the educational policy positions within its own party (the national picture associations have long supported the idea of bilingual education) and its own consistent support of bilingual education make predictions about Obama’s response uncertain.
While he agrees with the point that immigrants should learn English, he has recently trivialized the issue by noting that people should stop worrying about the legislation aimed at "only English."
Instead, he said, “You should make sure your child speaks Spanish.”
If Obama actually wants to close the performance gap, he should carefully consider educational models that work rather than despise and trivialize them.
Oil price drops as a result of renewed fears about the economy
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday due to fears that even the U.S. bailout plan for the financial markets might not be enough to revive the economy.
Crude oil futures on the New York Stock Exchange fell 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel in the morning session.
Since last Monday, the price has fallen by more than $20.
Over the past two weeks, goods markets have been shaken by both the financial turmoil on Wall Street and strong hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After peaking at $145.29 per barrel in July, prices have fallen to nearly $90 per barrel this month and then rise again as a result of the enormous uncertainty in the financial markets.
On Monday, investors showed concern again, despite congressional officials announcing they had agreed on a rescue plan over the weekend, which was supposed to be the largest in history.
This news was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis is far from over.
In the final chapter of the growing crisis, according to a government statement on Monday, the Citigroup is to buy over the banking operations of Wachovia Corporation.
Meanwhile, Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial group Fortis.
According to analysts at Barclays Capital, despite the tense negotiations that took place over the weekend and led to a bailout plan, it appears to have failed to revive the mood in the markets.
As the economic situation continues to deteriorate, demand for goods, including oil, is expected to continue to decline.
Analysts at Deutsche Bank wrote in a statement to investors that forecasts for global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates had become extremely uncertain.
We believe they continue to write that goods markets will also be affected.
“From the perspective of goods markets, we are most concerned about whether the U.S. virus is spreading globally, especially to China.”
The bank’s analysts have adjusted their expectations for oil consumption downwards due to weak economic growth for the coming year, and lowered their forecasts for oil and gas prices for 2009 by 20%.
Team record set by series in the second quarter
Defender Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything after appearing in the Jets jersey more than anyone else in the last eight and a half years.
Then on Sunday, he saw the second quarter, in which the Jets turned an unsuccessful game into a triumphal move.
"I've never seen anything like this before," Ellis said.
After a sloppy game between the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals that matched the bad weather, the second quarter started.
However, when quarterback Brett Favre’s pass arrived at Lavernues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, it marked the perfect prelude to an afternoon where their evolving collaboration took a huge step forward.
Favre found Coles in this quarter for two more touchdowns, one sliding out as an outside defender and the other 10 seconds before the end of the half-time.
"I didn't put much effort into it," Coles says about the passes that went to Coles.
“He is a super player.
“Our vote voted no matter what people think.”
While Favre and Coles played Catch, the defense dismantled quarterback Kurt Warner.
Defender Darrelle Revis caught an accidental throw and turned it into a 32-yard touchdown.
Libero Erik Smith came to another passport and caught it.
Linebacker David Bowens then caused a loss to Warner.
The last ball loss, forced at Bowens, was probably the craziest.
The Cardinal had captured the ball with 10 seconds left in the game when the Jets recaptured the ball and Jay Feely turned a 20 yard shot to 34 to 0 lead.
These were the most points the Jets had ever scored in a quarter.
When asked to describe the madness, Erik Mangini, the coach of the jets, replied "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
In response to both, because the Jets allowed 21 points in the third quarter without scoring one, Mangini said: "Believe me, I enjoyed the second quarter more than the third.
A lot of points were scored in a short period of time."
Rested Gebrselassie beats his world record
Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia has once again shown why some consider him to be the best long-distance runner of all time after breaking his own record in the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and becoming the first person to complete the 42.2 kilometres in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the win on the flat course in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie improved his previous result of 2:04:26 by 27 seconds, which he had achieved in Berlin last year.
Gebrselassie, 35, has set his 26th world record in his versatile career, in which he has achieved at least one World Championship title or set a world record on every track from one kilometre to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie skipped the Beijing Olympic marathon, fearing that air pollution might make his asthma problems worse.
Instead, he signed up for the competition in Berlin.
In almost ideal conditions - in the sun and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees at the finish - Gebrselassie has won with an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since runners such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya switched long distances, the record time for Marathon in the last 10 years has fallen by more than 2 minutes since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won in Berlin in 1998 with the result 2:06:05.
After his victory on Sunday, Gebrselassie told the press that he had cramped his calf two weeks ago and therefore could not train for a week.
Obviously, he was refreshed after a break and did not come back rusted.
"I'm so happy," he told reporters.
“Everything went perfectly.
I started training again a week ago and had some concerns today, but in the end it was all great."
He has been criticized – especially in Kenya, Ethiopia’s rival from East Africa – for over-orchestrating his races, avoiding many of the world’s best marathon stars in general, relying too much on the race leaders as if it were a track race, and setting world records over the competition.
But this criticism hardly harms Gebrselassie’s size as a long-distance runner.
Accompanied by four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie had reached the centre of the track in 1:02:04.
Two elite runners from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, have continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the pacemakers slowed down.
Just over three miles before the finish, Gebrselassie made his last appearance to separate from Kvambai, who arrived second in 2:05:36, thereby improving his best time by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi finished third in 2:07:48.
For women, Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now German, has completed a remarkable year by showing the seventh fastest result of all time with 2:19:19.
The world record of 2:15:25 holds Paul Radcliff from Great Britain.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko had surprisingly won the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She missed the games in Beijing due to problems described as back injury, but recovered to win in Berlin and improve her best time in her third marathon by five minutes.
She has cleverly planned her run by having a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners ripped out first, but overtaken after 30 kilometers.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia finished second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop from Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
The pride and the hardships in the lives of the black people, in a city of a very special kind
Hidden among the exuberances of the theme parks around Orlando, a few miles from the glittering, noisy and gigantic hustle and bustle, lies a quiet city where the pride and complications of African-American culture come to light.
Eatonville, the first entirely black town in the country and the hometown of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as easy to describe as Hurston did in 1935: "the city with 5 lakes, three croquettes courts, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, more than enough guavas, 2 schools and no prison."
Nowadays it is a pilgrimage site.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to commemorate the most famous author of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet, the city that describes it – and which made it a tourist destination by including it in the Florida Travel Guide produced by the Federal Writers Project during the Depression – is and remains, in many ways, a place of the very special kind.
Eatonville is as independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with the white man who "knows so little about us that he doesn't know what escapes him."
Even nowadays, in a year when a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, is calling for an open conversation about racial relations, many here are still tired of being watched by outsiders.
"We are very much concerned about how our history is told," said Hortense Jones, 59, from birth to a resident of the city and a parishioner of the city's oldest church.
It must be right."
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is both a historical example of the black movement and a community of nearly 2,400 inhabitants where the poverty rate is twice as high as the national average.
It is, on the one hand, a stronghold of literature and, on the other hand, an example of the – sometimes condemned, sometimes praised – black culture of the rural South, which has its roots in American slavery.
It is not surprising that residents here are both proud and on guard.
And really, the concerns about Eatonville's image actually started with Zora, as everyone here calls Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world in books that came from the heart and were written in dialect, such as "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1973).
Five paragraphs in the Florida guide changed the city, which is very close to Route 77, a road that passes through Florida’s often-forgotten center, to the scenes of black history and human drama.
Naughty like Oskar both in real life and in literature, Hurston led readers to the store of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then turned to more private affairs.
"Away from the road to the left," she wrote, "is the brown-white-painted modern school, with its manicured gardens and playgrounds that Howard Miller always cares about, even though he can barely read and write."
She also mentioned the new husband of widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of any kind and whatever-always fits hour rooms."
In just a few hundred words, Hurston associated Eatonville with self-government, but also with illiteracy, second marriage, and sex.
This was certainly not a travel guide.
In fact, this was not a portrait that was appreciated by everyone.
“Zora described things as they were,” said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson girls who immortalized the Hurston, citing the men singing songs about her beauty that were full of sexual allusions.
She added, “Some people didn’t like this.”
One still remembers Hurtson as a lively eccentric who regularly returned after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, remembered that when Hurston came to the city brewed, she usually did so without warning, in a noisy Chevrolet, smoking and dressed in trousers, in a city that even today impersonates something of her venerable dress style.
According to Mr. Franklin, most residents were fascinated, whereas many despised them.
“People were always happy to see Zora,” Franklin said.
But "she never stayed too long," he added while swinging in his chair, on a rear-facing terrace overlooking Sabelia Lake, where Hurston was probably baptized.
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books out of stock.
Along with most of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten them.
Although she was once a famous author, a contemporary Langstin Hughes, and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an anonymous tomb in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived.
In Eatonville there was no great commemoration, no public readings on a large scale.
"I don't think they understood their contribution to the world or their legacy at all," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a biography about Hurston published in 2003.
The change came in the 80s.
Orange County authorities wanted to lay a five-lane highway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the town's slow two-lane main road.
Orlando’s suburbs had already pushed Highway 4 through the western outskirts of the city.
The proposal was made when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the fight against racial mixing brought hatred into the community.
"At that time, a bunch of white boys often came and they threw oranges and stuff on the off-seat people," Franklin said.
“There was once a woman who was killed.
They threw a watermelon out of the car."
In 1955, Hurston, in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel, questioned the Supreme Court's demand to enforce integration, calling its decision in Brown's case against the school council "offensive rather than respectful of my race."
Residents nowadays say that although the abolition of segregation was positive in some respects, it weakened the group cohesion in Eatonville and the self-confidence of its youth.
"Black children were used to being hugged - I remember - you hugged your teacher in the morning and you hugged your teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and managing director of the nonprofit group to protect the Eatonville community.
This could be maintained for so long, she added, until teachers and students were no longer from the same place.
"You didn't hug your white teacher because he was a white teacher - I mean there's a cultural divide," Nathiri said.
However, civil rights have helped make room for more Zora Neale Hurston’s – black writers, actors and artists who overcame prejudice, as she did, with positive self-confidence and statements like, “How can anyone deny the joy of my society!
I don't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker set out to Hurston's nameless tomb and began to fight for the revival of her fame.
Five years later, a highly acclaimed Hurston biography of Robert E. Hemenway was found on the bookshelves, and once again made it part of the American literary canon.
The highway project came at a time when Eatonville’s most famous daughter was once again in the public eye.
And this time Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
The community began planning a Hurston Festival in 1988 to show what the district could destroy with the construction of the highway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and every January many return for the celebration.
A few years later, the district turned away from its road plans.
"The plans for a five-lane highway animated the city, accelerated it at top speed, aroused real citizen pride," Nathiri said.
Ms. Boyd put it a little simpler: "Zora saved Eatonville."
Victory against the highway project has contributed to a change in the city’s self-image.
There were more and more visitors, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been going to church here since 1993, and locals began to re-appreciate the past.
Eatonville was added to the National Historic Register in 1998.
A new one-storey library (named after Hurston of course) opened in 2006 on the newly paved and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Nowadays, Eatonville is still a feature in Florida: just 6 miles from downtown Orlando, it can sometimes feel like a back alley in the summer rain, as small as when it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(It is 90% black nowadays.)
Outsiders in search of the history of Eatonville and its significance are often still treated with caution.
For most interviews, permission is required in advance and certain things - such as the wall painting of Eatonville's oldest church, painted by a white man and depicting black men in field work - are not allowed to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Ms. Jones, a brave, confident teacher with a penchant for dark red, still fear that her shielded community will be misunderstood.
And yet, at the same time that the Hurston Festival grew larger, an increased degree of homeland pride was also born.
Especially young people tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw their entire race: beautiful, with all his problems, neither worse nor better and as proud, creative and diligent, silly and mixed up as any other racial and ethnic group in America.
It is the sincere love for this city that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the city council or with the police, who he says might need some help.
And even the younger ones, such as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old twins from Winter Park, have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people who just drive through here will think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others,'" Alondra Kenon said on a Sunday after church.
"But if you actually stop and look at its history for a moment, it's a very beautiful city."
Here in New York, people speak financial latin fluently.
At first glance, nothing changed.
If tourists in Manhattan were to stay away from the newspaper stalls and the huge television screens in Times Square, they wouldn’t even realize that they are in the middle of a debacle.
They would never believe that above their heads, in the shoe-box-like offices with the glass facades, bankers and hedge fund managers who have the monopoly in New York, have the worst horror workday ever since the stock market crash of 1929.
The suppliers still push the metal tea trucks along sidewalks with loud rattles and carry trays loaded with muffins for breakfast sessions.
Latinos are still wandering between apartments, like human pack animals loaded with around 50 ironed T-shirts hanging from a yoke-like pole lying on their shoulders.
Office workers are still waiting on the sidewalks for their breakfast bagels and it is still impossible to get a yellow taxi on a weekday between 4 pm and 7 pm.
It didn’t feel like a crisis at all until I decided to open a new savings account on Thursday afternoon due to all the talk of the end of the world.
Although I had decided to put my compulsory course on the quiet late afternoon at my JP Morgan Chase branch, about 20 people were already in line.
Not at the cash desks to withdraw or deposit money, but at the customer service counter where regular customers order checkbooks, ask tourists about the way to the Macy's department store and where new customers open accounts.
Most of them, I learned later from Starr, my "personal bank employee licensed", stood in line for the same reason as I did.
Unlike me, however, they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks, in places from which they commuted, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They had withdrawn money from so-called thrifts (a bit like a construction bank), cooperative banks and those local savings banks that only have branches in one state, saying that they treat their customers like family.
In the past year, 15 of these banks have quietly gone bankrupt.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a $327 billion investment bank, went bankrupt and when last Friday New Yorkers drove home over the weekend, Wachovia, another bank that owns $440 billion in savings, was looking for a savings buyer.
In fear of another collapse, the office and shop workers who were waiting in front of me brought their cash to a bank that is considered a safe haven, a bank responsible for most rescue purchases on Wall Street.
Normal New Yorkers have acquired a flowing financial latin in recent weeks.
A woman who was on the phone in my Chinese trunk supermarket was as familiar with Lehman Brothers, the bank that went bankrupt, and their slimming-looking CEO Dick Fuld, as if blaspheming about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the 50-year-old uniformed concierge of my apartment block, has gotten off our usual entertainment topics about Brad and Angelina and my grocery delivery.
"I now have all my savings in money market funds," she told me after my visit to the bank.
"I've changed, I'm not taking any risks anymore."
Muslim tombs desecrated during right-wing slip in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, a left-winger of the Austrian right-wing Freedom Party, and Filip Dewinter, a member of the Belgian right-wing Pertei Vlaams Belang, attend a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008 to represent the organization "Cities Against Islamization".
They carry signs in the style of traffic signs on which a mosque is depicted, crossed with a red line.
Police are accusing right-wing extremists of profaning a Muslim cemetery in Austria, where extreme right-wing parties made significant gains in the country’s parliamentary elections on the same weekend.
In the night from Friday to this morning, more than 90 graves in the cemetery in Traun near Linz were severely damaged in a, according to the police, organized action.
The perpetrators sprayed Jewish symbols such as the David Stern on some of the tombs, but criminals believe this is an attempt to disguise the motive of extremists driven by hatred for Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is in any way related to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shaken" by the news of the tomb defilement that took place as the religious month of Muslim Ramadan approaches its end.
At the same time, Austria is undergoing a round of conscientious examination after the country slipped to the right in yesterday’s parliamentary election.
The FP<0xC3><0x96> and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, the two far-right parties that received almost 30% of the vote, campaigned for a strict anti-immigrant law and some of their slogans were criticized by opponents as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, chairman of the FP<0xC3><0x96>, who won 18% of the vote, advocated a ban on headscarves and burkas and even expressed his aversion to food that is generally associated with Islam.
At his last rally in Vienna, he spoke of a "European Brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties want to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that these are political symbols of a continuous Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses conducted immediately after the election, stating that the extreme right is the politically strongest bloc in the country, suggest that this new development is based on young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter's Travel Restrictions
Gary Glitter, the glam rock star who has been convicted of child sexual abuse, has been forbidden from travelling to France and Spain.
Judges imposed a six-month suspension on Glitter after he informed the authorities controlling him that he wanted to travel to Spain via France.
Police in Kent were granted a travel ban last Thursday after they presented to judges evidence of Glitter’s criminal record for child sexual abuse.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford District Court in Kent, but was represented by the law firm Corker Binning.
A spokesperson for the Court said: "On Thursday, September 25th, Kent police at the Ashford District Court requested permission to prevent Mr. Paul Glad from travelling abroad to France and Spain by March 25th.
Paul Gadd was not present in person."
As required by the Register of Sex Offenders, Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad.
He must inform the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also notify the police 7 days before his planned departure.
Failure to notify the authorities could result in a prison sentence of 5 years.
Police in Kent said they would not discuss individual cases or glitter’s possible whereabouts in the country.
A spokeswoman for Kent’s police unit said: “The police in Kent will do everything necessary to protect children in this country and abroad.”
"In our view, it is easier to control someone who is in the UK because we have a comprehensive system to effectively prevent any potential risks."
"It is the top priority of the Kent police force to protect the residents of Kent and we are working closely together to monitor the behavior of registered sex offenders in the country to minimize any risk that might exist to the population.
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing 2 girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he was scheduled to take a flight to London.
But he said he was uncomfortable and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not let him through the passport control and he flew back and forth to Hong Kong after some time.
The Chinese authorities also denied him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and border officials insisted that he return to the UK.
Last but not least, he arrived at Terminal 3 in Heathrow on 22 August and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge District Court in West London, as Scotland Yard had successfully requested permission to demand that he register as a sex offender.
Glitter had previously been detained in the UK in 1999 for 4 months for possessing images of child abuse.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, Interior Minister Jacqui Smith is reassured and satisfied that Glitter was prevented from travelling to France and Spain.
<0x60>I receive the Master behind the scenes to capture his character', Günter Brauer, photographer.
No heels, no ruffles, no costumes for the performance.
The nature of the great flamenco dancers who renounce concentration and devote themselves to interpretation in order to get a relaxed look as a woman or as a man.
On the one hand, artists
On the other hand, personality
I look into private lives, into those moments that are foreign to the audience, I know when I can find the personality-typical gesture, the depth of a stolen look, or the expressiveness of the hands that are concerned because they will not enter the stage.
In his project <0x60>Flamenco-people' the German photographer Günter Bauer presents varied theatrical scenes on stage with singers, dancers and guitarists. From this side he was little known for the artists.
With this proposal, the photographer creates a special iconography of the flamenco representation on different levels.
The exhibition, which is part of the programme of the Month of Photography of Flamenco, <0x60>reflects the international importance of flamenco, which is growing from day to day,' the artist explains and makes it clear that <0x60>Flamenco-people' <0x60>can be any person, but when you look at the photos, the viewer notices that they are not typical pictures of artists on stage.
Normal people on the portraits are artists who are able to convey on stage passion, sadness, joy and thus move the audience.
In order to capture the personality of these artists, you do not have to take photos on stage.
Their personality and character are in their hearts.
What interested me was to create a personal atmosphere that would allow me to capture the characters of the greatest flamenco masters with the camera."
Bauer, inspired by the Cante de las Minas festival, embarked on a long journey in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a digital camera.
Thanks to the image sorting function of the camera and the available material, images were created reminiscent of classical photography.
The use of various stylistic means destroys the classical foundation of the image, giving the image the modernity and the idea, as the farmer understands flamenco: <0x60>Music with traditional roots that changes and surprises every day'.
These are not only the dance, the singing or the instrumental play in itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, who seduces the audience with his art.
The search for the essential, for a certain something that becomes visible in the form of hearing, of being, is and was the firm goal of this work, which will be presented in the next period in the gallery of El Fotómata.
Famous flamenco figures including Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others are among the close selection of almost seventy artists photographed.
The project became an anthology of flamenco and will soon be published as a book, with all the portraits from the exhibition.
Bauer’s passion for the portraits led him to retake this idea two years ago and realise it as a ‘portrait of the veterans of the sport’ (‘SportARTproject’).
Although the concepts of the project <0x60>Flamenco-people' are different, the photographer adds to <0x60>I like photographing people, getting to know them and putting me in their state of life, whether for a short moment or for a longer time.
I think that in the field of photography, the portrait is the most difficult genus.
You meet or encounter people, personalities you sometimes don’t know at all, or they leave you alone for a few minutes to take a photo.
Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas.”
The collection of today’s portraits of flamenco, entitled ‘Flamenco-people’, is on display in the gallery of El Fotómata, which is located in the street called la calle de la Mata and runs parallel to la Alameda de Hércules. The exhibition can be visited until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa admits that the Roma he is writing is 'a fool'.
He does not yet know where the plot of the novel takes place and what it is about, but Mario Vargas Llosa persistently tries to advance the project he is currently working on, a novel with the protagonist Roger Casemant, a nationalist from Ireland who lived in the Congo for twenty years and moved to the Amazon.
Yesterday, during his presence at the Hay Festival Segovia, the preferred Nobel laureate admitted that the project he is dealing with is 'a fool' and 'everything indicates he shouldn't have to write the novel'.
<0x60>If I were prudent, I would not have done it, but I will do it and hope to end the novel someday', so he concluded his participation in the festival, where the ideas, thoughts and words were exchanged. Within the four days he saw hundreds of writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people who were in Segovia.
The author of <0x60>La ciudad y los perros' was one of the most outstanding personalities at the third festival and made predictions.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival premium and to whom most of the attendees gave their voices, is compared to the old edition of <0x60>Our mutual friend' and can be seen at the Theater Juan Bravo.
He was introduced by Félix Romeo and noted that he had an audience in front of him, which noticed that the Peruvian, who has a wonderful memory and great sense of humor, was not given enough time to be able to go through everything again: how his vocation to literature, which comes from 'extraordinary adventurous' writing, from 'joy in reading' and from 'wanting to experience more'
The Hispano-American novelist admitted that there is "no way" to measure and how to know whether books change life, "but I refuse to believe that literature is mere entertainment, a fleeting experience," Vargas Llosa stressed, who claims that it does not "provoke effects" and "bring people more to each other because of it."
At the festival in Pozoblanco, the weather did not play with: bullfighting festivals partially failed.
After the announced bullfighters found that the ground of the square was in poor condition, the bullfighting festival, which was to conclude the festival in Pozoblanco, was moved to yesterday morning.
Thus, the organizer, with the consent of Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to postpone the bullfighting festival.
Thus, the festival was exposed to inconsistent weather, which is why two out of three celebrations could not take place.
On Saturday it was raining, which is why the second bullfighting festival planned could not be celebrated.
The group of matadores consisted of José Luis Moreno, Curro Días and Juan Bautista, who gradually entered the bullring.
There was a celebration only on Friday.
The winner there was Daniel Luque, who cut three ears and triumphed, after which he had left the passage with pleasure and aesthetics.
On the same evening, Alejandro Talavante met two horns and an ear of the bull, which he had done more by galloping than by his bullfighting.
And even worse was El Juli, who passed through the Arena de Los Llanos without difficulty, but also without fame.
After fighting so badly, most of the audience responded with buh calls during his second fight.
In <0xC3><0x81>lava, two people wanted to escape the control of their car, which was loaded with two thousand kilos of hashish.
Tomorrow, five minutes before ten.
Traffic controls in Ertzaintza, in the urban area of Armiñon (<0xC3><0x81>lava).
Two policemen called on the drivers of the car to stop, and they fled.
It looked like they would not have to stop with the load of more than two thousand kilos of hashish.
Police pursued her and arrested one of the drivers, the 28-year-old man known as A.A.J., as reported by the Basque Ministry of the Interior.
The detained person was accused of drug trafficking and forging official documents.
The incident occurred when the traffic police officers of the <0xC3><0x81>lava region had already completed traffic control on the N-1 and were passing through the urban area of Armiñon.
They decided to stop a car to carry out the route control. The driver did not follow the instructions, suddenly increased the speed and tried to escape control.
The police began the persecution until after a few kilometers the car stopped at the edge strip. At that moment the drivers got out of the car to escape via a country road into a forest area.
In the car, an Iveco Daily, the drug dealers transported 2,178 kilos of hashish, which was confiscated by the police.
The front part of the car was loaded with hash bundles, which were later directed to other police departments for precise laboratory analysis and weighing of the bundles.
In addition, the officials found that the license plate was 'double', so that it did not match the license plate indicated in the car papers, which is why an additional arrest was made for forgery of official documents.
Police in the city of Ertzaintza are continuing to investigate the arrest of the second suspect, who, as already mentioned, was able to flee, but also to determine the origin of the drugs confiscated.
The detained 28-year-old A. A. J. was taken to a police station for interrogation and will be presented to the judge in the next few hours.
Actress Heather Locklear was arrested for driving under the influence of an unknown drug.
The actress Heather Locklear, who is known for the role of Amanda from the series "Melrose Place," was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California, for driving under the effect of an unknown drug.
One witness had witnessed her trying to get out of her parking space in Montecito in a rather strange way, California traffic police spokesman told People magazine.
The witness told us in detail that Locklear ‘pressed the accelerator pedal after 4:30 p.m. and made a lot of noise by trying to move her car backwards or forwards out of the parking space, and as she drove backwards, she grabbed her sunglasses a few times.’
A little later, the witness, who initially probably did not recognize the actress, saw Locklear stopping on a nearby road and getting out of the car.
The witness was the person who notified the emergency service because she had 'fear of Locklear's living.'
When the police raid arrived, they found the actress sitting in her car, which was standing across the road and blocking traffic.
"She seemed to be disoriented," so they took the police to a special drug and alcohol center to take a test.
According to a police spokesperson, the actress showed cooperative, excessive alcohol consumption was ruled out from the first moment. <0x60>The officials' first observations as a result, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of an unknown drug,' said the spokesperson.
Locklear, suspected of driving under the influence of an indeterminate substance that could not be determined, was arrested and taken to a local detention facility around 7 p.m.
Two months ago, Locklaer was released from the Arizona clinic after receiving treatment for anxiety and depression.
Llamazares insists that the Andalusian Association of the United Left will be responsible for the Silva case.
Gaspar Llamazares, the main coordinator of the VL and MP of the United Left, has today assured that the Regional Association for Education will be the one to make the decision in the case of the former City Council for Youth and Sports of the City of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of doing business with family members.
"In such cases I am a great federalist, and the Andalusian organization will be the one to take over the responsibility for this," Llamazares pointed out what the approach of the party must have towards the one who until now sits as city councillor in the city council of Seville.
Nevertheless, the chairman of the VL defended the necessity of ‘transparency’ in the possible investigations of the rule violations that Silva may have begun: ‘The VL always insisted that such cases receive maximum transparency’.
Regarding this issue, he stressed that education has ‘a strict ethical code for all public offices’.
Sangre de mayo: Hero Book by Garci
Inspired by <0x60>Episodios Nacionales' by Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Carci presents in <0x60>Sangre de mayo' the revised version of the famous Spanish uprising against the French. This is an admirable film in filmography, with around 15 million euros invested in filming.
In this way, the Cineast has tried to 'represent a lot of personalities and social analysis', which he has always admired in the works of the famous novelist, Carci explained today at the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the beginning of a long list of the actors.
<0x60>Sangre de mayo' with a film length of more than two and a half hours, will be presented in cinemas this Friday and later on the channel Telemadrid as a four-hour miniseries.
José Luis Garci, great fan of Galdós' literature, assures that thanks to this filming, his 'childhood dream' came true. This was thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who three years ago commissioned him by the Autonomous Community of Madrid to shoot a memorial film to the second century celebration on November 2nd in Madrid. Especially because the story was based on the <0x60>Episodes' commissioned
The total contribution of 15 million, which was made by the Autonomous Community of Madrid for filming, offers Garci, as he added, the 'unique possibility' with the help of decorations and appropriate garments to represent the image of 'confused Spain, who chose the wrong leader for the fight, because the people had been brought back by the struggle for independence and under the rule of Ferdinand of VII.'
However, the Cineast regrets that it was not possible to count on funding like in <0x60>Alatriste' or <0x60>Los fantasmas de Goya' (twice as high as in <0x60>Sangre de mayo'), so some scenes from the script with Horacio Valcárcel, with whom Garci worked almost his entire career, could not be filmed.
For this reason, Garci, who was also director of film in 'Volver a pedir', has contributed through his usual working method: he stood on stage to the actors with whom one has to rehearse first before starting to shoot and for those who had not done casting, he appeared to be 'humiliating' and respectful, 'a part of the profession of theatre director is to know what is happening in thea
Many actors he encounters in <0x60>Sangre de mayo' have to repeat in front of his camera, as in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, Oscar nominee in four nominations (of which he has won one), is of the opinion and assured that none of the three candidates representing Spain before the Academy of Hollywood this year represents a young generation of Spanish filmography. Neither <0x60>Sangre de mayo' nor <0x60>Siete mesas de billar franceses' nor the selected film <0x60>Los girasole'.
Garci is not expecting any awards for this film.
“At first you think you’re working for the offspring, later you realize that it’s only for the sake of prosperity, and now you’re satisfied if you’ve produced another film,” Garci explains after more than 30 years of work.
Isabel Bayón recalls the memory of the dancer from Seville Tórtola Valencia
A flamenco dancer from Seville worships a dancer who also came from Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia: her father was Catalan (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and the mother Andalusian (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), she was born in the Triana district and when she was three years old, her family moved to London.
She was a dancer and an expert in oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, she was one of the first women to fight for the emancipation of women, such as Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist, vegetarian, and advocated the abolition of the corset, which restricted free female movement.
The life of this woman, who left her mark on the dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe in the period between the wars, fascinated Isabel Bayón.
‘I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested this role to me, which seemed impossible.’
“We are not trying to tell about her life, but to preserve her spirit,” said the flamenco dancer.
Their dance bases have helped me a lot in flamenco.
"The dance of the butterfly," for example, seemed to me like guajira, or "the dance of the snake," like tango.
Her dancing was sensual and I have been told that my dancing is also in this aesthetic area," she claims.
The production expects two extraordinary collaborations: with Miguel Poveda, who will sing again for Isabel at one of her performances, as he did in La puerta abierta; and with flamenco master Matilde Coral, who wanted to work exceptionally together with one of her ex-students.
<0x60>Matilde plays Tórtola, a very mature personality.
I'm happy because she agreed to be involved in my work, and I'm very honored."
The production also counts on musical composition and the guitarists Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the vocals of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; with the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa el Viola and the collaboration with the actor Juanfra Júarez.
This work also tells in a certain way about the life of this woman, who became known in places as far away as India, the United States or Russia, and also throughout Europe, although she usually lived in London.
“I wanted to recall her, because I think she is one of those women who have had a tremendous influence on a certain era and whose works no one can appreciate today and therefore even less,” Bayón claims.
The performance will take place today at 20:30 in the Theater Lope de Vega.
The publication of the book <0x60>Diario de un poeta recién casado' also includes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of <0x60>Diario de un poeta conocido casado' in the Saint Stephen's Church (New York), in a place where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in 1916, provides an appropriate atmosphere to carry out planned activities on behalf of the Andalusian Council for Culture, to celebrate the <0x60>Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón's fiveth anniversary.
Thus, ‘the Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón’ is now concluded with the new edition of this work, with the international congress taking place in New York, with the restoration of the House-Museum of Juan Ramón Jiménez-Zenobia and with the itinerant exhibition <0x60>Juan Ramón Jiménez: <0x60>Aquel chopo de luz' is presented in Andalusia, which was opened in May and after which in New York it was presented in differently.
The Andalusian Council for Culture has also received eight hundred copies of <0x60>Diario de un poeta recibido casado', published by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Pacobo Pérez-Enciso, with the aim of making the person and work of the Andalusian world poet more famous.
The U.S. can't imagine itself without Paul Newman
“Sometimes God creates perfect personalities.
Paul Newman was one of them.”
This phrase comes from the actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Sensation Reporter," and from the then prevailing notion of American cinema, which was abandoned, coming from all over America to Newman with his enthusiastic notion and following it.
Look at how much it cost him to win the Oscar.
When he retired in 2007.
And he knew he was very ill.
Nevertheless, it was a big blow for everyone.
"What one sometimes feels is much more than an expression, and now I have lost a great friend," said Robert Redford, weeping, "my life and my country were the greatest follies of his life."
No one was afraid of ridiculing or exaggerating.
As the “father” of cinema and the homeland, he died at a sad moment when fear of terrorists and market collapse prevailed, when the downtrodden self-esteem of Americans is on the desperate quest for reasons to regain dignity.
If, in this difficult time, few people remain without virtue to be admired, then one does not necessarily have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For everyone, he embodied a platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was the official enemy of Richard Nixon and suffered as various losses as well as profits: from the foundation dedicated to the fight against the drugs and founded in honor of his son from the first marriage, who died of overdose, to his own brand of homemade and organic products.
All of this is a gift for the country where it took a lot of effort to prevail against a deadly nutritional culture.
A wide wave of astonishment strikes high above Hollywood without regard to nationalities and nationality.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only one person died, but the whole era.
The Englishman Sam Mendes, film director and Oscar winner, said that working with Newman was no more or no less than the peak of his career.
Russell Crowe, the evil boy who came from Australia, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
“The greatest of us has left us all,” George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today dare to try to live as Paul Newman lived: maintaining high demands on righteousness, leading a responsible private life, far from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in today’s media jungle.
But there is someone who tries, and Paul Newman was an example of that.
He divorced once and was then married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he was faithful, although there were certainly many possibilities not to be.
‘Why should I eat a hamburger on the street when I have fillet at home?’ he often joked himself.
In heaven, he will be proud that on earth his daughters have the same opinion as his fans, which is not necessarily common in America.
“Of all the great roles he played, none of which he was as proud of as the faithful spouse, the loving father, the attentive grandfather and the philanthropist,” they say.
For the Olympic Games, the streets in Madrid are deficient.
Yes, the dream of many of us is to host some Olympic disciplines in Madrid, after the failure for 2012, maybe it will be 2016.
But I wonder: ‘Are we prepared for this?’
Yes, we follow the example of the old roads, I say it is not true!
It was called the perfect road, and in my judgment, it was the worst road with everything there was.
Of course, this is a lot of nonsense, if you would pay attention to the evaluation and I could check it, clearly such a thing would not have come through.
But, let's go through everything from the beginning.
The nonsense starts with ticket picking, which allows you to be the first to go.
It doesn’t seem bad to me either, but if they already let you go ahead, then they should give you everything (including chip to avoid traffic jams on the road).
No, no, no, no.
Here they just let you get the ticket (the first nonsense that consists of going there just for that reason) and (after an infinite queue) there is the surprise! The T-shirt was only in size <0x60>S' (a second nonsense, because I need the size XL)
Where do we actually live?
Or is it that after the crisis it was decided to buy only small, much cheaper shirts from less fabric?
All right, things like this are a tiny thing compared to the days on the street.
Apart from the fact that you have to go very early to get the chip, there is already a queue of at least 15 minutes and, moreover, you have to leave the backpack.
The waiting took more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible in the case of a road where 11,000 people are expected.
Finally, as was to be expected, the road started and we had not left our backpacks in front of it, even if it had once succeeded, but to get them back would be more difficult.
In addition, it looked like rain in those 40 minutes of waiting, so it was tempted to organize a popular uprising and raid the house.
I think tomorrow some 500 people will certainly have pneumonia and some like me will not even appear in time at the classification because of this chip I got, I can already imagine that the output was stamped incorrectly.
Of course, if you asked me about a perfect road, I would never think of that road.
So I think we will dream for a long time of a city well-prepared for the Olympics
Microsoft looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the Emerging Technology Conference, hosted by MIT, Microsoft presented the progress of the new image recognition system and human interaction, a being of artificial intelligence without much intelligence, but capable of doing some primitive tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or, in the case of Microsoft, this is a route planner to move around on the company's campus).
Thanks to a camera and a form and face recognition system, this <0x60>receptionist' can recognize how many people are in the room, who they are and even remember how they were dressed, it can listen and understand the keywords of their conversation.
It can also classify those present in the groups after the conversations.
In the presentation video, ‘the receptionist’ notices a third person, but she understands that this person is not part of the group that is talking to her, and that neither is a company employee.
She asks if the person here wants to visit someone and answers that she will be listening soon.
Everything without the blue screenshot
Impressive
This is certainly the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example, on the next version of their Windows operating system.
This week, we talked very superficially about Microsoft’s strategy change.
Windows 7 will be faster and will not have so many embedded programs.
Steve Ballmer noted that if the computers were equipped with the essentials instead of filling them with the commercial garbage, they would work five times faster.
Everything is just a statement, considering that Microsoft in Windows versions added one or the other function and <0x60>Tools'.
The change of direction is worthwhile
The Microsoft is right, the operating system is gradually losing its importance, just like the software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the web, that was part of the theory that it was Google’s first step to competing with Windows.
Skillfully, many pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system, as an indispensable part, will always be necessary for hardware and software to work simultaneously.
The operating system performs the function that can be compared to the function of his wife or husband when it comes to communicating something to his mother-in-law.
That's right.
The system will never disappear, but one has to think of his "death," not as an absolute, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is the confirmation of that idea.
People pay less attention to the operating system each time, but more to the web browser.
The computer is only started to run Firefox, Explorer or Chrome and every day we spend more time browsing than in the surroundings of the <0x60>windows'.
What does half of the existing applications in the computer serve for?
Less is more
And Windows 7 must be more compact, much more compact than Vista.
Lighter, not so exaggerated, less complicated.
Microsoft’s interest is more in integrating its online services, which can eventually become the alternative to Google.
In reality, they need that, without a doubt. I bring a small example of this.
I took the photo of this place in Redmond, in one of the restrooms for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month.
On the soft drinks vending machine is a sign attached: <0x60>Your search. Our future'. It prints a request to use your own tool for online search.
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of employees at Microsoft used Google for web research.
By the way, it was also confirmed last week that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was delayed.
It will not appear at the beginning, but at the end of 2009, rather than in 2010.
Microsoft is looking for the possibility of bringing Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 to the market at the same time.
Every day, the phone turns into a computer.
The Android and the iPhon are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso was wearing it in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio was wearing it in Edward Zwick’s Blood Diamond, as was Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola’s The Godfather, and it is also part of a well-built priest’s clothing.
If we start to count the countless stars, we can go back to the image of a very strong man, with a pointed beard, who had lifted heavy weights in a walking circus.
Basically, this is a typical male t-shirt made of cotton, sleeveless and waisted.
The English-speaking people call it <0x60>tank', but Lle Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles outperforms all other brands.
First, because of its great name, although it is called <0x60>Marcel' in the narrow circle, the legend tells that the name creation is linked to sport and came from boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of singer Edith Piaf.
<0x60>La Marcel' overshadows everyone for its excellent cotton, for its distinctive unisex cut and is distinguished by a small Belgian flag (hardly recognizable), which these T-shirts have as a detail on the neckline.
And attention, the Belgian company is not just focusing on the production of <0x60>tanks'.
They also have College Sweatshirts, Boxer Retro, Cardigans and Cashmere, Cotton Pants, Striped T-Shirts, Babies, Mini Shorts
Modeled and comfortable underwear.
However, it is a pity to use them as underwear.
They are very charming.
“I want to be a young mother; I don’t worry about the candidate.”
Her great appearance with her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Mónica Cruz is tiny but full of joy of life.
At the moment, the Gruz siblings take their new activity in fashion very seriously.
For Mónica, this means much more than for some pretty and wealthy girls who keep their reputation.
She was in Paris at the promotion of the company Mango, moved to its residence and also makes the presentation of the most important awards in the fashion sponsored by the Spanish fashion house.
Merciful and shy, winner on the short distances.
Tell us what you do in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection for this autumn/winter season that my sister Penélope and I have designed for Mango, as well as attending the presentation of the second edition of <0x60>Mango Fashion Awards' and taking part in the dinner in honour of Valentino.
A very intensive working time that is exciting at the same time.
You work for the Spanish house, what is the basis of your new collection for the fourth season for Mango?
My sister, both I and I are fascinated by the cinema of the 50s and 60s; there we find many ideas.
I like to walk through a city and watch women dress up, how they combine their garments, I often do that.
Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think yes, but after all, everything comes together in one and these areas have many things in common.
Since I was a child, I have been enthusiastic about the clothes; I always wanted to go to my grandmother’s clothes and see her clothes.
That was great, almost better than going to a theme park.
Even later, as a dancer, I always tried to pay attention to the clothes.
You know, we dancers like to have our own style in class and rehearsals to look in the mirror and feel good about it.
As an actress, when you get the costume, you put yourself in the real acting role.
After all, everything is interconnected, it is so, a lot of respect for the costume designer and their professionalism.
Recently, you've turned 30, haven't you fallen into a crisis?
Oh, my God.
I feel better than ever, as a 30-year-old I feel good.
I think the woman becomes mature, has experience and can enjoy life with fewer mistakes.
I'm not afraid of my biological clock.
I’ve done the things I’ve wanted to do since I was a kid and that gave me a lot of inner joy.
So, you're thinking about becoming a mother, aren't you?
I’ve known for a long time that I’m going to be a mother because that’s what my body requires, and I want to be a young mother; I don’t want to miss that.
As for the candidate, I’m not worried.
I will impart great feelings of happiness to my child and educate him with much love.
As far as film art is concerned, keep an eye on the work you participated in and shot last year.
That’s exactly what it is and I want them to be presented to the public.
I, as a woman who comes from the theatre, am very impatient and restless and want to have everything at once, which of course cannot be immediately.
I very much wish that <0x60>La última hora' and <0x60>En busca de la tumba de Cristo' will be performed for the first time.
Let's see how you like them
A couple of days ago, you appeared on the ramp with Naomi Campbell, right?
It's okay, don't say that.
It’s not that I went on the runway to model.
Naomi Campbell, who I've known for some time, just called me and invited me to London to attend a charity parade for her organization Women for a Better World and the clothes we show. I know that two garments from our collection were auctioned for mango to raise money for Naomi's NGO.
People don’t know Naomi’s good heart.
There's a lot of stuff being told about her. I, as the one she knows, would tell you they're not right.
Nevertheless, I will support this good thing in which she is involved.
She asked me to attend the parade for this generous cause, but if she comes and asks me to make a handstand, I will do that too.
To support women in the Third World, which is also necessary.
Drivers who may be relapsed due to alcohol levels will have to install the ‘Alcolock’.
The authorities order that the driver, who had three official penalties for alcohol levels, installs in his car this system, which forbids him to start the car in a drunken state. If he is alcoholized, then the car does not start.
The initiative was announced last month in June and is already part of the report of the Attorney General’s Office. According to them, it is a pilot project that will last for a year.
The purpose is the resocialization of the driver, which is why he receives a course for the reeducation of traffic behaviour.
In addition to the Attorney General, the Ministry of Transport and the Foundation of the Technical Institute for the Safety of Automobiles will participate.
According to statistics, between 30-75% of drivers who have been reported driving under the influence of alcohol more than once have returned to the wheel.
The 'alcolock' would prevent this because it is a system connected to the car, it measures the alcohol content in the exhaled air and prevents autostart when the driver has made alcohol test; or when an alcohol concentration higher than allowed is detected.
It costs more than 1 000 euros, the costs are borne by the person who imposes the sanction.
In this context, a study conducted in the U.S. in 2007 showed that cars equipped with these devices prevent up to 65% of rule violations in the first year after its introduction.
In Spain, it is estimated that 115 lives could be saved each year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to tackle this behaviour before it becomes a criminal offence.
And in order to facilitate their implementation, a lawful reform can be implemented in the ordinary way, and yet a fundamental law reform, which is necessary for the law enforcement process, is called for.
The device is still available in the Spanish markets, in no store, although it has already been installed in some commercial vehicles and vehicles of public transport.
It is precisely tomorrow that the House of Deputies will vote on the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, which proposes to install this system in school buses, which has already been done in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes'
With British punctuality, at 17:40, at the time scheduled by the program, next to the presidential hangar of the Benito Juárez de México DF airport, the plane of the Spanish Air Force, with the Prince and Princess of Asturias, landed.
The sun went down, but its rays still forced to use the hand as a parasol to see the royal couple getting out of the plane.
Directly at the gangway: the Spanish ambassador and other authorities
A few hours earlier, I had asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Prince and the Princess of Asturias were visiting the city to formalize the official trip.
- Ah, very good, so you can't take any people at the airport at this time you're from here or something.
No, she's the Spaniard, but she lived here for a couple of years.
- Oh, that's very good.
But the Mexican press knows exactly who the prince and princess of Asturias are and knows the importance of the trip.
There are many who are waiting in the airport’s hangar and on the red carpet, also military protection of 27 soldiers of the navy, who give the ointment of honor.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in navy blue, and she, the princess, with long hair blown by the wind, without ordinary 'peep-toes', perhaps she was told that a thunderstorm is expected in DF.
Before entering the hall, they smile and are prepared for the photographers, in which the official entourage awaits.
At the door of the hotel where they are housed, one of the four largest in the city, a reporter from Mexican television who likes to make jokes is waiting for them.
The best premium in fashion
Probably there was no more suitable place in the world than Paris to present a premium of fashion and there was probably no substantially outstanding fashion designer and bonvivant than Valentino.
Mango presents the second edition of the fashion competition <0x60>el Bóton-Mango Fashion Adwards' for the promotion and international promotion of young fashion talents.
This is awarded with a cash prize of 300 000 euros.
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, saw her drawings yesterday in the shop window of the Mango branch on Boulevard Haussmann number 54 in Paris and almost cried because of the emotional excitement.
By the way, this is the second largest business of the company in Europe and was recently opened. It offers a sales area of 1 335 m2.
The biggest business is in London.
So many events have taken place that we would like to thank fashion designer Valentino for his jury chairmanship at the competition, all ended with a luxury dinner at the Opera National de Paris.
Around many famous people, the board table organized by Mango seemed spectacular.
Nati, with the heavy heart broken by the pain of the recent death of his brother, pulls himself together. He put on the suit from the fashion house and wore some jewelry from ELAH, which were breathtaking. He held on the arm of his son Luis, who is almost two meters tall, and accompanied Valentino at the dinner, in his honor.
Andik, the owner and master of the Mango house, greeted the guests and was such a cavalier, so he ended up with the Baron of Rotschild without jackets, because jackets they borrowed from the ladies.
Mónica Cruz, hurried to the shop and had a pants and a shirt, which she modeled herself, and for dinner she wore a long, black sexy dress. On a night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us a hall for ballet rehearsals, so she got excited, remembered the old times, grabbed a pole and made a prank.
Inés Sastre, did not join the walk through the palace, but before that she had shown us the photos of her son on the cell phone.
The next morning we could look forward to the presence of Oliver Martínez, a personality that always evokes a stormy enthusiasm, and to Jon Travolta, who after arriving (with his own bed linen and towels) at the Hotel Internacional in Paris, asked in advance to have a room without odors.
The stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh la la, that's life.
1001 advice on stress
There is not a thousand, but one more way to forget chaotic and fast-paced everyday life.
And even though they are few, they are all collected in a book that says how to relax. The book will be released in the bookshops on September 30.
The alarm clock is a penalty if it rings at 7 o’clock in the morning, but even worse seems the idea of getting back into the hectic rhythm that the current life demands.
The office is called the tension and the computer that leads to the back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are not one and not two ways to combat daily exhaustion and the problems of turning off the world of work.
However, the number increases, no more and no less than 1001.
In addition to yoga postures, classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott presents in the book the whole list of options adapted to the tastes and time of each individual.
The work against stress is called <0x60>1001 Ways to Relax' and so the calm that the book conveys comes into the bookshops of the publishing houses Pearson Alhambra and DK.
Anyone who thinks that it is impossible to achieve calm in areas such as workplace with the help of personal contacts, this manual refutes such beliefs.
In addition, the methods are offered, how to stay in contact with nature or the 100% natural recipes that lead to relaxation are suggested.
When the adrenaline in your veins stops rising to restore balance to the body and the stress has become a problem, the time has come to sit down on the sofa, turn off the brain and focus on reading.
Talking in sleep
Some children talk at night
I don’t mean those who wake up and tell us something about what happened the day before, but the children who talk while they sleep.
When it happens to you for the first time, at best you will be frightened, but in reality it doesn’t mean anything.
This is a positive sleep disorder called speaking in sleep.
It is quite common, especially among children and teenagers.
Certainly, more than one of you was told that you were talking at night.
This phenomenon can occur occasionally (once in life, for example, during high fever), or regularly (every day, once a week, once a month ), the next day the child can remember nothing.
There is not a single reason that causes this phenomenon.
Often, connections are sought with other phenomena in sleep, such as nightmares, panic anxiety at night, enuresis noctura (bed wetting at night), speaking in sleep, but there is no reason for this.
As we mentioned earlier, it can be due to very high fiber, stressful situations or overload.
In any case, this is a little researched phenomenon.
The frequency with which it occurs is very variable.
It can be quietly speaking in single words, whispering or it can be quite the opposite (screaming, crying, long discussions).
In cases where the expression is very intense, it is recommended to observe the child and seek advice from a specialist to check whether there is a problem that causes anxiety and thus arises.
We have said that it is a positive disorder, so it is not treated, whether it is, it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, with sleep apnea or with stress).
What you can do is perform a series of simple preventive measures:
Try not to excite the child before sleeping.
So, pick quiet play for the child and avoid stressful television programs that are awful and somewhat too wild.
For the nervous children who are recommended relaxations, relaxation methods can be used to help them get some inner peace.
This helps the child to sleep calmly.
If speaking occurs once in sleep, try to keep calm.
Remember that it is harmless to the child and the next day he will not be able to remember anything that happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake it up.
This is useless, because the child is unconscious, so you will tear it out of sleep.
Even though the child speaks, he sleeps, so he rests.
Remember, if it appears frightened after a pair of appearances, it is recommended to seek advice or find out what the child has reason for fear.
When they understand what it says (which is not so common), the child does not put pressure on them to conduct an interrogation and get more information.
So you will not be able to achieve anything with it, because when the child is sleeping, he is unconscious and unable to think about it.
Besides, you will hear what it says, but you will not know what it dreams and why it says so be careful with the interpretation of the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Maybe, don’t tell the child that you hear this at night and know its secrets.
Not even as a joke.
That causes a lot of fear.
So don’t worry, it’s nothing bad, it’s a moment that only takes a few minutes.
Illhausen ... finally
After a long thirsty journey, Illhäusern is finally back on track for success on the field.
Without much effort, the Yellow-Blacks gained numerous goals and managed to implement one of them, thus winning the game.
The pace of this encounter, where the attackers struggled to show their skills, was not very high.
After a first attack by the guest captain Kauffmann, whose long-distance shot just past the angle, Illhäusern was to dominate the game with ease, and it succeeded in alternating first Fonderflick with a long-distance shot, then brain with a high pass, and Romain with a shot with the tip of the foot to challenge the defence of Denmark.
The opposing team blocked in the middle of the field, leaving only the lively Riahi at the top of the storm.
The start of the second half should be decisive with initially two goals won by Riahi and Temporal, and immediately thereafter with the first goal for the Illhäuser by Marais, who stood exactly right to take back a ball that had been repelled by Diebold in a first attempt.
But the ill-fated goalkeeper should not be able to enjoy his luck for long and be sent to the bench about twelve minutes later, whereby his teammates had to continue to play in terms of numbers.
Denmark, however, did not take advantage of this and faced no major problems to an illiterate elf, who only retreated a little to <0x60>compress' her defense, except in the very last seconds of the game, in which the ball passed very close to the bar after a great mess.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make another detour to Brittany.
Given the determined stance of the fishermen who blocked the access to several Breton and Norman ports on Monday, the French president decided to come to the port of Guilvinec in Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet with their representatives there.
The latter promised to receive him <0x60>with a constructive spirit', and hoped that he would come with <0x60>concrete proposals'.
The president’s visit coincides with a general meeting of the crisis committee set up by the Breton fishermen to enforce measures in light of the extreme rise in the price of diesel, which has reached a record value of over 1.14 euros per litre on average.
According to Elysee Palace spokesman David Martinon, “the president will discuss possible solutions with them to help their companies become competitive again, and to secure working conditions and pay for seafarers.”
Sarkozy is expected by the fishermen with determination.
Tuesday morning, they led protest marches in Morbihan and Calvados, causing traffic jams of almost ten kilometers in length.
The sailing port of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-île did not interrupt.
The Quiberon Peninsula was delimited by a barrier.
As early as Monday, sailors expressed their determination by burning tyres and pallets from early morning in front of the fuel deposits of the ports of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations were held in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement extended to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the English Channel, such as Sables d'Olonne, in Vendée, where the fishing boats did not sail out, or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the maneuvers of merchant ships.
In the evening, the fishermen of Turballe and Croisic in Loire-Atlantique dissolved the blockade of the major Total refinery in Donges.
Those from Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the course of the meeting at the ministry on Wednesday before deciding on possible measures.
In fact, the crisis committee in Guilvinec must decide on the reactions to the movement and on its participation in the discussion planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the leaders of the National Fisheries Committee, which has not supported their movement.
“The strike will continue,” said Liliane Cariou, president of the Lorient Fisheries Committee, “because the fishermen will not give in at any point” and “don’t want to go to Paris.”
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel, currently cost about 50 cents per litre, but they believe that the profitability limit of a boat can only be reached with diesel for less than 30 cents per litre.
Paul Newman the Wonderful
Butch Cassidy and the Kid died at the age of 83 from cancer at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford or Sam Mendes said goodbye to the cinema legend and committed actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its 2008 delivery forecasts
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer expects 215 aircraft delivered this year, despite the threat of recession, as a threat to the global economy.
Embraer, the fourth largest aircraft manufacturer in the world, is keeping its 2008 delivery forecasts with 215 aircraft delivered, its president Fredrico Fleury Curado confirmed.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer hopes much from the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft of the order of 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 machines to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider filing more than 15% of its assets
According to the Sunday issue of the Financial Times, the insurer American International Group, which has been financially supported by the U.S. Monetary Authority, is considering returning more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion it has been advanced.
AIG is willing to drive the sale of most of its businesses, beyond its international life insurance and retirement plans in the United States.
According to the FT, the board of directors of the AIG met on Sunday evening to review possible sales.
At the AIG no confirmation was obtained.
Among the assets that AIG might be separating from is its aircraft leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in the reinsurer Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate assets and investments in private equity.
No final decision has been made on these sales, FT continues.
AIG must make the sales as soon as possible to repay the loans over 85 billion that the Federal Reserve has granted it, including at the risk of the American authorities getting 80% of their capital and the current shareholders being lost to the same extent.
Analysis Historical Paris of the Meeting Historical Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange on Monday, after the Chamber of Representatives rejected Paulson’s plan to save the banks, reported a historic fall in prices: The Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss of nearly 800 points, and Nasdag 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dropped by 777.68 points to 10,365.45 points.
In terms of points, the strongest case in its history (684.81 points) had been recorded before on September 17, 2001, the day of trade decline after the terrorist attacks of September 11.
According to the final drop figures, the Nasdag index, mainly in terms of technology, dropped by 199.61 points to 1,983.73, and the widely used Standard&Poors 500 index by 8.81% (106.85 points) to 1,106.55 points.
After the unexpected rejection by the Chamber of Deputies of the plan to save the banks, which was once again to provide some stability in the markets, Wall Street collapsed, which had already been wrecked at the beginning of the quarter.
With 228 votes against and 205 in favour, the MPs denied finance secretary Henry Paulson the funds he had asked for.
Nearly two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
“This is a bad picture circulating that shows Congress is unable to adopt a plan,” said FTN Financial’s Lindsey Piegza.
<0x60>This shows how much the market counted on this plan,' she added, fearing that a project adopted in several days would come 'too late'.
“If the project is actually doomed to failure (...), it will soon be the job of the Fed and other central banks to tackle the crisis, which would limit credit conditions even more,” said Brian Bethune, Global Insight’s chief economist.
And Miss Piegza emphasized, emphasizing even more the sense of urgency that “every day that passes brings with it the ruin of a financial company” in the United States.
Following the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, the U.S. authorities planned to buy Wachovia’s banking operations from its competitor, Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis suddenly accelerated, leading to emergency measures in favour of banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, a sign that markets are facing “not just an American but a global crisis,” the analyst added to FTN Financial.
The market for basic goods has grown rapidly.
Revenues from the Treasury within ten years fell Friday evening from 3.632% to 3.827%, and revenues within 30 years last night from 4.161% to 4.357%.
Obama wins in first TV duel
The first debate between the two White House candidates on Friday was followed by another to find out who was the winner, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As expected, the QGs to elect both Republicans and Democrats announced their own victory in this television duel that should be pursued by one-third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen estimates that John McCain's performance, although quite handsome, was not <0x60>brilliant' enough to allow him to halt his decline in election polls five weeks before the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, which published an opinion poll on Saturday, according to which Obama is ahead with five points (49% to 44% for McCain), believes that the Democrat is clearly making the better figure.
Among the still indecisive voters, the ones that matter now, Obama emerged victorious with 39%, while according to a CBS poll, 25% of them see McCain as the winner.
Obama should be able to confirm his lead on Thursday with the good performance expected of his competitor Joseph Biden at the first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin.
“It would be a mistake to underestimate it.
She has good instincts," Bill Clinton said.
Seventy-year-old McCain continued to highlight his indisputable experience in foreign policy, clearly underlining his opponent's "naivety" on these issues that were the focus of this first television duel.
“Senator Obama doesn’t seem to understand that,” he said several times.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge to become president," he said.
A point of attack that has been preached in Republican election commercials since yesterday.
Obama himself stressed that he represents the future.
He expressed himself briefly and precisely, without getting out of his mind.
He put his ability to make good decisions and renew the image the world has of the United States.
"McCain still hasn't understood, Obama has," a Democratic election advert this weekend opposed, accusing Republicans of not capturing the full extent of the crisis that weighs on the "American off the street."
"During the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot of things to say about me, but nothing about you," Obama denounced yesterday in front of 20,000 people who had gathered in the rain during an election rally in North Carolina.
He did not even mention the words “medium-sized” or “workers.” The financial crisis gives Obama, whom Americans consider most appropriate to save the economy even on the brink of the abyss, a clear advantage.
“The coming week could be a decisive turning point,” said influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama’s “good economic instincts” to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current crisis is “the final verdict of an eight-year bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain.”
After again stressing that he might even be able to lower taxes for 95% of Americans despite the fluctuations on Wall Street, the Illinois Senator pointed out that creating a possible energy independence of the country and promoting renewable energy, along with the introduction of a health insurance system, would be his top priority.
McCain, on the other hand, wanted to build a plant of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
The two candidates carefully evaded the questions related to the $700 billion (470 billion euros) plan to save the financial market, which was passed by Congress last night and is extremely unpopular among the people.
“Have you noticed that there was an election in Minsk?”
Young people and opposition protested on Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital in order to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
Several hundred Belarusians have gathered on Sunday night since the ballot boxes closed in the Minsk marketplace to protest the fraudulent nature of the parliamentary elections.
Although no results had yet been announced, many young people had come to protest against the power of Alexander Lukachenko: ‘The dictator should resign.’
Some admit that they haven’t voted at all: ‘What good is that if they do what they want with my vote,’ says a teenager.
They do not believe that the regime, which has shown itself to foreign observers in the best light to resume negotiations with the European Union, is ready to make a democratic change.
Sanctions, including the non-issue of visas to 40 leading Belarusian personalities and the suspension of certain assets, could be lifted if those elections were deemed clean by observers.
According to the opposition, it was not.
"We were excluded from the election commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the counting," regretted Yuri Potemkin, press spokesman of the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous union of twelve parties.
This is a cosmetic change, emphasizes Alexander Milinkievich, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, because it is important who counts the votes, and with us that is the executive.
If members of the opposition come to parliament, it is because they have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry into Parliament can mean television time, meetings in the regions and legislative proposals.”
The opposition is therefore guilty of interfering in the political game, because ‘the dialogue with the European Union must be opened.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, falls into a crisis and we do not reform, we run the risk of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
Well, we want to be independent."
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has followed the electoral process, will not recognize the election as valid.
She stresses that voter turnout figures seem too high, and that extending the vote in advance (26% of Minsk voters) has paved the way for any kind of manipulation.
“Have you noticed that an election has taken place?” asks the leader of the Social Democrat Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five members of the opposition in Parliament, the ones most likely to be in line with the ideas of the government."
The silence of the night descends again over Oktoberplatz.
On television, President Lukachenko and the members of the Central Election Commission congratulate them on their success.
Conversation - From the blood that became safe again
Hema-Quebec celebrated its 10th anniversary yesterday, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to rejoice, as Hema-Quebec has become one of the safest and most efficient blood banks in the world.
And above all, it has regained public confidence, which had been severely shaken by the scandal of contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, the national blood reserves administered by the Canadian Red Cross Blood Donation Service were contaminated with the HIV virus and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In the face of this tragedy and public dissatisfaction, the Government of Canada launched a public investigation in February 1994, led by Judge Horace Krever, aimed at bringing light on the circumstances that had led to such a tragedy and drawing up guidelines to prevent a further disaster of this kind.
While Judge Krever was still hesitant to submit his report, several provinces at the time set up a committee aimed at developing a new system for managing blood preserves in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this task.
According to the reports of Gélineau and Krever, two blood banks were established in Canada: Hema-Quebec, which is responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian Blood Society to supply the other provinces and the two territories.
<0x60>1998, when Hema-Quebec started work, barely 38% of people had confidence in the blood-preserving system in Quebec, Dr. Décary recalls.
The situation was daunting.
Through the tremendous efforts to improve the safety of blood preserves and by working in this field over the next few years, we have regained public confidence,” she says, before proudly emphasizing that in early 2008, nearly 94% of Quebec’s population had confidence in Hema-Quebec.
However, Dr. Décary keeps in mind that “trust is something extremely fragile.”
Since its founding on September 28, 1998, Hema-Quebec has acted on the principle of caution.
At that time, we witnessed the occurrence of numerous cases of the human form of bovine madness in Europe, a new type of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, says this woman, who has been in charge since its founding in 1998.
“And we had no idea if this disease could be transmitted through the blood.
So we cited one of the main guidelines of the reports by Krever and Gélineau, according to which exclusion measures are applied when you do not know this and when a disease progresses slowly, as is obviously the case with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which manifests itself by degeneration of the brain, which inevitably leads to death.
So in April 1999 no blood was accepted from people who had been in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
Well, a few years ago, it was proven without a doubt that this disease is transmitted through the blood.
Thus, this event has shown us that the principle of caution we applied has a meaning.
In 1999, a much more accurate technique for detecting HIV appeared on the market: the nucleic acid tests (NST), which allow to detect the occurrence of the virus itself directly in the donor’s blood, and not the antibody against the virus, as has been the case with the tests used so far.
The NST made it possible to shorten the incubation time that takes place between the time the person was infected and when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, the specialist explains.
This time could be reduced to less than a week.
Thus, the risk that certain donors might be infected without knowing, and you could not recognize, has been significantly reduced.
These improvements made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of AIDS transmission via blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people is at risk of getting HIV-infected blood.
“In other words, it means that you would have to distribute 12 million blood cans before someone gets infected with HIV.
Since Hema Quebec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood preserves each year, it would take more than 24 years for a case of HIV to occur.
I believe that you can feel comfortable doing this nowadays when you get a blood transfusion or prescribe it to restore health," says Hema-Quebec's chief executive.
“Our challenge for the next ten years is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogen can enter the system.
Only last year, the chikungunya virus emerged on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted through the blood through insects.
We need to monitor continuously," continues Dr. Décary, before stressing that Hema-Quebec must provide adequate care in addition to safe supply.
“The need increases as the population ages.
Because cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also affects the blood donor network, which, on average, includes only 3% of the population of Quebec eligible for blood donation.
Any healthy person who is 18 years of age or older and meets the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who provide their blood are not accepted because they have AIDS or malaria, for example, and those who have travelled to a country where malaria is spread are excluded from blood donation for one year.
<0x60>With this 3%, we manage to get an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Lack of supplies is very rare.
But you have to renew the members of this donor network as they get older and can no longer donate blood.
It’s hard to convince people to donate blood, but most importantly, to hold them and make them become regular donors.
“Life is so hectic these days that you rarely find the time to spend an hour donating blood,” Francine Decary said.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Quebec delivers not only blood preserves, but also human tissue, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs, and skin, which is used almost exclusively in severe burn injuries.
These tissues are examined, processed and frozen before being temporarily stored at Hema-Quebec, which also manages Quebec’s only public umbilical cord blood bank.
In the umbilical cord, which was previously considered biomedical waste, there is rich blood stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
“A few weeks ago we celebrated the storage of our thousandth cord blood sample, and we plan to take more than a thousand a year.
<0x60>We should probably start making it available for transplants at the beginning of next year,' explains Dr. Décary, who describes this cord blood sample program as very popular.
<0x60>Many mothers believe they don't have access to it' because Hema-Quebec lacks the resources to offer this complex and costly program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Soccer - Impact in the semi-finals
Montreal’s Impact qualified yesterday, thanks to a 3 to 1 win (4 to 3 with all goals) against the Sounders from Seattle in the second and deciding game of the quarter-final series at Saputo Stadium, where the overall goal ratio counted, for the semi-final round of the elimination matches of the first league of the USL.
The midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After a first half without a goal for both sides, midfielders David Testo and Rocco Plancentino landed the other goals for the Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who stood in the way of Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Let’s remember that in the first game of the foreplay and backplay series on Friday, Impact had brought a 2 to 1 defeat to the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, a suburb of Seattle.
In the semi-finals, Impact will compete with the Vancouver Whitecaps.
On Saturday evening, Thunder was able to offset a 3 to 1 deficit in the back game in Minnesota by a 4 to 3 win, but the Whitecaps nevertheless moved into the semi-finals with a total goal ratio of 5 to 4.
Impact will probably have to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the game series will be determined today.
In short - Siegestor by Kovalev
The number 1 trio of the Canadian team is ready to start the season.
Formed from Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrej Kostitsyn last night, the unit pushed forward the attack on the Florida Panthers with a storm fire, leading to a 3 to 2 win.
Kostitsyn, the star of the match, scored a goal, Plekanec delivered two assists and Kovalev turned a pass in this victory game, the fourth of the Tricolore in six preliminary games.
Kovalev scored the victory by shooting the only goal of the whole shooting.
"I'm not ready yet," the Russian warned.
I need another game to make me feel comfortable.”
“He has been too obsessed with it in the first half,” remarked Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he liked the end of the game.
He received stormy applause."
Charest is on the North
The Prime Minister does not rule out opening elections before the end of the year.
As soon as the General Assembly of the Liberal Party was over, Jean Charest went to Jean-Talon in Quebec yesterday, where the new Health Minister Yves Bolduc (left) is trying to be elected in today’s partial election.
<0x60>Moving the course of our last great frontier in the north': this is the long-term goal that Jean Charest presented visually yesterday at the General Assembly of the Liberal Party of Quebec in Levis, following entirely the guidelines.
During his lecture, a kind of picture mill was projected behind him.
On three huge screens, spectacular images of hydroelectric power plants, mines, viewed from Quebec in <0x60>Google Maps', maps, etc.
Great funds as during the legislative term.
By the way, to the press, the prime minister refused to rule out that he would hold the elections this autumn, even though he said his schedule was very full.
The ‘Plan North’ is the fourth element of a ‘vision’ that the Prime Minister allegedly has for Quebec, namely that of a ‘new economic area’ that provides for an agreement with France on labour, an agreement between Canada and Europe, and agreements with Ontario.
Although it has been frequently mentioned in the Prime Minister's speeches recently, the opening of the North - the northern area at the 49th latitude - has never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North is ‘a jewel with enormous potential’, but did not mention a date, investment sums or precise priorities for the upcoming projects.
At most, some outlooks on what more could be done: above all on water energy, on the forest, but especially on the mining sector, favored by the growth of emerging markets and the renewal of public infrastructures.
According to Mr. Charest's list, the North has "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds."
This <0x60>area twice the size of France' <0x60>is near us, is in Quebec.
It’s not just near us, it’s in us,’ he stressed, as to clearly show that he is looking to realize a national founding dream.
Quebec has grown greatly through its connection with the north, he emphasized: the road to gold in Abitibi, the technique of Quebec, the James Bay.
“It’s ours, it’s our future,” he added after taking a theatrical break to look at the huge map behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec’s territory, includes a part of Labrador that Quebec has always demanded, the prime minister told the press.
“This is a traditional attitude that all governments pursued.
There is a border line at which there has been no agreement for a very long time, and if the opportunity arises I will resume this position on behalf of the government," he said.
“With climate change, we need to rethink our vision of the North,” he said, speaking of the Northwest Passage, which will be accessible throughout the year due to the ice melt.
Against this new geopolitical backdrop, the Prime Minister feels that it is absolutely a duty to occupy this territory.
And the inhabitants of the land, the indigenous people, and the Inuit?
The prime minister said that the government of Quebec would be very cautious with them, and that they would benefit from this project, especially the boys.
Two former ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pekist MP of Ungava) have already initiated discussions with about thirty communities.
A Committee of Ministers led by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Mineral Resources) occupies an important place, has begun the work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large gathering, 'not necessarily a summit', but an opportunity where 'one will create a common vision'.
The development of the North will be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
Plan North will be 'discussed, regulated and environmentally friendly', he promised.
Jean Charest described this “vision” as a continuation of those of the Liberal Prime Ministers who were in office before him.
“Like the Liberals who were in office before us, we have rethought to turn the challenges into new growth and development opportunities.
This was, by the way, one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which was opened on Friday with a large cocktail party to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the takeover of the party leadership by Jean Lesage.
One of the decisions adopted envisages rename the Beauharnois power plant to Adélard-Godbout dam.
“From Godbout, who created Hydro-Quebec, to Lesage, who achieved the silent revolution and the nationalization of water electricity, to Bourassa, who made James Bay, our party always knew how to determine the future,” said Jean Charest.
In front of the press, he referred to another, this time conservative project, namely the program "Roads to the North" by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
With regard to the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydropower dam project, Mr Charest stresses that its commissioning is scheduled for 2012.
"That remains among us, but I intend to be there," he entrusted to his party members, which resulted in those applause storms.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and certainly also in 2009, has in fact not yet ruled out the possibility of holding an election this autumn, which is legally possible for him.
However, he stresses that his schedule is full, mainly because of a mission of the Community Council in China and a summit between Quebec and New York.
The general meeting of the weekend provided the Liberal party leader with a platform of nationalist plans, especially of 'constitutional' goals, which were readily adopted: the PLQ in particular calls for the recognition of the 'particularity of Quebec' in the constitution.
It also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council, and that they have a veto on the decisions made in Quebec.
On the part of the opposition, the guidelines of the Plan North were taken up with skepticism.
The leader of the Parti Québécois, Pauline Marois, has renewed the policy for the development of the Nord-du-Quebec, which was introduced by the Landry government in 2001.
According to her, the Liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, refused to apply it.
If she had done so, "we would have gone much further today," Mrs Marois judged alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election is today) Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ has spoken out to support the government’s adoption of a Plan North.
"But what we want is that this isn't just a big show," said party leader Sébastien Proulx, representing Mario Dumont, who is coming back from vacation today.
Letters - A disgraced country
Mr. Vic Toews, ex-'Justice' minister (which irony) in Harper's cabinet, was the one who allowed himself to say last summer about Louise Arbour that she was a 'shame' for Canada.
This woman, who has waged a never-ending fight for justice and deserves all our admiration to cover with shame, says as much about the people around the prime minister as about Stephen Parker himself.
We are dealing here with a government that is the only one from all the countries concerned who has not brought home their compatriot who was imprisoned in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that doesn’t even take into account that Omar Khadr was still a youth when the things happened that are accusing him.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, breaks its word and vegetates a child soldier in inhumane conditions.
The only one who condescends to a judicial parody to assess the accused's guilt.
Let us remember that especially UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Association of Canadian Lawyers are pleading to bring Omar Khadr home so that he can have a fair trial in Canada.
It is precisely this government that closes its eyes to torture: it is of little interest to them that a young adult, after so many years of torment, will surely be broken forever.
We are not yet aware of this, but we are witnessing an insidious restriction of our rights, our freedom and our 'democracy', this word that Harper constantly carries in front of him like a flag, and that sounds so futile from his mouth.
So the time has come when there is no morality: one can arbitrarily abuse, torture and imprison a Canadian citizen, at the discretion of a head of government who is still only supported by the minority (may he be a minority after October 14th...).
Many voters believe that they can be saved by a party that preaches virtue, law and order, but they do not see that this government has renounced what constituted the reputation and dignity of our country.
The disgrace, Mr. Toews, lies in this abdication, and nowhere else.
Free Opinion - The Orwellian Speech by Barrick Gold
In its September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Deputy General Director of the Canadian Gold Mine Barrick Gold.
This confirms, and follows an Orwellian logic, that the world’s largest gold mining company sought a defamation lawsuit of six million against three authors and a small destitute publishing house, with the aim of opening a ‘public transparent debate’.
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, then they do not judge about the truth, especially not in the case of defamation charges, but about the law.
As expected, this fundamental difference was completely concealed by Mr Garver.
For Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate is to ruin anyone who dares to represent one of their opposite opinions.
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the authors and editors of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums of money to prepare their defense and fight with very unequal weapons against an army of lawyers paid out of the almost inexhaustible pockets of the gold mine.
The tactic in these unequal struggles is, by the way, often to ruin the defenders in order to force an amicable settlement that silences the opposing side and, moreover, deters anyone who dares to deal with the question again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she should have presented her view of things to public opinion.
In contrast to what is commonplace in many of the countries where Barrick Gold works, in Canada debates are usually carried out through the exchange of ideas rather than by batting.
So it would have been enough if the gold mine had exposed its books and files and opened up a real debate through which newspapers, media, publications and the financing of independent audit teams could have shed light on this issue.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to have confidence in public opinion and wipes the petitions and letters in support of the authors of Noir Canada aside with one hand movement.
Could Mr Garver perhaps explain how he can simultaneously ask for a 'public' debate while disregarding the opinions of this public?
Apparently, in the world of the Vice President, this word only encompasses the generously paid lawyers, and not the community of all Canadians; a rather narrow view of the term.
In a democracy, even slanderers have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold doesn’t understand—or doesn’t want to understand—is that the public that supports the authors and editors of Noir Canada does so primarily because they reject the brutal attitude of the gold mine.
This public is willing to listen and judge Barrick, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not in a framework that many perceive as a gag complaint (in the course of the <0x60>public debate', Barrick Gold has just made a demand to the authors of Noir Canada in which she asks them not to use this term anymore...).
Apart from Mr. Garver’s surreal speech, Barrick Gold’s lawsuit is a direct attack on the freedom of academic research and truth-finding that is fundamental to any democratic society.
It completely denies the right to quote credible sources and discuss facts and interpretations that form the basis of intellectual work.
If in a country like Canada it is impossible to explore and discuss topics that the rich companies of the world do not like, who else can do that?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could lead it by following the scientific norms used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has a right to reply.
The university environment to which we belong has long known how to manage debates and disagreements and how to resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold’s disproportionate lawsuit clearly shows that, contrary to what she claims, she has no desire for a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the university world, as well as for the public debate, and it is time for governments to take action to limit these kinds of unjustified lawsuits.
Rescue for Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans Understand
The Bush administration and senior congressmen, Republicans and Democrats alike, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the most extensive economic recovery plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new $700 billion version of the plan to stop the financial crisis that has been shaking Wall Street for months has yet to be adopted by the two chambers of Congress.
The main contents are: better control of MEPs over the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms to secure the repayment of public funds used, new orders to limit the number of houses seized due to arrears, and the right to monitor the salaries paid to the executives of the supported companies.
The U.S. Secretary of Finance Henry Paulson, the President of the Chamber of Deputies Nancy Pelosi, and the representative of Republicans present at the negotiations, Senator Judd Gregg, announced yesterday, a few minutes after midnight, the good news, after a two-day negotiating marathon.
"We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be effective in the market," Bush administration representative Henry Paulson said.
“Everything happened to protect the real economy and the American people from the price crisis on Wall Street,” the Democrat said.
“This is the basic point: if we don’t do that, the trauma, chaos, and unrest in Americans’ daily lives will be enormous,” Republican Judd Gregg said in a statement.
Negotiations had accelerated over the past two hours, fearing the impact a renewed failure would have had on investors’ mood.
The deadline that had been agreed was the market opening this morning.
The two American presidential candidates, who took part in the negotiations late, were more likely to be in favour of the agreement, but did not fail to express their dissatisfaction with the need to meet them in this extreme way.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama insisted on the addition of certain arrangements to the agreement, especially those designed to allow owners to keep their homes, and those relating to the salaries of the executives of the companies rescued by the state.
“If one asks taxpayers to take extraordinary action on account of the irresponsibility of certain persons, it is not something to congratulate.
But these measures are necessary," he said on American television channels.
When asked on another channel whether he will vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent John McCain replied: “I would like to know the details first, but I hope so.
“The guiding principles I’ve read [show] that this is one thing that we all will have to digest, and with which we will be able to move forward.
The option of doing nothing is simply unacceptable," he said.
The $700 billion plan is aimed at using the money of taxpayers
It comes 14 months after a crisis triggered by the bursting of a real estate bubble that initially led to the collapse of high-risk mortgage loans (subprime) before expanding to further forms of more common bonds (PCAAs), and finally to a freezing of financial power and to the ruin of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republican MPs who failed the first attempt to reach an agreement last week.
Since the Democrats have accepted that certain "toxic" assets of the societies in distress should be secured only by the government and not bought, it is believed to escape the deadlock.
To round off the perspectives for everyone in Congress, an order has also been added that if the government loses with this program within five years, it can then levy new taxes in order to recover its invested capital.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of 250 billion, to which another 100 billion can be added if the president considers it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion dollars must be approved by Congress in a renewed vote.
In return for his help, Washington receives shares in the supported companies, which will earn dividends in the event of profits, and which it can resell once the storm has passed.
The Federal Government will have the opportunity to suspend the seizure procedures relating to the dwellings linked to the real estate loans affected by this plan, as well as to set deadlines for repayment and severance payments to the executives of the companies concerned.
The developers of the plan would like the Chamber of Deputies to vote on it today, and the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will get the green light.
In fact, yesterday, more votes were raised against this plan, both on the part of the Republicans and the Democrats.
“Washington obviously doesn’t understand us,” Republican Scott Garett, a member of the chamber’s finance committee, told his voters.
“Yes, we have a big financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one that consists of asking the taxpayers to pay."
Democratic MP Brad Sherman, who heads a group in Congress called “the caucus of skeptics,” portrays things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred distinguished professors of economics, including three Nobel laureates, have written to us to tell us that we are asking Congress not to be put under pressure and to carefully consider what path to take,” he said.
At the same time, we were once again given proof in Europe that this is a global crisis.
At an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> 11.2 billion (US$ 16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it would refrain from buying up its competitor, who is in great difficulty since losing <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2 billion ($2.9 billion) in the crisis due to high-risk real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insurers.
"This is not a lost money," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
To compensate, we get a right to vote and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what the savers and households appreciate now that uncertain times are announcing.”
During this time, on the other side of the English Channel, the British government was just about to nationalize another bank distressed by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take all current loans to Bradford and Bringley Bank, including over 41 billion ($75.5 billion) from real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy the branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank to nationalize the British government since the beginning of this financial crisis, after Northern Rock.
Paul Newman (19252008) - Death of a committed icon
His beauty with the azure eyes has long been his asset, no one would say his weakness.
Did the American actor free himself from the narcissistic mirror with the charming smile?
Yes and no.
His sensitivity, sensitivity and obvious talent have probably also kept him away from a position of power that brings the truly terrible monsters into the world.
But what a great permanent runner!
Paul Newman, who died on Friday at the age of 83 from lung cancer at his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last icons of American cinema in his golden years.
He was less monumental than Brando, to whom he resembled and for whom he was for a long time a kind of rival on the canvas, more careful in his spectacle, certainly also more fragile, but equally an apostle of freedom and the explosion of dramaturgical conventions.
Mixed blood often produces wonderful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, the son of a German Jew and a Hungarian-born mother.
Its European roots were to create one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without excessive ego, utmost quality feature.
Because it reflected an entire country that was in love with the self-made man, the fighter who was wounded in battle in the Pacific War, who studied acting at Yale in the early 1950s and then visited the Actor's Studio in New York before having success in the theatre, on television and soon in the cinema.
This man, who fought for civil rights, was also the driver who finished second in the Mans 24 Hour race in 1979, and also a sex symbol, although he had been in a showcase relationship with actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With him, the unknown facets of this mysterious, reserved, committed and hypersensitive star disappear, whose mysteries will never be solved completely.
A decent man, in the purest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newman put the cinema lovers in turmoil this weekend, as all his major roles were played on the dark screen of memories.
More than half a century of American film art in constant change is passing by with him.
The charming cowboy from "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) comes to mind, and the young man who rejects his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on the Hot Sheet Roof, filmed by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
It evokes a much shorter past memory (1990) of his sensitive Mr. Bridge, who is disturbed at his old age by a wedding that did not fulfil all their promises.
There have been so many other Paul Newmans throughout history.
This criminal, stormy, violent and unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano from Somebody Up There Likes Me by Robert Wise, a role that was intended for James Dean, who was resumed after his death and made Newman well known in 1956.
This sympathetic crook in the outstanding The Sting, which was awarded the Oscar for Best Film in 1973.
As a bitter and vengeful billiard player in the wonderful The Hustler by Robert Rossen (1961),
This face through the times, that was it.
Still him.
In his resume, epochs unite.
He is best known for his cult film Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, the less orthodox coach of an ice hockey team.
His fans found him again in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers.
A final role in 2003 as the godfather of the Irish mafia in Road to Perdition by Sam Mendes closed the circle.
Unlike several cinema legends who retired early enough from the film world, Newman was to stay in the saddle for a long time, betraying Hollywood, his fortune, his pomp and his concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without humour, as a living challenge to the ‘underplaying’ when he judged his overly expressive achievements.
The profession was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the roles flew for a long time.
However, he rarely played Sunnyboys as outsiders: neurotic, alcoholic, nasty or desperate, with the perfect representation of which he reflected his slipping and his rebellion.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown sides of his true sensitivity.
His 1968 Rachel, based on the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, drew a subtle portrait of a woman full of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott due to an overdose, dedicated his 1984 film Harry and Son, a work full of delicacy and sadness.
In the flood of honors that poured on Newman yesterday, his close friend and former weapons companion Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said: 'His presence has improved my life and this country.'
Generosity and joy of life were essential characteristics of the deceased actor.
Aside from his legendary career, a great advocate of civil rights, environmental protection and independent cinema, an opponent of Hollywood’s drifting away, is now going down.
We have probably seen him standing with his foot in bowls full of vinaigrette, in sauces, pastries or other foods, and thought this was quite tasteless, although we found it fun at first.
The profits from his sales nevertheless flowed into his foundation for children in need.
Instead of resting on his myth, Newman committed himself to the shot.
He left a letter to his five daughters with these phrases: <0x60>Always and until the very end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was an honor to be here.”
And for us, it was an honor to follow the life of such an intelligent and generous American actor.
An exemplary citizen, in the narrowest and broadest sense.
What was produced in the invoice factory of Supplement Co.?
On 8 October, negotiations will begin in the criminal trial against Jáno’s surplus and his accomplices.
The defendants are accused in particular of involvement in organised crime, as well as grossly negligent damage and business fraud, and other criminal acts - including forgery of documents.
According to the prosecutor’s office, the funds gained from the tenders were used for their own purposes, while the services rendered were often documented with counterfeit invoices.
State funds and grants from the self-government - a total of HUF 65 million - are said to have flowed partly into the funds of the organization Fiatal Baloldal, partly into the private funds of individual.
As the investigative authorities announced, fictitious invoices were submitted when the tender money was received, and the clubs were also said to have failed to fulfil their obligations.
According to the indictment, most of the bills were counterfeited.
The invoice blocks were bought at the market of Józsefváros, the round seals were made in Kiskunhalas.
The decision on which companies to issue the invoices was decided on that round trip north of Lake Balaton, to which István Lados was sent by János.
In the course of this "exploring tour" Lados should find guesthouses and restaurants.
He demanded bills on consumption in order to later issue bills based on these templates for the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social and Labour, and the self-government of Budapest.
These bills are said to have been mostly manipulated by István Lados and his accomplice, András <0xC5><0x90>ri, the latter, according to our information, being responsible for drafting the relevant reports.
One of the destinations of Lados' "Exploration Tour" was a beer bar.
As can be seen from two invoices issued by Zuschlag and Co in 2003, the catering company is said to have hosted the 90-member group of the association Biztos Pont Egyesület.
Now, however, the head of the company states that such a large group would not fit into the restaurant at once.
Another invoice, issued in the summer of 2002 to the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért Foundation, later known as Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, also showed serious errors in form and content.
A guesthouse in Badacsonytomaj, which has only three rooms and can accommodate no more than ten people at the same time, is said to have stayed 130 guests.
The imagination of the counterfeiters apparently had no limits when it came to Pigal Kft., a catering company, in whose accounting documents of the customers Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért and Hoppá do not even appear according to the prosecution.
As Managing Director Gy<0xC5><0x91>z<0xC5><0x91> Farkas told hvg.hu, he was immediately aware that these were fake documents when documents were presented to him by the public prosecutor during an interrogation.
"Our company name and tax number were incorrectly affixed to the stamp".
And further: apart from form defects, the fact that the company is said to have accommodated one hundred people was also wrong, after having a total of eleven rooms that could not accommodate so many people.
Food was also mentioned on the bill, but the restaurant has not been in operation for a long time.
The current counterfeiters also failed to verify that the Budapest travel agency targeted by them exclusively offers travel abroad, and so they indicated Hungarian travel on the cash invoice, which was also contrary to the company’s accounting practice.
As it became known in the course of the investigation, they also mentioned VAT on the invoices, although travel agency services relating to a country outside the EU are VAT-free.
The total amount of VAT was incorrect on four invoices issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. to the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért Foundation, since the company only charges 15 percent VAT instead of 25. In addition, only machine invoices are issued by the employees, but the counterfeit documents were handwritten.
Another mistake that the "invoicing brokers" had made was that in one case they had declared "goods transport" as service rendered, although this is not offered by the firm specializing in investment consulting, the prosecutor's office said.
Other formal errors - wrong invoice format, wrong stamp - were due to the fact that the invoices issued to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, as well as to XXI Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont could be exposed as counterfeits.
Similarly, in the case of Ravenna Bt. and the Kunfehértó sports camp, whose managers claimed that they had never issued the invoices.
Another "error" was committed by the counterfeiters at HIB Kft. from Nyíregyháza: this company was in dissolution at the time (2001), when the group of the Fiatal Városért Egyesület was supposed to have eaten there - the mass manager therefore stated that the invoices were not issued by himself.
Consciously Falsified
The other group of accountants are individuals who were well aware that they would have to make fictitious invoices.
At the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, the Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation has issued invoices for the Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Foundation, amounting to approximately HUF 4 million.
According to the indictment, the managing director of Collab Kft. was persuaded by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, to issue the fictitious invoices.
Biogate Kft., which is currently also in liquidation, is also said to have cooperated with Zuschlag und Co.: In 2003, the GmbH is said to have provided the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért Alapítvány Foundation, as well as the associations Atlasz Egyesület and Vörösfeny<0xC5><0x91> Egyesület with counterfeit invoices in the total value of HUF 5 million.
However, there was just as little payment traffic as the invoices were cancelled immediately after their issuance, which the persons concerned have forgotten to note in their documents.
The third group of accountants includes persons directly associated with the defendants.
One of them is Iván Kubatov, the postman of the Ukrainian managing director of Delta Trió Kft., a fuel and vehicle trading company based in Budapest that cannot be found there.
The company is said to have issued several invoices for the sale of computer components for a total value of HUF 18 million between October and December 2005.
According to the investigating authority, Cash Investment Kft. from Kiskunhalas, which has been in liquidation since 14 September 2005, is said to have acted as the buyer of these invoices.
Managing director of this company was a Romanian, to whom the company documents were also to be delivered by Iván Kubatov, between 2002 and 2005.
According to our information, during the investigation, Kubatov admitted to having issued invoices on behalf of the company to the Atlasz and Hoppá associations, as well as to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and to having cashed their equivalents himself.
The firms Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. are said to have been founded by Romanian masons at Iván Kubatov’s express request.
However, in truth, none of these companies were active, which according to the defendant was due to a lack of orders.
Nevertheless, he was able to benefit from the companies: at the request of his accomplice, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who was commissioned with the preparation of the company’s founding documents, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to the associations associated with the contract, such as Atlasz and Y-Generáció.
In total, Kubatov is said to have issued 15 invoices totalling HUF 14.2 million on behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade to the organizations.
The prosecutor's office assumes that Kubatov could have collected 10% of the invoice amount as well as VAT.
Kubatov is even said to have abused the company Szi-Beri Bt. for issuing fictional invoices - in this case, the invoices were included in the applications of Biztos Pont.
The company Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért submitted their applications to the non-profit organization of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány ("TMA") in January 2006.
Both received 500,000 forints each, but used these amounts inappropriately.
To cover up this, they submitted five fictitious invoices of the Works Team Kft. to the TMA.
By the way, these invoices were seized during the search of the office of <0xC3><0x81>rpád Kemecsei in the Ministry of Education.
In the negotiations, some defendants are now expecting a confession about the procedure of counterfeiting of the invoices, as they were already filed before the prosecutor’s office.
It could be a sensation if the main defendant, János, decides to make a comprehensive confession.
His previous statements were less detailed, and although he had already pledged several times to report extensively on everything, his confession is still pending.
The question remains, therefore, whether this is in his interest, whether the Socialists have entered into a pact with him regarding the reparation of the majority of the damage of HUF 50 million, and whether surcharge is willing to take responsibility in return.
However, it is quite possible that Supplement now plays the "insulted" after his requests for mitigation of the detention and house arrest had come across deaf ears.
While other criminals, who have done far greater damage with economic offences and have not remunerated them, are free, or at least under house arrest, surcharge remains this possibility denied.
The Psychology of Overbidding - or Why We're Ready to Pay More
In auctions, buyers tend to spend more and thus overvalue the filed.
Neurologists and economic researchers at the University of New York have now succeeded in discovering the neurological-economic foundations of this well-known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to a study published in "Science" magazine, people do not want to give up in a competition, such as an auction on eBay, and are therefore willing to pay even excessive prices.
The researchers have tried to explore the neurological scheme of this "game" with experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers was to play the lottery while the other took part in a playful action - in both cases, the subjects' active brain regions were examined using functional magnetic resonance (fMRI).
In both games, participants were able to win money, but increased activity of the striatum, a complex below the cerebral cortex, was measured in losers at the auction, where overbidding the opponent plays an essential role.
Among many other functions, this brain region is responsible for the “self-rewarding” of the nervous system.
The researchers therefore believed that the price increase could be explained by avoiding an overreaction of the striatum.
To substantiate their thesis, the economists in the research group have additionally carried out research to track the money.
In this case, three groups should bid against one partner under different conditions.
The control group was informed of the true value of the product, after which they made their deployments.
Another group was also promised a $15 reward in case they emerged as winners of the game.
The third group received $15 before the auction, which were also lost in the event of a losing game.
So the difference between the two groups was simply that the emphasis was on winning while the other was on losing.
As proof of the hypothesis expressed by neurologists, however, the members of the "against losing" group were ready for higher stakes than those in the control or "win" group.
“These findings cannot be derived from any previous economic theory.
These have justified the behaviors observed at auctions so far only with the joy of winning or risk avoidance.
The contradiction between these two theories was resolved thanks to imaging neurological procedures, so we now have a third explanation ready," said Andrew Schotter, professor of economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When to see the doctor?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is listed among the leading causes of death.
The number of infected people is estimated to be one hundred thousand in this country, but only seven thousand are treated, which is due to the fact that patients often do not know that they are infected.
Hepatitis is the collective term for infectious liver disease caused by various viruses.
Symptoms are often similar - liver inflammation and jaundice are common, but the pathogens and diseases differ from each other.
Depending on the pathogen, the hepatitis viruses spread in two different ways: in hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (for example, through contaminated food or water), in hepatitis B, C and D, the viruses can be transmitted through blood and other body fluids (such as sperm, vaginal secretion or saliva).
Travellers are recommended to be vaccinated against viruses A and B, because there is no vaccine against virus C.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear about two-three weeks after eating the contaminated food and are generally accompanied by discomfort, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After that, the jaundice occurs on the skin and in the eyes, the stool becomes light, the urine dark, and the recovery can last up to two-three weeks.
Worldwide, about 1 million people die each year from the far more serious diseases caused by hepatitis B, such as liver cancer and cirrhosis.
The main reason for this is that, according to estimates, only one in ten people infected is in drug treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: untreated, it can lead to liver cirrhosis and liver cancer.
Most infected people do not even know about their disease, because the pathogen insidiously destroys the liver cells - in many cases, the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years.
Therefore, timely prevention, such as regular check-ups, is essential.
There are three groups in which this disease is more common: those who underwent a blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts, and tattoos.
Currently, the number of chronic hepatitis C patients worldwide is estimated at 200 million.
Since the disease can already be detected in a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to visit the general practitioner at the first signs of unknown origin.
Detected in time, the disease can be cured, the virus can be eradicated, thereby eliminating the risk of infection and preventing the development of cancer.
September 30th is the World Day of Hepatitis, held in 2004 for the first time by patient representations worldwide.
The aim of the action is to increase awareness of this chronic liver inflammation caused by viruses, its development and the importance of early detection.
Do believers have less pain?
Recent research shows that religious faith acts like a kind of “pain remedy” that is said to have already facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University have conducted an interesting experiment: it has been investigated to what extent faith in God affects man's sense of pain, the British newspaper "Telegraph" reported.
In the course of the rather bizarre investigation, 12 believers and atheists each received electric shocks while studying a painting of the Mother of God.
As the results showed, the believers were able to eliminate the majority of the pain.
Using brain scan technology, it was even possible to prove that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for pain regulation.
The study was the first in a research project in which, in addition to scientists, philosophers and theologians from various departments of the university participate.
During the experiment, a sparkling device was attached to the left hand, which gave off the electric shocks.
Participants were asked to focus heavily on two paintings: on the one hand a picture of the Mother of God, painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and on the other Leonardo da Vinci's "Lady with the Hermine".
The researchers hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary would evoke a kind of religious trance among the faithful while choosing da Vinci’s painting, as it was hardly different from other paintings and felt reassuring.
The subjects spent half an hour each in an MRI scanner and received a total of 20 electric shocks in four stages during that time, while they were supposed to look at either the religious or the other painting.
The Catholics reported that they felt “safe” at the sight of the Mother of God, as if they were “cared for,” and they felt “calm and peace.”
While viewing the religious painting, they reported 12% less pain than if they had Leonardo’s work in mind.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the experiment, said that you could produce similar effects with other, strong-acting images also among the atheists, you would only have to find the corresponding photo.
"We would have to find a picture that triggers very positive sensations, such as a mother or a father," the psychologist said.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
"Practicing the faith should change our personality, and it does so in many cases," said Wright.
After these excellent results, there remains only the question of what effect a Madonna image of Leonardo or another comparable painter would have on the pain regulation of the faithful.
Would the high-quality Virgin Mary achieve even better results?
You are what you share about yourself
On the occasion of her tenth birthday, Google can rightly say: she is in people’s pockets as well as above their heads in the sky: she knows where people have spent their holidays, which specialists they go to, and what moves her.
And that’s still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of Google’s CEOs.
Towards skeptics who are plagued by Orwell’s horror visions, he points out: These would just overlook the essentials of Web 2.0.
In an interview with the Financial Times recently, Schmidt said Google's main goal was to collect even more personal data about users and thus get closer to the company's original goal of "ordering all the information in the world."
Schmidt said Google was still at the beginning of gathering information after ten years of world-changing work.
Asked about the status quo in five years, Schmidt said he wished Google would be able to answer questions like "What should I do tomorrow?" or "What job really suits me?", but software programs were not yet able to do so, as they didn't know enough about the users.
Not all Internet users are aware that in the course of their Internet research the search terms would be registered, as well as the IP addresses from which they were searched and the pages visited.
For example, the "Personalized Search" introduced two years ago allows the visitor to save their own search history and later access it, so that the hits can be generated much more precisely later, and the same logic is also based on the so-called "recommendations", with which the system recommends customized products and services based on the previous preferences.
However, users wonder what happens in the event of a data abuse - "If you look at what I do" - some are concerned about the Google data monopoly.
In most cases, however, it is rather the potential power represented by the company that is frightening, and less the sense of guilt or fear of punishment, the pursuit of freedom, or the revolt against power that is encountered by many Internet users.
However, it is a proven fact that the search terms are not only stored, but also passed on to third parties, and in these cases there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user.
A prime example of this was recently the action against pedophilia in Brazil, in the course of which Google provided the Brazilian government with information collected by the community site called "Orkut" and also enabled identification of the pedophiles.
Users concerned about personal rights could still breathe up in May, when Google together with the civil rights organization EFF successfully pulled against the FBI in court: accordingly, Google cannot be forced in the future with any point of the Constitution to release information to the FBI on secret request.
(However, the Federal Government has successfully obtained the publication of 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms with reference to the Jugendschutzgesetz passed years ago, but it was denied the list of individual users, or their web and search term list, for two months retroactively.)
Google’s image thus remains controversial: those who are reluctant to release their personal data because they fear the loss of their privacy and intimacy by using the Google services are scourging the company with the indignation due to the companies acting conservatively.
Meanwhile, the American "geek culture" that is present in many countries, uniting enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users, sees the next generation of "cool entrepreneurs" in them, unlike Microsoft, which is market leader thanks to Windows, even though both are struggling for the same goal.
One possible reason for this is that, unlike Microsoft, Google does not require identification codes from its users and provides its services for free, so that an open, constantly updated source code and program package appears to be far more attractive, youthful, and cooler than the official practices of the software giant.
On the other hand, the geeks see through the problematic relationship between personal rights and the Internet in a razor-sharp way - a relationship that has become the focus of attention especially in recent years thanks to the term "Web 2.0".
"Web 2.0" is all about collaboration, that is, users deliberately leave traces and use the available communication channels, and even if the dimensions are individually different, the main thing remains the same, namely to show themselves publicly.
An average teenager can manage their profile on multiple community portals at the same time - from Facebook through Xanga, connecting them through other services such as Twitter, or music services such as last.fm, and eventually integrating all of these into a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. In addition, they can run blogs that automatically display the latest photo galleries that are geosted on Flickr or Picasa.
And a number of other exemplary cases prove it: when looking at last night’s party photos, the girlfriend soon finds out who her unfaithful friend was having fun with, or the employee is fired because he is all too honest about his anger at corporate management in his blog - one thing is certain: The term “privacy” has now been completely reinterpreted.
Who leads an online life is what he reveals about himself - so you could formulate the basic idea behind the behavior of today's youth.
And anyone who tries to keep something secret, or even to circumvent the Google monopoly, can gladly do so – such as with Scroogle, a tool that accesses Google’s search engine, but deliberately leaves no trace.
Many people do not intentionally register on community pages so that they are not findable, but Google’s online applications, such as word processing and graphical tools and RSS feeds, can also be handled with alternative versions that are not tied to huge server parks and therefore do not generate the best possible profile from the user.
Public opinion is waiting for Google to show its true face.
With its current value of USD 156 billion, the company is even ahead of IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising space threatens the revenue of advertising agencies, and the increasingly rapidly launched services are causing headaches not only to Microsoft, but also to other software developers.
Critical viewers, however, also find the disturbing counterpoles: For example, the corporate management has completely rejected a protest of the employees after the fees of the company's kindergarten were doubled, in addition, the management said that the multiple meals of the employees was too expensive. But all this seems to be quite mild against the regime, that Google was in 2006 before the Chinese government even to the knees and won the good agreement.
The Group's internal regulation is that no new service will be advertised in advance, but only if it is already available. Nevertheless, the events of the coming months and years could turn a lot: While some believe that Google's book and magazine scanning and archiving project meanwhile assumes that the company will soon have to deal with the Supreme Court, the creation of a completely
And the fact that Google is building a genetic database is already providing the next generation of sci-fi authors with the substance - for example, "Scroogled," the famous novel by Cory Doctorow describes in the best Orwellian way a future in which a person becomes terribly approachable thanks to Google-related data.
Two teenagers help the double killer of <0xC3><0x93>zd in the removal of traces
In connection with the double murder of <0xC3><0x93>zd, the police have now interrogated two young people suspected of helping to remove the traces, the spokesman of the Borsod police commissioner said on Tuesday.
The young people were confessed, they are currently charged with the aid.
According to information from the MTI news agency, these are two girls who are defending themselves freely.
Aid is threatened with imprisonment of up to five years.
The suspect of the double murder of <0xC3><0x93>zd, a 23-year-old local man, was taken into custody on Sunday.
The man is under urgent suspicion of deliberately murdering several people out of greed for money.
In the course of the investigation, it turned out that the 23-year-old owed a 53-year-old a larger amount of money.
The suspect, however, did not want to settle his debts, so he lured his creditor to a site in <0xC3><0x93>zd last Wednesday, where he murdered him and his nine-year-old daughter.
According to the MTI, the man has planned the act by a long hand - this is also evidenced by the fact that he committed the murders with a gun hidden at the scene of the crime.
Together with experts, the police are now investigating the crime weapon and the circumstances of its use.
Warsaw Stock Exchange Offers Purchase of Prague Stock Exchange
Around 200 million euros, or 5 billion Czech kroner, was offered by the Warsaw Stock Exchange for the 100% purchase of the share packages of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, reaffirmed the offer made by the Poles despite the fact that they were formerly excluded by the Czechs as potential owners of their stock exchange.
The reason for this is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange belongs entirely to the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which intends to sell more than 60% of the securities in the coming months.
According to reports from the Czech daily "E15", the offer of the Poles contains the highest purchase price ever offered for the Prague Stock Exchange.
As the newspaper reports, so far the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have made offers.
Petr Koblic, head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that of all prospects, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would probably be the worst new owner, and he did not rule out that this could even lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at 5-10 billion kroner.
According to the shareholders agreement, 90% of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance Investment Bank with a 25% stake, followed by Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the perspective of European newspapers
In their comments on the ever-aggravating international financial crisis, some leading European newspapers on Tuesday already spoke of "September 11".
We owe the global financial disaster to the American president, said La Repubblica - the president was not even able to put his own party behind him for the bill, which should bring some relief to the frightening situation...
Instead of a “new Pearl Harbor,” as billionaire investor Warren Buffett called it, it would be more appropriate to speak of a “September 2/11.”
Parts of the press in Madrid also locate the scapegoat in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of political leadership is to blame for the fact that the global economy is now on the verge of collapse.
The American financial system is increasingly at risk of collapse, and the whole world will suffer from it.
Bush’s plan was not perfect, but now, after the vote in Congress, there is a danger that Washington has no political means of crisis management.
The world economy is hanging in the air, just at a time when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
One can no longer ignore the threat, says the Geneva-based "Tages-Anzeiger".
Still, some states could provide bailouts to their banks and save the banks from bankruptcy with the money of taxpayers.
However, if a domino effect is triggered and more banks go bankrupt, then neither further financial injections nor other immediate measures will help.
In the long run, EU member states would have to jump over their shadow and centralize control over the money markets.
On Monday alone, more than EUR 100 billion was paid out to weakening financial institutions, the Viennese "Der Standard" recalls. Furthermore, the newspaper continues, the concerns are becoming more and more realistic that after the Americans now also the European taxpayers would have to take a bit deeper into their pockets to get out of the crisis.
So far, the EU has not dealt seriously with the crisis that is now sweeping over the old continents like a tsunami.
Although the “savers” would not have to immediately “wave” with several hundred billion euros, it would be advisable to note, in which case it would be reasonable to touch the money of the taxpayers in order to avert even greater damage.
Intelligent car imitates the flight of the bumblebee
What would be the best way to develop new technologies for accident prevention, if not to imitate the obstacle sensors from nature?
For example, the bees.
At CEATEC in Japan, an amazing project was presented, in which Nissan engineers were inspired by bumblebees in creating new accident prevention systems.
In collaboration with Tokyo University, Nissan has built the BR23C auto-robot-controlled biomimetic system, a mini car equipped with the characteristics of bees, with the aim of supporting the development of a system that avoids any collisions.
In flight, each bee forms its own oval "private area," which is very similar to our own "protection shield," Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for technology PR and research development, said at the exhibition.
The composite eye of the bee, which can see in any direction and at an angle of over 300 degrees, plays an important role in this.
To mimic the function of the composite eye, the researchers took up the idea of the laser-controlled rangefinder.
It identifies obstacles in front of the BR23C in a 180-degree field of view within 2 meters, calculates their distances and sends signals to the microprocessor on board, which immediately initiates the collision-avoiding process.
The obstacle is recorded in fractions of a second, and the car robot immediately changes course, similar to the movement of the bees, by turning the tires at the corresponding angle.
In contrast to previous systems, this maneuver takes place purely instinctively.
"If it wasn't, the car robot wouldn't be able to respond fast enough to avoid the obstacles," said Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the car robot project.
The system must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the innermost and most vulnerable part of the shield - a layer within which accidents are currently considered unavoidable.
The whole process must reflect the behavior of bees when they avoid other bees.
And that has to happen in a fraction of a second.
However, in contrast to the bees, the deflection cannot take place up, down, or even diagonally - it can only be two-dimensional, and only in the direction of the maneuverability of the tires.
While there are endless possibilities for the bees to avoid other bees, the researchers could only use the rotational movement, or acceleration and deceleration, in the car robot.
The BR23C contains lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and more energy efficient, and therefore have a longer lifespan than conventional lithium-ion batteries.
Andoh explained that it depends on the instinctive, intelligent response, and less on the processing of the data, and even less on the ability to store it.
This device only needs to process a few inputs per second and respond to them accordingly.
It does not have to store them, or use previous maneuvers to produce an intuitive, logical response, so that it continuously uses only a handful of KB memory.
It does not require gigabyte and megabyte-heavy memories.
This is the first step in the development of the instant collision prevention technology, which Nissan estimates will be in production as standard within the next ten years.
Another application the technology could find in GPS satellite navigation by consciously steering the driver around obstacles and thus guiding him to his destination.
A name for the sinful child
Now the written version of the $700 billion bailout package law is available, which will be applied in several stages and aimed at buying the banks’ bad credit.
In the first round, half of the money should be spent.
In a meeting ended Saturday after midnight local time East Coast, congressmen reached an agreement on the $700 billion bailout after several days of debate, Reuters reported.
"We have made substantial progress," Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic president of the US House of Representatives, said, saying that the agreement had only to be put on paper.
The compromise reached on the bailout package was supported by both presidential candidates – Barack Obama and John McCain.
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said the program will be effective and efficient, but we need to do more. According to Pelosi, this is not about saving Wall Street, but about tearing the helm of the economy.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets, i.e., Washington time Sunday evening 8 a.m. (Central European time Monday 2 a.m.), but did not trigger a high on the stock markets.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will first vote on the 2008 bill to stabilize the economy, then it will be the Senate's turn.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday evening, and the White House also welcomed the news of the agreement.
We are pleased with the progress made that night and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our markets and protect our economy, said White House spokesman Tony Fratto.
The program, however, deviates from the Bush administration’s original recommendation that the $700 billion should be spent at once on the purchase of lazy, credited securities.
In a first tranche, a maximum of half of the $700 billion amount will be spent, with $250 billion immediately available after Congress is expected to vote on the cause on Monday. This sum will be spent on the purchase of credit-loaded, bad securities, and the other $100 billion will be decided by the president.
The program is reviewed by its own commission, which also includes the president of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the $700 billion will depend on another congressional decision.
Under the law, the Treasury Department can also apply a combined tactic: it can simultaneously purchase bad loans, mortgages, and mortgage-laden securities, or other "toxic" loans.
As officials of the Ministry reported, the purchase can be done both in an auction and directly.
The law allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance program in which the Treasury guarantees the worrying funds and the companies pay the fees corresponding to the expected damage.
Henry Paulsen said: The law defines the necessary funds in such a way that up to $700 billion can be provided as emergency aid to the American financial system, whether for the large-scale purchase of bad funds, their insurance, or the avoidance of systemic risk triggered by the collapse of a larger financial institution.
We are taking the necessary steps to be ready to introduce the law once it has been signed, Paulson said.
The bosses of the banks in trouble and now relying on state aid can, however, expect their clearances, which in the overseas slang are called "Golden Handshake", to be shortened by the government.
There will be salaries cuts only in certain cases, and these cuts will depend on how the Treasury Department helps.
The cut essentially means that if the ministry purchases as part of an auction, the "Golden Handshake" will be taxed, unless the outdated banking chief is deported to the pension.
In the event of a direct purchase of the lazy loans, the government will aggressively intervene to ensure that manager salaries are not overstated.
The picture also includes that the existing Golden Handshake contracts will not be changed - the restrictions only apply to new agreements so that more people participate in the program.
This is the first case in American history that cuts in managerial salaries are regulated by law, Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the Finance Committee, commented on the measure.
The state gains equity rights in the participating banks, so that the risk for taxpayers decreases, since they can also participate as soon as the economy and thus also the rescued bank gets better.
The bill requires the president to submit a proposal to Congress over the next five years on how taxpayers should recover their lost money from the financial sector.
However, there were skeptics on both sides who expressed their doubts about the plan.
That’s not what American citizens expect from us, the plan does not protect the money of taxpayers at all, according to California Republican Darrell Issa.
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, said the measures were driven by the same people who are also responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continue to rise
Like the Central Statistical Office, domestic sales prices rose by 0.1 percent in August 2008 compared to the previous month, and by 12.9 percent compared to August 2007.
Export prices were 1.1 per cent higher than in July 2008 and decreased by 3.9 per cent compared to the previous year.
Due to domestic price changes and the export sector, production prices were 0.7% higher than in the previous month, and 3.2 percent higher than in 2007.
Domestic sales prices rose only slightly compared to the previous month, i.e. by 0.1 percent.
The sales prices of the manufacturing industry also rose only slightly - 0.1 percent - since July.
The biggest price increase in August 2008 was in leather goods (2.8 percent) - primarily in bags and belts - the increase was 4.6 percent, in shoes prices went up by 2.5 percent.
Higher prices for plastics and chemical raw materials pushed prices for chemicals and production up considerably (1.6 percent).
Price declines were recorded in crude oil processing (1.4 percent), electrical and technical equipment (0.9 percent) and timber processing (0.1 percent).
Prices in papermaking, publishing and printing remained unchanged.
In other branches of the manufacturing industry, a price increase of between 0.2 and 0.9 percent was measured.
In the important domestic sales markets of the industry, such as the electricity, gas, steam and water supply, prices rose by 0.3 percent in August, primarily as a result of the price increase in gas introduced on 1 July.
If you look at the domestic sales markets of the manufacturing industry year-on-year, prices in crude oil processing have risen the most (32.4 percent).
In the metal processing sector, a 13.2% increase was observed, while the increase in the production of food, beverages, and tobacco was 11 percent.
Price declines were observed in the textile industry (2.5 percent) and in electrical and technical equipment (0.3 percent).
The extent of inflation in the other manufacturing industries was between 0.6 and 9.1 percent.
Overall, prices in the manufacturing industry climbed by 10.2 percent last year.
Electricity, gas, steam and water prices rose by 18.7 percent year-on-year.
On the domestic sales market, the highest price increase was recorded in the asset sector in August (0.7 percent).
In the consumer goods manufacturing sectors, prices rose by 0.3 percent, while in the energy and processing sectors they remained the same compared to the previous month.
The largest price increase in August 2008 was observed in the energy and reuse sectors (16.8 percent) compared to the same period in 2007.
In the consumer goods manufacturing sectors, a price increase of 6.8 percent was observed, while in the asset sector, a price decrease of 1.4 percent was observed.
Industry export prices measured in Forint rose by 1.1 percent in August compared to the previous month, but declined by 3.9 percent year-on-year.
The domestic currency was weakened by 1.7 percent against the euro, by 7.1 percent against the dollar, and compared to August 2007, it was stronger by 7.5 percent against the euro, and even 15.9 percent against the dollar.
No more visas to the United States from 2009?
Kinga Göncz sees good chances for the U.S.-Hungarian visa agreement to come into force around January 12, the foreign minister told representatives of the Hungarian community in Chicago.
In her view, “it all depends now only on whether the electronic immigration or control system overseas will be introduced in time.”
However, she also stressed that there will be no entry permit in the new system, but tourists would have to register in advance.
The head of the Hungarian diplomacy is conducting negotiations in Washington from today.
She meets Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who will hand her the "Middle Cross of Merit with Star" of the Republic of Hungary, and she also holds talks with the foreign policy advisers of Democrat Barack Obama and Republican presidential candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain back bank bailouts
Barack Obama and John McCain, the two presidential candidates of the major U.S. parties, pledged on Sunday their support for the $700 billion bailout package for banks, but there are politicians calling for the resignation of the Treasury Secretary.
After days of marathon consultations on Sunday morning, Congress and government officials announced that they had reached an agreement on the banking rescue package.
The Wall Street crisis, as well as the thawing of the frozen credit market, became the central issues of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain – both claim to be better suited than their respective opponents to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to recent polls, Obama was able to further expand his lead thanks to economic issues, while McCain’s high, which gave him the presentation of Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin after the Republican Convention, has also melted away.
At a campaign event in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hopes that Congress will quickly adopt the $700 billion package law.
He stressed that the plan also includes those passages of consumer protection that he has supported.
"We must act now, and act responsibly (...) - your jobs, your savings, whole industries, and the stability of the economy as a whole are under threat," he said in front of 35,000 viewers.
He has not failed to describe McCain’s economic visions as “obsolete.”
In an interview given to ABC, McCain said: “We’re all going to have a hard time pining it... but not doing is definitely not an alternative.”
The Republican senator said the plan also prescribes the establishment of a control commission for the Treasury Secretary, as well as the restriction of clearances for top managers — something he insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain did not play a definite role in the negotiations, whereas he, Obama, was in contact with the minister.
On Sunday, the House of Representatives spokeswoman, Nancy Pelosi, announced that the House of Representatives will probably vote on the bill as early as Monday.
Press review of the German-speaking region
The right-wing camp is intact, only the voters within the camp became more confident - so commented "Der Spiegel" on the weak performance of the CSU in Bavaria.
In Austria, Haider and Co are ready to rule to prevent a red-black coalition.
The Mirror (Spiegel.de)
In the online issue of the left-wing German news magazine, Franz Walter analyzes the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article "Bayern's Revolution exterminates its fathers".
According to the renowned political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took over.
The Christian Socialists have renewed Bavaria for decades - now the modern citizens are turning away from them.
The breaking of the epoch is at the same time a problem of Christian democracy, as is also the case for Angela Merkel.
Surprisingly, the disaster of the CSU did not come, but something ended on Sunday, which, however, was already emerging quite exactly ten years ago: the undoubted hegemony of a state party.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU reached 47.7 percent, falling below the 50 percent mark for the first time since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, i.e. still in the much cited Stoiber era.
Finally, the modernization carried out consistently by the CSU in the federal state has destroyed their own mothers and fathers.
Sociologists had already predicted this 40 years ago, but at the same time significantly misjudged the pace. But the secularization, the educational successes, the influx of East and North Germans into the prosperous regions of Bavaria on the loyalty of the CSU voters could not remain without effect.
Modernization is always accompanied by an increase in options, and this has political consequences.
The right camp is intact - only the voters within the camp became more critical and idiosyncratic.
It is striking that in the last few weeks almost the classical citizen groups expressed the greatest distance from the CSU: the free professions, the commercial bourgeoisie and voters with a high school diploma as well as a university degree.
Here, the support of the CSU dropped to even less than 40 percent.
The Press (diepresse.com)
The conservative Wiener Tageszeitung reports in its "Who with whom? party leaders reticently in coalition issues" titled article on the chaotic domestic political situation in Austria after the new elections.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to negotiate with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The <0xC3><0x96>VP prohibits the interference of the SP<0xC3><0x96> in internal affairs.
The BZ<0xC3><0x96> is open to talks in all directions, while the Greens do not yet want to commit to a coalition.
The new elections are over, and now it’s all about the coalition; in the debates on public television, the party leaders barely let their cards look.
SP<0xC3><0x96> leader Werner Faymann reaffirmed his desire to negotiate with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is very possible - this is already the case in some federal states and in the social partnership.
The question of whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current <0xC3><0x96>VP-Chef as Vice-Chancellor, left Faymann open.
As he said, the voters had rejected the bowl-torter course.
A repetition of this direction would not be possible.
Molterer has, however, reacted cautiously to red offers.
The cooperation cannot be fruitful, he said, if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal concerns of the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
Whether his party is going into opposition or into the coalition is currently completely open, and these questions should be discussed internally by the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
BZ<0xC3><0x96> CEO Jörg Haider showed himself open in all directions.
"To prevent red-black, we are ready to take governmental responsibility," Haider said.
Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, the European Summit on Equal Opportunities started in Paris, hosted this year by France, the EU Presidency of the Council.
In her address to the plenary, Fidesz Member of the European People’s Party, Lívia Járóka, called attention to the education segregation, which is one of the most serious violations of the law that Roma children face, and the biggest obstacle to their need for validity.
The high-level conference was opened by French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, Xavier Bertrand, on behalf of the French Presidency, and Vladimir Spidla, EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among the participants were representatives of governments, the European social partners, as well as the most important European legal protection and civil society organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the MEPs of Fidesz, Járóka has pointed out that, in addition to discrimination in job search, Roma will be displaced from the labour market primarily because of their low level of education.
"The vast majority of Roma youth do not have secondary education and, thanks to poor primary education, only a small proportion of them can achieve a higher education degree."
Járóka also stressed that education is a fundamental human right, which would play a key role in enforcing other human rights.
Investing in the early education of Roma children can strengthen the economy of EU member states.
MEPs believe it is important that the widest possible circle of people - Roma and non-Roma - should be aware of this.
The sooner a Roma student starts school, the more their chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market increase; and through income and sales tax they make their contribution to national spending.
"As citizens of the Union, Roma must be guaranteed the right to a high-quality education - poor and segregated education must be stopped," says Lívia Járóka.
MEPs have stated that a common, targeted and action-oriented approach by the European Union is necessary to accelerate the process of desegregation in the education sector, which requires proper compliance with the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives.
“We need to break the vicious cycle of poverty, segregation and unemployment and give Roma children the democratic opportunities to contribute to the future of Europe as full-fledged citizens,” Járóka said.
Since the Congress in Berlin last year, the summit is held annually with the aim of creating a unique forum for the advancement of the objectives of equal opportunities and non-discrimination at European and national level, in the sense of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities".
CSU: Grace on Time
At the end of October, the fate of the fallen duo Huber-Beckstein will be decided
Despite the electoral debacle, no heads are rolling yet, at the head of the Bavarian CSU, the personnel debates have been postponed.
Party leader Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Beckstein remain in their offices, the question is only how long this grace lasts.
The fate of the tandem after the disastrous loss of 17 percent of the vote will be decided at the Extraordinary Party Congress on the last weekend of October.
The much criticized duo, however, already showed that they do not want to stick on their armchairs.
In doing so, they want to appease the angry faction and the party base, which demanded personal consequences one day after the "Bavarian tsunami" in the face of the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - admittedly, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, who is at his career’s peak - the Christian Social Union still reached 60.7 percent, but now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, they were only able to secure 43.4 percent of the vote.
For 46 years, the CSU was a “single-government” in Bavaria, which generates 18 percent of Germany’s GDP.
While the conservatives remain the determining force in the southern federal state, which is also important for the Hungarian economy, they will have to govern in a coalition in the future.
As a first sign of the party-internal restructurings, the potential successor of Huber, Vice-President and Federal Agriculture Minister Horst Seehofer, will also be involved in the exploration team, which is conducting exploratory talks with the liberal FDP and the right-wing “free voters” on a possible Munich coalition.
The irony of fate is that with the list of "free voters" Gabriele Pauli enters the legislature, whose anti-stoiber appearance the Huber-Beckstein duo first took advantage of, and then mercilessly deprived the determined politician.
The CSU leadership is now concentrating all its forces on stabilizing Beckstein.
In this transitional process, Stoiber, who has so far pulled the strings out of the background, will play an active role. The former prime minister and CSU chairman called September 28 the "bitterest day of his political career".
On Monday, Huber made a few poisonous remarks towards the CDU - in his view, the CSU would have deserved far more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a signal to the CDU and thus also to Angela Merkel.
If the CSU, which contributed a lot to the success at national level in 2005, is not put back on its feet with a joint act of strength, Merkel cannot become Chancellor again after the German parliamentary elections in September 2009.
Merkel, who has made no secret of her disappointment at the fiasco, believes that the loss of ground by the CSU will not have a negative impact on the big coalition in Berlin.
However, what is relative is that the wounded CSU will not be easier to govern, and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
With 18.6 percent, the SPD achieved its best result in Bavaria since 1946.
Lukashenko opposition: 110-0
In the elections on Sunday, no member of the opposition has made it to the Ukrainian parliament.
Russian observers believe this is due to the prosperity and stability in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but the OECD suspects illegality in the counting of votes.
The OECD, which has sent 450 observers from 43 countries, has not recognised the elections.
Although the legislature of the 10-million-populated state has been without opposition for decades, the opposition party, assembled under the name of "United Democratic Forces" (ODS), since yesterday's elections, sincerely hoped that Lukashenko, who would allow in the unclean elections and thanks to a constitutional amendment in 2006, would renew his presidential mandate in the parliament for the fourth time.
That is why the ODS has even withdrawn from the previously planned boycotts.
Ukraine is becoming more and more economically dependent on Russia’s natural gas imports thanks to rising prices. Loans have even been taken to alleviate price increases, and the country has also agreed to the sale of Beltransgas, the owner of the country’s leading gas pipeline, to the Russians. In the background of the opposition’s expectations, there was the hope that Ukraine wanted to improve its relationship with the EU because of anti-Lukashengmoor
The OECD election evaluation report, which emphasized the positive movements rather than the shortcomings, such as the exclusion of one third of opposition candidates from the elections, provided a temporary relaxation.
However, the OECD's quick report criticized the campaign on Monday - according to which opposition members should not appear in the press - and in particular the fact that the opposition was not allowed to be present in the counting of the votes.
Despite all this, the opposition is able to see an improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been set free, for example, and Minsk is even ready for minor confrontations with Moscow by continuing to deny recognition of the independence of the renegade Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, although Russia, with which Ukraine is considered on paper a federal state, has been considering the two territories as independent for a month.
"We have taken two steps forward and one backward, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," Alexander Milinkevich told our newspaper.
According to the opposition candidate of the 2006 presidential election, a continuation is desirable, although "the powerful have become afraid to let even one opposition member in parliament."
The opposition does not plan any protest measures in view of the results, but rather tries to make the need for economic reform clear to the voters.
"We are struggling with many problems here - the opposition newspapers have to be printed in Russia, the local authorities are putting stones in our way when distributing them, but nevertheless I see that more and more people are supporting change, even the older ones" - said Milinkevich, alluding to the fact that not even the most supported layer of pensioners agrees with the Lukashenko regime, whose sole security is the production.
“Thanks to the country’s indebtedness and the increase in the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before the ‘social security’, which reminds of the silence of a cemetery, begins to crumble,” Milinkevich said.
Unlike opposition politicians, Russian observers have described the elections as democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Community of Independent States, told the news agency Ria Novosti: "People believe in deeds, not words, and the absence of opposition is therefore proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on, breakfast will be served before work"
For the first time in the history of Palazzo Chigi, there are rotating doors for the entrances and exits of the officials.
As of today, the measure will come into force against those clever people who first stamp and then go for coffee during working hours.
The new anti-lazyness law was presented today by Renato Brunetta, Minister of Public Administration, and Mauro Masi, Secretary General of the Bureau of the Council of Ministers.
“Swivel doors are a means of increasing work efficiency through a higher attendance rate and more services,” Brunetta said.
“A new era of responsibility and transparency is emerging.
This is reformism," Brunetta underlines once again.
With the Palazzo Chigi, the establishment ends in all buildings of the Presidium of the Council of Ministers.
Masi says: "The choice of swivelling doors is also of great symbolic value".
There was no resistance on the part of the officials, the secretary-general assured: "This process was supported by all, the cooperation came from all sides."
All in all, there is now no more breakfast during working hours; stop with coffee or croissant.
Brunetta says with a smile: “A good cappuccino at 7 o’clock works wonders.”
During a meeting of the Superior Committee of Public Administration (Scuola Superiore della Pubblica Amministrazione)
The minister said that "within three months, the absences of officials have been reduced to 50%, that is, 60,000 more people per year are present at work".
He adds that it is necessary to strengthen the efficiency of Italy's public administration
"their wage dynamics - according to the minister - have been twice as large as the private sector in the last 8-10 years and far above the inflation rate".
Meanwhile, thousands of officials have teamed up to counter the Brunetta Decree as part of the appeal supported by Codacons.
"While the Minister of the Public Service profiles himself with figures on lower absences at work - writes the Consumer Center - the people of the 'acting lazy' are growing continuously.
In fact, thousands of correct and valuable officials of the public service have joined together to declare war on the unlawful norms of the decree."
In particular, the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) is fighting for additional financial compensation for work-related illness; the planned extension of the mandatory house arrest of the sick worker, during which inspection visits can be made, and other aspects of the minister’s innovations are challenged.
Napolitano: "Prevention of accidents at work is crucial"
Every day in Italy, 2,500 workplace accidents occur, three people die and 27 remain disabled for life.
For 2007, the data from the Inail (Istituto nazionale contro gli infortuni sul lavoro) confirm that the fatal accidents at work were around 1200.
These numbers prove the gravity of a phenomenon that causes almost twice as many deaths as murders.
Today, the Anmil (Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) in all the provinces of Italy will celebrate the 58th National Day for Victims of Work Accidents in order to draw the attention of social institutions and media to this dramatic situation.
"The worrying data spread by Anmil and the tragic news these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at the workplace is," the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano confirms in his message to the President of the Amil (Associazione nazionale mutilati ed invalidi del lavoro) Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of state expresses his "great appreciation for the constant commitment to prevention in the workplace, to protect the injured workers, to assist the families of the victims and to raise public opinion."
"An outraged 'basta' has risen up; understandable in tragedies that, measured by their magnitude, trigger some media turmoil and public sympathy. But everyday reality often confronts us with dramatic events that can even repeat themselves in their own dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is definitely a resource problem: it must be invested decisively in education and information."
The numerous initiatives for a more direct awareness in schools on the part of young people who nourish the world of work are of particular importance.
It is our duty to pay attention to this phenomenon and not to distract from its social gravity; it is our duty to enforce and improve a legislative norm.
For his part, the President of the Chamber, Gianfranco Fini, stressed "how the phenomenon of work-related deaths constitutes an urgent social emergency that offends the conscience of all of us and forces all institutions to work towards decisive rules aimed at putting an end to the problem".
"The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight improvement, but this does not exclude the fact that the number of deaths related to work is far too high," said Pietro Mercandelli, President of Anmil.
"We don't want this 'positive tendency' to mean less attention. That's what causes the tragedy in the end."
"How do you believe that you are basically doing too little to counteract the phenomenon of accidents. You can fight against it through various actions.
In our opinion, stronger controls and inspections are necessary – according to Mercandelli; but also stronger measures to educate workers who start at school.”
"A further effort is needed - he adds - in terms of communication and public opinion awareness.
But above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers towards a phenomenon that constitutes a social emergency is in demand."
Mercandelli also spoke of "the progressive deterioration of protection for work accident victims" and denounced the "abolition of the social system against which we have been fighting in recent years."
"The aim is, therefore, to return to the worker a guarantee on insurance so that the fate of the victim of a work accident does not depend on voluntary or accidental donations decided from time to time by a legislator".
MP3 player under prosecution: risk of hearing damage
Listening to loud music over a longer period of time with portable music devices, such as MP3 players, can lead to permanent hearing loss.
This is reported by the European Commission, which in a report published today in Brussels cites the opinion of the EU’s Csrseri (scientific committee on current and recently identified health risks).
"The report - it says in a note - makes it clear that 5-10% of those who listen to loud music with portable music devices for at least five years a week for more than one hour a day risk permanent loss of their hearing."
"I'm worried that such a large number of teenagers, who usually put portable music devices and mobile phones at high volume, will irretrievably damage their hearing without knowing it," said Meglena Kuneva.
"The scientific findings - it is said by the EU - show a clear risk, which urges to act quickly.
What really matters is to raise awareness among consumers and make this information a common good.
In view of these scientific findings, we need to re-examine the existing control systems so that they are fully effective and keep up with the new technology."
Brussels had commissioned the independent scientific committee in view of the widespread use of portable music devices among young people.
"The scientists - concludes the EU communication - confirm that they are rightly concerned and that the EU Commission, together with the other EU Member States and those concerned, will now examine the necessary measures to better protect children and young people from the noise coming from portable music devices and similar devices."
There is already a European standard that limits the level of noise of portable music equipment to 100 dB. The concern about the damage that could come from too much noise pollution.
One can very well limit these damages by resorting to solutions such as the reduction of the volume and the length of the noise exposure.
In its report, the EU Scientific Committee points out that if users of portable music devices listen to loud music (no less than 89 decibels) five hours a week, the legal limits on the maximum noise level at the workplace have already been exceeded.
Those who cross that line of music risk the complete loss of hearing within five years.
This represents 5-10% of the users of such devices, the number of which can be estimated to be between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Roma, Alemanno launches the "Commission for the Future of the Capital"
We start today, in March it is supposed to be over, in June we will take stock.
This is the procedure laid down by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital Rome", which met this morning in the new headquarters behind the Caracalla thermal baths.
In six months, President Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will work out the guidelines for Rome.
Once the project is completed, the City Council and the Municipal Council will evaluate the analyses and projects in order to be able to present the strategic plan for Rome in June with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and the Mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural opinions are represented in it", - stresses Alemanno. "It will present proposals for a development plan for Rome, whose political leaders remain the city council and the municipal council.
There is no redistribution of responsibilities, only the will to have a place where one can develop a large project for Rome.
Its task will be completed in March and the Commission will disintegrate, as such a project must have a deadline.
In June - the mayor announces - we will present the strategic plan, in which we will take advantage of the work done by the Commission."
Those who question the Commission's competence because of its lack of commitment, Alemanno replies: "Everything depends on the work that the Commission will do and on the quality of its proposals.
If, as in France, the Attali Commission delivers quality results – and this will certainly be the case in Rome – then its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics deals with the everyday problems and emergencies that occur from time to time.
We, on the other hand, want to have a longer period in view in order to work seriously on the development of Rome and the future of the city in a deeper perspective."
"This commission is neither a useless institution nor a wreck: it is absolutely free, it will not cost the Roman citizens a penny and it will make us think, it will employ the best minds of the capital."
According to Alemanno, "it is necessary to have a strategic plan that is neither hermetic nor static in order to enable our city to take a quality leap - which it really needs - and thus to take a joint step into the future."
A future, says the mayor of Rome, which "will not only limit itself to the current municipal boundaries, but will look much further", not only in terms of Rome's role as a metropolis and political capital of Italy, but also as the future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama – the first anti-American president? Here’s a statement
A well-known American politician who cares a lot about being seen as independent wrote: “Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, through his decisions, decimated the U.S. economy and maintained (and still does as a private individual) relations with hostile Islam.
The attacks on Obama are getting more and more violent, especially now that the elections are approaching.
A lady from Miami wrote on an internet site: “This person is full of ambitions.
Obama is very cheeky: he thinks he will get the highest office of a nation that has seen a total of two black governors and five black senators!"
But actually, these attacks don’t have much to say; they are racist attacks and they don’t answer the voters’ question: will he be a good president? And then there are the polls; everyone says Obama will win with a big lead.
Also in this case, there are people who speak with the heart and not with the head.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deepest south of the United States, wrote in its editorial: it is only in the electoral booth that we will probably know who the real American patriot will give his vote.
This is where a mentality of the United States emerges, which has been kept hidden until the last.
"Say what you want, then we will decide for whom we will make our creep, whether for Obama or for McCain."
There are people out there who swear, if Obama wins, we will emigrate from America.
Something you’ve never heard before – only now, when the black candidate’s success seems so certain.
In any case, despite all these considerations, the final weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were questioned: What mistakes did Bush make during his tenure? 89% answered: the war in Iraq.
America is changing.
The nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent home with a kick in the butt.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Nevertheless, Iraq remains Bush’s weak point for the majority.
The one who will take his place is faced with a huge task.
USA. The financial collapse also leaves its mark on journalists: in the newspapers you can already feel the cuts. And many accuse the Internet, the "killer" of the printing press.
Five hundred American journalists were interviewed by the PEW Research Center about their situation and their mental control regarding the future.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
Nevertheless, they did not really express concern about the general credibility of the information concerning the competent authorities.
They don’t feel as alone as they used to be.
The problem for American journalists is money.
For these journalists, the crisis of 2008 is a crisis of an economic model that has been destroyed.
Added to this are the major problems caused by the cuts in the newsroom, i.e. the room in which the editors work to compose the newspaper.
It is a problem that needs to be solved – according to the interviewed journalists – if one wants to prevent traditional journalism, as the large audience understands it, from shrinking substantially.
A clear but complicated pessimism nowadays fills the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and senior executives in the press believe that journalism at the national level is on the wrong track.
In the local area, executives are even around 65%.
Printed vs. Broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to imagine in which direction the web is going.
The most important publishing groups are making their way into the Internet, which is regarded by many as the "killer" of the printing press.
The “economic pressure” that journalists feel has increased by up to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists have admitted to joining the new technology in the hope that "they will bring something good for journalism."
The biggest rift in American journalism today is between the editors-in-chief of the newsroom and the reporters who work for them.
56% of editors-in-chief at national level are confident that their reporters share their values with them, whereas only 23% at local level.
Some think it has to do with "security at work".
The company managers who are afraid of losing their jobs within three years are 47% at the national level.
Journalists are 30%.
The topic of "secure work" in the team (our "editors", note from the editors) is always a topical topic in the USA.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation like the US, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and TV stations and internet operators, employers offer as they like it and so it becomes a matter of take it or leave it.
The editors-in-chief often get very high wages, the editor, on the other hand, can sometimes get only 10,000 euros per month, plus pension and insurance funds.
As for the holidays, the matter gets complicated: a certain amount of days in the first year, so and so many after the third, to finally reach 15 days of holiday after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, as they themselves admit, often become "sick" over the course of the year.
It is a question of climate.
UNIPOL: COURT OF ROME: DANILO COPPOLA STAYS IN GROTTTAFERRATA
The President of the Second Criminal Chamber of the Court in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the request of the real estate agent, who had asked to be transferred from Grottaferrata to Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy in the context of the investigation into the counter-agreement in the event of the takeover of Unipol-Bnl.
In the course of the trial against him during the last week, his release from house arrest was converted into a residence obligation in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had asked to allow the real estate agent to be moved from the provincial city to an apartment in the capital.
According to the court, such relocations (which the public prosecutor’s office had opposed) could give him the opportunity to influence his society and obtain evidence accusing him.
The elite is in danger.
The phenomenon had already been revealed a few days ago when the Chamber of Deputies voted against the White House’s $700 billion savings package: A large proportion of Americans were and are more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This is confirmed by yesterday’s issue of the New York Times, which reports how the crisis is dividing the Republican Party, which is increasingly splitting into its old and moderate East Coast soul, which has always favored the state institutions and the business community, and which is hostile to those neoconservatives who are “those in Washington” and the financial world, and which is gaining power mainly in the south and the center of the states.
This part of the party owes its rise above all to the voice of the one I mentioned above.
However, this example just mentioned is only a small part of the major changes that the current economic earthquake is announcing or even already represents: not only in the US, but also throughout the West and perhaps beyond will be affected by them.
Both in the states and in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the long feared events, which are finally taking shape and coming to light under these new conditions.
The first of these phenomena is the new discovery, the unprecedented renaissance of the state in conjunction with a kind of renationalization of the economy.
In fact, the crisis means a decline of banking and financial institutions, which have close ties to foreign countries and at the same time manage an enormous amount of the assets of private households living in a single state.
This represents an immediate political problem for the governments: namely, how to behave towards the affected families, which are also a huge voter base.
So the crisis seems economically global, politically, on the other hand, it is almost purely national.
Political internationalism in itself seems to have fallen aside and lost its right to speak: the obvious proof of this has been given by the EU, which, due to its division into various national and international conflicts, cannot find a common path.
Therefore, everyone now expects the intervention of their own state; rescue plans, new rules, and especially distribution of aid funds: Since the crisis became more and more serious, only the US is in the economic situation to save themselves without outside help.
And in addition to the means, they also have the legitimacy to use them: thus, two prerequisites not to be overestimated – under certain circumstances – to which no international organization and no market will otherwise be able to rely in a similar way.
That new emphasis placed on the state-national element is, moreover, in perfect harmony with the ever-increasing importance which has recently been associated in the economy with a closely related sector: territoriality.
Paradoxically, now that we have been so convinced that we have long since entered a networked realm, a realm of always differentiated technologies, of the intangible, that we must suddenly see how our future will depend more and more on the essential material things: water, harvest and oil.
These can certainly all be transported from one place to another in the world, but are nevertheless connected to the utmost with a narrowly defined piece of earth – a territory.
Therefore, the person who has such a territory is in advantage over another who lives in a harvestless, waterless or oil-free area.
I now come to the second novelty, which, however, requires a brief introduction.
Whoever says territory, whoever says government, whoever says politics, also says leadership.
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to be generating two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, there is the knowledge of the need for respected leadership, that is, the need for someone who knows how to regulate things.
On the other hand, there is now a wave of indignation at the existing leaderships, especially those of the economy, which have turned out to be inadequate and full of shadow zones.
Finally, there is a deeper and in a sense even more disturbing aspect: a loss of confidence, an intolerance, an image of inappropriateness, a sense of distance, all directed at a whole class of managers of Western countries.
It seems to be the conviction among large sections of the population that it is not only the actions of the social elite, but already their world of ideas, their way of life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, whose content presents itself to the majority as ever more foreign and traditional.
The demand for leadership thus feeds underground a branched but powerful movement of disempowerment of the leading class and the traditional political establishment. This is manifested in unforeseen "revolts" of the voters and perhaps in the sudden reversal of the American collective mood of recent times: starting with the rise of the conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, the right also plays a role in this country.
One gets the impression that the old elite, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, magazines, intellectual believers, some would say their format, more and more understanding problems and therefore less representative value in relation to what is happening today in the lower social classes of the West and is intensified by the financial crisis and driven to overdimensionality.
In the face of all this, it would be simply exaggerated to speak of a “rebellion of the masses”.
Keeping your eyes wide open is certainly not.
The super glue that goes up against the walls
Defeat the forces of gravity thanks to an adhesive and be able to climb up walls like Superman.
This is the subject of four American research centres, one of which seems to have almost reached its goal.
Using an adhesive applied on an area of only 2.5 sqcm, the researchers have succeeded in fixing a body weighing 100 kg on a vertical wall.
The STUDIO – an American journal has published the results of researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the research team is a further development of the already used adhesives, which use a special carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
"The principle of adhesive can be imagined as a row of spaghetti tubes," explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists have been inspired by the feet of the geckos, which are covered by microscopic hairs that give the animal a perfect hold.
Tests carried out with various materials such as glass Teflon and sandpaper have shown that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the holding capacity of the reptiles' feet and at the same time "can be easily removed from the wall," said Liming Dai, researcher at the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
"This material could be used as a transient adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Perhaps it does, but the researchers are more likely to think of a less fascinating benefit, such as the connection of electrical devices, because the nanotubes are also conductors of heat and electricity.
Other areas of application could fall into the field of space travel.
So for the moment, the superheroes have to wait.
THE OTHER TYPE OF RESEARCH – also the University of Berkeley, California, is dedicated to a new type of adhesive.
In an article by the American Chemical Society, the Californian scientists present an adhesive made of microfibers that, like hair, clean themselves from dust by moving on a surface and thus always maintain perfect adhesion.
Drugs: Never take with fruit juice
Beware of grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, which are consumed mainly in summer due to their refreshing quality and vitamin abundance, can cause serious health damage when taken at the same time as certain vital drugs, as they can have an extreme effect on the body’s absorption.
David Bailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, repeatedly points out the risk of both packaged and fresh fruit juices associated with medication intake. At the 236th meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he once again struck the alarm: a glass of apple, orange or grapefruit juice is enough to jeopardize the absorption capacity of certain vital drugs to such an extent that these are virtually eliminated.
Grapefruit juice has already been suspected to be responsible for increasing the effects of some drugs such as antibiotics, antiasthmatics, cardiovascular drugs, anxiolytic and neurological agents, up to toxic levels.
Drugs at Risk – The same agency of the drug had warned doctors and patients about the dangers of this mix in a report two years ago, stressing to pay attention to what is being drunk in conjunction with drugs such as Diazepan or Metadon.
It’s not just grapefruit – according to the experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that can inhibit the drugs.
The list of active ingredients inhibited by the fruit juices is long.
Hence the appeal of Michele Carruba, the director of the Università Statale di Milano: "Such results are usually immediately forwarded to the various international manufacturers, who are free to change consumer information.
Therefore, it is advisable to always read the package leaflet and, if there are still ambiguities, do not be shy to ask a pharmacist or doctor," emphasizes the expert of the ANSA agency.
The Nobel Prize goes to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize in Economics is awarded to American Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and the establishment of economic activities.
The 55-year-old Krugman is a Neokeynesian who teaches at the University of Princeton and known for his regular articles for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration's economic and foreign policy.
A few months after the September 11, 2001 attacks, during the days of the Enron collapse, Krugman had claimed in a New York Times editorial that this second event was more decisive for the history of the United States than the assassinations.
A prediction that received no little polemic as a response and was presented to the economist years later, but today proves to be completely correct.
"I am surprised and shocked at how quickly the memory of the scandals of the collapses of Enron or Worldcom disappeared from the public eye," Krugman said.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is an "economist of great value," but also a banalizer with a "very aggressive style, particularly directed against the excessive liberalism of the Bush administration."
Open Office, the third version of the "Anti-Microsoft" package appears
The day of the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0 has come; the open source software as a free replacement for Microsoft’s Office is gaining an increasing number of users, both at home and in the office, both among freelancers and in the public administration.
After a year of intensive work by the voluntary developers, which is supervised by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office now presents itself to the public with some new features: in addition to a revised and now more spartanly designed beginning menu, it has finally achieved a fundamentally guaranteed compatibility with Apple's Mac OS x operating system, as well as support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, i.
Eight against was also on the compatibility with Microsoft's Office 2007, whose new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) can be read by OpenOffice.
Also interesting are some new features, such as the one that allows to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, which makes it easier to send e-mails, including the possibility to import PDF files into graphic editing modules while preserving the original appearance of the page.
Thus, "hybrid" PDF files can now also be generated, which extend the typical graphics of the Adobe format with the elements of a table and a word processing system.
Collaboration is one of the most improved elements of the applications: tables can now be edited multi-handedly by different users, thus avoiding conflicts in case of changes; in the case of the word processing system, each editor is assigned a Frabe to guarantee a better correction procedure.
Some companies are currently publishing various features of OpenOffice on the internet (on the cloud), while the final result is expected to be made public in the coming weeks.
The Italian version is available for download at the following link: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html. So it follows the English version, which has been on the mirrors since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the program is also available for the Linux operating system.
Upon request, you can send the installation CD to your home or office.
However, freedom of charge can be an incentive for the dissemination of the program in private households, it is also in the area of business, where OpenOffice could succeed: after all, various institutions of the public administration and schools have already switched to OpenOffice.
In fact, there is not even a lack of a training offer, which means optimal help for small and medium-sized companies, and thus even opens up business prospects.
OpenOffice is made up of five main components: Writer, the Word-related text creation program; Calc, the spreadsheet program that aims to displace Excel; Impress, to create presentations like PowerPoint; Dbase to operate databases instead of the more familiar Access; and lastly, Draw, a graphics module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads – a goal that can easily be exceeded with already reached 3 million and 600 thousand.
Kohl also tested positive and thus the fourth doping case
A new doping case is opened in the framework of the previous Tour de France: it is the Austrian athlete Bernhard Kohl of the Gerolsteiner team, who is third-ranked and winner of the jersey of the best climber.
The news was published by the daily L’Equipe on its website.
The 26-year-old Kohl from the Gerolsteiner team is the fourth driver to be tested positive for Cera, the third generation Epo. This was already the case with the Italians Riccardo Ricc<0xC3><0xB2> and Leonardo Piepoli as well as the German Stefan Schumacher.
The analyses from Kohl’s blood samples are among those carried out in recent weeks by the laboratories of Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter-tests now confirm the positive results on Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place and be excluded from the races for two years.
The head of the French anti-doping commission, Pierre Bordry, confirmed the positive epotest and, according to the Associated Press, also notified the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian climbed the podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans and also claimed the jersey of the best climber for himself.
THEME IMMIGRATION: THE NEW YORK TIMES QUESTION: IS ITALY racist?
Italy, "the former country of emigrants has recently become one of the preferred countries for immigrants", which are only welcomed with reluctance.
This is what the New York Times asks in a long article devoted entirely to the theme of racism in Italy, based on the case of the young Abdul William Guibre, a Burkina Faso native, who was murdered a month ago in Milan after stealing a pack of cookies.
The case bears witness to what the Times calls the "paradox of the North": the northern regions are those where "the most integration and job opportunities" exist, yet "the highest degree of anti-immigrationist sentiments and the greatest support of the Lega Nord are recorded."
As a confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the Times cites further episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And not just this.
The new legislation introduced by the League against immigration and the faster expulsion of illegal immigrants is also cited as a sign of climate change in Italy.
A movement that the Pope and the President also underline: “Giorgio Napolitano asked the Pope at a meeting on the Quirinal for a cooperation between the Church and the State to combat racism.”
Students victims of up to 900 euros per room high rental prices
The housing market for students knows no crises.
According to the latest study of the Sunia, the tenant union, a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"This phenomenon has already taken on a very serious trajectory: in fact, large numbers of students are losing their right to study because their families are unable to support them at this level" - says Sunia's manager, Laura Mariani - "in these cities, the high demand from students is leading to a deformation of the market that has also damaged the other residents.
In addition, most rental offers include a number of violations: free contracts, missing registrations, no rental price limit, unauthorized sub-rents.
For the Sunia, there is a need for exceptional measures, which lead to lower rental prices through a revision of taxation.
A closer look at the study shows that in Milan a sleeping space in the Brianza district is needed for about 450 euros; a single room starts at 650 euros (in the Bande Nere district) and ends at 800 euros in the Lambiate, Udine and Fiera district or even 900 euros in the Vittoria district.
In Florence, a place to sleep costs an average of 350/400 euros, a room 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in the neighborhoods around the university, 250/280 euros are needed for a place to sleep, 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, the prices in the neighborhoods around the university are around 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a sleeping place in a double room.
Only a little lower are the rents in the neighborhoods around the other universities of Rome: 550 euros in Ostiense and Cinecittà.
Only those who avoid in outskirts can save money: 300 euros for a place to sleep and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar quarters.
In Naples, you need 300-450 euros for a place to sleep, for a room the price is between 400 and 600 euros in the most expensive neighborhoods, the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, a place to sleep costs 250-350 euros, a single room at least 350.
In the smallest cities, prices are lower, but they have a greater weight in the urban economy.
In cities where the phenomenon of renting to non-European students is more common, such as Perugia, there is even another anomaly: rents that are 25-30% above the average are demanded by foreign students.
Goodbye to the old cinema Paradiso – the cities close their historic cinemas
The historic cinemas close due to the favoured multiplex cinemas.
“A city without cinemas is a blind city, like a face without eyes.”
This picture by the director Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect what is currently happening in the major urban centers of Italy, and also in the provinces.
The process of exclusion of cinemas, which began with the birth of the large multi-room complexes in the periphery, means death for the one-room cinema in the center in the long run. A process that not only appears inevitable and irrevocable, but also carries the traits of a cultural crime.
It is like losing a friend with whom you have travelled a stretch of road full of emotions," says the director of the film "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso", which earned him the Oscar and the Grand Prix of Cannes 20 years ago. It is the story of a suburban cinema and its nostalgia, which consists of living in a cinema world that is probably forever lost.
The figures provided by Anec, the central trade association, speak a clear language: in the last five years, the enormous amount of 316 traditional cinemas have had to close; these mines paid for most of the cinemas in the major cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
The most affected regions are Emilia-Romagna with 82 cinemas lost, followed by Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41.
This shows that the main culprits are the multiplex cinemas, because it is precisely these three regions in which the largest number of these modern cinemas has been registered: with 195 in the last 5 years, Lombardy leads the lists, 81 are in both Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
"The business has developed in an irrational way," says Paolo Protti, the president of Anec, "it is useful that new structures also arise, but first and foremost is the preservation of what already exists, because a hall closes in the city, not all of its regular customers are willing to visit a multiplex cinema in the periphery instead of the old one.
And here remains the missing budget for the fund of the trade association: the debt burden recorded by the state is about 10 million euros.
It is a disgrace from the ethical-moral standpoint that the government fails to comply with existing laws.
In order to maintain the sector, between 16 and 18 million euros a year would be needed."
Interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city to decide to protect the old cinemas through an agreement between the municipality and the Anec, which is the first of its kind in Italy to protect and support the traditional cinemas, both in the historical centre and in the periphery.
Among the foreseen measures are tax advantages for the cinema operators as well as advantages for the public in terms of local transport: it will be allowed to drive to the restricted areas of the centre and also to park at lower parking fees.
"It's a pleasing initiative," says Giuseppe Tornatore, "I hope that other cities will follow our example and also design new concepts.
Certainly, however, we also need better audio and video equipment in order to be able to align against the superpower of multiplex rooms, because after all, today’s audience is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema has always been an important topic for me: the closure of the "Supercinema" of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the decisive point that led me to establish the "Nuovo cinema Paradiso", even though I had been playing with the idea for 10 years.
I have been living in Rome for 25 years; when I pass by the Rialto or the Quirinale in Via Nazionale, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn to the side so as not to have to see the dust-covered posters.
The links between politics and 'Ndrangheta lead to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to adapt the decisions of the municipality to the interests of the Piromalli mafia group.
The accusations of the Calabrian anti-mafia prosecutor’s office against Mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his deputy Rosario Schiavone of the municipality of Gioia Tauro, who were arrested this morning for involvement in mafia business, are serious.
Handcuffed was also Gioacchino Piromalli, the older intermediary between the clan and the public administration, as well as his nephew: the lawyer, who bears the same name as the boss of the clan, had already been sentenced for involvement in criminal organizations of the mafia, then to a sum of compensation of 10 million euros.
"Disregarding any kind of moral and legal norm," the lawyers wrote, "the two local administrations had decided to pay the lawyer Piromalli funds for consulting activities."
"So it was made possible for the mafia group - according to the judges - to enter the town halls by official means and to help determine the policies of the public administration."
The president of the Calabrian Regional Committee, Agazio Loiero, does not deny that in his region "it is anything but an exception to encounter connections from local administrations and organized crime." "There are places where the concentration of the mafia is greater than in others, where such connections are virtually inevitable.
But there are also local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'Ndrangheta: heroes who get a white vest."
The arrests this morning follow those of last July, with which, according to the police, the Clan Piromalli was beheaded.
Since the end of last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, but already in 1991 – and even then due to alleged links between organised crime and local administration – local politicians had been removed from their municipal offices.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then mayor of the UdC, was elected head of the centre-right coalition after the second round election in May 2006.
He shouted scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He addressed Vice-Minister Marco Minniti, whom he accused of inventing everything for political-strategic reasons, but the judges explained in connection with this morning’s arrest warrant that the Piromalli clan had even dared to request a change to the A3 project.
From an eavesdropping operation in connection with the investigations into the Dal Torrione case, the willingness to comply with the wishes of an entrepreneur, who is known to be a representative of the large group around the Piromalli, has been demonstrated - making the public administration's actions identical with the interests of this clan."
When the energy comes out of the waves, suddenly the big ones come up.
It is a non-drying source of money covering over 70% of the planet’s surface, and only now do the world’s big energy companies seem to understand this.
Waves, currents and tides are the new renewable energy sources that everyone is now looking at, and are also looking to occupy, such as giants like Chevron.
The possibility of extracting energy from the movements of the sea has been considered and studied for 70 years; it is not by chance that these studies have intensified considerably since the first oil crisis.
When the price of oil fell by 1980, the idea of marine energy was lost, but now the environmental organizations and the rising oil price are pushing for new impetus in this sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of global energy demand could be covered by the energy generated by ocean waves.
This would be twice the energy currently produced by nuclear power plants.
There are also the currents and tides.
Giants in the attack.
The first company to now rely on marine energy is Enersis, which signed a contract in 2005 for the construction of a power plant in the north of Portugal.
When this news was published, it seemed to be a revolutionary step.
Two years later, more and more companies from the traditional energy sector are now relying on marine energy production.
“Chevron is exploring these technologies,” said a spokesman for a company known to the American giant in the Wall Street Journal, “and is considering the possibility of working with us.”
It is about obtaining an approval from the American Energy Commission, which is necessary to start a project off the coast of Alaska.
This is a sign not to be underestimated, especially considering that in Alaska in particular, oil is still being extracted by the U.S., and President Bush has only recently set in motion plans for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey are also investing in the new industry; if the details are not known, observers are talking about an increasing interest.
Technologies still to be improved.
Experts speak of an emerging technology, not least because the last doubts on the part of environmentalists have not yet been clarified.
So far, projects such as this one in Portugal and Scotland are of a rather small dimension and do not seem to cause any serious environmental problems.
However, to produce energy on a large scale, technologies with a far greater impact on the environment are needed.
There are several possibilities: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of interconnected buoys.
The thrust of the shafts, which moves the buoys up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure within the floats via pistons and cylinders.
This drives a turbine, which in turn operates a generator.
The electricity is then sent to the coast via underwater pipes.
So far, there are four planned installations of this type, which are only waiting for government approval, and some of the energy obtained could also be used for military facilities.
Verdant Power is already producing energy for a department store and parking lot using undersea turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movements during the tides drive the turbines, which feed the generator due to the resulting rotary movement.
According to Verdant, a long queue of potential clients is already waiting for the necessary authorizations to use these energy sources.
First the waves, then the tides.
According to the Institute for Electricity Production Research, a particular interest deserves immediately the potential that lies in the tides.
Although it is also an irregular phenomenon, the tides are better predictable than wind currents, the sunlight and also the waves, and therefore a more reliable source of electricity.
It is precisely tidal energy that has led states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, as well as other coastal states, to invest $7.5 million in 2008 – up to 35 million are already planned for 2009.
