28-year-old cook found dead in San Francisco mall
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the staircase of a local mall.
The victim’s brother testified that he cannot imagine anyone wanting to harm him, “he finally went uphill again.”
The body, found at Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning, was identified as 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, San Francisco's forensic department said.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was classified as a murder and the investigation is ongoing.
The victim’s brother, Louis Galicia, told ABS station KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who used to work as a cook in Boston, had gotten his dream job as a cook at the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A Sons & Daughters spokesperson said they were “shocked and devastated” by his death.
"We are a small team that works like a close family and we will miss him painfully," the spokesman said.
Our thoughts and condolences are with Frank's family and friends during this difficult time.
Louis Galicia stated that Frank initially lived in hostels, but that, "things finally went uphill for him."
"He found an apartment, he had a girlfriend," Louis Garcia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said that he could not imagine anyone trying to harm his younger brother.
He was a friendly person with a big heart.
His way of connecting with his family was to always cook us something, prepare us dinner," said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to take part in any kind of conflict.
He was the brother who swam with the river.
"With everything going wrong in the world, he was that uncut diamond that shined brightly every day," he said.
Anyone who has information on the case is asked to call the SFPD’s alert telephone number 415-575-4444.
Jennifer Aniston: I'm Always Put in Drawers
Jennifer Aniston doesn’t always have to be perfect or successful.
The Hollywood star has now made this unmistakably clear in an interview.
"I'm always put in drawers or get labels glued on from outside, which usually have little to do with me and reality."
“I don’t want to always be perfect and successful.”
“Honestly, I think these things are rather snuffy.”
Jennifer Aniston, 47, can only laugh at the fact that she is considered “Miss Perfect,” as she explains in the current “Cosmopolitan”.
The actress prefers to spend her time at home, in front of the TV with loose dut and Mexican food, according to the magazine.
“We women don’t have to be married or have children to be perfect,” the Hollywood star said.
In her new film "Mother's Day - Love Is Not Easy", Aniston is seen as a single mother of two sons.
The film will run with us from August 25th.
Golfer Langer receives the sports pyramid
His experiences on the horse are manageable.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer and some colleagues sought a bit of variety with a horseback ride on the beach.
It was a premiere for the 58-year-old.
CHIO: "Golden Sports Pyramid" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes, the horses remembered their work, they hunted home to the feed troughs in a quick gallop.
A mile at that pace, I was scared.
"It wasn't a good experience," Langer says.
And that ended the riding career again.
On Saturday, Germany's best golfer of all time - 101 tournament wins - was again close to horses.
He and his family were guided over the ALRV facility, he did not even swing on a horse for photo purposes.
Langer was in Aachen for the first time and thus also at the CHIO.
The reason was quite convincing.
The German sports aid handed over the Golden Sports Pyramid to the man from Anhausen during a small gala.
The sympathetic athlete is not lacking in awards.
Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silbernes Laurelblatt, Champions-Tour-Player of the year...
Even the British queen has ennobled him.
Langer is the 18th winner of the sports pyramid.
In Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.
"This award means a lot to me," says Langer, "because it is awarded not only for sporting achievements, but also for social commitment."
For decades, Langer has been supporting young people.
And so he also handed over the prize money of 25,000 euros.
With 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time US Masters winner was admitted to the "Hall of Fame of German Sports" on Saturday.
Among the winners are the athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the gymnast Eberhard Gienger, the fencers Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the rower Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob driver Meinhard Nehmer, the judoka Frank Wieneke, the jumper Alwin Schockemöhle and Erhum Handball.
Many of these sports legends came to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrious company moved to the Spring Stadium, where the Lavazza Prize ran.
Bernhard Langer kept a distance from the big animals.
Clinton’s and Trump’s Economic Policy: It’s All About the Money
Investing in infrastructure and preventing the trade agreement TTP – that’s what both Clinton and Trump want.
However, the two US presidential candidates disagree on tax and energy policy as well as on a fundamental issue.
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.
It is about the role of the state.
Trump wants to keep those in doubt rather small and warns about how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says.
He himself would be completely different, Trump says.
He will massively reduce regulations, and he is advocating for far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates – for private individuals and for businesses.
Clinton, on the other hand, says: The state has certain responsibilities, it has opportunities to open up disadvantaged people and needs money for that.
That’s why taxes for the rich would be raised, she says.
Interestingly, both are very close to the subject of infrastructure.
Trump and Clinton say they need to be invested in it almost in the same way.
The Democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since World War II.
State investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected, for example, by the state-critical Tea Party wing of the Republicans.
So, Trump could still have internal party discussions.
The differences in energy and climate policy are clearer.
Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and increase coal production in the United States.
Oil production should also be possible in protected areas, he wants to terminate the Paris climate agreement.
Clinton, on the other hand, explicitly wants to expand renewable energies with her investment program and calls: "A country will become the superpower of clean energies and create millions of jobs."
"It will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be."
But not only in terms of infrastructure – even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart.
TPP, the Trans-Pacific Trade Agreement, will not sign either.
At the same time, however, both do not want to isolate the US from international trade – but simply protect American jobs better.
They should also be paid better, for example, demands Clinton.
The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a starvation wage.
They want to raise it to $15 an hour.
What Trump wants to do on this issue is not entirely clear: once he says: the minimum wage must go up, then he says that it must not be changed.
But the big discussion in the coming months is likely to evolve around the tax policy of the two camps.
On one side is Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens in order to boost growth.
His critics argue that this would only make the budget deficit even bigger.
On the other side is Clinton, who wants to demand at least from the rich that they pay more taxes, and whose critics say: more taxes are also not the solution.
Escape: "Every refugee woman has experience of sexual violence"
For women fleeing alone, sexual violence is almost part of everyday life.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.
A house offers shelter.
There are four women in a large kitchen.
Everyone has a baby that is at most one year old.
One of them put her little son in her arms.
He looks curiously into the room with big eyes.
His mother stares at the table top.
Until she realizes she’s being watched.
She smiles briefly and kisses the little one.
The scene looks normal.
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is the divisional managing director of Condrobs, a social aid provider in Bavaria, and deals with the topic of women on the run.
The four women in the kitchen are refugees.
They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralised accommodations for single women and their children in Bavaria.
In January, Condrobs opened the facility together with Pro Familia and Munich Women’s Aid.
It has recently been officially opened.
60 people live there – about 40 women and 20 children.
There are no men, not even as visitors.
The only exception is a security guard at the door.
“It’s not an exaggeration to say that every woman who arrives here has had experiences of sexual violence while fleeing,” says Bahr.
“Men flee because of wars, because they are politically persecuted, because they are threatened with torture or death, or because their families send them to Europe as hopes,” she says.
For women, other reasons for fleeing predominate: "Many are stealing away secretly because they see no other way out."
In their homeland, they have experienced sexual violence, forced marriages, honor killings, slavery or forced prostitution.
That drives her away.
This continues on the run.
"That tugs, for example, for a bottle of water demand a sexual act, is not uncommon," says Bahr.
And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.
Those who believe that it will end as soon as they arrive in Germany are insane, says Bahr.
Here, too, single women in refugee shelters are often considered inferior and, at worst, abused.
As a result, about 90 percent of the women who live in the accommodation in the north of Munich are traumatized, she estimates.
"Some of the children are certainly not born voluntarily."
Many women are so used to saying nothing.
"Or they don't dare speak openly about what they have experienced because the shame is too great."
Since they often don’t know how to help themselves, they need more accommodation just for them, Bahr demands.
In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.
When asked if they knew about a project similar to that in Munich in their area of responsibility, some answered with a no.
In the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, for example, there is no such thing in government accommodations.
Even in Swabia, refugees alone are not being accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press spokesman for the government.
In Upper Bavaria, Lower and Middle Franconia, there are in some communal accommodations floors or own houses only for single women and their children.
The exception is Lower Bavaria, where there are two central accommodations exclusively for women.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be housed separately from men.
In a study published for the committee, it states: "It is very important that men and women are housed separately."
"If privacy is lacking or men and women are being accommodated together, there may be – continuing – violence against women".
Above all, the washrooms should be separate and easily accessible for women, according to the study.
How much the women feel this need for protection can be seen from the crowd that exists on the house in Munich.
“Since it’s been talked about that we exist, we have a long waiting list,” says Bahr.
You could easily open a second house.
Strike of resident doctors: calls for new labour struggle measures
Deputies of the resident doctors have called on their union to approve new labour action in their disputes regarding a new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called on its entire council to approve more action from the beginning of September.
The JDC testified that ministers had failed to address concerns about the treaty.
In July, resident doctors and medical students voted on the rejection of a contract that was agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the elections.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter on Thursday evening, JDC chair Ellen McCourt said the government had remained “persistently quiet” on issues, leading to the contract being rejected.
She said: “In view of this, the JDC Board has voted to reject the proposed new contract completely and requested official renegotiation on all of your concerns.”
In response to the government’s silence, the JDC Board today formally filed a request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing program of escalating industrial action that will begin in early September.
The disputes caused resident doctors to strike six times this year, the first overall outages in the history of the NHS.
The head of the BMA resident doctors Dr. Johann Malawana resigned after the election for rejection of the agreed terms of the contract, which had been recommended by the BMA.
He told BMA members during the meetings that took place before the vote by 54,000 resident doctors and medical students that the contract was beneficial and should be adopted.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said that the contract for doctors in England would be forced to be introduced.
Russia and Turkey: An "Alliance of Outsiders"?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give hands and announce an official end to the eight-month-long war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish opponent in the gold-plated hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot refrain from the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.
There was a handshake, yes.
But Putin’s smile seemed narrow-lipped and he barely radiated warmth, even for his restrained circumstances.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his "dear friend" Putin - according to a report - five times.
I couldn't count it anymore.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old pre-crisis levels, but would even improve.
The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan had behaved as if nothing bad had ever happened.
His enthusiasm seemed to suggest the opposite.
But Putin’s radiant, sustained coolness showed that Russia’s head of state had forgotten nothing.
Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the shooting down of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border by Turkey.
Moscow's reaction at the time was furious.
Putin divided and accused Ankara of falling into the back of Russia.
The offense was even greater because it was committed by a supposed friend.
Rebuilding trust will be difficult, if not impossible.
Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media carried out a fierce, unrestricted attack on Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything.
Most serious were the accusations made by senior officials that Erdogan’s own family had benefited from the illegal oil trade in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He has vehemently denied this.
But in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look forward.
After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology he wanted to hear from President Erdogan.
Russia had some sort of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are clear.
Erdogan needs primarily all the friends he can get after he was almost removed from office in a failed coup last month.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.
But there are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard – especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number has declined by almost 90%.
In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed.
They count on a late-season rush to the Mediterranean.
This week, state television predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports were allowed again.
A report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows: "Tourists there long, tomatoes here long."
But the visit had added political value to Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West as it sees its response to the attempted takeover of power as a weak response.
Add to this the ongoing resentment over the snail pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin – who is eager to take advantage of the cool mood and reduce Turkey’s relationship with the West.
The Russian head of state certainly won a bonus in Ankara for demanding support for the elected state bodies after the attempted coup.
This is a matter of course for Moscow, which has a deep-seated fear of regime change.
The summit in this splendid seaside palace enabled Russia and Turkey to portray one, as an analyst once described to me, as “an alliance of outsiders”: two countries that feel offended and ill-treated by the West and now allied.
Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still major differences between the two.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave itself the role of peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
It could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents said at the press conference that they had not even touched on the issue.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize them.
There is no clear consensus on where to find a common denominator on Syria.
But after months of open hostilities - and given the potential for a complete disaster when NATO member Turkey shot down the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better for the two heads of state to talk at least again.
Royal Bank of Scotland is no longer available to customers outside of Scotland
According to the CEO of the bank, the RBS brand will only be reduced to a back-office role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank’s global ambitions.
The bank has distanced itself since when it nearly collapsed and had to be rescued eight years ago.
During this time, brand strategists have used “RBS” to protect other end-user financial brands.
She supported the international sport with millions of pounds in sponsorship, from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.
But now she has decided to focus on more national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized.
In England and Wales, all RSB references, the decentralized headquarters and the stock exchange listing will be switched to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller retail brands that will gain more importance - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed by customers and employees in Inverness-shire during a tour.
He told the BBC Scotland: “The RSB brand will become our investor brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be employed as we are now becoming more of a bank of brands.”
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I am now saying that we are not pursuing global goals, but local goals.
Each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the visibility of the various brands in its sports sponsorship.
“It’s time for us to become the bank of the brands, because how do we inside (we asked) focus on making this a better bank for customers?” said the CEO.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would have been a great bank for our customers and launched these brands.
But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think, you will see a lot of changes.
We can relaunch these brands, so I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori reaches his 3,000th win at Newmarket on Predilection
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket, which brings him 3,000th profit
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British win at Newmarket on Friday.
He set a milestone on Predilection, which is trained by John Gosden, on his local race track with his second win of the night.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the milestone in the flat race.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
The three-time winner Dettori, who previously won on Ghayyar, said, "It's something special."
I am very emotional because my family is here too.
I am very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banal Friday night with 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very humble.
Dettori picks up the cheer as he wins on Predilection
Two jockeys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who achieved more than 4,300 wins in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, the nine-time derby winner had 4,493 career victories
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of the modern era and it’s no surprise that he has reached this milestone that few have reached before him.
He has style and is strong, but it is his tactical intellect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room.
He is a fantastic ambassador for racing, his enthusiasm and charisma have inspired fans for years for this sport.
I told Frankie at Epsom a few weeks ago that if he weren’t just a weekend and big tournament jockey, he would have already won 6,000!
Frankie has already been a winner in the UK for almost 30 years, which is great.
He has a vibrant personality, which is good for a British race, but beyond that he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the flagship of the British flat race for two decades.
It was nerve-wracking.
A whole series of major tournament wins, including his famous "Glorious Seven" in Ascot in 1996, but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug ban.
Three years ago, he initially had trouble returning from his six-month lockdown, but he showed an impressive character strength to defy his doubters and return to his best form.
And he is far from over - Dettori once said that he wants to continue in competitions until he is at least 50 years old.
Russian President Vladimir Putin fired Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly fired his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov.
For many years, Ivanov was part of Putin’s closest circle of trust.
The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Environmental and Transport Affairs.
In a statement issued by the Kremlin, Putin stated that “without giving any reason, he ordered the dismissal of Ivanov from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration.”
Anton Vaino, who had been Ivanov's deputy since 2012, was appointed as his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo.
The website of the Kremlin says (in Russian) that he was later protocol chief and chief of staff of the government.
About his appointment, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I think the government’s most important task is to support your work as head of state on bills and controls to implement your instructions.
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.
Are the smiling faces convincing?
This move has made Moscow mysterious.
Sergei Ivanov was for a long time one of Vladimir Putin’s closest confidants and works like him for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB.
As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the chief of staff resigned at his own request.
But despite the smiles on the cameras, few are convinced of this – especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the result of some kind of power struggle?
Nobody knows that right now.
But the official claim – that a man who was once touted as a potential president would suddenly want to lead Russian environmental policy – encountered great scepticism.
In his remarks to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin’s website, Ivanov said “it’s true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 to entrust me with this very complicated post – one could almost say – for four years.
As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took up the post in December 2011.
Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB State Security Service.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB) replacing the KGB, Ivanov was appointed as his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov as one of five people he trusted the most.
It was once believed that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin’s second term, as a third term of Putin would have violated the Constitution.
But this post was taken by another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson fired after beating producers
Gibson was involved in a physical confrontation last month on the set of the series in Los Angeles.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced its termination in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized publicly on Thursday before the announcement of his resignation.
On the set there were artistic differences and a disagreement.
I regret the incident,” he said in a statement.
Details of how Gibson’s character will be featured in the series, which follows a team of FBI agents, are expected to be released at a later date, according to ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old, who previously starred in the sitcom Dharma & Greg, has been in the series since the first season in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have put my whole heart and soul into it for the past 12 years," Gibson said in a statement released Friday.
I had hoped to be there until the end, but that will no longer be possible.
I would just like to thank the writers, producers, actors, our wonderful crew and, most importantly, the best fans you could wish for a series.
The planned broadcast of the twelfth season is scheduled for September 28.
Mysteries about fish that landed in garden in Banff
A resident of Banff asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks that the 75 fish could be sandals spit from a fountain.
Mr. Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, posted a video of the spectacle on Periscope in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two-inch-long fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge Now Connected to Fife
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the north deck of the Queensferry Crossings to the viaduct – which means the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four closures of the "deck blower" that are approaching completion around each of the three towers of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 inclined ropes.
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017.
Economics Minister Keith Brown visited the construction site today and was one of the first to walk from the country to the bridge.
He said: “This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossings.
We are all witnesses to an engineering craft of a truly epic dimension in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used solely for this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for fit.
Overall, almost 79% of the total bridge decks are in place and the last section of the deck is given a concrete cast for the deck today in Rosyth, which means the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, Project Manager at Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: “The first lock is a significant milestone in any bridge project.
In this fantastic project, the lock represents future-oriented construction and civil engineering.
After the installation of the last section of the road deck and its connection to the North Tower deck under construction, we had to close the remaining gap on the north or shore side.
This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.
Massive because the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incline of about 3%.
tricky, since the tolerances the team is working towards were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Rescue in Moelfre Bay: Three men have "happiness to be alive"
Three men are "lucky to be alive" after being thrown off their fishing boat off Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station struck an alarm at 13:20 BST on Friday after a crew watched the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men had difficulty swimming in safety while their boat moved on its own.
“We saw the boat spinning around her and imagined the worst,” said the head of Moelfre’s rescue station, Vince Jones.
"Fortunately, the strong winds have already blown the boat out of its reach until we let it down," he added.
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third man, aged 60, was exhausted and found hanging from a buoy without a life jacket.
They all got aboard the coastal rescue boat and were taken back to the rescue station
Mr. Jones said, "The three men who were thrown into the water are fortunate to be unharmed and still alive.
Although the boat engine had an emergency stop square, it broke away from the person who steered the boat when the boat was swinging.
Somebody watched over these men today.
Severely injured - man stabs his ex-girlfriend
A man attacked his ex-girlfriend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife and seriously injured.
As police reported yesterday, the 50-year-old had been given the key to the apartment to get his personal belongings.
Instead, the alcoholized perpetrator cut his ex-girlfriend’s clothes.
When she came to the apartment, he stabbed her twice.
The 44-year-old was injured in the hand and body.
Police were able to arrest the perpetrator.
While the 50-year-old destroyed his ex-girlfriend's clothes, he called his mother.
She then alerted her sister.
Together with her partner, the 45-year-old wanted to reassure her brother.
She couldn’t get him to leave the apartment.
So she went out of the house with her companion.
On the street they met the man’s ex-girlfriend.
When the two women entered the apartment again, the 50-year-old pushed his sister aside and attacked his ex-girlfriend.
Who builds Braunschweig's cheap apartments?
The SPD and the Greens believe that investors should be given much more responsibility in the future.
How do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1,300 cheap apartments in the next few years?
The SPD proposes a "living action concept" at the next Council meeting.
Controversy is programmed.
First and foremost, the question is: who should actually build the cheap apartments?
There has been a lack of regulation so far.
SPD Group Chairman Christoph Bratmann says: "We agree with the Greens: If you want to build on urban areas, you have to designate 20 percent of all apartments as social housing in the future."
However, the cheap apartments can also be created in stock.
The big issue in the town hall, however, according to Bratmann, is: "How do you deal with investors who want to build on private land?"
"We want investors to build at least 10 percent but as much as possible 20 percent of the housing on such land as social housing."
A new urban housing support program, which will cost millions and still needs to be financed, should provide incentives.
The problem, according to Bratmann: "At the moment there is no agreement between the factions."
The CDU wants to make as few regulations as possible for investors.
The Left still wants tough conditions for investors.
Despite this, according to Bratmann, the situation in the housing market is aggravating.
If the action concept is implemented, this will provide additional tasks in the construction administration.
More staff is needed.
It's unclear if we'll get the specialists.
But the program is not yet complete: because the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.
But how can we compensate for the loss of another 1,300 cheap apartments, whose funding will expire in the next few years?
By 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments.
To prevent this, according to the planning policy spokeswoman Nicole Palm, now expiring ties should be purchased from the city.
In addition, it would have to be considered to bring apartments back into the price binding.
This is possible in the West City.
In a moment, the problem could be solved.
Because in the western city deadlines expire at the end of the year.
Around 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price limit for cheap apartments.
Only: this is what the owners, the housing companies do not want.
Because the number of social housing in the western city is again increased drastically, one distances from the goal of the so-called mixing.
A concentration of socially weak people in just a few parts of the city should no longer exist.
The Greens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion.
Group leader Holger Herlitschke says: "For a broad majority, the CDU must join in."
It has concentrated on more building sites for single-family homes.
However, this does not mean that a compromise cannot be reached.
Pokémon Go: A Hunt for Health and Happiness
It is fascinating to see how the world changes.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside to play, but rather prefer to spend their free time staring at screens, has been lamented by many over the last decade.
Pokemon Go is about getting people off the sofa and getting more active.
The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then to video games and finally to smartphones.
Therefore, it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.
I’m referring, of course, to the Pokémon Go madness, an app based on the characters that were first created for the video games in the 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs).
Like many pop culture phenomena, interest declined slightly before the game was released in the US, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.
The market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that overloaded the servers.
Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pokémon that are tracked with a GPS and, once found, can be "photographed" (via a screenshot on the phone) or "captured".
A generation who played the game when she was younger joined the madness and jumped off the sofa for the search.
In the U.S., the game led to a significant increase in steps taken by the “average” person every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, recently told the Washington Post that within two days of launching the game, the number of tracked people exercising for 30 minutes every day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company doesn’t know who is playing Pokémon Go – it just sees the raw data to boost performance.
Many public health education campaigns that want to get people to “take 30 minutes,” “come off the sofa,” and “be active every day” stumbled on deaf ears because many public messages about health are boring and come from people who look miserable.
However, the importance of sports cannot be overstated.
Exercising regularly reduces your chances of developing cancer or depression.
Exercise helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to list here.
But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it gets people to do something outdoors that they enjoy.
Thus, three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine, as well as fun.
Some people even make new friendships on the hunt.
As always, there are grumpy game spoilers who always have to complain about something.
And yes, someone could run against a door.
What's the matter?
There has been a breakthrough.
Even though smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity earlier, they didn’t give us any reason to exercise like this game does.
The new will lose its appeal and use will decline over time.
However, due to Pokemon’s success, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with being active in the real world, helping many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.

Simone Biles wins gold in women's gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all this.
Dynamic on the jumper.
Effortless on the beam.
Breathtaking on the floor.
Brilliant on the whole.
And finally, the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast climbed up to the multiplayer title on Thursday, widening the gap between herself and the rest of the world in front of everyone under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.
Their total result of 62.198 was clearly ahead of the silver medalist and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
The American Simone Biles turns on the floating beam during the women's single multi-fighting final in art gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American to win a multi-fight title and the fifth overall, as she consolidates her reputation of being the best of her generation, or even the best at all.
She burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey came to an end at that moment.
This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who has taken their sports to new heights:
Biles has dominated her sport for the past three years, winning 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises that involve a mix of ambition and precision that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton said of her that she is "the best gymnast I've ever seen."
She was expecting a final test in Brazil, a competition that was not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations.
Not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas, would be seen as a disappointment.
Americans Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the Women's Art Gymnastics Single Multifight Final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday
Biles took the first medal on Tuesday while she served as an exclamation mark at the farewell party of retired team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Although Biles insisted on never planning the future during her long journey to the top, that’s not really true.
Part of their ground exercises – which include their typical Tumbling Pass – are tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic Arena in Rio.
It's no coincidence.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a small child and discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman's mother during a school trip to the gym where Boorman was training, became a force.
She hasn’t lost a multi-fight competition since the summer of 2013, a series of victories that will last as long as Biles wants.
Even though Mustafina led through two turns easily, the picture deceived.
Hovering beams and ground gymnastics - in which Biles holds the world championship title - lurking.
She picked up again with 15,433 on the floating beam - and put another one on it with a 15,933 on the ground.
Raisman gently embraced her as they awaited her final burial — a pure formality — and tears poured on Bile’s shiny red, white and blue eyeliner as the vision she once described in her collection book became reality.
Raisman's performance was a revenge for the last time four years ago, when she fought for third place, but the bronze medal went to Mustafina in a tiebrake.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, who is called "Grandma" by the Americans, had a lead.
After her ground practice, she threw kissing hands to the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes seemed doubtful.
As for Biles, the rapidly expanding tweet of the 19-year-old from the beginning of this week has a whole new meaning:
Police: 3 victims shot in serial killing while listening to music in the car
According to police reports released on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot dead in one of the deadliest attacks in a decade in the first Phoenix serial killing while talking and listening to music in the car.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot dead on June 12 while the car was parked in a driveway, authorities said.
The perpetrator fired eight shots from a handgun while standing on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle, the report says.
Police said the triple murder did not appear to have been the result of a robbery, as the attacker did not take with him the handbags or the $2,900 that were in the possession of one of the adult victims.
Phoenix police spokesman Sgt. Jonathan Howard said the shooting led investigators to take a closer look at whether it was associated with four previous attacks.
A total of seven people were killed and two others injured in nine attacks in predominantly Hispanic residential areas within four months.
"It's happening in a residential area in front of a house," Howard told KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including a late 1990s brown Nissan, a late 1990s black BMW, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to conclude that the attacks were linked and committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized for her injuries and later died.
Liner, 31, and Elli's daughter Maleah died on the spot.
A witness told police that it was not uncommon for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
Authorities also published a police report on the shooting, which targeted an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and is believed to have been the serial killer’s work.
Investigators found cartridge sleeves and secured a bullet from the seat as well as bullet fragments from the engine compartment.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephaly: "It's getting better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and of course his mother.
But like most of his peers, Edmund has microcephaly, the result of a genetic disorder his mother Elizabeth Picciuto knew nothing about during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was, I can’t do that.
I can't do that.
I didn't get into that.
What's not true at all -- of course they got involved," she said.
Her husband Vincent and her were informed that Edmund may never be able to recognize her and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far as to suggest institutionalizing him.
"My first response to that was, 'I didn't know people were still doing that,'" Picciuto said.
Edmund can walk with the help of a walker.
Edmund couldn’t sit or crawl until he was three years old and he still can’t speak.
But he's slowly progressing.
He can walk and cycle with support.
He also loves to play and sing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Edmund invented for "Please sing something to me."
"We're teaching him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not a typical sign language -- she says. Edmund invented a few signs alone.
Microcephaly has a variety of causes: genetic as in Edmund, as well as infections with viruses such as measles or the Zika virus during pregnancy.
Symptoms and prognosis can vary greatly.
It is still too early to say how it will affect the lives of those infected with the Zika virus.
Picciuto remembers the emotional price of an uncertain future.
I kept asking, what will happen?
What will happen?
And she still doesn't really know.
I haven’t asked for the prognosis for a long time because I don’t expect anyone to really tell me.
But Picciuto has a hopeful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zika virus.
It's getting better.
You know it will get better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rains, flooding gives rise to rescues in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rains and large-scale floods in Louisiana forced the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with more rainfall expected throughout Saturday.
Numerous rivers in southeastern Louisiana and the south of the Mississippi flooded their shores, threatening large-scale flooding after extreme rainfall, the National Weather Service reported.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and help to the affected communities is already on the way.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the governor’s Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, said the requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags were increasing.
Steele said that the Tangipahoa community alone had requested ten thousand sandbags.
A flood warning system will be deployed over large parts of southern Louisiana until Saturday.
The weather service reported that an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area.
A flood warning system was deployed in southern Alabama on Friday while it continued to rain in the Mobile area.
The River Comite near Baton Rouge and the River Amite near Denham Springs, both located in Louisiana, are likely to reach record levels over the weekend.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann says both rivers could flood many homes in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said downstream flooding in Ascension Parish poses a danger as these will only flow slowly into Lake Maurepas via the stepped rivers.
The Tickfaw River, south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday at 9 a.m.
Rescue teams were still pulling people out of the floodwaters in the Amite and Wilkinson districts in southwestern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and his stepson were among those rescued near Gloster on Friday.
Hansford, 62, says water from Beaver Creek, which is usually more than 400 feet away from his home, rose sharply overnight.
He said another stepson, who lives nearby, had warned him.
"We woke up and the water was flowing in," Hansford said.
It reached my waist.
His wife told Hansford that in the 48 years she lived there, she had never seen such a high level of the river.
Hansford said that he and his family members had all the disabilities and he was the only one who could swim.
Hansford said emergency responders had rescued all three in a large military truck and taken them to the next fire station in Gloster, where they were housed until Friday.
Krautmann said the flood had “swiftly spread” as there continued to be heavy rainfall and that authorities were considering evacuation instructions.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Livingstone reported 13.75 inches of rain from midnight until Friday morning.
Krautmann said the soil has been considerably soaked by the rains since Wednesday.
Authorities said heavy rains and road floods caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and school failure in five school districts.
CBS subsidiary WWL reported that an associate in Tangipahoa reported 200 flooded houses.
The residents were evacuated to two churches, both of which were now flooded.
The community chief, Robby Miller, said the authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets from flooding.
In the cities of Amite and Hammond, emergency shelters were set up to accommodate the evacuated.
"As soon as the water starts to go back, they will be able to go back to their homes," he said.
In the town of Hammond of Tangipahoa municipality, nearly two dozen roads were closed due to the flood and sandbags were provided for the residents to take with them, who hope to keep the water out of their homes and shops.
"The last major flood we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum of the City Council.
This seems to be a similar incident.
In Mississippi, emergency manager Rupert Lacy of Harrison County said it continued to rain on the Gulf Coast.
According to him, a handful of houses were reported flooded on Thursday, but none have been reported so far on Friday.
Keith Townson, Manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen it before," Townson said, "and it's still coming."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "holed by bullets", survives shooting in Philadelphia
Police say the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, the second time a 6-year-old child has been shot this week.
The boy's grandparents identified him as Mahaj Brown for CBS Philadelphia.
The grandparents reported that Brown suffered several gunshot injuries, including in the loins, leg, arm and abdomen, but that he was conscious when he was transported to the hospital.
"He went through a lot, his little body was pierced by bullets," his grandmother Delores Melendez told the station.
I just can't believe it.
The boy’s condition was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several surgeries.
The boy’s family told the broadcaster that he is expected to recover.
He should have started the first class at a local primary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two at the age of 29 and a 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; the other two victims are in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The boy was found shot in the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old, who is in a critical condition, reports the station.
The other two victims were not in the car, and police are investigating whether one of the injured men could be among the perpetrators.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that there seems to have been a crossfire between several shooters.
Cartridge sleeves for assault rifles traced back to various assault rifles overshadow the crime scene.
It seems that this was clearly an ongoing struggle.
On the street, on both sides of the sidewalk, there were shells.
So there seem to have been several armed fighters here who were very actively involved," police chief Anthony Ginaldi told the Philadelphia police station.
Several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area.
There were no arrests and police are reportedly currently reviewing the surveillance video.
On Tuesday, another 6-year-old girl was hit by a club in her arm while playing in front of her home in the residential area of West Oak Lane.
She is recovering and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That’s what I imagine among the women’s Olympic gymnastics team for more than one reason.
Firstly, I have been at every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant.
And secondly, this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who seemed inspiring to many young girls of other skin color.
The structure of this team, rounding up Aly Raisman who is Jewish and Madison Kocian who is Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally reflects the United States.
It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the forefront of this sport.
For the past four years, the number one female gymnast has been an African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2.
This shows strength.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America cheered.
Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of triple world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez as they delivered unexpected yet masterful gymnastics routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth heterosexual American to win gold at an individual multi-fighting event for women.
Team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We’re experiencing the peak of this sport, but that’s not what gymnastics classes all over the country look like.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison to make it to the Olympic team.
They are the "Last Five" because the next Olympic team will have only four female gymnasts in the team, and this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as coach.
But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnastics players are primarily in private gymnastics clubs, which are maintained by parents who pay for the training, furnishings, travel, clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the coaches and their gymnasticians and families).
The majority of these gymnastics clubs are located in wealthy suburbs that can support the business.
In these clubs, the gymnasts receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment for the families.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started gymnastics.
We must enable the communities of countless young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie to have a more affordable and accessible gymnastics training.
I founded my 20-year-old gymnastics foundation.
At my events, we offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youth (mostly black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high-quality gymnastics to youth who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.
This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.
It’s the inspiration of this team that gets thousands of young girls interested in gymnastics and that’s great.
It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.
It's such an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real portrayal of "Girl Power" by getting the Olympic team gold and thank you, she got so many young girls from different backgrounds motivated to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
Interns Want to Organize Further Strikes After Rejecting Jeremy Hunt’s Proposal
The ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 resident doctors who voted in an election rejected it.
In July, Hunt revealed plans to force the contract, saying that the NHS was in a “nobody’s country” and any further delay would be harmful to employees and patients.
The first resident doctors are to receive a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend work to improve care at unsatisfactory times.
Dr Ellen McCourt, the chair of the BMA Committee on Interns, said in a statement last night: “Interns still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will fuel the current workforce crisis and fail to treat all doctors fairly.”
With only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress must be made and time runs out.
Efforts by the BMA to resolve the disputes through talks met with the government's reluctance to participate and sometimes with deafening silence.
This was one of the promises Jeremy Hunt made last month that his door would always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt must act now, lift the enforcement and address the concerns of resident doctors".
If he fails to do so, the resident doctors have made it clear that they are ready to carry out further action.
The last strike in late April saw a postponement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments as nurses and specialists were involved to provide coverage to doctors on the strike post chain.
The ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting the reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants a better weekly salary for the 54,000 resident doctors who will be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, director general of the NHS staff, urged the resident doctors to end the strike.
Mortimer said: "Work-fighting measures do not achieve anything of little, but weigh on already overloaded teams and service providers and only cause worries, distress and interruption for patients, caregivers and their families."
Over the past two months, we have spoken to the Committee of Interns and have responded positively to concerns about guardianship and whistleblowing with the Ministry of Health and other ministries.
Employers hoped that the continued positive engagement on other key issues - such as posting, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from a occupational break, training kests, mutual recognition of the curriculum, continuing education leave, and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious the employers, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health were with respect to compliance with the BMA agreement in February.
The <0xC2><0xA3>2 per day medication that can lower heart attack risk
Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a <0xC2><0xA3>2 per day medication after authorities recommend administering this to more people for an extended period of time.
The anti-coagulant drug ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.
The drug is already administered for 12 months after a heart attack, which reduces the risk of a stroke or another heart attack.
NHS regulator NICE has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
NHS regulator NICE has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Around 140,000 people suffer a heart attack each year, and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty material in artery walls that form linings.
If the plaque breaks apart, it can cause a blood clot that blocks blood flow to the heart, causing a heart attack.
When the blood clot dissolves, it can flow through the bloodstream and block the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are at higher risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, which is manufactured by the British company AstraZeneca and marketed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots less likely.
NICE’s draft guide, published today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg of ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Center, said: “Despite the availability of secondary prevention, one-quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke – often with disastrous consequences.”
Fear of a recurrent heart attack can have significant negative effects on a person’s quality of life.
Experience shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
Through a preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased to be able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.
Information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years. The draft guidance does not recommend treatment beyond this period.
Culture of Political Correctness Leads to Election Fraud in Muslim Territories
Former Mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year at the instigation of a government report on corruption
A culture of political correctness has led to widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities being knowingly ignored, as a crushing government report revealed today.
Former Cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacks the police, election observers and town halls for ignoring evidence of electoral abuse due to “hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion.”
The former Minister of Integration and Local Government, now an ant-corruption king, said that intimidating voters for religious reasons would be so bad that police should be allowed to set up shut-off tapes outside of polling booths to protect intimidated voters.
He recommends that voters should carry a passport to prove their identity in elections.
Currently, a voter only has to give his or her name and address.
The report suggests applying non-removable ink to a person’s finger when they cast their vote to prevent someone from voting twice.
Whistleblowers should be given more protection, says Sir Eric.
He calls for the press to have more access to community records and decisions from non-official committees or working groups.
"This not only serves to prevent election fraud, but also to protect the municipal government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that comes with it," he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlet election scandal in eastern London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that incumbent mayor Lutfur Rahman should be removed from office after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman had "cynically perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community" and that he had silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobia accusations.
Rahman is said to have led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to vote for him.
Up to 300 votes were either dubious or the result of an imitation in which one person chooses as someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.
He was particularly alarming about the fraudulent letter-voting — in which older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to vote for a candidate of their choice.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system, including holding IDs to prove identity
The report states: “As evidence, pressure has been put on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, to vote according to the will of the elderly, especially communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi backgrounds.
"There was concern that... state institutions would have knowingly ignored such behavior due to 'politically correct' hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including banning political activists from editing postal ballot papers to stop “election harvests.”
The report, which is being considered by Theresa May, also calls for tougher registration checks to prevent the electoral directory from being used for immigration and social fraud purposes.
Consider options to ask voters for your ID before the election.
Use non-removable ink on a person’s finger once they’ve cast their voice to prevent someone from voting twice.
To carry out systematic checks on a person’s nationality to ensure that they are eligible to vote.
A three-year limit on applications for an automatic dial-up.
Ban political activists from processing full ballots and envelopes of ballots.
Give the police the power to set up barriers around polling stations.
A law amendment that facilitates an indictment for intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Photography ban in election stations.
Requirement that only English may be used in voting stations (except Wales).
Increasing training to ensure employees enforce the rule that voters go to the polling booth alone.
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "amazing" that no criminal charges have been filed after the Tower Hamlet case.
"The Electoral Court has declared Lutfur Rahman and his deputy unfit for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices," he said.
He was found guilty for a number of reasons - according to the high requirements in criminal proceedings.
He also criticizes the ineffective "shoot-off controls" of the election registration departments of the town halls.
Sir Eric said: “The court ruling in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal.
Our country, as the mother of parliaments, has a proud legacy, but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and denial by some authorities threaten this reputation.
Crazy after Kate's cyclist doppelganger and other famous doppelganger of Olympic athletes in Rio
Fans of the 2016 Rio Olympics have been disappointed this week by the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has proven to be an impressive double of the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympic athlete this summer is by far not the only gold-fighting athlete to have his own famous doppelganger – at least not if you can believe the social media.
In honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that are currently flickering on our screens, FEMAIL has created a list of Olympic athletes who have more than just a certain resemblance to Hollywood celebrities.
The hunter and the wolf: team member of the U.S. team in archery Brady Ellison, left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since his childhood
In addition to Kate’s doppelganger on the racetrack, many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain archer could be the twin of A-celebrity Leonardo DiCaprio.
U.S. archery team member Brady Ellison has caused a rush on Twitter after images showing him looking incredibly similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star surfaced.
In fact, the archer got the madness on social media and admitted that he has been hearing from childhood that he looks like Leo.
"I myself don't see much resemblance, except for facial hair," Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a handsome guy, so I guess I'll take that as a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly come to the fore this year: the striking similarity between the British long jumper Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina with her large, expressive eyes should be able to go through as a double for the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the swimming pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to glee star Matthew Morrison for years.
One step up: This user believes that Nathan is the "athletic version" of the Inception actor
Another ongoing comparison was made between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who has similarly heavy eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medalist Yulia Efimova shows more than just the sun-tanned skin and blonde hair like actress Annalynne McCord, while American Nathan Adrian was attested by fans to resemble an "athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt."
Strong women: football star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have a similar face shape and eyes
Not the only one: One Twitter user was very happy that others noticed the similarities as well
Theory put into the room: According to this user, there may be a reason for the similarity of the couple
A Twitter user explained her satisfaction that “the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical.”
In fact, American football star Hope Solo and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is nearly identical to that of actress Laura Linney, as well as the gymnastics gold medal winner Gabby Douglas, who has her own beautiful, broad smile similar to that of Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union.
CBC commentator for the Olympics apologizes for his statement that Chinese swimmer "died like a pig"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth place at the dr 4x200m freestyle swimming squadron outraged viewers of Wednesday's CBC live broadcast of the Olympic Games
Canadian broadcaster CBC had to apologize after one of its commentators said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "did off like Mief" and died like "a pig" during the race.
Commentator Byron MacDonalds thought his microphone was turned off when he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m freestyle swimming squadron.
MacDonald, who had been brought on board the CBS commentator team to give more "colour," could be heard saying, "This little 14-year-old Chinese has lost connection, baby."
Too excited, went off like Mief, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second stage of the squadron 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, allowing Canadians to close the gap to China.
Viewers across Canada responded quickly online after being shocked by the tone and language
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Has the CBC commentator just said that the 14-year-old swimmer from China "died like a pig"????
The idiot didn't realize they were still on the air."
Ai Yanhan from China was described as follows at the final 4 x 200m freestyle swimming squadron for women: "This little 14-year-old Chinese has lost the connection, baby."
The criticism of Byron MacDonald on Twitter came quickly and hard, with many addressing him
Twitter users didn't hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: “Wow, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and make us all look like racists.
Shortly afterwards, Scott Russel, who hosted the CBC show, apologized live for MacDonald's comment, saying, "We apologize that the comment was broadcast about a swimming performance."
It was an unfortunately chosen wording, we're sorry it happened."
CBC ended up apologizing over 90 times to the people who responded to the comments on Twitter
Scott Russell apologized on MacDonald's behalf
CBC copied and posted its apologies to more than 90 other Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald's comments
The network also apologized quickly and issued a message.
We sincerely regret that these statements have been made and that it has been made possible for them to be broadcast.
We quickly apologized to our viewers on TV last night and to our followers on social media.
To clarify one thing, Byron’s comments relate to the swimmer’s performance and not to her as a person.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and an unfortunately chosen wording. Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized on the show, trying to justify his remark by stating that it was not his intention that it be interpreted as a personal attack.
"I'd like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made on the CBC Olympics after the women's swimming squad," he said.
“I was referring to the swimmer’s performance and not to her as a person.”
Of course, no disregard was intended and I am very sorry."
Buyer in Primark indignant about woman trying shameless underwear in the middle of business
Buyers didn’t know where to look when a woman took off her clothes in the middle of a Primark to try on underwear.
To make the situation worse, she looked at what it looked like, pulled it out and put it back on the shelf.
She continued browsing and tried four pairs of underpants in a shop at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone.
The Primark store at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone, where the woman tried on the underpants before placing them back on the shelf
A mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman had tried on the underwear, "she got dressed again and left the store without buying anything."
She said, "People couldn't believe what they saw."
Standing in the middle of the sales floor, she took a pair of underpants out of the display, took off her own tights and pants and tried them on.
"She didn't even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there, cheeky like Oskar."
"Everyone stared as she took off the underpants, which she obviously didn't like, as she put them back on the shelf."
She repeated the same with three more underpants before finally deciding that she didn’t like anything, dressing up again and going out.
"She didn't seem to bother anyone watching her -- or thinking about the person who might be buying the underpants she had tried on."
Ms. Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said, "How disgusting to think that someone would take home underpants that were worn by another person and that weren't washed."
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added, "As I noticed, the employees tried to pull the garments out of the sale after she left - which is just as good."
"I would hate to go home with a new pair of underpants and find out that another woman was wearing them and taking them off again and they weren't washed."
A spokesperson for Primark said: “Primark is aware of the incident that occurred in our branch in Folkstone on Tuesday, August 9th.”
All eligible products have been withdrawn from the sale.
How to Protect Yourself from Arms Attacks with Krav Maga
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a bit safer for you.
We spoke with Rhon Mizrachi, a grandmaster of the Krav Maga Association in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
Regardless of whether you are approached from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to turn the skewer for your predator.
When approaching you from behind, the first thing you should do is turn around so that you can see your attacker and “get out of the line of fire,” Mizrachi says.
Then grab the gun between your forearm and shoulder before hitting it in the face with your free elbow.
Then punch him in the groin with your knee and twist the gun out of his hands as the attacker curls in pain, punch him in the face with the barrel and move backwards as they point the gun at him.
For attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the line of fire, grab the gun and twist it so that the attacker cannot shoot.
At the same time, shift the weight to the gun and hit the attacker's chest, then twist the gun out of his grip before moving backwards and pointing the gun at him.
Sounds difficult?
Watch the video to see exactly what Mizrachi is doing.
But keep in mind that in the case of a robbery, it is safest to hand over your money - unless you are a Krav Maga Grand Master.
Traveler Ian Wright scours his tongue for a guide to the dirtiest places in Europe
A British traveler underwent a serious test of his immune system and strangulation reflex by licking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
Moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, scraped his trains on a euro bill, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a flushing knob of a train toilet, and a public phone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.
Before licking off any object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he is going to get into.
But the experiment, filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results to light.
The idea of licking the rinse knob of a train toilet that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely disgusting, but in fact, there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.
During his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about promoting gut bacteria as well as his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked left more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.
Mr. Wright became known for testing the resilience of his gut by traveling around the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
From public railings at railway stations to wash-buttons of toilets, the task definitely put his immune system under a test
In the film, he said: “Already as a child, I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all kinds of things in my mouth, soil, worms and mud water.”
In the film, he certainly lived up to his reputation.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
His test smear showed a luminometer number of over 4,000 units.
In comparison, the luminometer number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to lick after their luminometer count exceeded 4,000 units, while freshly washed hands had one of less than 60.
Mr. Wright and the Finnish dairy producer Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom
In the film, he says, “That comes close to the worst thing I smelled in a toilet.”
There's nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not gonna lick anything here because it's disgusting in here.
"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.
Valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, Juices and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.
We did some crazy brainstorming that ended up saying, "Let's call Ian."
They claim that interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context – the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health, and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary, we were able to provide more information about it to consumers in an interesting way.
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: “Let me say it like this – I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked some of the things I instructed him to lick, such as the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the film.”
Of course, there were things where it was easier to get Ian to lick them and others where this was pretty difficult.
I'm glad we recorded some of these dirty treats on film."
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio, 84 percent of all respondents associated lactic acid bacteria, in particular, with the well-being of the stomach and intestines, and 58 percent said they use at least occasionally products that contain attached lactic acid bacteria.
Asocial family destroyed by delogging social housing in Saltash, Cornwall
An antisocial family left their social housing after a delocation with damages of <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 for terrorizing their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown from their property in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints.
After being forcibly removed from their property, shocked housing cooperative employees found the property in irreparable condition.
The walls had gaping holes, wooden planks were torn open, garbage was scattered on the floor and graffiti was lubricated on the walls.
The family was relocated and it is believed that she now lives in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, who works for property management at Cornwall Housing, said she fears the apartment will no longer be repairable.
She said, “It was an absolute nightmare for the people here and I don’t think people have to live that way.
There are many things to consider, as this property will probably be considered not so beautiful part of Cornwall.
The family is infamous and their reputation is as well.
The couple had three sons living in the apartment in the meantime, and police said the terror the family had inflicted included street fights with baseball bats, intimidating residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking, and excessive screaming, quarreling, and swearing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, received an order for anti-social behavior in June.
In some rooms of the house, which may be demolished, old garbage has been found
In the estate where drugs were traded in the past, the wooden slabs were torn open
Neighbors said they saw them fighting on the street and had to be called regularly to the police
Cornwall Housing forcibly denied her and her partner from the property this week after giving them an extended 11-week period to voluntarily move out.
The delogging was hailed by relieved neighbors who said their lives were made hell.
One said, "They didn't care about anyone."
We lived next to them for 20 years and it was always bad.
The countless times we tell the police here are unbelievable.
“We couldn’t sleep this morning.”
We got up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to that!
Now that they are finally gone, it will be beautiful.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Cornwall Housing’s Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager, said the family had failed to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house to which the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years.
On the overgrown side of the community house, rubbish and old toys were thrown down
He added: “It’s a shame that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for their behavior and that of their family, as a delog is always the last step that Cornwall Housing is considering.
This was a very difficult case, as the behavior was extreme and their actions for their neighbors had to be awful to watch.
I appreciate all the work my team, the Devon and Cornwall police, and members of the community who bravely approached us and gave us the information.
I hope that this development will provide comfort to some neighbors and convey the message that antisocial behavior is not tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20.
A dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the bedrooms of the house after delogging
House management workers will now have to clean up rubbish piles surrounding the house
In 2014, police raided the house and found over 70g of cannabis, as well as scales, paraphernalia, and <0xC2><0xA3>1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined after she confessed to possession of a class B drug on commercial intent.
She claimed that the money was for a tombstone for her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After being homeless, Tanya and her partner are now believed to be living in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many of the room walls of the house were smeared with graffiti.
Police Say They Will Delegate Tenants Who Don't Follow House Rules
Angela Crow of the Devon and Cornwall Police said the delogement was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not abide by the house rules.
"This goes to those who think they can behave without self-accusations, as well as those who have been harmed by such behavior," she said.
The Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal panicked after a low-flying military jet flew over the beach
Sun worshipers in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
A Portuguese P-3C Orion Air Force plane made an incredible crash
The Air Force said it was on a training flight, but insisted that there was no security risk.
This was the moment when frightened tourists began to panic after a low-flying jet crashed over a full beach.
Dramatic video footage showed the military plane flying almost in tangible proximity over the sun worshipers on the beach section in Aveiro in northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers jumped up as they understandably began to worry about the noise of the jet engines, without first seeing what was coming to them through the clouds.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many vacationers who posted videos about the dramatic fly-by on social media, said: “It really flew twice very deep and there was a moment when it looked like it was crashing.”
Nuno Arroja added: “I was just surfing and it felt like the plane was falling on me.”
Tourists on Aveiro beach panicked when the plane came out of darkness and flew incredibly deep
The Portuguese Air Force reported today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to fly so low that it was the only way to detect them.
The spokesman said the jet flew slightly deeper than usual due to the poor visibility caused by nearby surface fires, but the air forces insisted that security was not compromised at any time.
Fires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer, killing four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force reported today that the pilot had to fly so low due to the conditions - strong fog and fire smoke - which limited his visibility
The plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
Supercup: Barca with concerns against Seville
Seville - FC Barcelona is struggling on Sunday for the first step to win the first title in the new football season.
The Catalans are competing in a duel for the Spanish Super Cup away against FC Sevilla, the return game rises three days later at Camp Nou.
The double winner has to renounce Neymar in the competition with the defeated Cup finalist and reigning European League champion, among others, who competes in the Olympic football tournament with Brazil.
Goalie Marc-Andre ter Stegen is also missing.
The German suffered a bandage stabbing in the knee during the training, which at least for the time being clarified the one-on-one question at Barca in favor of Claudio Bravo.
The Chilean international and Ter Stegen have been competing in Barcelona for two years for the status of number one.
Coach Luis Enrique has so far renounced a clear decision in this regard and left Bravo in the league, but Ter Stegen took the lead in most other competitions.
Before the first mandatory game of the new season, the Spanish champions have doubts about the fitness status of the team, which was humiliated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool with 0-4.
Also in the 3-2 test gallop against Sampdoria on Wednesday, Lionel Messi and Co. did not really convince yet.
Sevilla, on the other hand, has to digest the 2-3 defeat after extension in the European Supercup against Real Madrid and aims for a second triumph at the "Supercopa de Espana".
Barcelona is the record winner in this competition with 11 hits so far.
Ma Long in his own league to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new Olympic table tennis champion.
The 27-year-old defeated his compatriot and "title defender" Zhang Jike 4:0 (12.5,4.4) in a one-sided final on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro.
The World Rankings-First won the "Golden Grand Slam" with successes in the World Cup, World Cup, World Tour Final Tournament and Olympia.
Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani.
The two Chinese made it to the final as expected and made the title to each other.
It was clear that for the third time in a row, a Chinese would win the single title under the sign of the Five Rings.
The last non-Chinese on the top Olympics was former SVS-N<0xC3><0x96> legionary Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were left alone on the record, between sets and time-outs they had no coaches with them.
They had retreated to the stands and let their protégés go on their own in fair competition.
"The matches so far I've played for my country."
"In the final, I play for myself," Zhang had consistently said.
After the match, gold and silver medalists with the China flag posed.
The match itself was unexpectedly one-sided.
Ma really struggled with his 28-year-old opponent only in the first set.
After that, he determined the pace on the record and left Zhang from there only 13 points in total.
Due to Ma’s superiority, the expected enthralling match did not develop.
Nevertheless, there were enough breathtaking ball changes to be seen.
Mizutani won the bronze match against 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonov 4:1.
The Belarusian had suffered a rib injury in his quarter-finals against the German European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov, was then in medical treatment, had to "finally" be satisfied with tin.
By the way, the Swedes Jan-Ove Waldner (38/2004) and Jörgen Persson (42/2008) had become Olympic fourths in a similarly high table tennis age.
Donald Trump Admits “Great Problems” in the Election Campaign
The leadership of the U.S. Republicans is plagued by massive worries about losing their majority, even in traditionally conservative states.
Presidential candidate Donald Trump now admitted weaknesses of his election campaign in the former Republican stronghold of Utah.
A rare moment when the usually large-scale and self-confident multimillionaire expressed some sort of concern, as correspondents reported.
After throwing 16 rivals out of the race within his own Republican camp, doubts about his success in the White House battle now grow.
“We have tremendous problems in Utah,” Trump told evangelical Christians he asked for support in major states such as Ohio, Florida, or Virginia.
To blame for false reports about his candidacy, he resumed his well-known media shelves.
Republican strongholds shake
Utah is usually a safe bank for Republicans.
According to a June survey by SurveyUSA, Trump and his competitor from the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, were on par.
Other institutes see Trump ahead, but not with the distance that is common for Republican candidates in the state.
Arizona and Georgia are also at risk.
In an interview with CNBC, Trump responded to the question of how he wants to stop Clinton’s advance again: “Just as I have done so far.”
And pushed behind: this will "either be successful, or I'll have a very, very nice, long vacation."
He does nothing but “tell the truth.”
If it’s not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that’s okay, Trump said.
Then I return to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, the party is said to have threatened Trump to cut funds in support of his election campaign if he could not present better poll scores.
Instead, we want to strengthen the Republican candidates for Congress.
Olympics: Thirst fraud in doping test
The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary commission on the case.
Kenya's athletes are threatened with harm after the second doping affair at the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.
After a scam attempt at a doping control in the Olympic village, Kenya has sent a trainer home.
The International Olympic Committee said it would immediately set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case.
A Kenyan official had announced that former sprinter and current coach, John Anzrah, had delivered a urine sample in the Olympic village under the name of 800-meter runner Ferguson Rotich.
This was reported to the Kenyan team leader by the doping controls.
The IAAF has asked the IOC for information on the case in order to conduct its own investigation, an IAAF spokesperson said.
"Depending on the results of the investigation and the IOC's subsequent actions, the IAAF will make an assessment," the IAAF said in a statement.
"He (Anzrah) went to the doping control station and pretended to be Ferguson Rotich, gave the sample and signed it," said Kenya's chief of mission Stephan Arap Soi.
He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete who was on the World Anti-Doping Agency’s training controls list.
Ferguson Rotich finished fourth in the World Cup over 800 metres in Beijing in 2015.
Four days earlier, Kenyan athletics delegation chief Michael Rotich had been withdrawn from the Rio Games.
He is said to have informed athletes in his country about upcoming doping tests against payments.
According to media reports, he was arrested on his return to Nairobi airport.
Kenya has been under special observation at the IOC for a long time after numerous doping offenses.
In announcing the IOC’s more than 2,000 doping target controls before the Rio Games, it was unusually pointed out that athletes from Kenya and Russia are being targeted in particular.
The World Anti-Doping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country before the Summer Games in Brazil to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.
The law was passed a few weeks before the Olympics began.
As a result, WADA removed Kenya from the list of countries whose doping control is compliant with WADA’s rules.
Kenya is considered a great runner nation.
The country's athletes won the most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing.
A number of ARD television reports have repeatedly alleged that doping funds are easily accessible in Kenya and that there is a significant mentality of sports fraud.
IOC member Richard Pound recently called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had done in Russian athletics.
It was demonstrated that in this sport doping was comprehensive and systematic.
Russia's athletes were then excluded from the Summer Games.
Salzburger "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli
In the Shakespeare Year, the Salzburg Festival presents the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as a tragic love couple, similar to Romeo and Juliet.
A surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical conquers Salzburg: the "West Side Story", Leornard Bernstein's masterpiece.
The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and fulfilled a dream of youth with the role of Mary.
In the orchestral moat the Simón Bolívar Orchestra conducted by the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythm," he enthuses.
We always say that it is very Latin American.
There are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and melody.
It is a wonderful mix, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I would say that we really have Bernstein’s music in our blood!
In this staging Bartoli plays an aged Maria.
She remembers with sadness her love with Tony, while the younger Maria plays and dances.
Mary’s role has always fascinated me.
First, because it is musically exceptional!
And then there was Mary’s personality.
She says it in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright".
So she's smart, of course, naive, and very passionate.
“She is very similar to me, my Italian character, which I have as a Roman,” Bartoli laughs.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It is such an honor for us to work with her.
She is a very generous person.
And Bartoli returns the compliment: "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!"
Conducting is a necessity for him.
You can see it in each of his movements, in his eyes, it is his life!
It is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a cheerful approach to life, which is very important at all!
For the American director Philip Wm. McKinley, the "West Side Story" is highly up-to-date: "This play is about prejudice and fanaticism."
Today we have the refugees, then the Puerto Ricans went to New York, and the New Yorkers didn’t want them.
They are the same topics, and they are as meaningful today as they were then.
59 years later, the piece is still relevant.
London Schoolgirl Joining ISIS Has Been Killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, has reportedly died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said her family learned of her death in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
It was suspected that she was killed by a Russian airstrike in Raqqa, the group's bulwark in the country, ITV News reported Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and died, according to her family, shortly after she planned to leave the war-torn country and return to England.
"One can only hope that the only good thing is in - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks involved in going to a war zone - stopping people from ever making that decision," Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from east London boarded a plane to Turkey and then a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana’s family was told that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria – and became a widow within a few months.
Reid says Clinton will stay with Garland as Supreme Court candidate in case of election victory
Harry Reid, leader of the Democrats in the Senate, is convinced that Democrat presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
The Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland’s confirmation since his nomination by Barack Obama in March.
The majority leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, believes that the next president will appoint the successor to the late judge at the Supreme Court, Antonin Scalia.
Reid said Thursday during a teleconference that he expects Clinton to select Garland "with a certain degree of certainty."
A spokeswoman for Reid later said that he had not yet talked to Clinton about whether she would nominate Garland and he was speculating.
He praised Garland and said Clinton’s team would not cause unrest with a new candidate.
Garland is the Supreme Judge of the U.S. District of Columbia Court of Appeals.
Raid said Republicans blocked Garland’s nomination as laymen and helpers of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also noted that Donald Trump was unsuitable for president.
Treats wants nude calendar for "women and for men"
Treats magazine collaborates with photographer David Bellemere to produce a 1970s-inspired Pirelli calendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, they want to find the next generation of top models for their NU Muses calendar for 2017.
Steve Shaw, editor-in-chief of Treats, told us earlier this year that his nude magazine was different from old-school playboys because "Playboy is for men."
I do this for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar does too.
"We need to return to depicting timeless and classical nudity, where both women and men feel comfortable and inspired by these images of a female body," Shaw said in a press release to the release of the calendar.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit their pictures online or in person at an open casting call in Los Angeles and New York.
Turkey: Kurdish community expects mass exodus
"Those who don't adapt and praise Erdogan sit on packed suitcases," says the chairman of the Gülen-related Foundation Dialogue and World, Ercan Karakoyun.
The Kurdish community of Germany expects tens of thousands of refugees fleeing Turkey to Germany in the short term.
In the medium term, it could even be "some hundred thousand," believes the association's chairman Ali Toprak.
Due to the hard action of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt, the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany.
"In the short term, I expect tens of thousands, and in the medium term, hundreds of thousands of refugees from Turkey in Germany, if the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition," Toprak said.
Because the government already overlaid Kurdish strongholds with punitive actions months ago, 500,000 Kurds are fleeing within Turkey.
After the defeated coup, secular and opposition ethnic Turks were added.
Many will want to start anew in Europe if they continue to be oppressed in Turkey.
"It cannot be that a state that itself accepts refugees produces refugees in its own country," Toprak said.
The head of the association complained of the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in Alevite cities.
Erdogan wants to increase exit pressure on the remaining Kurds.
"They are the last large minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have been exterminated or expelled in the past hundred years," Toprak said.
The head of the association called for the German government to “position itself as sharply as Austria against Erdogan and his supporters.”
In Germany, too, a "witch hunt" against Erdogan critics is taking place.
For the first time in the last few months, I no longer feel safe in Germany.
The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad.
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and opposition members.
The branding as a Gülen supporter destroys teachers and other academics’ professional existence.
"Those who do not adapt and praise Erdogan sit on packed suitcases, by the way, the Kemalists and secularists," said Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the Gülen-related Foundation for Dialogue and Education, the "World".
As the newspaper reports, citing figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior, the Turks constituted the largest group of asylum-seekers recognised for political persecution in Germany even before the coup.
As of June 30, this was 11,386 people and thus almost 29 percent of all recognised asylum-approved (39,625).
This survey does not include those fleeing war, poverty or lack of prospects.
Asylum under the Basic Law is exclusively political, i.e. from the state side, individually persecuted.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: "Go where it hurts"
Strange Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania: The locals get nothing from the summer election campaign with - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to vote the state parliament.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.
In 2021, the state elections will not take place again directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.
Because it is not possible to do more stupidly than before: summer holidays, heat and state election campaign - that bites itself.
The locals, who are supposed to be convinced by the campaigners, are on holiday.
The vast majority of holidaymakers who are in the country, travelling to Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not locals, so they are not allowed to vote for the state parliament.
In addition, there are practical problems: During the holidays, helpers who hang up posters, inflate balloons, distribute flyers and end up counting votes are difficult to find.
By September 4, 2016, the election and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern must once again pass election campaign just past the people.
The hot phase, if you can say it at all, has just begun.
And it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD/CDU coalition, must fear for his office.
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in polls.
It is exciting how much newcomer AfD cuts and what remains in the end coalition-worthy.
Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, is making an almost inconspicuous election campaign, you don't see his big posters.
He travels through the country, distributing roses and chatting with the people, just as his legendary predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.
Otherwise, Seelering has gotten cold feet and blames Chancellor Merkel for the flourishing of the AfD.
Their refugee policy, their “We can do this” has accelerated the rise of the right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the beautiful office.
The CDU with its top candidate, Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced what it is like to campaign at the wrong time in the right place.
She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to major rallies; Merkel’s Bundestag constituency is located in the northeast.
But the target group was not right, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony than Mecklenburg and Vorpommern.
"There was probably the majority from other federal states," complained Vincent Kokert, general secretary of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in the NDR.
But it is also not a pity for anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel.
Otherwise, the North-East CDU largely renounces the usual campaign stands on market squares and in front of shopping centers with umbrellas and balloons.
This, according to Kokert, only plays a "subordinate role".
The Union has also noticed that in the countryside it is breaking down the base, that it has to work hard to find a wire with the people again.
It is like the left, the SPD, the Greens: in the vastness of the country hardly exists.
However, the advice of the CDU campaigner Kokert to his fellow militants is also self-explanatory: "You must go where it hurts, namely where people are: village festivals, golden weddings, every birthday party must be used".
Because there is a lot at stake, Sellering has now called his SPD to a particularly committed election campaign.
In surveys, the Social Democrats were last behind partner CDU (25) with 22 percent and just ahead of the AfD (19).
In the 2011 election, the SPD had clearly won with 35.6 percent ahead of the CDU (22).
The Greens, small party with seven percent in the polls, are likely to make the leap into the state parliament.
They turn the holiday crisis into a modern virtue and largely redirect their election campaign to the Internet.
"Online election campaign," it calls the country's president Claudia Müller.
Otherwise, green campaigners go on a search for local voters among the holidaymakers.
Silke Gajek, the top candidate, is curving through the Mecklenburg lakes with a houseboat and still finds it beautiful.
Their impression: "Election holiday in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a punishment".
B27 refurbishment: restaurants suffer from blockage
There is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is being refurbished.
For those responsible for the construction work, which begins at 5.30 a.m. and ends only around 8 p.m., there is praise everywhere.
"They made everything quite tense," says Elvira Tetzlaff of the jet gas station.
This is a super team.
There is also no delay.
The construction site could be relocated to the south at the beginning of the week at halftime, as planned, by the end of October everything should be ready.
It is also praised for the willingness of those responsible for the construction work, for example when it comes to the establishment of temporary driveways.
Since the construction site moved south on Monday and the blockage of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen was lifted and the connection to Rottenburg has been restored, the traffic situation within the village has relaxed.
Citizens can now travel from Ofterdingen on the B 27 again on both sides.
Escape traffic through the town seems to be going backwards.
"There were some significant complaints," says the deputy chief executive Florian King, responsible for the transport management of the renovation.
The residents of Bachsatzstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to deal with more traffic noise, because many people were looking for slipways and trusted their navigation rather than signage.
As a result, some trucks have become frantic in residential areas.
Since the speed limits were not complied with, the municipality increasingly requested the measuring vehicle from Mössingen.
"There were significant violations," says King, who once informed himself on the ground about the situation.
There are already two to three flashes per minute.
The fastest was at 77 km/h in the pace 30 zone.
Since the construction site moved on, however, it has become calmer.
For the businessmen at B 27, it is only a small comfort that the road is now open again for customers from Rottenburg.
Business people do not like to look into the cards.
But the fact that the B 27 refurbishment has led to sales drops in them lets everyone you ask see through.
However, some are more and some less affected.
Anyone who has less to do with the "end customer", i.e. produces for other companies, for whom the renovation has little consequences.
At the Maier car dealership, Thomas Sulz also speaks of a "maximum slight decline", but also admits that of course "the running clientele is missing".
The locals along the road are the most heavily pounded.
J. Albert Göhner, owner of the steakhouse, formerly Krone, finds clear words.
It is already existentially threatening.
Not only him, but all the restaurants have hit it hard.
The customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.
We have to be happy about every euro turnover.
The loss of sales amounts to "far over 50 percent".
The refurbishment of the road has “thrown back its operation by two years.”
Half of his employees were fired.
If I had a company with 4,000 employees and half of them had been fired, the policy would have reacted differently.
Instead, President Jörg Schmidt responded to a question from Göhner, whether there could be a financial compensation, with the indication that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation on the B 27.
Göhner knows from other counties where such a thing was handled more generously.
With all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.
After all, the family business has been located here since 1715, it refers to its long history.
He can understand that other regular guests now stop by less often because of the complicated traffic management.
If you can't drive here, it's nice elsewhere.
Göhner has no doubt that his regular clients will return after the renovation work has ended.
Despite the crises with BSE and avian flu, Göhner considers the impact of the B 27 construction work on his clientele to be the biggest crisis his restaurant has experienced in its long history.
Six months of construction work, that's already brutal.
In the name of counterterrorism, laws are constantly being screwed on.
After the recent attacks, Interior Minister de Maizière is now presenting a thick security package.
But what does a toleration status have to do with terror?
And what does the coalition partner say about all this?
Thomas de Maizière gives the reconciliator.
All of his proposals are "politically reasonable for the coalition partner," says the Federal Minister of the Interior at the presentation of his new security package.
They don't overwhelm anyone.
Other, more extensive points would first be discussed within the parties.
I also participate in this.
As Interior Minister, however, he is concerned about results and a "achievable consensus" within the coalition.
After the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, De Maizière has let a little time pass before presenting his conclusions on security in the Republic.
But now they are all the more extensive.
Some things are already known, announced, targeted: that a new security authority should take care of the cracking of encrypted communications is not new.
Neither is the fact that Germany has to implement several EU requirements on passenger data and weapons law.
The call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities is also not surprising.
In part, de Maizière is launching a second round of proposals that were not yet possible with the SPD: he wants to criminalize sympathy advertising for terrorist groups and to knock off jihadists with dual citizenship the German passport.
"These will be difficult points for the SPD," admits the CDU man.
He nevertheless considers this reasonable and also demands nothing that the coalition partner has no chance anyway.
De Maizière also presents a few new ideas.
They have it in themselves in part: He plans quick procedures for deportations and more possibilities for detention of people before deportation.
Refugees who are being brought into the country should first have their smartphones checked and disclose social media accounts for a security check.
In the case of tolerations for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to make some even worse than so far - for example, those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers in order to disguise their identity.
Some of them are politically and legally delicate.
Some things also seem unscathed and leave questions open.
And on some points - in the case of the unequal treatment of those who are patient, for example - the question arises: what does this have to do with security and terror?
Yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terrorism.
But there is no denying that the assassins of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
In addition, many people were concerned about security in view of the high number of refugees.
And things that people were deeply concerned with could not be excluded in election campaign times.
Internal security has come to the fore.
Only the attacks in the neighbourhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
The uncertainty is great.
And yes, there are election campaigns.
Union and SPD are therefore increasingly taking a stand on the issue of internal security.
Over the past few days, there has been a lot of tension between the two parties.
First a nasty dispute about the equipment of the Federal Police, then about a security policy idea collection of some Union interior ministers, in which the heads of department also demand a burqa ban and a departure from dual citizenship.
De Maizière also struggles for conciliatory tones here.
He doesn’t think of a double passport.
We have pacified the discussion in Germany.
Reopening them is not meaningful.
And in the case of a burqa ban, he has constitutional concerns.
Whether his own package is constitutionally sound at all corners and whether it is actually "reasonable" for the coalition partner still needs to be shown.
There's a lot in it that could cause arguments.
However, the SPD is also currently trying to establish a profile on the subject of internal security.
Party leader Sigmar Gabriel cautiously signals willingness to talk and says: "The SPD is ready to talk about anything that contributes to further increasing security."
Volkswagen is still shining.
Despite the diesel scandal, the number of deliveries worldwide is rising.
But not all markets are running around.
In the recall action, there is a whirl about a term.
Volkswagen starts in the second half of the year with more subdued deliveries.
Despite the diesel business, Europe’s largest car manufacturer has continued to show an increase in the current year thanks to its many brands and some well-functioning markets.
In July, however, the core brand VW weakened, especially in Western Europe, thus again straining the overall sales, as the Dax-listed company announced.
The VW brand sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles worldwide in July, with 4,49100 cars compared to the same month last year.
In Western Europe alone, the second most important market after China, sales were 14 percent below the previous year’s month.
In the home market of Germany, deliveries fell by almost one-sixth.
Brand sales chief Jürgen Stackmann attributed the weaker figures from July to two fewer sales days in Europe.
In addition, there has been a reluctance to buy in some core markets due to "changed economic conditions".
In addition to the situation surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey, the British vote to leave the EU also burdened, a spokeswoman explained.
In the US, where the exhaust gas affair escalated first, there is also a downward trend.
Big support for VW is the Chinese market.
Overall, the mainly affected domestic brand of Lower Saxony continues to glimpse through the diesel scandal anyway: after the first seven months, only a drop in deliveries of 0.9 percent to 3.37 million vehicles is recorded.
Group sales chief Fred Kappler continued to show an increase in sales from January to July.
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles during this time, 5,904 million worldwide.
Volkswagen had manipulated exhaust tests with a software.
In Germany alone, VW is calling for around 2.5 million cars to be retrofitted to its workshops.
In the course of the conversion, VW confirmed that the conversion of the cars had no negative effects.
After the conversion of the vehicles, there will be no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance.
The car manufacturer issues a "guarantee-equal" certificate to the customer after the conversion, but does not speak of a "guarantee", as it was said on Friday in company circles.
The reason is legal intricacies.
The "Focus" had reported that Volkswagen now grants its German customers a guarantee for converted diesel models.
This was confirmed by VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday.
It was confirmed by the Ministry of Transport that this meeting was held.
"VW must fully comply with the requirements of my commission of inquiry and the KBA."
"Deviations from this are not accepted," said Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) according to the ministry.
VW has assumed the guarantee that there will be no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance after the conversion and that all vehicle type-approval values will remain unchanged.
Volkswagen itself does not use the term "guarantee", as it was called in corporate circles.
With the broad term "guarantee", Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers, for example, come to a workshop with an engine damage for half a year after the conversion - and this could be attributed to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
In the interest of the customer, it is also important to avoid that any other damage, which has nothing to do with the exhaust scandal, creates uncertainty regarding possible warranty regulations, as it was said.
Therefore, VW does not use the term "guarantee".
Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee is demanding penalty interest from wealthy savers in the future - as the second institution in Germany.
Bank chief Josef Paul said on Thursday: “It’s only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros in cash or daily money accounts.”
The Bundesverband Deutscher Banken speaks of an individual case and sees no signal: Normal savers would "not have to fear to pay for their savings interest".
If banks store money overnight at the European Central Bank (ECB), they have to pay it 0.4 percent penalty interest.
From September, Raiffeisenbank Gmund will refund this fee to private and corporate customers for deposits of more than 100,000 euros in current or daily money accounts.
“The first $100,000 is free.”
“The next 100,000 will cost 400 euros a year in the future,” Paul said.
For some time now, he has held 40 million euros, which could be raised from one day to the next and which he cannot use.
"They are in my central bank account and cause 0.4 percent costs," the bank chief said.
"I can't lay down for every million 4,000 euros."
He now passes on the costs according to the polluter-payer principle.
To simply leave the cash in the vaults of the Raiffeisenbank would be far too dangerous: "I've already experienced four robberies, I don't want the fifth!"
Most clients understand and switch to other forms of investment.
Few have moved to other banks.
The Bavarian cooperative association stated: “The ECB’s extreme monetary policy course causes significant costs for all banks.”
Wearing them alone is “permanently impossible in the business world.”
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management, credit cards or transfers.
The Thuringian Volks- und Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land with its Skatbank branch made headlines in 2014 with penalty rates for deposits starting at three million euros.
Michael Kemmer, Chief Executive Officer of the Banking Association, said: "We do not expect private customers to have to pay fees for deposits nationwide, for this reason the competition among banks and savings banks in Germany is far too strong."
A banker said that there is "a client on Lake Tegernsee who is somewhat more luxuriously equipped with wealth."
“This can be a problem for a small bank” if it keeps money for free.
Founded in 1911, the cooperative bank Gmund has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
Well-known actors, athletes and entrepreneurs live in the region.
"At the moment, no other banks are known to charge a fee compensation for deposits from private customers," spokesman Ernst said.
Uwe Fröhlich, president of the Federal Association of German People's Banks and Raiffeisen Banks (BVR), had stated at the end of June: "The threshold to go to the negative towards the private customer is very, very high."
The competition is tough, and it threatens the migration of investors to the competition.
Customers in Germany will not like this broadly.
Destination records: who actually buys records?
Lonely middle-aged men love plates.
Before you hurry to the comment section to sow it with harsh insults under the pseudonym NotAllSingleMenMedium Ages, this statement derives from current data.
According to YouGov, the much-discussed resurgence of records is not due to a boom in millennials who want to welcome the news of physical objects, but to midlife nostalgia.
Those who have recently purchased a record are likely to be between the ages of 45 and 54.
In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely buyer group.
It’s also not a hoarding by hobby collectors – it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers are more likely to keep their feelings to themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).
But are the results of YouGov correct?
If this blog were a news report on television, the camera would follow me as I walked in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest gray suit, and wildly gesturing before stopping, holding my hands, and saying something decisive like, "So, let's take a closer look at it."
So, let's take a look.
Even though the heart of Sohos is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where formerly independent sellers were based - there are still a handful of fantastic record specialty stores.
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part, where I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to assess their age and mind by observation.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I follow from Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (data number: eight middle-aged men, one woman, presumably around 20), is for a day for a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.
Is he a collector, I ask?
"I guess so," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not follow him home), dress the walls of his living room.
The reason he owns such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records that he could not afford when they appeared and buy again items that he sold when he was young and broke.
“A lot of things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12, things that I was probably a little too young to buy,” he says.
He agrees that those who buy records are more introverted and like to spend time alone, adding, "I don't smoke and I don't drink very much.
This is my truck.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets apply to the YouGov profile.
However, he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media hpe, people who have heard about the comeback and see themselves prompted to buy their old records again.
Of the conversations I've had, people usually got rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again," he says.
That would explain the boom in followers of the record revival of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional significance of records?
It only takes a few seconds in a store like Phonica to realize that record stores provide a soothing community of like-minded people.
According to Wez, some of the older customers took offense at the contactless payment system.
Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record covers, of objects that evoke happy youth memories.
"I think sometimes it can be filling a void or possessing material possessions as a kind of consolation," says Wez.
This is the case with me as a collector and I think it is the case with many people.
It is an easy way to engage spiritually.
"We are like their social workers!" flutters an employee from a pile of records.
An April ICM survey revealed that nearly 50% of people who bought a record last month haven’t listened to it yet.
The survey also found that 41% own a turntable that they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not own a turntable.
At this point in the news report, I would probably look very worried as I scroll through a pile of bossa nova compilations.
Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (data count: three middle-aged men), has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the revival.
"Someone just recently came in here and said, 'I don't own a record player, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead record so I can put it on the shelf,'" he says.
This is not a large percentage, but it definitely happens.
More product-intensive, less music-intensive.
We have people who say, "I don't have a turntable."
They're younger people, not older ones, coming in slowly.
Fopp, who devoted almost an entire floor to the records, has a more colorful audience than I enter.
There are couples around 70, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Even though the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the aforementioned stores – Wild Beast’s latest synthesizer- and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz roars out of the speakers – it’s good to see such diversity among customers.
None of them looks particularly lonely, but nagging psychological traumas are difficult to detect when standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been running around in the store for a few minutes, looking at the variety of records for sale.
She is more likely to do a window shopping than a large purchase.
She doesn’t earn much, so collecting records isn’t a real option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It's easy to listen to music from a computer or in other ways, but the beauty of records is..." she drifts off with a sigh in love.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stop is a store that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While appearing to pattern the jeans hotpants, I watch a group of young teenage girls grouping around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter consider buying a Crosley turntable.
To the left is a staircase, a wall full of records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential records for an average collection.
No one looks at them – maybe because they’re just purely decorative, some so far up that it’s impossible to touch them.
It's pure "plate art".
But considering that any attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and send some customers into the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain about.
It’s no surprise that a population that has more time and money than others is also the one that spends the most on luxury items such as plates.
Even though my research has shown that the results of YouGov are correct, they do not take into account, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record lovers who exist in reality, record stores and online forums.
These people probably work hard at school or in offices.
They certainly don’t spend their Thursday morning strolling through Berwick Street record shops and scrolling through records while avoiding the staring gaze of a sinister, 30-year-old fake presenter, who rises above the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Greenland shark is the longest-living vertebrate - video report
Scientists say the Greenland shark has the longest lifespan of any vertebrate on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who is studying sharks, says the record was set by a female who is believed to be between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long.
French court rejects offer on demolition of shops in jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected an offer by the Calais authorities to tear down dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Calais jungle, where thousands of refugees live.
At a court hearing this week in Calais, authorities argued that the state should be authorized to tear down 72 temporary stores where people inside the warehouse sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.
The Calais Prefecture argued that these places should be demolished because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which would pose a fire and medical risk.
Humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important because the free meals offered by the state-sponsored association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.
They also pointed out that the temporary shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need.
A court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of people running the 72 provisional business, but admitted that the Calais prefecture's concerns were "absolutely comprehensible."
Judge Jean-François Molla said grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than just feeding people who “live in extremely precarious conditions.”
He said the areas provide quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by the low tear was the camp’s Jungle Book Kids’ Café, which is non-profit-based and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes, as well as advice on asylum matters for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the Kids’ Café.
In a letter to the Guardian, it said the closure "would be a disaster for these children, the youngest of whom are eight years old."
The two aid organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp has risen to over 9,000 - the highest number so far - after a steep increase in new arrivals during the summer.
Despite Olympic disappointment: Martin remains combative
Despite his disappointing appearance in the Olympic time trial, cyclist Tony Martin does not want to be beaten.
"I will keep my eye on the World Cup, remain confident and continue to fight," the 31-year-old wrote on Facebook on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro.
He has no explanation for his miserable twelfth place at the Sugarloaf.
"I honestly find it hard to comment on yesterday's time trial," Martin said.
He had to calmly analyze the reasons that led to the debacle.
At the World Time Trial Championships in October in Qatar, Martin wanted to compete for the title.
“I’m going to look at everything we’ve changed lately.”
"This also includes my position," wrote the three-time time trial world champion, who lost more than three minutes to Olympic champion Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland) on Wednesday in the 54.5 km.
Olympics: Tennis professional Siegemund misses semi-finals
Laura Siegemund's triumphal move ended in the quarter-finals of Rio: the World Rankings-32 from Metzingen missed by a 1:6, 1:6 against Monica Puig (Puerto Rico/WTA no.
34) the semi-final of the Olympic tennis tournament clearly.
Siegemund, who was plagued by back problems, was only able to pass through her service once and seemed powerless compared to the previous laps.
On Thursday, medal hope Angelique Kerber (Kiel/No. 2) had the chance to jump into the preliminary round.
The Australian Open winner met the British Johanna Konta (No. 10).
Tommy Haas was the last German tennis professional to win a silver medal in Sydney in 2000.
Two German DTB starters in the quarter-finals of summer games had been there last in 1992.
There has never been a German duo in an Olympic singles semi-final.
Group joins start-up for live video game broadcasts
Watching other people play video games is a huge trend – and Microsoft also wants to benefit from it.
The technology group buys the start-up Beam, which specializes in this hobby.
How much money is flowing for the acquisition, Microsoft did not announce on Thursday.
Beam launched its offering in January and already has more than 100,000 users.
You can watch others play, but you can also intervene yourself.
For example, they can give up missions to players and confront enemies, as well as provide equipment.
Activision Blizzard launches a new HD video service for the booming world of e-sports.
On the way to the global media event, Facebook should help.
The advertising industry is already listening.
Employees of the start-up, previously based in Seattle, Washington, are moving to Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, California, according to Beam co-founder and CEO Matt Salsamendi.
For the customers, nothing will change with the takeover.
Beam will be integrated into the video game department around the Xbox console, according to Microsoft.
The live streaming video game activity market is currently growing rapidly.
Well-known platforms are Twitch and YouTube Gaming.
Twitch was purchased by online retailer Amazon in 2014 for nearly a billion dollars.
YouTube Gaming is part of Google’s parent company Alphabet.
Here comes the Enforcement Trailer
Germany’s speedometers have to adapt to the next generation of speedometers: In various federal states, including Hesse and Brandenburg, new flash devices are being tested, which are supposed to transfer speedometers particularly effectively.
The futuristic-looking enforcement trailers of the company Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used, for example, at accident centers where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.
For example, at motorway construction sites or bridges to be refurbished with temporary speed limits, there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that the speed limit is adhered to with a stationary speed camera.
However, a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or expensive.
The Enforcement Trailer is self-sufficient: Its battery lasts for five days during continuous measurement, the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem.
With laser measurement technology, all vehicles can be detected simultaneously across several tracks.
Variable speed limits as well as transit bans by time, lane and vehicle class can also be monitored.
According to the manufacturer, the trailer can be moved with any car with trailer clutch.
So that it is not simply stolen, it is lowered in measurement mode, so that the wheels disappear in the armored and, by the way, also shot-proof outer shell.
In addition, a built-in alarm system is designed to protect the speed camera from vandalism.
According to Vitronic, the trailer has been tested in various federal states since 2015 and is now also in use.
Foreign authorities are also flashing with the new technology: France recently reordered 100 pieces, after an order of 150 pieces last year.
Great Britain gets silver in 7th Rugby after Fiji Masterclass gets gold
The impressive performance of the UK in 7th Rugby came to an abrupt stop at the final hurdle in the form of the Fijis in the final on Thursday evening, when they were beaten with a score of 43-7 at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji gave a master class in handling, side-stepping, backing, line running and raw power to win gold – their first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat was sweetened by the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament, beating New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-finals on the same day, could fall back on them in the final.
But regardless, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in best form at this form.
It might be a comfort for GB - but it probably won't - that at least one Briton will have a gold medal hanging around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's head coach Ben Ryan, the former boss for England from Wimbledon.
GB had a difficult path behind it.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens.
They only lost one here.
This slap will hurt, but the progress is amazing.
Fiji started wonderfully and had the attacks of GB bounce off out of fun.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and Co., it felt like you were running in on-going buses. The World Series winners went up 5-0 when Osea Kolinisau crawled in the corner.
With four minutes left, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right-hand corner, which he converted.
12-0 and GB barely touched the ball.
A prolific tackle by Mitchell stopped the mountain by man Leone Nakarawa from scoring a third goal, but it only stopped Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua left a touchdown in the right corner and it was 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new one since the restart and there was still over a minute of playing time...in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou pressed through more weak tackles from the GB team and stormed to the line to make a goal.
The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.
It’s like Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB is still learning.
That's the way it is.
GB made fundamental changes at the halftime and closed the Fijian gap...for a full four minutes, which was good for the ratios of the first half, until Joshua Tuisova passed through after a brilliant interlude from Fiji.
Dan Norton started a try for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game has long been in favor of the South Seas islanders, whose fans sang, waved flags and danced on the grandstand.
It was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fiji.
Mata Viliame set the i-tip with another attempt in the last seconds.
The whistle sounded, the Fijis hugged each other and GB kicked crushingly beaten in the lawn.
Earlier that day, Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi-finals by 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa out of the race in a narrow semi-final match - Britain's conversion of the difference.
Kyle Brown brought the boxes forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footwork and scored a goal under the posts in the second half.
A brilliant late tackle by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning Inspired by Fighting the Trainer's Cancer to Rudder Victory
There will be no more emotive gold than in these games and that means something.
From the first rudder strike to the last, 220 hard hive that go down in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found additional significance in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.
Even if it was only the two who were at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. The coach Robin Williams’ echo was omnipresent when they rowed for the second Olympic gold in a row without a Steuerfrau, the first women in the history of British sport to set such a benchmark.
Their dominance was absolute, at least their 39th undefeated stake, which is also unprecedented.
What we see are two brilliant athletes sliding over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not fully reflect the way of triumph.
Behind every gold in rowing is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to the incremental progress that makes the difference and there was no one more helpful than the coach who did not know 30 months ago if he would survive that day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer.
As he said, he was risky.
I had bladder cancer that is surgical and they did.
If you don’t, it spreads everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes the outlook a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio were fortunate to be able to begin his treatment in early 2014, outside the season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, if that is the right term at all in such circumstances.
I needed money, so I had to get better soon.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital, walking around on the station – 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said a few steps would suffice.
That's how it starts.
Rowing itself is a challenge, but that makes it even bigger.
In the immediacy of the victory, her first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nerve-wracking morning talking a little more than usual and trying to process his own fears.
Stanning, who was on a mission in Afghanistan as a captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment, said, "I was an emotional wreck this week. That may be a bit extreme, but it means so much."
It just repeats how much that means to me, how much Helen and Robin and I have worked.
It was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anyone, so a big thank you goes to him. He's the best coach in the world.
I couldn’t have wished for a better person to train or a better coach.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the last five years.
The pair had a tough rhythm that their opponents could not keep up with.
Even in the last 500 metres, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started unlocking, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very trapped at the moment.
Helen called out, "Stay in the process, stay in the process."
It's really important not to get carried away.
We had a good start and at the same time we weren’t looking to do something great.
We didn’t want fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, which we did.
The couple will take a year off before making decisions about their future.
Glover has to appear at a wedding next week, her own with TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn’t mean to say it was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
In London it took about six months to realize that I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new to me and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes.
That feels so much better," she said.
Provided exemplary clarity for 31 years
The managing director of the water-purpose association "Viitensteingruppe", Ruppert Göller, retires.
The association is considered "exemplary throughout Bavaria".
A small Franconian drinking water association as a model for the large water producers.
So it was said some time ago in the original tone in a contribution by the Bavarian Radio.
A little later, the Water Forum of the Government of Lower Franconia honoured the purpose association.
The work of the Veitenstein Group was considered "exemplarious throughout Bavaria".
Rupert Göller, who was an employee for 31 years, 28 years as managing director, is behind all of this.
He was retired at the age of 65.
The drinking water association of the Veitenstein Group, based in Kottendorf, the municipality of Breitbrunn, produces about 150,000 cubic meters of water annually and supplies 32 towns and hamlets with about 5500 inhabitants.
Member municipalities are the municipalities of Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach.
There are water supply contracts for other cities and municipalities.
The current chairwoman, Breitbrunn’s mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller had been hired as a water caretaker in 1985 and had already been appointed as Managing Director of the purpose association in 1988.
"His duties have been very diverse and they ranged from water pipe construction and maintenance work to office and organizational activities, budget preparation, calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends," the chairman said.
Among the outstanding events mentioned were the commissioning and inauguration of the new wells (1994), the purchase of land in the area of the new wells (1998) and the compensation of farmers, the renovation of the high tanks (1999), the new acquisition of a central computer control system (2004) and the partial renewal of water pipes.
There was no stopping and innovations were repeatedly accepted because water meant life and drinking water was the most important food.
In her laudation, she praised Göller’s faithful, reliable and correct service over 31 years.
He has committed himself with a lot of heart for his water-purpose association and he has lived the water-purpose association as if it were his own company.
A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the success concept of the Veitenstein Group for nitrate reduction in front of the water forum of the district of Unterfranken.
He received a lot of recognition and praise for this.
Rupert Göller, for his part, praised water guard Alfons Griebel, who had worked with him for 28 years.
He's the best waterguard and he was a loyal kid.
Together we were an unbeatable team.
From his point of view, he described the construction of wells and the restructuring of the purpose association as highlights.
However, the biggest challenge and the most difficult deployment were the pipe breakage at the high container near Kirchlauter on January 3.
It will have to work at minus 17 degrees all night long so that the towns can be supplied with water.
The supply of Neubrunn was once only maintained because the high container of Pettstadt was filled with hoses.
The management of the Drinking Water Purpose Association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who succeeds Rupert Göller.
Soprano Anna Netrebko openly deals with her son Tiago's autism - and turns to other affected parents: "You must have the courage to talk about it."
"Medicine has made great progress," the 44-year-old told the Italian newspaper "Corriere della Sera".
When the disease was detected in her son, she believed she had to die.
However, the now eight-year-old Tiago has made good progress and is now studying privately in New York, where there are the best therapists.
"To give an example, if I ask him something that was two years ago when I sang at Milan's Scala, he doesn't remember anything," Netrebko said.
He is the happiest man on earth.
Tiago comes from Netrebko's connection with the bass baritone Erwin Schrott.
She is now married to the tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Relationship status in Bargteheide - Man shoots at life partner
A 35-year-old man shot his partner around 10.45 a.m. on Friday in an apartment building in Bargteheide (district Stormarn) and fatally injured her.
"The man himself called us and stated that he had shot his life partner," a police spokeswoman said.
The perpetrator was on the run, after which he was publicly searched.
By now nationwide, because Sven S. could be on the road by car.
The man is about 1.80 meters tall, muscular, brown-burnt and has a baldness.
Police have released a photo of him.
However, it is a few years old.
Meanwhile, the man is wearing a bald man.
The man should not be addressed directly.
He could still carry the gun with him, according to the police.
If you see Sven S., call the 110.
The police are talking about a "relationship act."
The victim was born in 1988 and the perpetrator in 1981.
The relevant police in Lübeck initially did not want to provide information about the crime or the relationship between the perpetrator and the victim, but they confirmed that a person had been killed.
"It's a murder offence."
"We don't say anything more at the moment," said a police spokeswoman in Lübeck.
According to eyewitnesses, a Special Operations Command (SEC) was at the scene.
Steel - Lights for the German steel industry
The crisis-stricken and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared millions of additional costs.
Financial burdens threatening the industry from the green electricity subsidy are off the table.
It remains for the exemption from the renewable energy transfer at the existing plants for the so-called own electricity production in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister of Economics Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday edition).
“I’m really happy that we finally achieved this after two years of tough negotiations.”
The European Commission had therefore initially planned to ask steel producers who use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption to pay.
According to the German industry association, the steel industry faced additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year.
Gabriel told WAZ that there is now a principle agreement with the EU Commission after discussions with Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
Only when the generators in the steelworks are replaced will an EEG surcharge of 20 percent be incurred.
But this is also not raised in the steel industry.
The IG Metall welcomed Germany’s agreement with the EU Commission on Own Power Generation.
This largely stipulates the status quo of the previous regulation.
“Gabriel’s successful efforts for the steel industry are particularly important.
“In view of our ‘steel is the future’ campaign, this is a first step.”
“Others must follow.”
"Climate and employment targets must also be weighed in the reform of the emission trading system," said IG Metall CEO Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt.
Since the 2008 financial crisis, the steel industry in Europe has suffered from overcapacity and considerable price pressure.
Last year, the situation further aggravated when the world’s largest producer country, China, threw steel on the world market in bulk in the face of weakening domestic demand.
European manufacturers accuse Chinese steel companies of price dumping.
Over the course of this spring, the situation has been somewhat relaxed.
On the one hand, import duties imposed on import steel have had an effect, and on the other hand, the economic outlook in China has improved.
It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.
German industry leader Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.
Lately, prices would have stagnated again.
The industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.
Thyssenkrupp did not want to rule out closures of individual plants.
At the end of 2015, the German steel industry employed around 86,000 people.
In July, the German steel manufacturers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.
At 3.4 million tons, they produced roughly six percent less raw steel than in the previous month, according to the German Steel Association on Friday.
After a short increase in May, the amount produced decreased for the second month in a row.
Since the beginning of the year, production has been two percent below the level of the previous year.
The association expects an increase in output in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation.
Community, Spirit, Health: Singing is Good for Seniors
Ursel Kipp has been singing her whole life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, in the teaching degree she took up the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.
"Singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.
After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful, and overall more alive, she says.
By the way, she does something good for her health and her spirit.
Because singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler of the Deutsche Seniorenliga.
Most seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of the music with like-minded people, Hackler describes.
Through regular gathering, seniors can establish and maintain social contacts.
Because social and family structures often dissolve in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
Ursel Kipp has also made this experience in her choir: "To agree and organize, to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together".
Singing can be exhausting in a positive sense, says Hackler.
Seniors train deep and controlled breathing.
Those who regularly demand their lungs do not get out of breath so quickly in everyday life.
Even when it comes to preserving the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an optimal hobby.
Singing often has a very special effect on the elderly, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Labour Association of Senior Organisations.
In the older generations, singing together was much more important, it was part of everyday life, both in school and in leisure time, she explains.
Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs awakens many memories in older people, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.
Through lyrics and especially melodies, even people with dementia remember long-time events.
In addition, singing demands a special performance from the head, explains Lenz.
Focusing on one’s own voice and on a predetermined rhythm at the same time and adapting to the other singers – this is a great cognitive challenge.
Especially older people who live alone practice not only to focus on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition you get from singing in the choir, says Hackler.
An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.
Self-esteem also grows through singing in the choir.
Showing myself: When I practice for something for a long time, I get better and grow beyond myself – this experience strengthens.
So there are good reasons to start singing, there are plenty.
Anyone who wants to try out a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent, Lenz advises.
You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who hears when a sound goes wrong?
Looking for the right offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.
If someone from the circle of acquaintances sings in a senior choir, you can simply join in.
Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the area.
Anyone who wants to sing in a church choir can contact the congregation or the church leader directly.
Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.
If you do not have access to the Internet, you can ask your family, friends or neighbors for help with the Internet research.
If you want to sing, you should definitely join a choir, Hackler advises.
Singing does good to the soul and has something liberating - that applies to any age.
Cats are more sensitive than hangovers to cries from young animals
Biologists in Hanover have investigated the effect of calling cat babies on adult animals.
To their surprise, the miauling did not leave the males cold either - but, unlike the females, they always behaved the same.
Female cats can detect the level of excitement of cat babies by miauling the little ones.
They react ten percent faster to sounds from kittens who feel that they are in great need, as scientists from the Veterinary University and the Medical University of Hannover (MHH) have found out.
Cats also respond to the calls of kittens - but always the same.
"Apparently, the acoustic differences between miauling fewer and heavily aroused young animals are either imperceptible or insignificant for the males," said biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH.
She is the first author of the study, which was published this Friday in the journal "BMC Evolutionary Biology".
In a previous study, the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of the kitten screams differs with the urgency of their need for help.
A total of nine adult cats and eight kittens from the animal husbandry of the MHH were observed.
On the one hand, they were played by little ones, who were taken out of the litter box for three minutes and separated by mother and siblings.
On the other hand, they were confronted with screams from more aroused kittens, which were additionally raised.
The researchers consider their findings meaningful despite the small sample.
"All females, even those who had no offspring of their own, responded differently to the screams," Konerding said.
They turned to the loudspeaker more quickly when it played the calls of the much more excited kittens.
This ability may be congenital or may develop with sexual maturity.
"A surprise was that the males reacted at all," said the biologist.
In the past, scientists have investigated the reactions of women and men to baby noises on several occasions in humans.
Also, some studies showed that women responded more sensitively to infants, whether they were already mothers or not, reported the biologist Marina Scheumann.
Podolski wins Supercup with "Gala"
Hakan Sükür is a football legend in Turkey.
In Turkey, an arrest warrant has been issued against former football star Hakan Sükür.
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
For the first time after the coup attempt, an important football game will take place in Turkey.
Before the archrivals' duel between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolski's Galatasaray Istanbul for the Super Cup in Konya, the official line is clear: "Business as usual" is on the go.
Already in the imposition of the state of emergency after the attempted overthrow in July, the government asserted that the everyday life of ordinary citizens should not be affected.
But this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is being blamed for the coup attempt.
There is also no stopping before football.
The prosecution issued an arrest warrant against the former starfighter Hakan Sükür.
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
Suzur is said to be a supporter of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is blamed by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the coup attempt.
Although the state of emergency, initially imposed for 90 days, is still valid until October, in fact, it has virtually no effect on the lives of most Turks.
The “democracy watches” in public squares across the country on Wednesday declared Erdogan to be ended.
The sport, like the whole country, is divided into supporters and opponents of Erdogan.
Particularly fans of the Besiktas workers’ club traditionally do not count among the president’s friends.
But what unites most of the Turks in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military coups.
Even the fans agree - whether their heart beats for Galatasaray or Besiktas.
With the cup winner "Gala" it will be especially important for Lukas Podolski.
The Kölner proved his athletic value in the past season: With 17 goals and nine assists in all competitions, the 31-year-old finished his first season as top scorer of his club.
In the final against Fenerbahce, he scored the 1-0 win.
The newspaper "Fanatik" hailed him: "He was the best on the pitch."
He finished the season in an excellent way and secured his team the cup.
Thanks to "Poldi", the disappointing season for the record champion found a conciliatory conclusion.
After the preliminary round K.o in the Champions League, the "Lions" also retired early in the Europa League.
In the Süper Lig, it was only enough to rank sixth.
The season was not good.
The cup was the only way to win.
"We did that and that's the most important thing," Podolski said.
For Master Besiktas, the game year went better.
Especially thanks to Mario Gomez, who set the basis for the 14th title with 26 seasonal goals as the Super Lig scorer king.
This is also why fans continue to hope for the return of the 31-year-old.
Gomez, who was signed with AC Florence and only loaned to Besiktas after the coup attempt, announced that he would not return due to the political situation in the country after his EM holiday.
"If Mario wants to come to us, he just has to say it," said Kicker, head of the club, Fikret Orman.
However, the striker would have to be willing to renounce around a third of his estimated annual salary of 7.5 million euros, Orman clarified: "We cannot pay his salary at Florence."
In spite of doping, these athletes still have medal opportunities at the Olympics in Rio
The 34-year-old Justin Gatlin had already been suspended twice for doping (2001 and 2006).
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblower Julia Stepanowa is not allowed to start in Rio.
Other convicted athletics sinners can only laugh at it - they are fighting for medals in Rio.
Doping continues to make headlines at the Rio Olympics.
Russian swimmer Juliya Yefimova, who had sued for her right to start just before the games after a doping lockdown, was ruthlessly whistled out at her start (100 meters chest).
There was a quirky scenery: with an upset smile, she was still struggling in the hall and had provoked with her appearance.
When it was determined that she would not pick up gold, the audience burst into a cheering storm.
But there are many other athletes who, despite their doping history, will compete at the Olympic Games in Rio.
Here is an overview:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100-m relay/USA): The 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in athletics.
He has been banned for doping twice (2001 and 2006 to 2010).
Since his ban, the 2004 Olympic champion and former world champion has been running even faster than before, he is the world’s number one over 100m in 9.80 seconds and is regarded as Usain Bolt’s biggest challenger.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100m relay/Jamaica): The two-time Olympic champion and seven-time world champion was suspended for six months in 2010 after she was proven to take the painkiller oxycodone.
She had severe toothache after surgery, the 29-year-old defended herself.
Sandra Perkovic (discuss/Croatia): In 2011, the Olympic champion from 2012, world champion from 2013 and European champion from 2010 to 2016 was tested positive for the banned stimulant drug methylhexanamine.
Perkovic denied the deliberate intake and was suspended for six months.
This year’s four biggest throws are on the account of the big gold favorite.
LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400-m relay/USA): The Beijing Olympic champion and two-time world champion over 400 m, had been tested positive in 2010 and suspended for 21 months.
A means of penis enlargement was responsible, Merritt asserted.
This year, the 30-year-old over 200 and 400 m is the fastest man in the world to date.
Ivan Tichon (hammer throw, Belarus): Hardly any athlete has been denied so many medals afterwards.
Tichon lost his 2005 World Cup title nine years later after he was diagnosed with testosterone doping.
The now 40-year-old also had to give up Olympic silver in 2004 because of steroid doping and the EM title in 2006 because of testosterone abuse.
He was also awarded the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games due to a ruling of the CAS International Sports Court.
With 80.04 m, he is ranked second in the world rankings.
Liu Hong (20 km walk, China): The world record holder and gold favorite was tested positive only in May, but is still allowed to start in Rio.
The 29-year-old world champion found evidence of taking a banned dietary supplement, the ban of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) was mild and expired on July 13.
Bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian woman injured - Several dead
The Austrian embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, said the spokesman of the foreign ministry, Thomas Schnöll, Friday early.
She suffered cuts and was treated in the hospital, but was able to leave it again.
She planned her return home in early September.
Whether the further explosions on the tourist island of Phuket as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon also affected Austrian citizens is unclear for now.
The foreign ministry is in constant contact with the local authorities in this regard, according to Schnöll.
In Hua Hin, about 200 kilometers south of the capital Bangkok, two bombs were first exploded in a nightclub on Thursday evening.
According to police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.
In the early hours of Friday, two explosives went up again, killing another person, according to the authorities.
A bomb explosion was also reported from Phuket in the morning.
In the detonation near the popular beach of Patong, a taxi driver was injured according to police reports.
In Surat Thani, on the southeast coast of the country, another bomb exploded, killing an urban employee.
According to the authorities, the explosives exploded in a flower bed in front of the coastal police station.
Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the southwest coast and in Chumphon on the southeast coast caused several injuries.
It is believed to be related to the explosions in Hua Hin, it was said.
"The bombings carry the same signature," Army General Danai Kritmethavee told journalists on Friday morning.
"We assume that this is a coordinated attack."
It’s too early to comment on possible motives, but it’s probably the actions of Muslim rebels.
Thai media also wanted to identify a pattern typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.
The Thai police, on the other hand, said the attacks were not related to the Islamist insurgency movement or international terrorism.
"This is only local sabotage, which is limited to limited areas and provinces," a spokesperson in Bangkok said.
Rather, it is assumed that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military junta.
In recent days, the authorities have received intelligence reports of upcoming attacks in the south of the country, but they were not informed of the exact time and places.
It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.
Police instructed their officials across the country to strengthen security around key government buildings as well as airports, railway stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.
In Thailand, there are always smaller bomb attacks, but they are usually not aimed at tourists.
In Hua Hin lies a palace that was used for years by Thailand’s King Bhumibol Adulyadej.
After the bomb explosions, the Austrian Foreign Ministry recommends on its homepage that the instructions of the Thai security authorities be strictly followed.
High security risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and surrounding areas.
After clashes between security forces and Muslim populations, it is not advisable to make unnecessary trips to these provinces.
Increased security risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.
This will continue to give the military great influence in the coming years.
Junta chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos as the country moved towards stability, an improvement in the economic situation and tourism.
The Military UNTA, which took power in 2014 after a period of bloody riots, considers itself to have led the kingdom back to stability and order.
However, the military has also failed to manage the uprising of Muslim rebels in the far south of the country, which has been swallowing for years.
More than 6,500 people have been killed in the conflict.
Nearly a year ago, 20 people were killed in an attack on a popular Hindu shrine in Bangkok, most of them foreign tourists.
It was the bloodiest attack in the country’s recent history.
The right-wing “Identitarian Movement” has been targeted by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution.
According to several state offices, the constitutional defenders in the federal government have also put the group under observation.
"We see in the 'Identitarian Movement' indications of efforts against the liberal democratic basic order," said Constitutional Protection Chief Hans-Georg Maaßen of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Thus, immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are defamed in an extremist way.
That is why we are now observing the movement.
The "Identitarian Movement" is a group with French roots, which has been active in Germany since 2012.
It opposes “multicultural madness”, “uncontrolled mass immigration” and the “loss of one’s own identity by over-alienation”.
Constitutional defenders in nine federal states - Bremen, Bavaria, Hesse, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, North Rhine-Westphalia, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - are already observing the "identitarians".
Maaßen said that his authority had coordinated closely with the state offices in the decision.
“Groups like the Identitarian Movement are trying to pick up their target group where it stands,” he said.
In general, extremists try to address them with a language that is suitable for young people, often with pop music.
Islamists as well as right-wing extremists.
This is not a plausible advertisement for one’s own cause.
Propaganda is meant to appeal to people emotionally.
Young people are particularly vulnerable.
That's dangerous.
Recently there had been reports from several federal states about contacts of the "identitarians" with AfD politicians.
Maaßen said he had no knowledge of this.
Possible contacts of this kind are only relevant for the Constitutional Protection at a certain point.
It depends on whether the respective party - in this case the AfD - changes its target direction by certain people who are extremist and thus becomes extremist.
The decisive factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party.
This is not recognizable.
Regarding the significant increase in legally motivated crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shelters, Maaßen said he would not yet speak of new right-wing terrorism in this context.
But we have found in recent years that there can be right-wing terrorist structures.
There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Freitaler Gruppe.
It may well be that further right-wing terrorist groups or microgroups are forming that plan attacks against asylum seekers, against refugee shelters or attacks from other right-wing extremist motives.
A Germany-wide or Europe-wide control of right-wing terrorism, however, is not recognizable.
The previous groups have emerged at the regional level or in social networks.
Maaßen was concerned that many of the attacks were committed on the account of people who had not previously appeared in the right-wing scene.
That's the worrying thing.
Many of the suspects in attacks on asylum shelters were previously not known as criminals, politically motivated offenders or supporters of the right-wing scene.
"So many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right-wing extremists, who were perhaps politically indifferent or voted for the CDU, the SPD or the left, but who then radicalized themselves by right-wing extremist mood measures."
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Habte becomes an Internet hit
Not always the Olympics or world records determine the headlines at the Olympic Games.
This is demonstrated by the courageous performance of Robel Kiros Habte at the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro.
At the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia swam so slowly that he was temporarily no longer visible in the TV pictures.
He simply disappeared - no matter how far the neckline was selected.
In social networks, Habte became a viral Internet hit.
In fact, the 24-year-old finished his lead with a 48-second delay and finished 59th out of 59 starters.
However, it was rather his not exactly athletic figure that attracted the attention of the international media.
Why is the 24-year-old still participating in the Olympics?
The Ethiopian got a special start right from the international swimming association.
This is distributed to promote swimming in under-represented countries.
Since most athletes run in Ethiopia, I just wanted to do something different.
Preparation is everything: Robel Kiros Habte gets ready for the big race.
The first nicknames quickly made the round.
Some media called him the "Robel of the Whale".
In reference to a "prosperity belly" the English tabloid "The Sun" made fun of him with "Dad Bod".
His time, he only hit with one minute and almost five seconds over the 100 metre freestyle, didn’t matter.
Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.
At the 2000 Sydney Olympics, Eric Moussambani's run attracted media attention.
Unforgettable was the appearance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea, when he had to compete alone in a lead over 100 meters freestyle.
Frenetisch was cheered on by Moussambani at the time.
The then 22-year-old only learned to swim eight months before the Olympics and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.

Geretsried - The owner of a shop on the Neue Platz has been robbed.
According to the police, the 67-year-old Geretsriederin had left her business on Monday around 5.30 p.m., forgetting to close a window on the ground floor.
When she returned the next morning at 8:15 a.m., about 250 euros had disappeared from the cash register.
Traces of the perpetrator could not be found.

Trump does not see the impending election defeat so close
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a campaign event in Florida.
If there is nothing to do with the election of the US president, Donald Trump already has an alternative idea.
He's just going on vacation.
If Donald Trump loses the US presidential election in November, he would relatively care: “In the end, either it will work out, or I’m having a very, very, very long vacation,” the Republican candidate said in a phone interview with US television station CNBC.
If it’s not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that’s okay, Trump said.
He described US President Barack Obama and Democrat candidate Hillary Clinton as the founder of the Islamic State (IS) terrorist militia.
Within his party, more and more resistance was formed.
Post enters the trade of electric transporters
An electric delivery vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action.
The interest of other companies in the vehicle is apparently great.
The Post is also planning to sell its StreetScooter electric vehicle.
Soon, the company will start trading with the van.
The Post wants to offer its electric transporters on the free car market from next year.
"We want to get into the sale to third parties," a post spokesman said on Friday.
The company has been testing for months whether it should also sell its self-developed StreetScooter, which delivers letters and packages, to other companies.
Post board member Jürgen Gerdes had said that there were repeatedly demands, for example from craftsmen.
According to information from the news magazine "Der Spiegel", the Bonn-based group wants to enter the mass production of the vehicles shortly.
In the production phase, the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift.
Gerdes had announced that the Group wants to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and aims for a complete transition to environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term.
"We will take a very, very robust step towards 2020," he said at the end of July.
I can imagine we're relocating the entire fleet.
The StreetScooter has been active on Germany’s roads since 2014.
GfK leadership resigns after disappointing business figures
The consumer research company GfK is replacing its CEO Matthias Hartmann.
The resignations came suddenly – but not quite surprisingly.
The difficult situation of the market research company GfK led to the suggestion that the chair of CEO Matthias Hartmann becomes all the more uncertain the longer the promised successes fail.
Turbulence at the head of the Nuremberg-based market research company GfK: After again disappointing business figures and the resignation of the corporate management, the world’s number five in the industry is facing a new beginning in terms of personnel.
GfK CEO wants to leave the company by the end of the year.
The Chairman of the GfK Supervisory Board Arno Mahlert will leave the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September.
As of 1 September, Gerhard Hausruckinger, a former member of the Board of Management, will take over the management of the company.
He is to officially take over the function of a "Board Speaker" until a successor for Hartmann is found.
As a reason for the resignations, the company cited "different views" on the long-term business policy orientation.
A company spokesman did not give details on Friday.
Who will lead the market research company in the future is currently unclear.
Investor circles said on Friday that the shareholders were most recently disappointed about the continued failure to succeed in the restructuring initiated years ago.
Mr. Hartmann has been at the top of GfK since 2011.
"The results of the restructuring are not yet visible, even after 5 years," it said.
Given the recent poor GfK business figures, every shareholder will eventually become restless.
"If that were the case with BMW, the Quandts would do the same," it said.
After setbacks in the previous quarters, the company had not been able to stop its loss drive in the second quarter of 2016.
At EUR 361.2 million, sales were 6.1 percent below the same level as in the previous year’s quarter.
With respect to the first half of the year, sales decreased by 3.4 percent at <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>721.2 million.
Earnings in the second quarter were particularly impacted by the company’s decline in value in view of its difficult economic situation.
The depreciation of goodwill of EUR 139 million, which became necessary in the Consumer Experience business unit, resulted in a loss of EUR 148.2 million for the Group.
In the second quarter of 2015, GfK had generated a consolidated profit of 19.7 million.
Accidents - Bus slips in Krummhörn in Graben: Eight injured
In an accident of a coach with 43 seniors as passengers, eight people were injured on Thursday in Krummhörn (County Aurich).
Two of the inmates suffered serious injuries, police said.
According to her information, the 66-year-old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisenach had to dodge a complimentary truck, which was partly on the opposite lane.
The bus came to the right of the road and slipped into a ditch, as a spokeswoman for the police Aurich/Wittmund reported.
"Due to the location of the bus, people could not leave the bus on their own," she said.
The fire department freed the inmates.
Six ambulances and an ambulance arrived at the scene of the accident on State Road 2.
The uninjured travellers were taken back to the Krummhörner district of Pewsum by a regular bus.
There they should wait for a replacement bus from the travel company.
Investigators urged the truck driver and potential witnesses to report to the police.
From 1 October 2016, the fees per cubic meter of wastewater for the Neudorf/Reuth/Welschenkahl wastewater plant area will be 3.44 instead of 2.10 euros; for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp 3.36 euros (previously 2.26 euros) and for Azendorf 3.64 euros (previously 2.18 euros).
At the plant in Azendorf, the sewage fee will increase again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures become necessary.
According to a considerable calculation, the wastewater price in Azendorf will then be at 4.37 euros per cubic meter.
As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, when the budget was approved by the Kulmbach Landratsamt, it was found that undercover coverage for these wastewater plants was incurred.
The Kasendorf market is obliged, on the basis of legal bases, to operate the plants on a cost-covering basis.
From 1 October 2016, the citizens as well as the commercial and industrial enterprises from Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to reach deeper into the wallet.
The fee increases range from 48 to 67 percent.
As Administrative Director Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the board, a recalculation of the fees for the sewage systems of the market community was necessary.
In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- or under-coverages from the previous calculation period should also be offset.
Schmidt reasoned the serious fee increases on the grounds that all three sewage plants are relatively small facilities with a very low sewage build-up, which is between 6,800 and 12,000 cubic meters per year.
Due to the low distribution base, for example, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact.
In addition, the sewage volume in all three plants is slightly decreasing.
Furthermore, in the past calculation period, all three plants have incurred considerable remediation and repair expenses, not least because of their age.
The plant in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the plants for Welschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years.
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced in the Azendorf wastewater plant due to damage.
The nearly 20-year-old conveyor systems had to be overhauled from scratch at the pump plant Welschenkahl and at the pond treatment plant Lopp, after almost 20 years of operation, the first sewage pond had to be dredged out, the sewage sludge disposed of and an additional ventilation option had to be installed in order to be able to comply with the water law requirements in the future.
Schmidt: "To these extraordinary expenses came the continuing maintenance and maintenance costs, which must be taken into account accordingly in the new calculation period."
The same applies to electricity costs, which in the previous calculation in 2011/2012 were still well below the current level.
Steinhäuser made it clear that in the case of the low sewage generation in the three plants, the expenses for operation and maintenance "are completely overwhelming".
Schmidt added that the market community has been spared from large maintenance costs at the sewage systems in the past 20 years.
According to Steinhäuser, the situation for the aforementioned facilities will continue to be precarious in the long term, especially since the supply area of the Friesenbachtal wastewater association cannot be extended to include these facilities because they are deficient facilities.
Bulgaria accounts for inflation for first time in 8 months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% on a monthly basis in July.
This is the highest value (as of June 2012) and the first above zero since October last year, when positive 0.2% was recorded.
The annual average inflation of the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) measured according to the CPI was -0.8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
In July 2016, a price increase was observed compared to the previous month in the following categories of consumer goods: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); leisure and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); various goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell for clothing and shoes (2.2%); furniture, household appliances and routine maintenance (0.5%); health (0.1%).
Prices of alcoholic beverages and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education remained unchanged as in the previous month.
Snapchat Anime Effect Criticized as Asian Cartoon
Snapchat says this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to races.
With its filtering tool, Snapchat allows around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in a way that already borders on the absurd.
You can turn into a pineapple, a dog, or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
The filters are straightforward, feature twisting tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies per day.
All missteps come to the public.
Snapchat filters have been criticized in the past for accusing the app of promoting blackface or promoting white skin as a beauty ideal.
When it suggested some users this week a filter that gave them slit eyes, false teeth and puffed up cheeks, some critics called it a racist cartoon of Asians - "yellow face".
They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a larger problem that the company has with diversity.
The news and outrage were widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat announced that it had disabled the feature.
The company offered an apology: the filter was intended as a tribute to anime characters and not as a cartoon of Asians.
But outsiders who have experienced racism, the filter reminded of hurtful clichés.
Others strongly rejected the anime comparison.
In an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweets about the photos were widespread, wrote that the filter was “injurious and, to say the least, unpleasant.”
She added that "it is difficult to argue with the contrast of a very disgusting Asian cartoon and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellow-faced, but that the yellow-face has been pulled into the devaluing extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses these cultural stumbling blocks.
American culture seems to be involved in an endless struggle for diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in our hands.
And Snapchat’s large audience of young people – who are more diverse in race than their older counterparts – might be more likely to expect sensitivity.
If one of Snapchat’s filters creates an image that is offensive to a user, “it’s much harder for such things to go unnoticed than it used to be,” said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account, urging others to do the same.
In an essay for Medium and in a phone interview, she said she believes racial controversy reflects a lack of diversity in Snapchat’s hiring practices.
Zhu criticized the largely white, only male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
“Either they don’t have a diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce, so they can make such decisions,” Zhu said, “or they have people with other skin colors who work there but aren’t in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say something about it.”
Others share their opinion, a complaint that Snapchat has largely left unanswered.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points out its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees, but according to a spokesperson, the company recently hired a recruiter focused on underrepresented populations and internal integration efforts.
Zhu said she will close her Snapchat account, adding, “I wonder if they need more users like us to be able to say that’s not OK.”
Military leadership falsifies ISIS intelligence, congressional committee notes
Military members of the United States Central Command modified intelligence information to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the actual conditions on the ground would have allowed, a Congressional inquiry committee reported in a report on Thursday.
The preliminary report, prepared by a task force of Republican members of the Armed Forces Committee, Intelligence Committee and the Armed Forces Budget Committee, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts, who reported how superiors changed their views on American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.
The Central Command, or Cencom for short, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"News intelligence information typically nicked by high-ranking Centcom commanders regularly drew a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism than the actual conditions on the ground would have allowed, and was consistently more positive than analyses from other news agencies," a newspaper article quoted the report.
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," said Ken Calvert, a Republican member of the House of Representatives.
The leadership mistakes in Centcom reach up to the top of the organization.
The ten-page report details ongoing problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in training Iraqi armed forces.
Although there is no direct evidence that Obama’s leadership has given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts faced pressure from their pre-laws to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat to the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements, and statements before Congress were significantly more positive than the facts," the report noted.
For example, a Centcom member publicly announced that a military recapture of Mosul could begin in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, so much is clear," said Mike Pompeo, Kansas Republican Congressman, in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the tops of the Central Command changed intelligence reports to minimize the threat from ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans launched the Task Force after they were told that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State.
The report published on Thursday will be complemented by more detailed findings as the investigation continues.
In addition, further investigations of the Centcom reports by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Defence are underway.
Democratic members of the intelligence committee published their own findings on Thursday, which were in line with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
"In 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an excessively restricted process for compiling intelligence assessments on ISIL and Iraqi security services," the committee's senior Democrat Adam B. Schiff, a member of the House of Representatives, said in a statement.
This process, Mr. Schiff said, “delayed the publication of intelligence reports,” damaged morale among analysts, and “gave excessively little room for dissent.”
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said they had found no evidence of a White House intervention by the Centcom analysts regarding a “certain political opinion.”
The preliminary results of the Congressional investigation were published Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
Last August, the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon inspector-general that were taken up after complaints from Centcom analysts.
Lt. Commander Patrick Evans, a Pentagon press spokesman, stated in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on reports from Congress while the Inspector General’s investigation is still underway.
But he also stated that "experts sometimes have quite divergent opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Department of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defense."
The investigations have repercussions beyond the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim now made by a growing number of members of the Department of Defense).
However, last year’s accusations have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
The criticism of the secret information on the Islamic State is reminiscent of disagreements more than ten years ago when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a paper about how the then-government under George W. Bush, contrary to the recommendations of many analysts, envisaged only a small occupation force in Iraq and devoted little time to reflecting on the consequences of the invasion of 2003.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against current coverage of the Islamic State.
Last year, according to government agencies, the team led by Mr. Hooker found that, contrary to government statements, air strikes against Islamic State-owned refineries would have no significant impact on the terrorist group’s financial position, as these provisional refineries had put into operation to sell oil on the black market.
However, this finding was not published, the Times reported in September.
Centcom's then commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature for his overly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel in the Central Command.
The United States wins fourth match in women's field hockey, a showdown with the UK is imminent
One day after scoring three goals in a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also scored the first two goals for the American women's field hockey team in a Thursday match against India that the American women won 3-0.
Five goals in two games should actually be a memorable achievement, but Bam (27) said she can’t remember ever having done that.
"I don't know," she said.
I'm not one of those people who keep their doors in mind.
However, she knows that: The American women are 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are ranked first in their group with the British women, who remain undefeated after their 2-0 victory against Japan.
The United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals, the game will decide which of the two within their group of six teams will take first and second place respectively.
The first-placed will avoid the strong Dutch women who lead the other group for a little longer.
Whatever the outcome of Saturday’s game, the American women have sparked a surprising whirl with their success story, four years after they ended up in the last of 12 places at the last London Games.
Bam was part of this team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had a hockey stick in her hands for the first time at the age of three (her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), at the age of 16 she became a U.S. national player, the youngest in the team's history.
She missed the 2008 Olympics because she could not qualify for the squad.
Then came the year 2012, when everything went wrong for her and her team.
The following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, became the coach of the national team and things began to change for the better.
"A cultural change, a mental change, and a physical change," Bam said.
We didn't have the workload in London we have now.
We were able to pull the rudder completely around.
On Thursday evening, Bam opened the Torreigen in the first half of the game with a backhand from the close range.
India had gone into the game without a win in the tournament, but the team showed surprisingly toughness and held the score from 1-0 until the third quarter, until Bam took the game into their hands.
She made a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved to the center and kicked the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.
The shutout was the first of the entire tournament for the US goalkeeper, Jackie Briggs, who had to score one goal in each of the previous games.
She's got a run.
Same as Bam.
"We are in a good position," Parnham said, but how good will depend on the result of the next game on Saturday.
In the midst of the rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline
Wherever you are, no matter how late it is, it is the Olympic Games.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel steady and inescapable, a frenzied relay run between competition and striving.
It’s like the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod, which goes from crossbow sniper to swimmer to gymnast to triathlete.
You can’t turn on the TV, read a newspaper, or listen to your neighbor’s queue at the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there is Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is at the Olympics for the first time and a swarm of women with dimples, could well have been among those well-known names broadcast on Prime Time, built by sponsors and feel-good TV advertising, if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even a fencer.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in the Olympic trampoline gymnastics.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event the same.
Further from the center, partly in the shade, are the sports that are not generally recognized: air gun shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We will always have the breast swimming and may it reign for a long time.
But if I may modestly make arguments for my particular favorite, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.
Although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000 when it debuted in Sydney, it has been so scarcely perceived for the last 16 years that many of those I interviewed didn’t know it was an Olympic sport at all.
It could also be regional ignorance.
Although the U.S. sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in trampoline jumping and had an athlete who made it to the final round until 2012.
The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.
Trampoline jumping has a certain outsider charm, partly because it sounds more suitable for an unexplained ear for a clown school than for the Olympics.
At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but just an earth-bound enthusiast.
It has humorous potential – the cartoon-like trembling of its never-ending impact – but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports it essentially unites.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means "springboard."
Emerging winners jump on a gigantic trampoline, shooting almost 30 feet in the air and having to perform a series of falling movements (turning, pike, and saltos) before landing on their feet.
They are evaluated according to the official Olympic program according to execution, difficulty level and "flight time".
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.
Medal hopers must continue in their pursuit of gold, faster, up and over, sometimes to the finish, sometimes back and forth, up and down on the playground.
They not only chase the finish line or the starting wall, but in the television broadcast also another ridiculous goal: that of the world or the Olympic record.
The goal-oriented pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatical - and it's enough to stir even a spectator to tears.
But it’s also what I find a bit tiring when watching these games.
The trampoline offers a breathing break.
The vector of the trampoline jumper is above.
A forward movement is not the goal.
He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up.
Here, too, there is a competition, of course, not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no vaulting in the distance, only the dreamlike, elegant cancellation of time and gravity.
It is as Zen as competition can only be at the Olympic Games.
The women's qualifying and final rounds will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men's on Saturday, also at 13.00.
NBC will broadcast the finals as part of an afternoon block on both days starting at 2 p.m.
In the midst of Olympic mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in general turmoil.
If the increase in awareness can only be achieved through the gazing and objectification of male athletes – as suggested by the male U.S. gymnasts recently, according to The Wall Street Journal – then Mr. Dooley awaits his struggling, new fan base.
"One Generation Protests" in Ethiopia, Long a U.S. Ally
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Protesters calling for political change in Ethiopia met with violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses say that tens of protesters were killed during clashes with police during gunshots.
Is Ethiopia on the brink of collapse?
Over the past decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a fast-growing economy.
But in recent months, protests against the government shook the country and spread to more and more territories.
Last week, thousands of people stormed into the streets and demanded fundamental political change.
According to human rights organizations, the government’s response was merciless.
Witnesses reported that police shot and killed tens of unarmed protesters.
Videos circulating about the protests, which are probably from last or early this year, show security guards beating young people with sticks while they were forced to make a handstand against a wall.
The head of the UN Human Rights Agency is now calling for an in-depth investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country together and it will be even more difficult in the future," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is appreciated by the West.
American military and intelligence agencies are working closely with the Ethiopians to tackle terrorist threats beyond the region, especially in Somalia. Few countries in Africa, if any, receive so much Western assistance.
Ethiopia’s economy expanded at a considerable pace.
Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.
The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy – human rights organizations have continuously led government oppression – the opposition in the country has been restrained, effectively silenced dissidents.
Many were sent to exile or jail, killed or driven into the vast expanse of the desert.
But that could change.
"If you oppress people and they have no other options but to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopia.
The entire youth is protesting.
A generation is protesting.
There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to strangulation in relation to the power of the ruling coalition.
After a widely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of parliament.
At the same time, tensions are rising along the border with Eritrea; a fight for this jagged, controversial line claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which have been more or less defeated in recent years, could take advantage of the turmoil and rearme themselves.
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness now explode after years of simmering under the surface.
The first one seems harmless: smartphones.
Only in recent years have many Ethiopians been able to communicate through social media as cheaper smartphones became more common and Internet services improved.
Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, which it does at regular intervals, especially during protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they are staying.
Several young Ethiopians said they were gathering in protest.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
For eons, the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia’s predominantly Christian highlands, have prospered in politics and business, while exploiting the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and live in lowland areas.
But that too is just changing.
"We are coordinating under one umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.
The biggest protests took place in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, which make up around 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in the military, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopia’s prime minister for 17 years until his death from an undisclosed illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think around the corners.
Analysts say he was particularly skilled at perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and using special agents to edit opponents and render them harmless.
"The current regime lacks this fundamental skill," said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively opaque reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.
Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he does not enjoy the trust of security services controlled by the Tigrays.
Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such turmoil was in 2005, after thousands protested elections that, according to analysts, were apparently spoiled by the government and subsequently stolen.
During the subsequent raids, many protesters were killed, although less than in recent months, and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia’s leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction.
But obviously this has not prevented the internal envy of the Ethiopian government from intensifying.
And it takes on a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters attacked Tigray-led businesses in Gondar, an Amharic city, and hatred for the Tigray is becoming more common on social media.
Analysts say the protests put the US and other Western allies in a strange position.
The U.S. government used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, even though it recently announced it had closed that base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile area.
"This," said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin trek."
Donald Trump explains his claim that Obama founded ISIS was "sarcasm"
Donald J. Trump on Friday attempted to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign by stating that his repeated claim that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the “founders” of the Islamic State terrorist group was not serious.
This clarification raised new questions about the communication skills of the Republican presidential candidate whether he was able to communicate clearly and understandably with the American public.
It also puts his fellow fighters, who strive to protect him during an eventful phase, in the peculiar position of having to explain statements that he could not have meant at all.
After making the suggestion at a campaign event on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump rushed back on Thursday’s claim, insisting in interviews that he really did not intend to indicate that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.
But in an early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic.
The tweet was the opposite of the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews he was completely serious about the accusation.
When Conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Mr. Trump mitigate the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate didn’t want to know about it.
The final storm of criticism is pounding on Mr. Trump as he tries to focus his campaign on the economic situation due to falling polls.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton gave speeches on the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to the subject.
Reporting via Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton’s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.
Mr. Trump has already promoted sarcasm in his defense.
At the end of July, he was heavily criticized when he said that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton’s emails, but he later said, “Of course I meant that sarcastic.”
This method allows Mr. Trump to shift the linguistic boundaries in politics and then row back as needed.
"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are picked up by his fans, how they arrive, and then, if necessary, "clarify" depending on how the response turns out," said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who monitors the language of both candidates.
But I also think he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.
Rather than defusing the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has adopted an even more corrosive tone as his poll scores continue to decline.
A new poll by NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, published Friday, revealed a lead with great lead in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump generally tries not to apologize for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstanding his humor.
But while he is increasingly in the focus of attention in the last few months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump’s jokes have put his loyal fellow fighters in the uncomfortable situation of having to stand by him, no matter how provocative his statements may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trump’s most prominent advocates, made great effort to defend the candidate today in a Thursday CNN interview.
"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," Giuliani said, so he was questioned on the veracity of Mr. Trump's statements as to whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
It is true, in this sense, that before Obama, ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called it backbone, completely wrong and that’s why it happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama administration, where Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to spread by failing to aggressively control the situation in the Middle East.
Before the campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media, accusing them of riding around on each of his words and being biased against him.
He mocked the “poor, wretched” television experts who were trying to understand him and said, “You can’t!”.
Some of the Democrats mocked Mr. Trump’s apology as just another proof that he was unfit for president.
Once pushed over the price from the market, café comes back in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shabby café in Williamsburg where you could only pay cash, which did not have Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the prices were displaced from its Bedford Avenue storefront.
Soap Cherie, which replaced Verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
Locals mourned it as the last loss in a gentrifying city.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is a change, but I still can't believe CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel except and Verb is now a soap shop."
But if New York is a change, it is also a reinvent.
A revived verb cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time employee of the old café, who is the owner and managing director of the new café.
He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.
When a customer offered him to provide funds for a new branch office, he was excited to do it, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot.
Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment too.
He introduced new ingredients.
On the menu are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnishes such as capers and sautéed onions.
There are natural rice bowls.
The café no longer serves beer, but there are fresh juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.
"Many old customers were also displaced by prices from Williamsburg," he said.
Recently on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she would take the road on her own.
After the verb closed, she stopped drinking coffee for a while, she said.
"I realized it was coffee and culture in the verb that I liked," she said.
Now she’s drinking coffee again, even if that day she ordered a Blended Chai Tea instead of her usual Iced Coffees, which is another new addition.
Tom Rosenthal has been another long-standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003.
He went there before work and inevitably always ordered the same thing.
"I came quarter after seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch and they're preparing my everything bag with butter," he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu.
Nowadays, Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he changes his everything bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez said he had no resentment about the soap business taking over the old business premises.
In fact, the owners of the soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for verb using the cold-brewed coffee of the cafe as an ingredient.
"I think we're still going to respond to their offer," Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint have also accepted the café.
A new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said he plans to exhibit it soon, making his new neighbors feel welcome.
The location also has other advantages.
A local juice store wants to bottle and sell cold-brewed coffee.
There is a chance that the café will expand to an adjacent building.
For many customers, a new verb is enough to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was a regular customer and said he was devastated when the café closed.
When the new cafe opened, Whitt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee felt like returning home.
"I had to smell it," he said.
The depressing eating of the economic crisis in "an abundant meal"
In March 1933, shortly after his rise to president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt had a fondness for refined Fifth Avenue delicacies such as pate de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup.
His menu that day was a little more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and as a dessert a plum pudding.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, “It was also a message to Americans about how they should eat.”
The couple live in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coe's last book, "Chop Suey," was about Chinese cuisine in the U.S., while Ziegelman, in her book, "97 Orchard," tells about living in a residential building on the Lower East Side from a food perspective.
Her latest collaboration, "A Decent Meal," which will appear at Harper Publishing on Tuesday, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity as they met with a reporter at Eisenberg’s Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, no-frills snack in the Flatiron District that has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, ate turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered hack roasts, the couple found this appropriate for a discussion about eating in the era of the Great Depression.
"Rich foods were very popular," Ziegelman said.
There was peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread.
They were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap that stretches the ingredient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve them as dinner.
Coe grinned.
"It must have lain in the stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table in an American household, especially in rural areas, was an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Teams of women cooked for male field workers and freshly baked pastry was served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War. "A Square Meal" records the ways in which the country was no longer the snare land.
“It was a time when eating became a central, tense topic for Americans,” Coe concluded, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
The new budget diet was just as tense: mysterious foods such as breads and casseroles became staples, the casseroles as a "wonderful way to recycle food residues," Ziegelman noted, as chefs could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, which has been the focus of American cuisine for years, has become a rarely served luxury.
Strange mixtures were tried, as a high-calorie and nutritious gratification took precedence over taste or even common sense.
During her research for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from that era, baked onions with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a popular addition at lunchtime," Coe says.
Ziegelmann continues: "It was surreal."
Peanut butter and baked onions do not match.
It was typical for many of the housekeeping recipes.
Like never before or since, household economists — including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 — fueled the country’s eating habits in such a way.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "household politicians" and meet the challenge of turning pamples like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.
"A Square Meal" is a feast of historical treats.
Particularly tasty are the reports of the government’s response to the hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover’s lass-me-cake-eating attitude.
While publicly praising the simple Iowa farmhouse kitchen of his kitchen, he dined like the millionaire man of the world he has become.
"He liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.
He ate in an almost gold-plated dining room and wore a tuxedo.
He was wonderfully alien to reality.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor hadn’t asked him to set an example with his stomach.
As described in the book, hiring a housekeeper with no interest in flavors by Ms. Roosevelt led to the White House producing the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most desolate cooks.
Many of the ways of dealing with food from the Great Depression era were discarded as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The legacy lies in our continued focus on calories and food, Ziegelman said, as well as on how science has been applied to food.
The couple stated that while writing the book, they had better understood the eating habits of Ziegelman's mother-in-law - for example, how she couldn't throw food away.
"She had a real fear of wasting food," Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled, "She actually made people sick."
There was the windbag incident.
After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg's, she and Coe drew out a dessert they had prepared at home: the plum dessert President Roosevelt had lunched.
“It’s called Prune Whip,” said Ziegelman, adding that it was a common trick to miss modest recipes with a chic name.
There was no whipped cream, only plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly dipped a spoon into the tough, brown slipper.
Surprisingly, it didn’t taste bad.
Coe took a look at it three times.
Like a can-do budgeter, he told his wife, "A few chopped walnuts would help."
Killed in bombing: He was the hero of Aleppo
He risked his own life to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar dedicated his life to the people of Syria.
He risked everything to save others.
Now, the 30-year-old himself died in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the White Helmets, a civil protection group that has saved nearly 60,000 lives, according to Bild-Zeitung.
2,900 volunteers risk their own lives to pull people out of bombed houses and to provide first aid in the war zone.
They are the heroes of the war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: A video of the civilian defender showing him on an 11-hour rescue of a baby from the rubble of a house went around the world in 2014.
It made the Syrian a shining symbolic figure in the horrors of war.
As a hero, however, he never saw himself, according to Bild, said: "For me, this is the real jihad."
“When I die to save lives, I think God sees a martyr in me.”
Shortly before Omar himself fell victim to an attack, he had spoken in a video about the recent bombings in Syria.
The helicopters dropped four barrel bombs over the Alzadia district, one was filled with chlorine gas.
One woman and two children died, seven people suffered from shortness of breath.
"We are now removing the poisonous remains of the bomb so that children don't play with it," the image quotes his last words before he died.
The Assad regime's deadly bomb was supposed to hit terrorists.
Greenland shark: the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old
Rare sight.
Greenland sharks usually come to the surface only in winter.
This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation aboard the research ship Sanna.
He was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day.
Greenland sharks do not have offspring until they are 150 years old.
Slowly, the Greenland shark swims along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it reaches an average of 1,220 meters.
Only when it matters, the five-metre-long animal accelerates to a whopping 2.6 km/h - and at this top speed is half as fast as a seal.
However, this slow lifestyle seems to be a patent recipe for an old age.
Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" about a Greenland shark that could be 392 years old.
"Madness", comments Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock on this lifespan, which represents a world record for vertebrates.
The evolutionary biologist has long suspected that Greenland sharks are stone ageing.
Only the evidence was missing.
Greenland sharks are difficult to observe, after all, they live mainly in the ice sea off the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitzbergen.
Because they prefer water temperatures around six degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface only in winter.
Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland sharks.
They measured their slow-motion pace when they equipped six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitzbergen.
In the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.
They may be hunting dormant animals or patrolling the bottom of the ice ocean, looking for carcasses to tow down from higher layers of water.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland sharks that fishermen picked up from the depths of the North Atlantic between 2010 and 2013 off Greenland or Spitzbergen as by-catch.
The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest was 502 centimeters.
To determine the age of the animals, they used the carbon-14 method to analyze the lens core of the sharks.
This center of the eye lens is formed even before sharks are born, and the proteins in it are no longer renewed later.
The two smallest sharks had a striking amount of carbon-14 in the lens core.
Their birth was supposed to be after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons experiments threw larger amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
In the third smallest animal with a length of 220 centimeters, the lens core, on the other hand, contained a small excess of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons trials, so it should have celebrated its 50th birthday during its investigation in 2012.
All the larger Greenland sharks, on the other hand, had normal amounts of carbon-14 in their lens core, which is produced by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, the carbon 14 clock for a 493 centimeter long Greenland shark showed an age of 335 years, while the record shark with 502 centimeters is likely to be 392 years old.
It was known that Greenland shark females will only have offspring when they are longer than four meters.
Now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length.
Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters was probably on the threshold of sexual maturity and his age was determined at 156 years, Greenland sharks can be reproduced at least a century and a half time.
This is also likely to be a world record for vertebrates at the moment.
The fact that such methuselahs mainly live in icy waters is no coincidence.
The previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale, in whose bacon was a 120-year-old harpoon tip, was also caught off Alaska.
Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on a savings flame.
So they mature later - and age more slowly.
In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals also often become particularly tall.
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, which causes the animal to lose heat.
The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much greater than that of one gram of elephant.
Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.
"A smaller animal therefore lives more dangerously and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as early as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein.
A very large animal, on the other hand, should rather invest its resources in a long life.
Building land in double pack
In the recent meeting, the municipal council focused on the topics of construction.
With relief, the panel took up Mayor Robert Putz's message that "at last, the marketing of the recently designated residential areas can begin".
After the land, parceling and development issues could be clarified and the applications for surveys were made, the sale of the land in the residential areas "Straßlweg" and "Schönau-West" (Binderstraße area - extension section 1) to interested parties is no longer in the way.
The municipal council is convinced that the building space in the rural and quiet residential community of Schönau appeals to young families and rustic seniors alike.
As it was said, volunteers can now report in the town hall, about the allocation of the parcels, the municipal council is expected to advise in its September session.
In order to be able to fulfil requests for the settlement of further commercial enterprises, together with the creation of jobs, the municipal council decided to amend the land use plan, which was newly created only in the spring of this year, in sub-areas.
For example, in the area of Unterzeitlarn, the commercial area already designated there will be expanded by two parcels in the direction of State Road 2112.
Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
The city on the Main thus has the best chance of attracting jobs and companies relocated from London, competing with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg.
"It is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit the most from the Brexit vote," says Michael Voigtländer, head of IW's Financial and Real Estate Markets Competence Field.
Following the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether money houses can continue to operate financial transactions across the EU from London.
For the so-called EU passport, they have so far sufficient approval in the UK.
This is what big U.S. banks are using.
Several banks have already announced that they will move jobs.
The Frankfurt Main Finance lobby group expects 10,000 new jobs on the Main within five years.
For Frankfurt, the seat of the European Central Bank (ECB), which brings together responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro area, as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance Supervisory Authority (EIOPA) and the Risk Board (ESRB) spoke.
Although the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is headquartered in Paris, it is less important to the financial sector than the ECB.
"The proximity to the central bank is important for banks, because it allows them to communicate directly with the supervisory authority," says IW Professor Voigtländer.
While Luxembourg is home to a large fund industry, its infrastructure performance is worse than that of Dublin.
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport.
Furthermore, the city scores with easily available commercial properties.
“In Paris, it’s not that easy to find free, high-quality offices,” Voigtländer says.
On the Seine, the rents for first-class commercial properties are also 50 percent higher than on the Main.
In addition, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime.
In a ranking by Mercer, the city ranks seventh, Luxembourg ranks 19th, Dublin ranks 33rd and Paris ranks 37th.
Even though quality of life is a question of preferences, “with its already strong position as a financial location for the European single market, Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors,” the IW concludes.
However, despite the Brexit vote, London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe, according to the economic researchers.
In London, according to figures from the Landesbank Helaba at the end of 2015, around 144,000 people worked in the banking sector, while in Frankfurt there were 62500.
Gilead Receives Legal Costs from Hepatitis C Patent Dispute with Merck
A U.S. judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to a refund for the legal costs incurred by the company in the Hepatits C lawsuit with the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was exempted from $200 million in damages for infringing two Merck patents related to Gilead’s blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni after a U.S. judge revealed a pattern of misconduct on Merck’s part, including perjury and other unethical acts.
In filing the lawsuit on Thursday, U.S. Judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead is entitled to exemption of the costs incurred during the defense of the case.
Merck is trying to match up with Gilead, which dominates the market for a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and claimed property on laboratory work based on sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead’s medicines.
US-backed troops say they have regained full control of Manbij from Islamic State
U.S.-backed troops have regained full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last ISIS fighters in the city left it, a spokesman for the group said on Friday.
The Democratic Forces of Syria (DKS) are currently combing through the city after the exodus of the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves inside the city.
They have freed over 2,000 civilians held hostage by the fighters, Sharfan Darwish of the DKS-allied Manbij Military Council told Reuters.
"The city is now under complete control, but we are currently carrying out cleanup work," he told Reuters.
Clintons earn 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% federal taxes
Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax return on Friday, which revealed for the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband an income of $10.75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2%.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million to charity, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton earned nearly $5.3 million in speech honors; the former Secretary of State reported an income of $3 million from publishing house Simon & Schuster for her book on her tenure in the State Department.
Clinton’s vice presidential candidate, Virginia Senator Tim Kaine, and his wife Anne Holton have been publishing his tax returns for the past decade.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
“Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards of financial transparency,” Clinton campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In stark contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses and withdrawals regarding his previous promises to publish his tax returns.
It is common practice for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, although they are not required by law to do so.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have given a tax audit by the tax authorities as the reason for his refusal.
"They're on the move," Clinton's campaign assistant Ian Sams wrote on Twitter, referring to the release of the Democratic presidential candidate.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump’s special adviser, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish anything until the tax audits are completed.
Trump’s critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, have already announced that his refusal raises issues related to wealth, his donations to charities, his business conduct, and various other ties, particularly with Russia.
Clinton has already stumbled upon the issue and posted a video on the Internet on Friday in which high-ranking Republicans are urging Trump to publish his tax return.
On Thursday, she also addressed the issue during a speech on the economy in Michigan.
“He refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax returns,” she said.
Politico has reported that Trump paid no or very little taxes for two years during the 1990s, and a New York Times business journalist quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax consultants on Friday stating that this could still be the case.
Federal taxes have become an issue in the election campaign.
Clinton supports a scheme named after billionaire and investor Warren Buffett that would ensure that individuals earning more than USD 1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
During a campaign event for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate is based here, called on Trump to attend a meeting to exchange their tax returns.
Buffett said he had also been subjected to an IRS tax audit and that Trump had “fear” from voters and not from tax authorities.
Clinton’s campaign has published tax returns dating back to 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average effective federal tax rate of about 32% between 2007 and 2014, and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5%.
The Clintons’ 2015 tax return showed that they only received $100 of their income as wages, unlike the majority of all Americans.
Their main investment was a low-cost index fund from which the Clintons taxed dividends and income of USD 109,000.

Condoms with chili powder, fireworks promote Tanzania’s elephant protection
Conservationists in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to stop elephants from going into human-inhabited settlements – they throw condoms on them that are filled with chili powder.
The method has proven to be effective and the Honeyguide Foundation, which had the idea years ago, along with the U.S. Conservation Agency, has intensified its promotion by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent four-step method to protect their homes and crops without harming animals.
Previously, many have used spears to defend themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day dedicated to animal welfare.
"Since we developed the ... Toolkit, we have been able to observe a change in their attitude within these communities, with them being much more confident that they can keep the elephants off their fields without harming the elephants," Honeyguide CEO Damian Bell said in a statement.
The first two steps include illuminating the elephant with a torch and blowing into a horn.
If he is not deterred, a so-called "chili cloud" is thrown.
Chili powder mixed with earth is packed together with a fireworks in a condom, the end of which is turned to the ignition string.
When it is lit, the condom bursts with a bang and sprays fine dust of chili powder into the air.
A hint is usually already out to chase the elephant.
One last possibility is a thrower who shoots a gold rain fireworks in the air causing a loud, bright explosion.
City Council unanimously decides: No new kiosk building on the banks of the Rhine
Normally, St. Goarer accepts investment projects from tradesmen with kissing hands - after all, the retail sector in the core city is considered to be clearly expandable.
However, the city council unanimously rejected the request for the construction of a new sales kiosk on the banks of the Rhine in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine balcony under construction.
"Basically, we welcome new traders, but at this location in an exposed location on the banks of the Rhine, this kiosk does not fit," explained Michael Hubrath for the CDU group.
Jewish director smashes Berlin hotel because Israeli country code has been removed after "Arab" request - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots unleashed a media uproar after he revealed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list an Israeli area code because, according to an employee, it had "demanded" Arab guests.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah" omitted his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel’s country code list.
However, the country was not listed among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and erased?
He wrote Lanzmann.
Instead, Kempinksi Bristol offers a way to dial Israel through its own call center.
Looking for an explanation, the director turned to the hotel reception.
The answer he received there "shocked him," as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel employee said the measure was an "intentional decision by the management of Kempinski Hotels."
The reason behind this was triggering even more anger in the director.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the country code be deleted," Lanzmann's employee was quoted as saying.
The Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a "great disgrace," reports the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
We were horrified and dismayed by this event.
That's really very embarrassing.
The fact that this happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is an even greater shame.
There's no need to explain that.
We expect the hotel to "draw the right conclusions," the official said.
The incident triggered a pretty big resonance on the internet, where people called it a scandal.
Some alleged to the Kempinski Hotel that it had "surrendered" to the alleged requests of Arab guests.
"Shame on you," it said in another post, in which it was pointed out that the hotel, which is located on the noble Kurfürstendamm, is near a synagogue.
The hotel quickly dismissed all accusations and called the incident an "accident" and "excused" Lanzmann, reports Der Spiegel.
"There has never been a direct instruction not to include Israel on the quick dial list," a spokesman for the Kempinski hotel told the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
It adds that the country code has now been added.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
Students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday as they gathered to protest government reforms for the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
The difficulties began when police officers tried to disperse the students, causing the police to use rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their dismay at the plans.
According to the proposals of the governor of the state of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, just under 100 public schools will be closed, while 300,000 students will be put in place to save money.
Some of the protesters were seen spraying graffiti against interim president Michel Temer on walls.
The recent protests occurred a few days after protesters took to the streets in masses to support suspended President Dilma Rousseff, who had been removed from office by a Senate vote to dismiss her.
Trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71% - RT Business
With the lifting of sanctions, according to Russian Ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, trade sales between Moscow and Tehran grew by 70.9 percent year-on-year.
Since international sanctions against Iran were lifted, interest in business in the country has grown sharply on the part of Russian companies, the ambassador said.
Russian companies are establishing existing ties with Iran, while new companies are ready to gain access to the market.
Of course, further trade expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that trade sales between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent in the first five months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $856 million.
In particular, Russian imports into Iran increased by 91.5%, amounting to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The trade upswing was achieved by deliveries of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan expects a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia for this year.
Last year, the Russian mission issued around 35,000 visas, primarily travel visas, to Iranian citizens.
Iran also ranked among the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists in Russia.
One could say that last year’s record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia will be broken,” he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians visit Iran, something the ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have preserved monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he said.
Witnesses wanted: Beverage market raid in Waldbröl
A robbery was carried out on Thursday evening at the beverage market of Rewe XXL on the Waldbröler Gerberstraße.
Under the guise of a firearm, three dark-dressed people who had disguised their faces demanded cash from the employee of the beverage market and then fled on foot and probably with a silver-colored VW-Golf.
How much money was stolen, the police did not inform.
The perpetrators are said to have been between 1.60 and 1.70 meters tall, i.e. relatively small.
The beverage market is directly accessible from the parking deck of the Rewe market and is difficult to view.
After the raid, the perpetrators must have run towards Gerberstraße, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg and escaped from the gravel parking lot opposite the entrance to the car park with the silver-coloured car, possibly in the direction of B 256 (Schladernring).
Anyone who has made observations in connection with the robbery at the time of the crime (at 7:45 p.m.) should urgently report to the police.
Nagold: Play and have fun on summer breaks
Eight beautiful and happy days were spent by the children and young people of the social pedagogical group/social group work of the Children’s Protection Federation Nagold with their caregivers on their summer holiday in Nussdorf, near Mühlacker.
In the quiet recreational centre Hardtwälle, the lively group was housed during the first week of school holidays.
Several full-day excursions were on the program.
On the one hand, we went to Bretten with a visit to the petting zoo.
On the other hand to Maulbronn, where there was a special children's tour in the world-famous monastery.
The third trip was to Pforzheim.
At the Celtic Museum in Hochdorf, the group learned a lot about the daily life and food of the Celts.
On the hot days, the group enjoyed themselves at the Tiefensee in Maulbronn, which invited them to jump, swim and paddle.
Children and caregivers were pampered with their self-prepared body dishes such as the Sauren Spätzle, the Seebronner Pfannenle, Iselshauser-Bloff, the English Breakfast and the Bolognese from Tübingen.
In workshops, beautiful jewelry was created from pearls and stones or made from wood a Roman mill game.
Other highlights of the free time were fishing in a nearby pond, the evenings by the fire and the final "Bunte Evening".
On the day of the return, the sun laughed and the children and young people returned home satisfied.
Haigerloch: Pilgrims to the Gate of Mercy
The ministers from the pastoral unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.
Together, four stages were completed.
In order to bridge the time until the next Rome pilgrimage of all ministers in anticipated two years, the St. Anna High Ministers’ Round has decided to prepare and conduct a multi-day pilgrimage.
Various pilgrimage destinations were examined and the decision was finally made for the bishopric city of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage destination was offered with the gate of Mercy at the Freiburger Münster opened for this purpose.
16 minis from Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch and Holy Rooms set out.
The evening before, Father Storost sent out the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the crosses of the pilgrims and bestowed the pilgrim blessings.
From Horb, a train was taken to the starting point Villingen, where there is also a monastery of Our Lady, and so the pilgrimage path was started from the monastery.
The individual day tours were each framed in the morning and in the evening by a short impulse with various prayers, songs and scriptures.
But also on the way, the minis kept pace at field crosses, chapels or churches to sing together a song from a specially compiled pilgrim song booklet.
For the overnight stays there were parish houses of the local parishes available.
At the stages, Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasty and refreshing dinner and breakfast.
On the second day, we continued across Furtwangen to Gütenbach.
The next day we started the stage to St. Peter, which was the most difficult route, but had to descend in muggy heat at first about 500 meters altitude and then climb again.
The reward deserved was a joint barbecue at the bath pond in the evening.
After the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter, we went to the final stage to Freiburg.
Visibly relieved and happy, the minis arrived later in the afternoon at Freiburger Münster and passed through the gate of mercy.
With a little impulse, God was thanked.
In the evening fair in Münster, the minis arrived at the pilgrimage destination were greeted by co-operator Markus Obert.
After the service, the pilgrims could visit the sacristy and the high altar.
The next day there was still time for the Breisgau metropolis.
In the afternoon we went back to Horb by train.
At the end, all the participants agreed that the days were marked by spirituality and a strong community experience.
Scotsman Callum Skinner storms home as Brite wins gold for cycling
Scotland’s Callum Skinner rushed to fame last night in the men’s team sprint at the Rio Velodrome when the British team defended the London 2012 title.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor role that his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had taken on, and the young lad made the legend proud as he stormed home to win a New Zealand favorite.
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic gold medals.
They repeated the trick after scoring only a modest sixth place at the London World Rail Championships in March despite Hoys' resignation.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of driver Jamie Staff.
They did so in time when Hindes appeared.
Hoy’s retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.
Skinner was the man they stayed with when they saw potential in the Scotsman that has now unfolded.
Hindes, Kenny – who won with Hoy four years ago – and Skinner set an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel with gold.
After his lap, Kenny was just behind, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.
A strategy change was a big part of the transformation, with Hindes going in a higher gear to slow him down and allow Kenny and Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy watched from his position as a BBC expert and noticed Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they climbed the podium.
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said: “It’s a flattering comparison.”
I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final round and defeated the world champions.
It was just unbelievable.
There is no better way to win this.
After the 2012 triumph at the side of Kennys and Hoys, Hindes admitted that he deliberately fell on the track after a weak start.
He later withdrew this statement and there was no objection from England's rivals.
With such an overwhelming victory, there was no such problem this time.
Hindes said: "It feels like London with all the UK flags on the grandstand."
We have come together as a team in the last three months.
We got away so badly with so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win the Olympics again.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, winning seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, then successful five days in the velodrome await us.
With the form of Kenny, it is possible that he repeats Hoy's victory of three Olympic gold medals in one competition.
That would mean for Kenny — who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a seemingly sacred date for British sports; that day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were also born) — a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.
That would be the same for Hoy.
Kenny is next in the sprint, which starts today and will go over three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, “I’m just enjoying this for the moment.”
The team event is always the best.
You can win it with your colleagues.
It feels a bit lonely to win alone.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be knighted."
It was the only medal competition of the day, but there was more good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometre race.
They arrived at the target in 3:51,942.
The world record, which won gold in London in 2012, was 3:51,659.
The first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the competition, in which Wiggins will certainly be the focus.
He had argued with commissioners before qualification yesterday, when officials called him up to measure his height.
Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie advanced in world record time in 4:13,260.
The GB team relies on its strong track cycling team to dominate the mid-period of the Olympic Games and get a bunch of medals.
After a truly extraordinary demonstration of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, expectations for Rio were down.
Dramas took place in the background, such as the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April amid sexism and bullying allegations, as well as the retirement of figures such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, if you look at the first evening of the competition in the velodrome, it looks like the now legendary reputation of GB, which reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated.
Future of Portland smelter questioned due to energy contract repeal
The future of Portland’s melting of aluminum in Victoria – as well as hundreds of workers’ jobs – is at stake as the plant operator terminates the energy supply contract and thus cancels all supply contracts, the supplying energy company said.
This move followed the government’s decision in Victoria earlier this year not to grant any further subsidies to the plant’s operation.
A subsidy set for 20 years expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs at Alcoa’s Portland facility are at stake.
No less than 2,000 jobs, both direct and indirect, could be at risk if they are closed.
In addition, there could be domino effects, as the smelter consumes around 10 percent of Victoria’s total electricity generation.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa’s Portland smelter is losing money and risks closing.
This move follows years of speculation about the future of the plant, initially as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently because of the electricity price for the plant.
AGL, which supplies the large aluminum smelter with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, said it expects three more owners to terminate their contracts.
The plant is majority owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.
"AGL expects the plant in Portland to continue operating, which means further physical demand for electricity through the smelter," the company said in a statement.
AGL further stated that the contracts were so-called “security transactions” that should have entered into force in November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they will end in 2017.
"AGL therefore expects the contracts to contribute to revenue in fiscal year 17," said the electricity supplier.
All potential impacts on AGL revenue from GY 18 onwards are currently limited by the forecasts of strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL announced that it had already written off the value of the contracts in its annual closing of $187 million in “anticipation of termination.”
Alcoa said that the decision to book out the contracts, the "ability of Alcoa... to operate the smelting mill or to ensure the power supply to the smelting mill" was not impaired.
The U.S. company said it had entered into a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which should have entered into force from November this year, even if it is still owed an explanation of why it resigned from the contract.
Analysts warn of the possible closure of the Portland smelting plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to poor economic conditions in the industry.
Referring to the analysts’ statements earlier this week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consumes around 600 megawatts of power annually and Tomago consumes around 900 megawatts of power annually.
Should both assets disappear from the market, this would result in a significant reduction in demand in the [electricity market].
And for us as producers, that would not be good," he said.
More than just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of manager and mother of Kardashian-Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of US Vogue.
Kendall, who is the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and ran at the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
“In a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover made me cry,” Kendall wrote.
The cover’s unveiling was followed by a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians similar?), scripted reality video showing the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (except for the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn, as well as in the presence of the all-time popular showbiz uncle and producer of Keeping Ryan Seacrest’s surprise, all of them planned a classic ending with their sister’s cover party: they forgot and that.
This is the stereotyped plot of almost every birthday episode of a children's show (Seacrest brought the phrase, "You thought we had forgotten you?" with the honesty of a cartoon rabbit on a broadcast spot at 8am), but Kris had to somehow let her other girls take part in this publicity.
With regard to the September issue of Vogue, a new era of the Kardashians has certainly begun.
Kendall's big sister Kim may have beaten her in terms of the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were on show in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league in itself.
The September issue is Vogue’s most sold issue of the year.
With a scope that resembles a picture book rather than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (according to Fashionista, of the 832 pages of the Wälzer, 615 pages were advertising).
The unveiling of his cover star is so eagerly anticipated that in the last two years, images of the magazine leaked even before the official announcement.
Women who have already been on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have been clearly more "celebrities who model" than "models who are celebrities" on the cover.
Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga had the honor.
But even with the small chance that Ms. Jenner - described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the former category, she is in good company.
These celebrities are not related to celebrities or reality stars or teenagers of today who know how to shoot a good Snapchat video (although all of that applies to Jenner).
They are truly talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.
Of course, Jenner’s success doesn’t please everyone.
With her reality TV story, Jenner’s position in the fashion world has always been somewhat tense.
In June, former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling her "the bitches of the moment."
These feelings started to boil up again when the news came out with the appearance of Jenner on the Vogue cover.
But riding around on the resentment seems to pass the point.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
She is literally a supermodel.
She's running for Marc Jacobs.
She promotes your Estee Lauder primer.
She and all her sisters sell you images of themselves on their respective paywall apps.
She sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time, she's on reality TV, probably just to see her sister Kourtney and their children.
Municipal law centers dismiss 160,000 people annually
More than 160,000 of the country’s most in need of assistance are turned down by municipal law centers annually, while the industry is preparing for the impact of further budget cuts on already overloaded transactions.
In Queensland, three out of five people—mostly elderly, immigrants, workers in need of assistance, victims of violence, and those who lack funds for unfair removals and the like—are already being rejected for free legal advice and legal assistance when they apply.
Legal services of the municipality, which are already overloaded, are ready for further cuts.
From June next year, it is planned that these legal centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds.
Queesland’s director of community law centers, James Farrell, said that the latest survey by the National Association of Community Law Centers revealed that thousands of people are already being rejected each year.
Farrell said the situation would only get worse without a repeal of the federal government’s decision.
"Queensland's community law centers are chronically underfunded, which means thousands of people are being rejected from important services they need," he said.
People leaving violent relationships, people with unmanageable and oppressive debts, families going through separations, workers unjustly dismissed — all of these people have legal problems and this survey shows they can’t get the help they need.
As of June 2017, the federal government will cut funds by 30 percent, which means that thousands of more vulnerable people from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help.
We urge the Federal Attorney General and Justice Minister, as well as Queensland Senator George Brandis, to immediately lift these budget cuts so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal assistance to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of the municipal law centers and their client communities, as well as that the Palaszczuk government is investing in this important work.
Donald Trump's election campaign charged after employees allegedly pulled guns
New York: Donald Trump’s campaign has been charged with alleged inaction after she was told that her North Carolina campaign leader pointed a gun at an employee in February while they were driving a jeep in February.
The incident is described in an indictment filed Wednesday in the state court of Charlotte by Vincent Bordini, a former software programmer for the campaign in that state.
Bordini stated that he had waited for months for the matter to be settled internally before realizing that “this would not happen.”
The campaign leader, Earl Philip, "draw a gun, put his right index finger on the trigger, and rammed the barrel into Vincent's knee," Bordini stated in his indictment.
After complaining to the local and regional campaign leadership, Bordini found that at least four other people had had the same experience with Phillip, he stated in the indictment.
"Weapons don't have to be fired to cause damage," Bordini said.
The indictment comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate triggered a riot when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the “Second Amendment People” — gun owners and gun friends — should take action if his rival Hillary Clinton is elected and appoint judges.
Trump’s campaign made it clear that the media had taken his words out of context and that he would not incite violence.
Bordini's complaint demands damages from the Duty of Care Campaign and from Philip for personal injury and permanent mental damage.
Trump’s press spokeswoman Hope Hicks was unable to reach for a statement.
Attempts to contact Philip also failed.
WCCB, a local news channel in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer an employee of the campaign.
Calls to his consulting company, Innovative Consulting Services, were not answered.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has so far led a controversial campaign.
The proceedings are Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Supreme Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Berlin/Schwerin: Poll before country elections: SPD and CDU lose
In the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (September 4th) and Berlin (September 18th) there are significant losses for the ruling parties SPD and CDU.
This was the result of representative surveys by the opinion research institute INSA for the "Bild" newspaper (Friday).
While the red-black government coalition could continue to rule in the north, this is not possible according to the polls in Berlin.
In both federal states, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances of continuing to face the head of government.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD fell from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.
According to the poll, the party would be just ahead of the CDU, which could come back to 23 percent.
The third place is disputed between the Left and the AfD.
The Left would be 19 percent (previously 18.4 percent), the AfD would be represented in the state parliament for the first time with 19 percent.
Despite slight losses, the Greens are moving back into the Schweriner Landtag with 6 percent (previously 8.7 percent).
The NPD and the FDP would not be represented in the state parliament with 3% each.
According to the survey, the SPD would only reach 23 percent in the Berlin parliamentary election (2011 election: 28.3 percent).
The CDU reached only 18 percent after 23.4 percent.
It was thus still behind the Greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but ahead of the left with 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).
The AfD would be represented in the House of Representatives for the first time with 14 percent.
At 5 percent, the FDP could hope for a return, but the pirates would miss the move, unlike in 2011.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The first smartphone
E-mail and Internet in slow motion: 20 years ago, the Nokia Communicator came on the market.
The successors dominate the world today - its manufacturer experienced a disaster.
The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.
It was thicker and bigger, so it was not good in the hand.
On the contrary, it was pretty chunky.
The built-in memory was initially eight megabytes, which would be enough for about two high-resolution selfies today.
An iPhone is now shipped with at least 16 gigabytes.
The Nokia 9000 Communicator was launched exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996, and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros, lovers can still buy the devices on the Internet, but they somehow date back to the stone age of the Internet age.
Twenty years ago, however, the communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair Cebit in Hanover as "office in the vest pocket format".
In fact, the new mobile phone was able to reach a lot for then standards: SMS and emails could be sent and received, even by fax was the communicator.
Even access to websites was possible via HTML browser, albeit excruciatingly slowly.
A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a small antenna, and the phone could be folded up similar to a laptop.
Then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen.
The price was quite proud: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. about 1400 euros.
The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany in 2015 was 392 euros.
In August 1996, no one could have imagined that the communicator would be the beginning of the smartphone era.
Everything has been different ever since.
The smart phones are a success story, though not for Nokia.
The Finnish mobile phone division experienced an unprecedented disaster, was eventually sold to Microsoft and handled.
Today, the market is dominated by vendors, all of whom came much later than Nokia.
Being online anytime and anywhere is everyday for a lot of people today.
In 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide.
Approximately 1.4 billion devices were sold, Samsung and Apple alone accounting for 555 million units.
Worldwide sales of the devices amount to around 400 billion euros.
In addition, the well-functioning business of the countless app providers and the telecommunications groups.
In the meantime, a whole industry has emerged around the smartphone.
The decisive breakthrough in the mass market came only in early 2007, when Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the iPhone at the Mac-World.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone and an internet communicator, all easy to use via touch screen.
The triumph of Apple began, still today the iPhone is the most important product of the group.
Nokia, Motorola, and Blackberry, which dominated the market, had the aftermath.
They eventually disappeared, BlackBerry is struggling.
Apple and Asian providers such as Samsung are now in charge.
The smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention.
On average, every German now looks at his mobile phone 88 times a day.
"We all have to learn to put the smartphone away once in a while," said Janina Kugel, who is responsible for human resources on the Siemens Board.
Permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and a blessing at the same time.
England needs to steer the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only to our local communities and throughout London, but across the country.
For me, this was Heathrow’s biggest attraction, just as it was in London in 2012, when we made a big effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.
The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.
And we will achieve this again by creating new opportunities for locals and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities, we will already create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment.
Just as they were ahead of us in London in 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of Heathrow’s expansion is too big.
I was told that England will never be ready for the Games and that we will be embarrassed on the world stage.
They were wrong in 2012 and they will be wrong at Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question he asks.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many and not for individuals.
Expansion is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, <0xC2><0xA3>211 billion in scientific growth, and leave a legacy of skills and employment around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team in Heathrow that has implemented a <0xC2><0xA3>11 billion infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from T5, which has been voted the world’s best airport terminal for five consecutive years, to T2 built amidst the world’s two most frequented runways.
Now they are ready to deliver a third runway, supported by <0xC2><0xA3>16 billion in private investment.
The 2012 London Games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will be one as well.
It is time to guide this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, safeguarding our future trade and creating a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury.
Adblock Plus, Facebook in the "cat and mouse game" regarding ad blocking
For companies that make money with online advertising, attempts to bypass ad blocking are a “cat and mouse game”, according to one of the software manufacturers.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad blocking on its desktop page, Adblock Plus published a blog post stating that users could update their filters in the program to block ads on the social network again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop page would change the encoding of its ads to make it harder for ad blocks to detect which part of the page is ads.
But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to bypass the new codes.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote that “this kind of back-and-forth battle between the ad-blocking open source community and bystanders has been going on since the invention of ad blockers,” and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with a new solution.
The fact that the world’s largest social media company has stepped into the fight is a strong indication of how worrying ad blockers have become for the industry.
According to a study by Pagefair and Adobe last year, around 200 million people worldwide use ad blockers; almost four times as much in 2013.
With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook from their mobile devices, mobile advertising accounts for 84% of Facebook’s advertising revenue.
The company is targeting ad blockers on desktop PCs because mobile ad blockers have no effect on Facebook’s social network mobile app and Instagram, a spokesperson said.
Advertising on desktop PCs accounts for a sufficiently large share of revenue, so Facebook seems worthwhile investing in such a step.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would update its “ad preference tool” to give people more control over ads targeted at them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that adblocking new filters would be worrying because they would also block content on the page that is not advertising.
"This is not a positive experience for users, so we plan to address the issue," a Facebook spokesperson said in an email.
Ad blockers are a blunt tool, which is why we instead focused on developer tools like Ad Preferences to put more control in people’s hands.
Woman killed in suspected suicide on Swiss highway
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are calling witnesses after a woman was run over by several vehicles on a highway in the early hours of Thursday in a suspected suicide.
The incident occurred on the A1 motorway near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.
A woman lay on the street in the dark "in an act of despair" and was hit by several cars, police in Vaud said.
It is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49, who was hit by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill herself.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been heard, but some have still not been identified, police said, urging them, as well as any witness to the incident, to report.
An investigation has been opened, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown.
Was a collision avoidable?
This is something that the prosecutor has to decide," Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers are not held accountable.
In each of the two cases - in which a person walked on the highway in the dark - it was decided that drivers did not have to assume that a pedestrian was walking on the highway in the middle of the night, the newspaper said.
Last year, a policewoman was acquitted of negligent killing after driving and killing a man who lay on the A1 near Payerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drunk and became unconscious on the street, the court heard.
The court found that the policewoman -- who had responded to an emergency call -- was driving in a justified manner and that the presence of a man on the street was a "perfectly extraordinary and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police on the number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
Venus was probably once habitable according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.
Scientists at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, with its hot, waterless surface and CO2 dense atmosphere, could have once had Earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously suggested that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus may have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere, but still slowly continued to rotate.
The model also illuminated the topography of early Venus.
The planet probably had more dry areas than Earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to accommodate life and protected against rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from a Sun that was 30 percent matter.
"In the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus exposes its day side to the Sun for almost two months," said Anthony Del Genio, a GISS scientist.
This heats the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the solar heat.
The result is average temperatures that are a few degrees cooler than those of the Earth today.
The model produced a history of Venus similar to evolution previously suspected by planetary scientists.
Although it was once presumably habitable, Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light over the course of billions of years.
Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burned away by ultraviolet light.
When their hydrogen escaped, there was only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide left with a deadly greenhouse effect -- Venus, as we know it today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy resigned as coach and vice president of hockey operations of the Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, citing an insufficient right of co-determination in the team’s decision-making process.
Alternate President/General Manager of Colorados Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the club will immediately look for a new coach.
"Over the past three years, I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and vice president of hockey operations of the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," Roy said in a statement.
Over the course of the summer, I’ve been thinking long and hard about how I could improve this team to give it more depth, it needs it, and take it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of the coach and vice president of hockey operations must be perfectly aligned with that of the organization.
He must also have a right of co-determination in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me of this decision today," Sakic said.
We all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him the best for the future.
Roy was named the league's best coach during his 2013-14 Avalanches debut season as the winner of the Jack Adams Award.
He led the club to 112 points and to first place in the Central Vision, but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the Minnesota playoffs and missed the post-season in each of the last two years.
The Avalanches recorded a 39-39-4 mark in the 2015-16 season and fell behind the wild for a second wildcard spot in the Western Conference by five points.
As a Hall of Fame goalkeeper, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers resume talks, suspend strike
Labour disputes over the remuneration of North Sea oil workers are suspended, as all parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of talks, negotiators said.
Strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group have been carried out sporadically on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group, as well as Unite and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the settlement process of the current dispute," the statement said.
We will hold some full-day sessions over the next few weeks, which will start early next year to address the issues anew.
The unions said their last strike, the first in over 25 years, was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent.
Wood Group has cut rates to its contractors in the North Sea by around 9 percent this year due to negative market pressure.
The company’s tariff cut follows a 10 percent decline for onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said additional cuts will give the company the space needed to get through the market downturn.
Shell, for its part, has fired thousands of people and announced plans to quit its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it streamlines its operations as a result of its mega merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude prices, an economic situation that had been exacerbated by the British decision in June to leave the European Union.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with labor leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labor disputes that has taken place in the North Sea for a generation.
The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.
"In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that works for many and not just a few," he said in a statement.
In 2016, less than $1.4 billion in spending on new projects in the North Sea is expected compared to an average of around $7 billion in the last five years.
Kepler Measures the Rotation Rate of Stars in the Pleiades Cluster
The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalog of rotation rates among the stars of the Pleiades cluster.
The new data will help astronomers understand why stars in the star cluster rotate at different rates and how the rotation periods are related to planet formation.
"We hope that by comparing our findings with other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between a star's mass, its age, and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.
The Pleiades star cluster is 445 light-years from Earth.
Many stars in this cluster of stars, formed around 125 million years ago, are now reaching adulthood.
They're turning the fastest now.
At peak rotation rates, these ripening stars emit large amounts of star winds.
As these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a slowing effect on the stars.
As a star ages, its rotation rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sunspots.
The latest catalog of rotational rates indicates that more massive stars rotate more slowly than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars to dancers, with larger stars spinning slower pirouettes than smaller ones.
"In the 'ballet' of the Pleiades, we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," Rebull said.
Because the Pleiades star cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotational rates.
"The Pleiades star cluster provides an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.
There is still a lot ahead of us that we would like to learn more about, how the how, when and why stars slow their rotation rates and hang their "dance shoes", so to speak.
Rebull and her colleagues have reported in detail in three newspaper reports on their latest analysis of the rotational rates of the Pleiades, which will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal.
A Controversial Baseball Star Resigns
The tears ran from base to base for Alex Rodriguez faster than the US baseball star in the best days.
After his emotional resignation announcement, the 41-year-old professional will be wearing the New York Yankees’ jersey for the last time against the Tampa Bay Rays on August 12.
“I love this game and this team.
"I'm saying goodbye to both," the 14-time Major League Baseball (MLB) All-Star player said.
Rodriguez was named the most valuable player in the league three times and won the World Series with the Yankees in 2009.
His signing under a ten-year contract earned him $27 million annually since 2007.
Until the end of the contract on December 31, 2017, he will act as a consultant and youth coach - with full salary.
As a player, Rodriguez paid back with performance for a long time.
With 696 homeruns, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ("runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994–2000), the Texas Rangers (2001–2004) and the Yankees since 2005, he achieved several milestones.
With Hall-of-Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two more baseball players have similar scores in the most important statistics.
However, the 41-year-old is not expected to be admitted to the baseball hall.
Because as successful Rodriguez - nicknamed "A-Rod" - was on the field, so controversial is his appearance outside the pitch.
Already in 2009, the superstar at ESPN admitted to having taken banned steroids between 2001 and 2003.
In August 2013, he was suspended for 211 batches due to an entanglement in the so-called Biogenesis scandal until the end of 2014.
Rodriguez is considered the main suspect for years of receiving performance-enhancing funds through an anti-aging clinic in southern Florida.
After a legal dispute, the suspension was reduced to 162 matches.
"The league might even have done me a favor for 2014 because I played through 20 years without a break," Rodriguez said at the time.
His farewell days are also not silent.
While many baseball legends once again get the big stage in their last games, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bench.
"My job doesn't include a farewell tour."
"My job involves trying to win every game," Yankees coach Joe Girardi said.
After all, Rodriguez, who was married to actress Cameron Diaz and is said to have had relationships with pop star Madonna and actress Kate Hudson, got sympathy expressions from fans of the Yankee archrival Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod," the supporters sang in the 4:9 defeat against the Rodriguez team.
2016 Olympics: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are first doping cases
Caught: Due to a positive doping test, weightlifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland is not allowed to start in Rio.
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official doping cases.
An athlete almost won a medal.
Before the seventh day of the competition, the first official doping cases were announced at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-meter obstacle runner Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were positively tested and excluded in Brazil - right before the start of the already critically watched athletics competitions, these news come at an untimely time.
In Chen, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances, was detected last Sunday.
The CAS International Sports Court confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon local time.
On Sunday, the 18-year-old took fourth place in the final over 100 m butterfly, only by 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.
On Friday, Chen should have participated in the 50 m freestyle runs.
Chen has asked the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to open the B-sample and hold a hearing.
The national association takes the matter "very seriously and demands full cooperation from Chen in the investigations," Xinhua quoted from a statement: "We will cooperate with the CAS International Sports Court and will accept the verdict."
For the first time in history, it is no longer the IOC but the CAS that is responsible for sanctioning athletes with positive cases.
Also on the night of Rio, the news of the positive test at Danekowa leaked, the 33-year-old went on the offensive herself.
"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive, this was an incredible shock," she told Bulgarian TV channel BNT.
"The only explanation could be dietary supplements," she said.
According to the report, the banned substance is the blood doping agent EPO.
Danekowa was temporarily suspended, according to BNT, the B-sample is already positive.
Bulgaria's Prime Minister Bojko Borissov immediately responded with criticism of the athlete.
"I don't understand why the athletes don't draw the right conclusions," he said, "we Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded."
For example, all weightlifters from the chronically doping nation are not allowed to participate in Rio.
On Friday, the case "Adrian Zielinski" was also known, the London Olympian in the class up to 85 kg was tested positive for the anabolic steroid nandrolone three days earlier, like his brother Tomasz.
Both contest the intake, but both are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg.
Before the start of the athletes, especially the case of Danekowa is another serious blow to the reputation of the entire sport.
The World Federation IAAF had banned the entire Russian team, with one exception due to systematic doping, the runners of Kenya also produce numerous bad news in Rio.
In the swimming sport, the previous offenses in China also caused fierce clashes between the athletes.
The Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang harshly.
"Sun Yang pissed lilac."
"When I see the podium over 200 m freestyle, I want to surrender," Lacourt said on French radio.
Sun was also at the centre of a confrontation with Australian Mack Horton.
“I have no time and no respect for doping fraudsters,” he said.
Sun had been tested positive for the stimulant trimetazidine at the Chinese championships in 2014, but only had to sit down for a three-month suspension.
Data theft: How perfidious hackers extort their ransom
Programmers of extortion malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful in doing so.
According to a recent survey by Malwarebytes of 540 companies in North America, the United Kingdom and Germany, 40 percent of the companies surveyed have been victims of at least one attack in the past 12 months, some of which have been repeatedly attacked with ransomware.
In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies have already been the target of ransomware extortion.
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransoms demanded by the perpetrators in order to be able to reuse the attacked systems and data.
According to Malwarebytes, the perpetrators are increasingly specializing their ransomware software in attacks on corporate networks.
If they are successful there, the potential ransom to be blackmailed will be significantly higher than for private users.
"We are currently observing a terribly fast evolution of malware," said Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski.
In 2008, most malware programs were still designed to send advertisements.
Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.
At first, private users were the target, but the switch to company attacks took place in recent months terribly quickly.
Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: Once active on a victim’s computer, it searches specifically for recently changed files such as Word, Excel or database files as well as archives of images and videos.
These files encrypt the ransomware and permanently delete the originals.
The software then presents the demands of the blackmailers.
In order to get the final encryption code to the files, the victims must transfer money - usually in the form of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.
But where the personal photo database is at stake for private users, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production stops.
Accordingly, the damage is higher when a ransomware hits.
22 percent of the German companies concerned reported losses in revenue due to ransomware, 13 percent even had to completely interrupt business activities, in one case people were in danger of death.
In Germany, several hospitals have already been victims of attacks, whose patients may be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.
"We always tell the victims: don't pay, you only promote the problem," explains Kleczynski.
However, 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay get their data back.
For managers, it is difficult to reject the perpetrators’ claim in the face of a standstill in the company.
The hackers, in turn, know this and try everything to build a good reputation.
In a recent study, F-Secure security researchers examined the user interfaces and contact with the blackmailers and came to the conclusion that the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to make more money.
They tell their victims via chat how to pay via Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support sites, or decrypt sample files for free.
And if private individuals are redeemed after payments of a few hundred euros, companies will sometimes have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to get their data back unencrypted.
Given the potentially high and relatively risk-free profits from ransomware blackmail, hackers are becoming more and more professional and sharing the work, security expert Chester Wisniewski of antivirus provider Sophos explains: “A single person can write a ransomware approximately within a week.”
However, it is more likely that they are three or four people.
The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software builder to the actual blackmailers.
The previous malware kits were created by buying the malware itself, advice, and additional tools for a one-time, fixed price between $1,000 and 10,000.
"A customization tool is included so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.
The blackmailers then search for more hackers to distribute the newly purchased software among the victims.
We live in a service industry.
So you log into one of the forums in the underground, buy the set from a criminal and commission another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
Payment is made per infected computer.
"Usually, the criminals then commission spammers with the dissemination," explains Wisniewski.
The risk of ransomware is now known by many companies that better back up their data.
More than 50 percent of the company’s IT leaders in the Malwarebytes survey trust in the ability to repel ransomware using file backups and scanner software.
Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.
"If encryption of data alone is no longer a sufficient threat to successful injuries, the perpetrators threaten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing," Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski said in a statement.
Thus, depending on the type of data, the potential for damage is still many times higher than before.
In the future, the perpetrators could also take on completely new goals in the Internet of Things.
At the Defcon Hacker Conference, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.
In the middle of the winter, the activation of such a blocked heater could be worth a ransom for some victims.
If the perpetrators block an entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future, ransomware could also become an issue in Industry 4.0.
One for all cases
HONDA HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
In the small HR-V, Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and also the versatility of a minivan.
Sounds pretty overwhelming, but the HR-V, which was built on the same new platform as the new Jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.
Although the only 1.60 m high HR-V looks rather small, the passengers have a lot of space both in the first row and in the rear, it does not seem tight at any point.
The materials of the interior are well-finished and look pleasant, only the top of the cockpit drops slightly.
The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in terms of storage space.
Not only is a luggage compartment of 453 l available with raised and 1026 l with folded backrests, but there are the "Magic Seats".
This is less magical than it sounds: the seats of the rear seat can be folded up like cinema chairs and thus offer storage space, which is 1.24 m high from the floor to the ceiling.
The luggage compartment is well loaded, but the loading height is slightly higher with 650 mm than the comparable Peugeot 2008.
The tested 1.6-litre diesel with 88 kW/120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.
However, he may do his job a little quieter.
The daily consumption of 4.7 l/100 km is pleasing.
There is another engine: a 1.5-litre petrol engine with 96 kW/130 hp.
A four-wheel drive is not offered.
The driving behaviour is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.
But the steering should be a little more direct.
The equipment leaves nothing to be desired in the tested top variant "Executive".
The safety systems include the City Emergency Brake Assist (works up to speed 32), the Collision Warning System and the Lane Keeping Assist.
The collision warning sometimes irritates because when maneuvering, it evaluates many obstacles as "approaching objects".
The high beam assistant works very reliably.
And the intelligent tempo controller responds to traffic sign recognition and drosses the speed if necessary.
However, full connectivity is only available for the top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation, app integration and more.
Two USB and one HDMI jack are located under the armrest and are therefore a bit cumbersome to achieve.
The around 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel is fine.
Those who do not want to invest so much, receive the gasoline from 20,000 euros, the diesel from 23,000 euros.
The engines meet the Euro 6 emission standard.
With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and everyday car.
Airline is not liable: Fall on passenger bridge
An airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge.
For liability is only conceivable in the case of hazards typical of air transport, argued the Düsseldorf Higher Regional Court (Az.: 18 U 124/14).
The plaintiff had broken a kneecap in the fall.
However, the accident could have happened anywhere - it was a general life risk, the court said.
The airline did not have to pay the man any damages.
Case of illness: when the organizer pays
Sick holidaymakers receive money back after their trip only if the cause of the disease can undoubtedly be found in the hotel.
However, this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests show the same symptoms.
In the negotiated case, a family suffered severely from diarrhea and vomiting on the second day of their Turkey vacation.
She spent almost the entire holiday in the room.
The holidaymakers attributed their illness to a defective sewage treatment plant that allegedly polluted the seawater.
The family thought the trip was deficient - and complained to the organizer.
The plaintiffs were unsuccessful in court.
The sewage treatment plant was indeed defective.
But the organizer only learned about it shortly before the plaintiffs left.
He had to assume by then that the sea water was fine.
So he did not violate his information obligations, according to the verdict.
Especially since no impurities were found in the samples of water.
The illness of several hotel guests - possibly due to contagion among each other - belongs to the general risk of life.
Out of 691 guests, only 38 were ill.
De Maizière said that after the violence perpetrated by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people were worried about further attacks.
The state must react simultaneously and decisively to terrorist threats.
What is certain is that our country will not answer the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division.
We will not give this triumph to the terrorists.
However, if criminals had to leave the country faster, this would increase security and also strengthen the public’s consent to refugee policy.
De Maizière wants to achieve implementation of the proposals by the 2017 Bundestag elections.
He also announced a further personnel reinforcement of the security forces, "on a medium four-digit scale over several years."
Sympathy advertising for terrorism must be punished again.
Video surveillance is to be improved, the weapons law is to be revised in such a way that the purchase of weapons on the Internet is made more difficult.
According to de Maizières, the most widely discussed confidentiality obligation for doctors should be maintained.
However, in dialogue with the medical profession, he wants to look for solutions on how to reduce the risk to citizens, he said with a view to psychological abnormalities, for example.
In order to counteract the radicalisation of refugees, the minister believes that better social care is necessary.
Teachers should be better prepared for dealing with traumatized people.
To prosecute criminals in special areas of the Internet (Darknet), de Maizière plans the use of covert investigators.
SPD leader Gabriel said: “The SPD is ready to talk about anything that helps to further increase security.”
It is important that the Minister of the Interior has clearly spoken out against activism.
"This was a slap in the ear for the sharpeners in the CDU/CSU," Gabriel told the newspapers of the Funke Mediengruppe (Friday).
De Maizière had previously rejected calls from the Union for a burqa ban and the abolition of dual citizenship.
He considers a general ban on full veiling to be constitutionally problematic.
You can't forbid everything you refuse, and I refuse to wear the burqa.
You can talk about rules, for example, in road traffic or for witnesses in court.
Greens chief Simone Peter accused the minister of trying to simulate power and ability with ever-new anti-terrorism packages.
Left party leader Bernd Riexinger said: "Float sayings and a tightening of the right of residence do not bring more security to the people of this country."
Improved traffic flow on the motorway junction
There is a lot of traffic on the bypass road - here is a picture of November.
But that should change: the right-hand lane should be extended.
This is good news for all car drivers who are in traffic jams every night when they drive over the motorway junction (A 43).
On Tuesday and Wednesday (16/17 August), the state road construction company will extend the right-hand turn lane by 700 metres in the area between Hammer Straße and Weseler Straße exit.
Drivers can then thread directly from the Hammer road to the right.
The big advantage: Traffic splits earlier, which improves the overall flow on the busy section of the Federal Road 51.
The idea with the extended exit had the CDU group in the district representation Münster-West.
The narrowing of the roadway on the feeder annoys the drivers especially between 5 pm and 7 pm.
On weekdays, the backstay extends to the bridge over the Albersloher Weg and sometimes beyond.
The reason is the needlehole on the B 51 just before the exit Weseler Straße.
From here, the traffic is steered only one-lane via the highway bridge.
The second track had to be rebuilt a good three-quarters of years ago.
The reason: Static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the necessary load-bearing capacity to accommodate mainly heavy-duty traffic in two lanes.
How long this bottleneck and the associated working-day congestion will last, the competent national company cannot say.
However, years are to be reckoned with: because the bridge has an official residual useful life until the year 2034.
For the extension of the right-hand turn lane, the state company has deliberately chosen the less traffic during the school holidays, because disabilities are to be expected.
Traffic will be driven past the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Intercultural journey: cultural offers for schools
The international class of the Waldschule attended the play "Das unsichtbare Haus".
The association Nima's and the Junge Theater are now planning a music project.
The association Nima's enables young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "Klasse International" of the Waldschule Kinderhaus has visited a performance of the award-winning play "Das unsichtbare Haus" of the Junge Theater Münster.
In the context of the "Intercultural Journey" initiated by the association Nima's, 19 students between the ages of eleven and 15 attended the staging in the Kleines Haus.
Since the beginning of the year, the association, which has set itself the goal of cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background, has offered schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project.
Most of the young people in the class came to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016, among others, from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria, and speak little German.
Thanks to the choreographies, the scenic images and video animations, they were still able to follow the course of the action, according to the press release of the Junges Theater Münster.
The association Nima's, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Sprakel, and the Junge Theater will work together in the coming season as part of a music theatre project.
From October to December, young people with and without a refugee and migration background between the ages of 14 and 20 will have the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing, dance, acting and music.
Offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theatrical language teaching are in the planning.
The project "Intercultural Journey" continues.
Given the increased number of refugees, the association expects many classes to participate.
Rain instead of shooting stars: hope for weather improvement
The weather has made the shooting star-guckers in the southwest of Germany in the night to Friday a stroke through the bill - but there is still hope.
The night was badly suited for watching the sky spectacle because of clouds and rain, said the chairman of the Welzheim observatory, Hans-Ulrich Keller, on Friday morning.
Our hope is in the night of Saturday.
The weather is supposed to be good, then we are sure to see many shooting stars in the sky.
The star scales are Perseids, which are among the fastest shooting stars at 216000 kilometers per hour.
They have their name because they seem to come from the constellation of Perseus, which rises in the northeast.
Relaxing Night: Tips for Sleep Disorders
In the evening you roll around forever, at night you lie awake for hours, in the morning you can no longer think of sleep long before the alarm rings.
This is anything but restful.
After all, you are in good company with such problems: According to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep disturbances and more than ten percent often or permanently feel that their sleep is not restorative.
How do sleep problems or sleep disturbances manifest themselves?
There are several forms of sleep disorders, and they can be caused by a variety of causes, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeß, board member of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine.
What is commonly understood as insomnia, however, is a sleep disorder.
In particular, many people feel that sleep is unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, board member of the German general practitioner association with practice in Varel, Lower Saxony.
What is behind sleep disorders?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
There may be organic, psychological or behavioral factors behind it, but also medications.
It is not uncommon for sleep disorders to be the expression of another disease.
"Very early waking up is common, especially with depression," says Weeß.
And it may be that different factors condition each other.
For example, if you have a herniated disc, you can lie down badly, wake up every two to three hours, and perhaps start to ponder about everyday problems and worries, Weeß gives an example.
This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.
When should you go to the doctor with sleep disturbances?
Anyone who does not sleep well over a period of a month in at least three nights a week and is impaired during the day should go to the doctor, Weeß advises.
The impairment can look very different: you are depressed, tired, sleepless, have difficulties with attention and concentration, are easily irritable, have mood changes or physical ailments such as stomach or headaches.
In order to alleviate the sleep disorder, it is important to find out their causes.
Treatment options include behavioral changes, cognitive behavioral therapy or medications – classic sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and for a maximum of two weeks.
There are hardly any sleep physicians in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleep medical center at Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin.
Therefore, if you have sleep problems, you should first contact the general practitioner, Weeß advises.
He can determine with examinations whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who should go to the sleep lab, and what happens there?
For the examination in the sleep lab, physicians advise, for example, in snoring with respiratory failures, in sick daytime fatigue, in sleepwalkers or if you do not find the cause of a sleep disorder, Fietze explains.
You don’t really have to prepare for the investigation.
You should spend the day normally.
"Just don't take a nap," says Fietze.
After wiring, you go to bed at your normal time.
In addition to the electrodes on the body, you wear nose glasses, a chest strap and a sensor on the finger.
In addition, a camera on the ceiling records the sleeping person.
How can those affected deal with the problems?
There are quite a few adjusting screws you can put on for a better sleep.
Weess lists: Regular sleeping and waking times, not lying in bed for too long, not sleeping during the day, not watching TV to fall asleep, avoiding alcohol and not looking at the clock at night - then you start calculating immediately, and this is not at all conducive.
What the jungle camp has to do with missing medals in swimming
Former German swimmer Markus Deibler has commented via Facebook on the disappointing performance of the DSV team at Olympis.
In December 2014, he won gold for the first time at the Doha World Short Track Championships, setting his first world record.
Former DSV athlete Markus Deibler has now faced his criticized ex-teammates via Facebook.
"In a country where an Olympic champion gets a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20,000 prize and a jungle king <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150,000, no one should be surprised about missing medals," the 26-year-old wrote on his Facebook page.
The support system in swimming sports is poor, while the doping controls are very good.
This means that we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not look so closely at the issue of doping or even do it.
"I'm not saying that the controls should be discontinued here," he said.
If he wanted to start a comeback, Deibler would have to be reported nine months before his first start to the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany (NADA).
This is how it should be with countries.
"Those who cannot be controlled by independent WADA/FINA inspectors for a certain period before the World Cup/OS are not allowed to participate," demands the Wahl-Hamburger, who now runs an ice cream shop.
Airport: gang of luggage thieves arrested
Professional thieves at Düsseldorf Airport
Civilian investigators from the Düsseldorf police managed to arrest two women and two men aged 50 to 61 on Thursday.
The suspects had committed several baggage and baggage thefts as a gang.
Around 9:30 p.m., civilian officials in the area of Düsseldorf Airport recognized a gang known to the police from past theft offenses.
The two women and two men had committed several crimes since mid-July of this year and had done so in a collaborative, collaborative and particularly professional manner.
The specialists of the Criminal Commissioner’s Office 34 can prove four acts to the thieves who had entered Germany specifically to commit crimes.
In total, they captured more than 15,000 euros.
Old buildings, a few linden trees, in between a remainder of cobblestones: The Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not seem like that at first glance, but the police consider it one of the "dangerous places" of the city.
Walking along the road from east to west, you will pass playgrounds, a freshly painted kindergarten and an organic shop.
On the facade of a grey house, someone sprayed "ugly!"
Opposite a Lidl, which will also be demolished soon, is already being built: by 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments will be built here.
Articles about this "trendy district", as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, are, however, preferably depicted with burning cars in the last weeks.
The reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, now the residents have rental contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.
Since the beginning of the year, the Berlin interior senator Henkel has repeatedly called for a harsh action by the police against the project, describing the area as a "no-go zone" for police officers and the 94 as a starting point for autonomous violence.
After clearing the ground floor rooms, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers on June 22, the police patroled for three weeks with 30 to 40 officials and three crew cars on site, blocked parts of the road and prevented visitors from entering the house with the number 94.
Meanwhile, construction workers refurbished the rooms on behalf of the unknown homeowners.
On July 13, a Berlin administrative court ruled that the eviction had been illegal, and a day later police and construction workers withdrew under the cheer of sympathizers and local residents.
On this summer afternoon, the street looks peaceful: parents go for a walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others chat before late.
In the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kindergartens.
Left-wing violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in the Kiez since 1999, and Jana*, who raises three children here, are mainly annoyed by the police presence.
They share with the residents of the house projects the concern about rising rents and gentrification.
It doesn’t sound like a party that wanted police protection from the vandal left.
The trench that the Berlin interior senator and the police open between house occupiers and their neighbors does not seem to exist.
Friedrichshain in eastern Berlin was actually a traditional working-class district, which still today has a low average income and high risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city.
House occupations and the resulting housing projects have long been part of the Kiez: In 1990, numerous houses in the former GDR were occupied, including almost the entire Mainzer Straße very close to the Rigas.
While the Mainz had been evacuated under a large police force in a real street battle, many of the projects in the Riga were legalized and are still inhabited today by the people who occupied it 26 years ago.
At the same time, in recent years, the district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and voters from all over the world: with them now residents from the GDR times and former squatters share their kiosks.
This is also evident in rents, which have increased by almost 60 percent in new rentals since 2009.
Many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols of this development: they are recognizable by injected panes or freshly painted facades, which were thrown with color bags.
No other street has been mentioned so often this year along with the words “left-wing autonomous violence”.
One reason why not all neighbors see this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: according to statistics, crimes such as assault are directed almost exclusively against police officers.
The majority of the offences are property damage, which tend to affect new buildings and newly renovated houses.
For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a rental house next to the controversial 94 for 17 years, there can be no question of uncertainty.
As far as violence is concerned, it is appeasing: the people in the 94 are their neighbors, they certainly weren’t.
Even the famous burning cars have not existed directly in the Rigaer for a long time.
For the architect, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "Here you help each other, live together on the street and get more of each other than elsewhere".
Neugebauer deliberately moved into Riga Street - and remained.
That’s why it was so important to her that the local residents get their street back: from the police, politics and the media, who all suddenly claimed interpretive sovereignty over the district in July.
But in the eyes of residents such as new builders, the road continues to be taken away from them: through faceless new buildings in former building gaps that displace the old residents.
"These are ultimately condominiums that are not interesting for many here - people who are not so well-dressed live here," she says.
“I can’t approve of violence and destruction at all.”
But what to do if no one ever listens to you?
There is frustration on all sides, including the police and the residents.
Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for newcomers who are annoyed by color bombs: the house projects and the left-wing scene belonged to the kiez.
Anyone who moves here should be aware of this - just like someone who moves into a pub district can complain badly about noise there.

Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugee commissioner
Annika Deuschle is the contact person in terms of integration and organizer.
She is also a social worker on site.
Since July, Annika Deuschle has been the refugee commissioner for Urbach.
The social educator supports the team of the administration around Achim Grockenberger.
She sees herself as a point of contact for all stakeholders: refugees, refugee aid work group, administration, authorities and anyone else involved.
Regine customer of the working group suggests that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the egg-laying woolen milk pig, which has a problem above all.
Thus, some - less ridiculous than aiming at the multitude of desired tasks - had meant when the administration wanted to advertise the position.
We were looking for an administrator with a talent for languages and people, combined with many years of experience in the field of social work, just an egg-laying woolen milk pig.
But administrative work is not her central area, says Annika Deuschle.
Above all, it is about organization, working with the people on site and behind the scenes as well as networking.
The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.
She has limited a 50 percent job to three years.
"It was high time," says Regine customer that Annika Deuschle supports honorary and full-time actors.
There are big and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.
Soon there will be new containers in the Wasenstraße
For some time now, it has been a serious problem to find housing for the refugees who have been accepted.
The municipalities are responsible for the connection accommodation.
They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented homes.
The costs of building, renting or renovating these accommodations must be borne by the municipalities themselves.
The responsibility changes from the district office to the municipality and job center.
Problem: There are free properties, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.
The search has been very difficult for some time.
In fact, the administration does not find private homes.
It does not work so far, you are relying on private apartments, according to Deuschle.
Therefore, community dwellings must be maintained, as it is so beautifully said.
So soon new containers will be set up in the Wasenstraße.
But it is only with apartments that it is not done.
Perspective is the keyword, Regine Kunde and Annika Deuschle agree.
In addition to a permanent residence, internships, training places, school places, one-euro jobs and temporary work for refugees and migrants need to be found or set up.
"More seats would be good," says Regine customer.
Many work in the building yard or help caretakers, do charitable work - and that motivated and very neat, as Annika Deuschle reports.
She hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external impact.
This is not “occupational therapy.”
But work doesn’t just mean work.
The day needs a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer.
People need to develop a sense of belonging.
So it needs offers such as sports, contacts with locals and, above all, language courses.
Professional courses are rare.
So here too, administration and volunteers intervene.
It is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany.
The length of the procedures is a problem.
They have to explain to the refugees that it just takes time and they can bridge the time meaningfully, for example with language courses.
Anyone who at some point develops the feeling that he cannot help anyone in Urbach, must not work and be useless, he will never integrate.
The vast majority are motivated.
But there are also problems, says customer honestly, "people who can't do anything at all". The work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always also to motivate others.
All of this is a mammoth task.
A difficult question: after the recent events, are the two afraid of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?
"No," says Regine customer quite clearly, "what some may call naive". However, a residual risk can and does not want to exclude them.
But the helpers are more sensitive.
These incidents are also the subject of refugees.
They'd be afraid the assassins would put them in disrepute.
“They want to show that they have nothing to do with it,” says Regine Kunde.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
Thus, principal and volunteers on site and in the region must look for activities.
They always have in the background that a new surge of refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.
Does Germany need an upper limit?
To answer this question clearly, politics is afraid.
Actually, it is unfair to put them helpers on the spot.
"In Urbach we have not yet arrived where we wanted to go," says Annika Deuschle.
No new refugees, that would ease the situation.
Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbachers are already busy integrating the previous people reasonably.
There are currently about 100 people, mostly young men.
But when people are in need, you have to help them, both women agree.
The political situation in the world is so complicated that there are no simple answers.
Schorndorf: burglar wanted with helicopter
