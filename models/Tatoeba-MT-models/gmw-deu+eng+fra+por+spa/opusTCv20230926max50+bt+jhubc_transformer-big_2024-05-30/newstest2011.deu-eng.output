The Czech Social Democrats in Prague know neither Voldemort nor the "confectionery".
The new councillors of the capital city from the ranks of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD will obviously have to overcome certain language barriers in order to understand their old-new colleagues from the ODS in the Prague council and the city council at all.
The newspaper Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz once "knocked off" members of the new Council of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD as they mastered the notorious slang that has become commonplace in recent years, in which today’s coalition partners were at the helm in Prague.
The coded vocabulary introduced by the Prague political elite in the past era by Mayor Pavel Bém is borrowed from some of the most famous actors, situations and causes.
Surprisingly, it turned out that the new councils in regards to which these new terms are tapping somewhat in the dark.
At least that's what they say.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"I don't know."
"I'm more of a novice in Prague politics," Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Kauck<0xC3><0xBD>, the new Councillor for Culture, responded to the test of the "paten vocabulary".
But Councillor Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina – a political veteran – also reacted in a similar way.
For example, the term "golf hole".
"That's the only expression of those you're presenting to me here that I use from time to time."
"Otherwise, I don't like a lot of slang."
From the vocabulary published by the daily Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz in June before the ODS Election Congress, the editorial team picked out six terms, especially those notoriously associated with the Prague Magistrate.
The Social Democrats should define the terms "Voldemort", "Prague's largest golf hole", "going to the confectionery", "bullying", "treasoning the capital" and "disguising".
Three Prague councillors agreed to the test, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future head of the Prague school system - promised to take part in the conversation first, but then did not even pick up the listener.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test from the outset.
"I don't care about these things and how the bourgeois Democrats talk to each other, I don't judge about that."
"It is important to me how we understand each other within our programmes," he countered.
As already indicated, Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Kauck<0xC3><0xBD> in the headline mentioned above allegedly did not recognize that the influential entrepreneur and friend of the ex-mayor Bém, Roman Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek, was talking about.
The term "Voldemort" says nothing at all to Kaucky and the only term he correctly guessed during the test was "the biggest Prague golf hole".
"This is the tunnel Blanka," says Kauck<0xC3><0xBD>, adding to safety: "But I know that from the newspaper."
And jokingly, “I’ll probably have to take a language course.”
The "golf hole" is then correctly deciphered as a tunnel Blanka not only by Matador Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina, but also by the Councillor for Environmental Affairs Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Plach<0xC3><0xBD>.
However, both Social Democrats also know who the term Voldemort stands for and Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Plach<0xC3><0xBD> even guesses where this figure can be found and thus also what it means to "go to the confectionery".
"I think that means going to some Prague catering establishment," Plach<0xC3><0xBD> is pretty close to the riddle solution, if you know that this is the headquarters of Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek's companies.
In agreement with B<0xC5><0x99>ezina, however, he claims to have drawn this knowledge from the newspaper rather than that this vocabulary would be his own.
According to the test participants, there does not seem to be a similarly naturalized slang among the Social Democrats.
"I also asked my colleagues, but obviously there really is no such thing with us."
"We call each other by name, from time to time we also use abbreviations or nicknames," says the chairman of the Prague-based <0xC4><0x8C>SSD Petr Hulínsk<0xC3><0xBD> - called "Hulda" by his party mates.
"At school I was called B<0xC5><0x99>íza (birch), but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina tells us his nickname.
The newspaper Deník Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz has tried the name and see there - it works.
Councillor Weinert is friendly to the party's colleagues the "Grandpa" or less friendly the "Old", the representative Miroslav Poche, who before the elections made attention by machinations in party sponsorship, is called by some colleagues "Igrá<0xC4><0x8D>ek" (known Czech Lego figure).
Nicknames are thus the only nicknames that the Social Democrats allow in the internal party language.
Hulínsk<0xC3><0xBD> allegedly does not like to be called "Hulda", but Deník Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz registered another nickname of the Prague president.
His nickname "Doctor of the Rubber Bat Rights" is allegedly related to Petr Hulínsk<0xC3><0xBD> having earned his title of Doctor juris at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to stop the torture of "witches" and issued a brochure
Women who are stamped as witches in Burkina Faso usually have some common social characteristics.
They are more likely to belong to the older generation, they do not find a job - for example, for health reasons, they are single and have no children.
When one of these women "becomes" a witch, she is strictly isolated so that she cannot become dangerous to the rest of the village.
"Men are seldom affected by this fate."
"This is also avoided by young and healthy women as they help with work and give birth to children," a nun describes the situation in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso in a special home for more than a hundred women who were expelled from their communities.
The local government now decided to take action against this abnormal "social measure".
And for this reason, he issued a brochure to stop the "witch chase".
But this thing has a catch.
“More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso cannot read,” the newspaper “der Standard” pointed out to the dilemma of written enlightenment.
However, witchcraft is also common in other African countries.
In Ghana, the neighboring country of Burkina Faso, 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahová was tortured to death by three women and two men - they poured oil on her and just burned her.
This incident was also reported by the BBC server.
The perpetrators, however, claimed that the matter had only been a coincidence of unfortunate circumstances.
According to her version, oil is ignited, which is used for ritual anointings.
After the group tried to “expulse an evil spirit” from the woman.
The isolation of "witches" supports the people here regardless of their education.
"The Standard" quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso as saying: "Eaters of human souls are a danger, once as today," he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso is at least trying to defuse the witch hunt, last year, the Gambian president has properly mixed the president himself.
"President Yahya Jammeh ignited a monstrous witch hunt after his aunt's death, as they allegedly participated in her death and would now try to kill the president himself by black magic."
"He called on shamans from nearby Guinea to help, who, accompanied by police officers, soldiers and the president's bodyguard, forcibly abducted women and men from Gambian villages and brought them to the president's farm in Kanilai," Amnesty International said in its report.
On the farm, the incarcerated people were forced to drink an absud of plants with hallucinogenic effects, which also caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of the people arrested did not survive the stay on the farm.
It was only because of international pressure that the nearly a thousand prisoners were released.
A tenant of Bakala: He does heat in the oven - yet pays higher rent
An elderly underprivileged man is leaving the client center of the RPG Byty company of the "coal baron" Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Bakala, the largest private owner of rented apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm, a portfolio with three new leases to three apartments: for his own and the apartments of his daughters and his son, who is currently serving a prison sentence.
All three have just increased their rent as part of the so-called "deregulation".
Instead of 3500 kroner monthly rent, the son is to pay 4100 kroner next year for a 2 bedroom apartment with a second category kitchen.
"And since there is not even running hot water in the apartment and you have to heat in a simple coal stove," he taps with his finger angry at the new lease of the son, for which he has a power of attorney to sign.
"But what - I signed," he explains half disappointed and half resigned.
The BytyOKD.cz Citizens' Association, which described the new rental terms as "incorrect and immoral," advises tenants not to simply sign the new contracts and to wait until December 7 to publish guidance on how to act against such contracts.
But the man is just beckoning.
"One says this, the other that," he makes a dark face.
The Ostrava region thus becomes a large "deregulation laboratory".
After the New Year, this deregulation is facing most rented apartments in the Czech Republic, whose tenants do not yet pay a marketable rent.
Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz therefore decided to visit this "laboratory" in person.
The RPG waiting room in Haví<0xC5><0x99>ov is one of four in the Ostrava region and already nine o’clock in the morning on this Tuesday.
Right next to the door are the bodyguards of a security agency and a call device.
"Miete 2011", so a special touchpad lights up on the touchscreen.
Shortly taped and the device spits out a license plate.
We have hardly deciphered the number "157" and it is already beeping on the large display on the ceiling of the waiting room.
Half a second later it's your turn.
A little later, an elderly couple enters the waiting room to ask about the rent, but the rush in the waiting room apparently does not apply to the new rent.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - repair requests, insurance matters and the like.
As of mid-November, in the Ostrava region, the envelopes with the new leases will flutter into the mailboxes for most tenants of the total of 44,000 apartments in the RPG portfolio.
The RPG Byty suggests a rent increase of about 15 to 38 percent in the letters.
The special counter for the new rentals in the client centre has been open since November 18th.
"The action runs a little over a week, that is, this is only the beginning," the ladies behind the counter reply after a moment of hesitation when the "client" turns out to be a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakala’s former miner’s homes are a hot topic.
Before the elections, the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD parliamentary vice-president Lubomír Zaorálek, from Ostrava, had taken up this issue quite loudly, no wonder today the newspapers are full of it.
“Twenty years I want a new floor from them.”
"They couldn't even change their toilet glasses," the man mentioned at the beginning breathes.
Until now, according to the employees, pensioners are mainly waiting at the counter to see if they really get the promised rental discount that RPG promises them if they sign the special offer in time.
The other tenants, who sign the new lease by December 15, will also be entitled to a half-reduced February rent.
So far, however, "deregulation switch" in Haví<0xC5><0x99>ov is anything but overloaded by demands.
"Of yesterday's 360 clients, only about 40 to 50 of the rent in 2011 were due here," the counter officials estimate.
RPG offers individual rental agreements on their websites as well as on wall panels where it seems necessary.
However, if the leased parties do not agree on the new rent, it will be determined by an independent court.
"This should not be a threat, but should be understood as information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal procedure," RPG explains on its websites.
"Nobody goes to court here," says one of the RPG Byty's co-workers and a man on the street in front of the client center at least partially agrees.
"I have 13,000 (crowns) pension, of which I have 5,000 left for food, where should I get the money for a court dispute," he says.
Then the employee becomes insecure.
"Let's see."
"Mr. Zaorálek tells them about the media not to sign and so people are still waiting," she says.
The regulated rent ends in most of the Czech Republic at New Year’s Eve 2011 and RPG Byty says the rent increase is an economic necessity.
"The existing amount of rent is not even enough to maintain the housing fund", argues Pavel Klime<0xC5><0xA1>, the director of the RPG Byty company's housing portfolio, and - in the opinion of the homeowners, the main reason for the increase is the neglect of the housing fund, criticized by the angry tenants.
While RPG was able to invest four billion in housing from rents taken in the years between 2005 and 2010, in the four years from 2011 to 2014 it is expected to be 5.2 billion.
On the large-format LCD display on the ceiling opposite the upholstery chairs in the waiting room of Haví<0xC5><0x99>ov, a few red-lighting information appears in between.
"The rental increases in 2011 by 15% and less affect 31 200 apartments, that is more than 90% of RPG's apartments."
"Always this means a maximum of 7.50 CZK per square meter per month," can be read on the LCD monitor.
Only 400 apartments from the RPG portfolio increase rent by 38 percent.
"In these cases, it is about raising extremely low rental prices of CZK 19.66 per square meter," argues RPG.
With 2600 apartments, the rent will remain at the same level next year.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not push rents up sharply, but will take place gradually within four and eight years.
What's more - the company imposes a further obligation: All revenue from the rent increase (see diagram) the company wants to put back in the apartments, especially in heat savings - in new windows and in thermal insulation.
But - these should primarily benefit those people who sign the agreements on the rent increase.
The architects took a look - the office also includes a kindergarten
The office building Avriopoint in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch.Design.
But who would expect a mini kindergarten here, with everything included: colorful walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a mini playground on the outdoor terrace.
This kindergarten has been available to Arch.Design employees since last year.
From the first designs for the new building Avriopoint, the Arch.Design design and architecture office, from whose studios a number of well-known Brno buildings originate, counted on the premises for its company mini kindergarten.
Most of his 90 employees are in the baby boom age and the company is concerned that the project managers and architects return to their workplace as soon as possible.
Along with the possibility of working shortly, kindergarten is another bonus that Arch.Design has to offer its employees in the concept of their social program.
This makes it easier for civil engineers to reconcile their demanding profession and child care.
The mini kindergarten is an original idea of the Arch.Design employees and with the support of the management they managed to win funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs for their project.
The company mini kindergarten is financed by the Human Resources and Employment Policy Operational Programme from funds of the European Social Fund and from the state budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to this funding (subsidies of CZK 2.8 million), the necessary facilities and equipment were obtained and for a period of 2 years qualified personnel and operations were provided.
After the use of the funding (2 years), the company Arch.Design is obliged to continue to operate the mini kindergarten for 3 more years at its own expense.
The preparation of this project took a whole year, with the company Economy Rating providing active assistance in the processing of the application.
The children are taken care of all-day qualified staff - a nurse and a kindergarten teacher, the kindergarten can be visited by children without age restrictions, although most of them are over three years old.
And since this is a mini kindergarten, only 5 children may be present at the same time, but several children alternate the day with each other.
The kindergarten operation is flexibly tailored to the needs of the parents, the children of all employees have the same rights with regard to the use of the kindergarten - regardless of the company hierarchy and their respective positions.
Although it is about individual education and nursing, the programme content in the mini-kindergarten is nevertheless comparable to the supporting programme of pre-school education.
The children not only play here, but above all, they are offered excellent lessons - from basic knowledge to preschool lessons, besides, they also learn English.
The classroom is not only equipped with toys and creative games, but also with a computer available to the children.
What's more - the presence of young children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive company environment.
Parents can take a look at the children at any time, eliminating the stress of late picking up the children from a distant kindergarten.
Parents use their working hours more productively.
No wonder that natural and loyal employer-employee relationships also emerge here.
Arch.Design thus ranked among the Czech companies that offer significant benefits in recruiting new employees, which are family-friendly and strengthen their personnel marketing through such programs.
A bone house fascinates even after 100 years. Take a look at the interiors of Gaudi
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs like the spine of a dinosaur and the balconies are torn fish mouths.
This is the Casa Batlló of the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
From the local inhabitants, the house with its organic forms was nicknamed "bone house".
Organic shapes, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, tile fragments and mosaics, the dandruff-reminiscent facades and ubiquitous soft lines, all these are typical features of the Art Nouveau style of Antonio Gaudi.
The facade of the house plays with dreamlike lines, tender colors and textures reminiscent of nature and living things.
It is only on closer inspection that one notices that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm and thoughtful order.
At night, the whole façade looks even more plastic, dramatic and the special lighting enhances the gloss of the colors.
The same sweeping lines and twisted shapes also dominate the interior of the house.
Wave-shaped wood copies the window frames, railings, decorative elements of doors, even lookouts and strips.
The Batlló house in the Eixample district on the lively shopping street Passeig de Grácia no. 43 was created by the renovation of a house from 1877, which architect Emilio Sala Cortese carried out.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, originally insisted on the demolition of the old and the construction of an entirely new building, but ultimately he agreed to Gaudí’s idea of an unusual and also cheaper renovation.
However, the Casa Batlló building was not designed by Antoni Gaudí alone.
He worked with the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
It was precisely on its drawing board that the decorations for the representative apartment of the reality owner were created and the use of mosaics on the facade was also his idea.
However, numerous other painters and artists also worked on the design of the facade.
Working together on the designs for the Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fruitful collaboration between Jujola and Gaudí.
Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaudí’s Casa Milá in the Park Güell, which also houses other works by Antoni Gaudí.
Shortly after its completion, the house was nicknamed "bone house" by the local inhabitants of its organic forms.
Others called it the special window opening mechanism because of the " yawning house".
It is also said that at the top of the building is the sword of St. George, patron of Catalonia.
But also other sculptural elements symbolize hidden religious motifs.
Gaudí designed for the house a central heating system unique to the time with vent ducts and typical fireplaces.
Something bizarre seems to be their 45-degree inclination.
In his work, Gaudí consistently ignored all the building codes of the time and was not impressed by them.
Before the start of construction, he obtained the corresponding building permit from the city, but the information he provided about the planned reconstruction was so vague that two years later, the city fathers were so horrified by the result that they demanded remedy.
Among other things, the councillors also stumbled upon the fact that the building with its pillars even interfered with the public sidewalk.
However, there were no more changes, quite the opposite - just fifteen days after the district's request for this, Josep Batlló filed a request for approval of the rental of the two highest floors of the house - and it was promptly granted to him.
The owner himself moved into the lower floors.
In the gallery on the 2nd floor was a social lounge, on the third floor were the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment.
The ground floor was leased to a jewelry store.
The entire six-storey building runs through a staircase up to the roof terrace.
The basic elements of the conversion eliminated all right angles and straight lines and replaced them with curved and curved walls.
But Gaudí also worked with a modern concept of interconnecting spaces.
The social part can be completely connected by opening the salon doors and so a larger society could chat comfortably without having to relinquish some intimacy in more confidential conversations.
In addition to a new facade, Gaudí’s renovation also gave the house a rather unusual roof and two more floors.
Gaudí’s play with the light is also impressive, as are the blue and white glazed tiles with which the courtyard is covered and the lighthouses.
The play of these two colors gives all floors of the house a maximum of light.
He simply took advantage of the principle that white reflects light better than dark colors, which absorb the sunlight on the contrary.
The Casa Batlló, which was included in the Unesco World Heritage List in 2005, can be visited by anyone today.
On the first floor is the most spacious and magnificent apartment opened to the public.
It was only in the year that the owners decided to take this step on the occasion of the 150th birthday of the famous creator.
When it was found that this was a fairly profitable business, the visits were maintained, and they were also extended to other common rooms and the attic rooms, including the roof terrace.
However, the price for visiting the monument is not a cardboard stick, it is 16.50 euros, students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist cards receive a 20 percent discount.
This amount exceeds the entrance fees to other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to get to know the real atmosphere of the house with its dragon towers, try to make friends with one of the residents and visit him at home.
The right mattress and the right bed grid? Women have different wishes than men
Not the best bed frame, but the quality of the lying surface - so mattress and rust make the good bed.
However, these must complement each other harmoniously in order to meet the wishes of the specific user.
Many things play a role in the selection - the weight, the size, the state of health and last but not least the sex of the sleeper.
Equally important is the interior, in which mattress and rust have to be subordinate.
A typical example?
In a weekend home where it is not heated regularly, latex mattresses are not well suited, as they take much longer to "get warm."
In addition, they are significantly heavier than conventional polyurethane mattresses.
And - they should be turned on regularly.
If they do not have enough vent ducts in the core and lie on a solid plate, moisture accumulates: it is not excluded that mould forms under them.
Of course, the choice also plays a role in what you are used to.
Those who have been abroad for a long time, where very high mattresses with a soft layer are common, will find it difficult to get used to a low mattress with a hard surface.
"Well, all the hockey players who have come back from the NHL have complained to me that they can't sleep properly here anymore."
"For their skinned shoulders, heels and hips, they simply need a soft layer of visco foam (memory foam - a shape memory polymer)."
"I recommend these, among other things, also to people with diabetes who suffer from a disturbance of the nervous system, so that they can receive the 'information' from the joints and the skin poorly," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in upholstered furniture.
That’s why I bought these mattresses with visco foam (memory foam) for many hockey players years ago, but also for other customers.
"Today, this is no longer a problem, because such mattresses are offered by the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico, among others."
And you don’t necessarily have to be a famous ice hockey player to learn to appreciate the benefits of the visco foam.
This "miracle" actually works quite simply.
The foam optimizes its hardness and shape according to the absorbed heat, in other words, it clings directly to the warm body.
Nowhere is it pressing, at night you don’t roll around like after a heavy fight.
You just sleep much better.
The viscoelastic foam also offers protection against decubitus (wound burn).
When choosing the size of the mattress, you should still add the length of the soles of the foot to the height, i.e. about 21 to 34 cm.
Men and women, who are up to 180 cm tall, need a 210 to 220 cm long bed.
Each sleeper should have at least 90 cm of lying width available, i.e. 180 cm together.
For single beds, for example for singles, 120 to 140 cm are appropriate.
For the sake of comfort and also for potential visitors.
Otherwise, the following rule of thumb applies for the ideal bed width: "When you lie on your back, there should be enough space for the slightly angled arms", advises Ing. Helena Prokopová, the master of the upholstery and room furnishings, who has been devoted to the problem of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture for years.
With a double bed, everyone needs their own rust and their own mattress, but be careful when shopping, so that the mattresses are equally high.
Otherwise, there is nothing else left but to mount the grids at different heights and that is not possible with every bed frame.
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with spring skeleton 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters should be on the mold layer and the fine cushion.
"With your hand or when you sit down, you must not feel the feathers under any circumstances," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a special rust type.
Fully upholstered beds with mattress and base like grown together Siamese twins have nothing to look for in the bedroom.
These mattresses can not be ventilated and the cover can not be washed, which is already common today.
And since you lose between 0.2 to 0.75 l of sweat in a single night, it is clear that after five to seven years, the mattress slowly becomes a huge (and clogged) sieve.
For this reason, experts reject advertising slogans that promise a lifetime of up to 25 years, even a lifetime warranty, for mattresses.
Every thing has its ifs and buts.
And therefore a practical advice from the dealers: with mattresses of 120 or 140 cm width, one should not shy away from the hygiene of washable, removable covers, yet it is recommended to use a mattress protector, which can be easily removed and washed.
Even though today mattress covers are usually made with an all-round zipper, so that you get two halves after opening (immensely important for the washing process and the washing machine size!), manipulation with larger mattresses, especially performed alone, often seems like the unequal battle between David and Goliath.
Do they have a solid plate in the bed instead of a grate?
Get out of here!
Or at most for a bed for unloved guests and for a single night.
Even so, they should prefer to provide the plate with ventilation holes (if there are no in it already) and use mattresses with spring skeleton and 15 cm minimum height with so-called pocket spring core and fine padding.
Polyurethane mattresses do not belong on such a base.
Latex or sandwich mattresses (possibly also combinations of latex and coconut) are suitable for non-adjustable slatted frames with 14 to 18 slats (slats), always paying off grates with a larger number of slats, i.e. from 28 and more slats, with lumbar support in the lumbar area and the possibility of regulating the slat hardness.
Adjustable lamellar gratings do not include spring skeleton mattresses, as they do not respond to the ergonomic adjustment.
In addition to adjusting the stiffness of the spring strips, special flexible shoulder modules are also offered.
This involves a special fastening of the spring strips, which makes it possible to press in the spring strips or even to bend them in such a way that they allow the shoulder of the sleeper to sink in a point-by-point manner.
Especially for men with wide shoulders an important thing.
There are even mattress manufacturers who have started to use soft zones for the shoulder area in "men's mattresses".
The ladies are also thought of - they are given these soft zones in the hip area.
For the most demanding customers, point-elastic wing spring systems (lattoflex) or grates with point-elastic contact pads with so-called multi-torsion suspension are designed.
The pressure is distributed over several points, which reduces the voltage.
But - if you use a bad (too large and full) pillow for the right mattress and proper rust, most benefits will be lost again.
Again, a rule of thumb: the pillow should support the head, its tips should only reach up to the shoulders, so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
Ideally, a 50 x 60 cm cushion appears, as for example the Scandinavians like it.
In the side position, the pillow (together with the shoulder relief zone in the grate or the soft zone in the mattress) should balance the shoulder height.
Our modern mattresses have something in common with the former straw bags (filled with hay).
Modern manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials or at least their admixtures.
Even in mattresses, the new magic word is "organic".
Natural oils – for example castor and soybean oil – are increasingly used instead of petroleum raw materials for the production of polyurethane foams.
Soya is probably used by all known manufacturers.
"Organic means that in mattresses, their core is made of materials of purely natural origin," explains Petr Va<0xC5><0xA1>í<0xC4><0x8D>ek of the company Tropico Plus.
However, natural substances are also used in the production of mattress covers - one of the first was aloe vera.
However, you can also treat yourself to microcapsules that spread fresh forest or lavender scent while sleeping.
Again, there is a difference between man and woman.
While in men, a "cooling" plant extract from birch leaves is used so that the mattress cover can absorb the heat and cool the body, the covers for women have a "warming" effect.
Extracts of red peppers stimulate blood circulation, so the weaker sex gets warm during sleep.
And today’s favorites?
Cold foam mattresses (it has larger pores with destroyed cell structure and is therefore more breathable than commercial polyurethane and also much more flexible).
The combination of the different stiffness (hardness) of cold foams and visco foams creates multi-zone mattresses that know exactly where the head, hips and heels are located.
For a high-quality mattress, however, you have 7000 crowns and more to charge.
However, health mattresses are usually charged with lower VAT because they are considered medical aids.
Gumotex was the first Czech company to benefit from this advantage.
You see, saving on the mattress and on the rust is not so easy.
From time to time, there are special offers from manufacturers and dealers that offer two mattresses at the price of one.
The Magniflex brand offers the Duofreeze mattress with visco foam memory for 11,990 CZK.
You can get the second one for free.
It was the material Tempur that initiated the era of viscoelastic foams with open cell structure and high density at an almost cosmic pace.
No wonder they were developed for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to enormous overloads during the launches.
Tempur becomes soft in heat, in a cool environment it solidifies again.
Thus, it adapts perfectly to the human body and distributes the body pressure in an optimal way.
It is therefore not only ideal for preventing pressure burns, but generally increases sleep comfort.
However, viscoelastic foams are not only used in mattresses, but also in other health products, such as special foot cushions, which are intended to provide relief to the legs and vessels.
Local manufacturers use, for example, Eucatherm C foams, Twinsaver or similar products.
More and More Parents Want Human Monitoring Devices to Control Kids
The fear for their own children is growing and so more and more parents are considering monitoring them via GPS.
The system, which was originally invented to search for cars, is as well able to locate people, which would also be helpful in such cases as the recent disappearance of nine-year-old Ani<0xC4><0x8D>ka Janatková.
The device is currently about the size of a cigarette box, but soon it should not be larger than a wristwatch.
Many people have been terrified by the disappearance of Ani<0xC4><0x8D>ka and are looking for ways and means to better protect their children.
Also for the price of compromising their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that this is not about spying around, but an effective means of reducing the likelihood of tragedy," says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS tracking devices in the Czech market.
“I admit that there may be abuse of such devices in individual cases, for example, if you put it in someone’s pocket without them knowing it, but we have not had such a case so far.”
“Most customers really buy it for security reasons,” Pilin adds.
In his opinion, however, the child should always know what purpose the "box" serves and how to use it in an emergency.
However, child psychologist Dana Bo<0xC4><0x8D>ková points out that if a child does not like to wear such a thing, it simply gets rid of it.
“Even very young children show great creativity when it comes to deliberately losing certain things when they don’t want to be controlled.”
"Mobile phones initially aroused great expectations among parents, but they can be switched off just as easily as these new surveillance devices," says Ms Bo<0xC4><0x8D>ková.
In their opinion, it is also controversial whether such a facility will actually help in the event of an attack.
"In the case of planned kidnappings, the kidnapper practically always checks whether the child has any electronics with which it could be located."
“Today, it’s the cell phone.”
"If such surveillance devices were to be used more widely, they would also look for them, as their sale would certainly be accompanied by massive advertising."
"In these cases, the criminals are always one step ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
However, she admits that similar devices can be quite helpful in the event of a sudden attack by a pedophile.
According to Roberta <0xC4><0x8C>ech of the company RC Monitoring, which provides tracking services for both automobiles and people, the existence of such a device can help even if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The device can be set to report the respective position at certain intervals."
"Even if it was destroyed immediately, at least the last position of the person concerned is available."
"In the case of more expensive devices, even an inclinometer is integrated, that is, if you fall and lie motionless, the device immediately sends a warning stating the position," says Mr <0xC4><0x8C>ech.
In his opinion, similar services could also perform intelligent mobile phones with navigation, you only need to implement a special software.
The problem with current tracking devices is that they are either match-box-sized devices that resemble trailers or smaller mobile phones.
There is always the risk of losing them.
According to Mr. Pilin von der Macro Weil, devices that look like normal digital watches are therefore being tested in the present.
"This has the advantage that the potential attacker does not have to recognize that it is a monitoring or locating device at all.
"Or he will only notice this after a certain amount of time, which gives the police a time advantage," he adds.
No matter which direction the development goes - to bracelets or trailers, the same technology is always used as for vehicle locating.
So for the combination of tracking function with the help of the GPS system (as with the navigation in the car) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position.
The army has so many ignition strings that you could wrap all of the Czech Republic they hold but only two years
The Czech army has purchased 445 kilometers of ignition cords, with explosives being ignited.
In the previous year, the Ministry of Defence had already delivered 224 kilometers of firing cord to the army camps.
It is reassuring to know that the armed forces have spent 225 years.
The problem is only the shelf life of the ignition cords - two, but at most four years.
The army bought the ignition cords from the stock company STV Group, a. s. for lapse 40 million kroner.
In his justification for purchasing this huge amount of ignition cord, the MF DNES general staff replied that the soldiers would consume up to 60 kilometers of ignition cord per year.
According to the research by army pyrotechnicians, which the MF DNES addressed, this indication shows that the entire army would have to undergo an extremely intensive pyrotechnic training every year - from all generals and officers of the army command to the secretary and cleaning ladies.
Defence Minister Alexandr Vondra and Army General Vlastimil Picek were not excluded.
Only in this way could the considerable annual consumption of sixty kilometers of ignition cords be justified halfway.
This length corresponds to 25,000 detonations.
But even so, these army stocks would last for more than ten years.
But if the old rule of experts still applies, that for the training of every new professional soldier two meters of firing cord is completely enough, then the army has created a calming supply for the already mentioned 225 years through these new purchases - also from the point of view of the increased need of the pioneer and special units.
Soldiers of the rapid response brigade recently complained to Defense Minister Vondra that they had almost no cartridges for small arms, so that shooting exercises are severely restricted due to the lack of funds.
Not to mention the lack of underwear.
"I also don't understand why they buy so many ignition cords from us."
But that's ultimately their decision, they'll already know what they need."
"For us, the army is a good customer, which we as a dealer would like to meet as much as possible," says the sales manager of STV Group Jan D<0xC4><0x9B>ck<0xC3><0xBD>.
Jan Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek, the spokesman for the Ministry of Defence, justifies the purchase of hundreds of kilometers of ignition string with the fact that the army would have been covered with this "munition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan D<0xC4><0x9B>ck<0xC3><0xBD> from the STV Group only speaks of a four-year service life of the ignition cords and police and army pyrotechnicians only of two years.
"With perfect storage, the four years mentioned are probably also possible," admits one of them, but wants to remain unnamed, so as a soldier not to be accused of criticizing the army.
After the expiry of the service life, any ammunition must be thoroughly tested to ensure that it is still reliable and does not endanger the lives of the soldiers.
However, these tests are not for free, but cost more money.
Another argument of the Ministry of Defence is the volume discount for the 445-kilometre ignition string.
"They cost us sixty percent less than last year's delivery of 244 kilometers," spokesman Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek tells us the position of the buyers of the Ministry of Defence.
For comparison, the annual consumption of firing cords of police pyrotechnicians liquidating ammunition from World War II or the Soviet Brothers’ Army has barely exceeded 1,500 meters for a few years.
And the police always order only those quantities of this ammunition that they can consume before the end of their life.
Because of the safety of the pyrotechnicians, the possibility of flexible purchases of more modern and therefore more reliable ignition cords is also kept open.
The Ministry of Defence has huge problems with the liquidation of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Treaty, when the two hundred thousand-headed Czechoslovak People’s Army was preparing for its campaign to the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnicians, the MF DNES addressed, the Czech armed forces expect in a few years the same problem in the liquidation of hundreds of kilometers old ignition cords, which they have bought so "cheap" today.
To this day, I am interested in the contacts I have gained thanks to the competition
The winning placement in the "Small Entrepreneur of the Year" competition helped Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun sell the franchise of his hotel.
Winner of last year's competition "Small Entrepreneur of the Year" was Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun from Liberec.
The story of his success sounds like a film scenario.
Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun liked to travel.
Only abroad did he realize that in Liberec there was a lack of good accommodation at reasonable prices.
From the savings of his holiday work abroad and with the help of a bank loan, he bought a decaying house with five apartments.
Considering that he was a college student in the sixth semester, this was certainly a courageous undertaking.
"The price-quality ratio at the time annoyed me and so I tried to do something about it," says Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun.
He rented the first reconstructed apartment to foreign workers.
He immediately invested the entire profit back into the house, which he subsequently converted step by step into a pension with 54 beds.
Since then, in just seven years of entrepreneurial activity in Liberec, he has succeeded in opening four guesthouses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four-star "Pytloun Design Hotel".
This year, another first-class hotel was added.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, to which we have sold our franchise concept and other interested parties to the Pytloun hotels franchise have already contacted us," says the number one entrepreneur from last year.
"A large share of this license sale to operate hotels just had the victory in the "Entrepreneur of the Year" competition, Mr. Pytloun adds in recognition.
The victory has earned him greater fame, yes popularity in Liberec and its surroundings.
"People recognized me on the street, they often even congratulated me afterwards and I have to say that did really well," he recalls.
I really recommend everyone who wants to create something to take part in this competition.
You don't have to win right away either, any visualisation is good.
He says that he still benefits from the contacts and acquaintances that otherwise would not have happened.
"With some people I met thanks to the competition, I still maintain regular business relationships to this day."
In his opinion, the fame associated with success also relates a little to each of his employees.
And there he is to the seventy.
"I notice greater loyalty and pride in them that they are part of something that receives general recognition."
I really don’t see this as just personal success, no, it’s the result of the good work of all of us.”
"My name has only come to the fore," says Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun modestly.
I wish my successors a quieter year than we had in Farmet
Victory euphoria was quickly replaced by the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his determination, Farmet has the worst behind it.
Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>, the owner of Farmet, received the prize for the first place of the Vodafone Company of the Year competition last year.
At the time, the jury acknowledged the efforts he made in the small toolmaking industry in <0xC4><0x8C>eská Skalice to get a company out of the ground that generates hundreds of millions of sales.
"I can say that this appreciation has encouraged not only myself but also all my employees and strengthened our self-confidence in struggling with the competition," says the winner of the previous year.
At the beginning of Farmet’s company history was the effort to do something useful.
And then when the state offered his father Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD> a small workshop for rent as compensation for the property confiscated by the Communists, he did not hesitate long, abandoned his career in the company in which he was employed until then, and founded his own company for the manufacture of plastic tubs with a few comrades of his father.
A short time later, they began to focus on vegetable oil presses.
Within 18 years, they have become the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
But it was only through its success in the aforementioned competition and its medialization that it entered the awareness of the non-professional public.
"Not only do our customers now perceive the Farmet brand much more strongly, but our foreign partners have also begun to work with a company that has achieved the greatest possible success in their country to attach greater value," says Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>.
Last year at Farmet, however, was not only about victory euphoria.
The appreciation was based on the company’s economic results in 2008 and part of 2009.
And 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of tool making products.
The crisis, which then shook even less citizens, but above all companies, was just at its peak - many companies were forced to stop their investment projects and restrict the purchase of new facilities and technologies.
"Of course, we could not escape this situation."
"Revenues fell by 40 percent, we had to cut production and even resort to redundancies," explains Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>.
A viable company sometimes has to take such unpopular measures.
However, it managed to get the situation under control and keep the company in the black, even though with less profits than before the crisis.
In one case, the company was not willing to make cuts - in terms of investments in research and development.
"From the grant, we built a research and training center, strengthened our presentation at international trade fairs and won major prizes at domestic exhibitions," says <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>.
Everything shows that we have overcome the crisis.
Revenues are growing again and with them the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a lot of joy in winning - but in a quieter atmosphere," Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD> says.
An opinion poll that cleanses up with nonsense regulations
The opinion poll on the "absurdity of the year" is part of the entrepreneurial competition for the fourth time.
Some nonsense regulations have already succeeded in eliminating them.
The dubious winner of the next year's opinion poll "Absurdity of the Year" advanced the duty to create documents on authorities that are available online.
For example, more than one third of not quite four thousand voting entrepreneurs decided.
For example, the Social Security Administration required a paper extract from the commercial register, even if the official could have retrieved it by two mouse clicks.
Thanks to the opinion poll, this is changing.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require excerpts from the commercial register in the future when checking social security payers," <0xC4><0x8C>SSZ spokeswoman Jana Bura<0xC5><0x88>ová said.
The purpose of the "Absurdity of the Year" opinion poll is to take a close look at all the regulations and orders that entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic have to comply with and to repeal the nonsensical ones.
For the fourth time this year, it is part of an entrepreneurial competition organised by the German Wirtschaftszeitung (HN) and enjoys growing popularity among the public.
If there were three thousand people in the vote last year, there were four thousand this year.
No wonder, because there are still a lot of legal obligations that only serve to hinder business activity.
"In terms of the number of income tax forms, for example, we are taking a leading position in the world," notes Karel Havlí<0xC4><0x8D>ek of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Traders of the Czech Republic.
The simplification of entrepreneurial activity has been the declared goal of all governments in recent years.
Compared to the world, however, the situation in the Czech Republic has hardly improved.
According to data from the World Bank, the Czech Republic ranks 74th in terms of business conditions, with an eight-place lower ranking compared to the previous year.
The Absurdity of the Year competition was announced for the first time in the year and takes place every year according to the same scenario.
Anyone can report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense from April until the end of September.
The web address www.firmaroku.cz is used for registration. Accordingly, the organizer of the competition selects seven candidates for the "anti-price" and lets the public vote via the Internet on the websites www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
It wins the absurdity that gets the most votes.
For this year’s opinion poll, more than a hundred, more precisely 105 meaningless regulations and orders have been registered.
The tips come not only from entrepreneurs, but also from professional associations and journalists.
Among the nominated "finalists" of the competition are, for example, provisions that maintenance vehicles for highways and expressways have to pay tolls or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets have to present every two years.
The list of this year's "Seven" is published on the pages of the competition.
The announcement of the competition at the beginning of November in Prague’s Wenceslas Square is part of an event in which political and public figures regularly participate.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, the director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Traders of the Czech Republic, and Petr Ku<0xC5><0xBE>el, the president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, were at the peak of the competition.
"Where the state throws a stick between the legs of the entrepreneurs, there can be no real economic recovery, so my goal is to repeal at least thirty paragraphs every year, which today unnecessarily make their undertakings more difficult for the entrepreneurs," said Martin Kocourek, the Minister for Industry and Trade.
Efforts to get rid of nonsensical arrangements have been effective.
In 2007, the people most disturbed the entrepreneurs imposed duty to notify the commercial office at the site of their permanent establishment three days in advance of the intention to go with an exhibition stand to an exhibition or fair.
This obligation has been repealed by virtue of an amendment to the Trade Act.
The duty, which received the second largest number of votes in 2007 - the duty to report to the Labour Office business trips of employees in the amount of up to 30 days - was abolished by the so-called "Green Card" law.
And all the good things are three:
To the absurdity of 2009, the ordinance imposed on physiotherapists to have a mirror, a refrigerator and two personal scales in the office was chosen.
This regulation was somewhat mitigated by the Ministry of Health this year - the refrigerator compulsory dropped.
A new category honours socially responsible companies
Evaluation criteria are humanitarian, environmental, educational or sports projects
A novelty in this year's fifth year of the competition of the Wirtschaftszeitung (HN) is the category "Responsible company of the year 2010".
The basic idea of this competition is to promote reasonable and fair undertakings.
"We would like to support companies that are aware of the consequences of their entrepreneurial activity on the environment and support socially responsible initiatives," says Patrik Bartholdy, regional manager of the mobile company Vodafon, who is the proclaimer and guarantor of this competition, as well as of the competition "Rebel of the Year".
For this year’s first year of this special subcategory of the main competition Vodafon Company of the Year, companies registered for which success is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is extremely inspiring and would provide enough material for a standalone article.
Although they differ diametrically in the subject matter of their work, their efforts still have a common denominator - support and consideration.
This is, for example, about disabled people, because of personal problems or the health of one’s own employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Czech Republic, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera, which promotes the emergence of non-formal sports teams among its employees, who then participate in numerous tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main sponsor of a fund for disabled children for seventeen years.
A paper factory in Pod<0xC4><0x9B>brady is also exemplary in taking care of its health-disabled employees, who make up 70 percent of its workforce, for which it was awarded the title of "Responsible Company of the Central Bohemian Region"; in the Vodafone Company of the Year competition, it ranked third in this region.
In the Olomouc region, the accounting firm MiRyz Soft won, introducing, among other things, a flowing working time reduced to an average of 35 hours per week, without a proportionate reduction in wages.
The jury also honored the fact that the company mainly buys from Czech manufacturers, supports citizens’ initiatives in its area and works according to environmentally friendly principles.
"We strive to recycle as much as possible in order to minimise the impact of our business activities and administration on the environment," explains her Managing Director Milu<0xC5><0xA1>e Ryznarová.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem region, in turn, cares about the health of its employees and has therefore purchased ergonomic armchairs and keyboards for all notebooks, promotes homework for their employees and uses carding services provided by a local protected workshop for corporate actions.
"In addition, we support the People in Need Foundation, which provides concrete assistance to the local Roma community," says Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Such<0xC3><0xBD>, the company's representative.
Last but not least, it is also worth mentioning the activity of the cleaning company "Praní a <0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B>ní" from the Karlovy Vary region, which contributes its employees to their pension insurance in the form of extra bonuses.
"We provide our employees with contributions for food, work, qualifications and holidays," says Josef Strapá<0xC4><0x8D> from the construction company Czasch from Bruntál, the winner in the Moravian-Silesian region.
For the Responsible Company of the Year category, all the district finalists of the Vodafon Company of the Year competition were automatically registered, who answered the questions of the questionnaire attached to the registration and sent it to the organizer by 15 August at the latest.
Incorrect or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were excluded from the evaluation by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the competing companies left the questions unanswered, they were excluded from the 'Responsible Company of the Year' competition, but were not disqualified in the main Vodafone Company of the Year competition."
"A separate registration for this competition is not possible, as it is merely a sub-category of the main competition company of the year," explains Karel Goldman of the organizing agency Bison & Rose.
Pilsner Bodenfonds - Arrests by the police during a public tender
In the building of the Ground Fund in Pilsen, the anti-corruption police have made arrests in recent days.
The local media entrepreneur and real estate dealer Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. was abducted by the detectives in handcuffs.
The latter allegedly attempted to manipulate an ongoing public competition for the settlement of restitution claims in such a way that the properties offered in the competition were awarded to a specific interested party.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. is said to have paid half a million for it.
"At this point, I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting a person for the offence of fraudulent acts in a public competition," said Antonie Zelená, the head of the Pilsner public prosecutor's office of the newspaper "Právo", more details could not be given in view of the ongoing investigations.
24 hours later, the 46-year-old entrepreneur was released by the police again.
How he was able to manipulate public competition can only be speculated, given the scarce official information.
The spokeswoman of the Lubomír <0xC4><0x8C>erná Land Fund pointed out to Právo’s question that the police had actually made arrests in the Pilsner Subsidiary of the Land Fund during a public competition.
"It was about a client and not about one of our employees," she said.
According to Ms <0xC4><0x8C>erná, the public competition had the correct term "invitation to tender claims for the transfer of land under the Land Act" and would take place in cases where several applicants expressed interest in the offered land.
"These persons offer a higher value of their restitution claims to be settled by the transfer than the declared property value within the scope of the request."
"According to the claims offered, the order of the potential acquirers is determined, after which the land fund transfers the property to the person with the highest bid," explains the spokeswoman of the fund.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. apparently had information available on who had registered at the request and, since he himself was a legitimate person because he had purchased a number of restitution claims, he offered a property interest to withdraw from the competition.
Obviously against a fat payoff.
That would also be a sufficient explanation of why he had such a large amount of money with him when he was arrested.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. has had all too good contacts with the Pilsner Bodenfonds in the past.
He also played a role in the cause of the former head of the land fund Václav Sankota, who was prosecuted for distributing land in replacement restitutions that had already been decided on the location of construction projects.
At that time Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. acquired from the Ground Fund, for example, plots of land intended for the construction of public roads, more precisely at the site where the construction of the access to the Borské pole industrial park was planned.
Later he exchanged this very cheap with the magistrate for a house directly in the historic center of the city, which far exceeded the value of the plots.
At that time, the town hall had to give up a heavy heart in order not to endanger the construction project by blocking the plots.
Housing costs of households increase by several hundred monthly
Households will not only have to expect higher costs for all types of energy from January onwards, but also higher water and sewage charges and for district heating and rents in some places will also grow.
Starting in January, families will have to pull several hundred crowns more from their wallets each month than before.
Electricity will be up to 4.6 percent more expensive, gas by 2 percent and more, in some cities you will have to pay up to a tenth more for water supplies and in some places district heating supplies will also be more expensive.
Electricity costs households a few hundred more crowns per year.
All major suppliers lowered the power prices, so it is to blame for the significant promotion of electricity production from renewable sources, especially from photovoltaic systems.
Gas is only getting moderately more expensive, but this is exactly when people need to heat the most and have the highest consumption.
Here, too, a few hundred more crowns per year can be expected.
While electricity and gas are becoming more expensive throughout the Czech Republic, the prices for district heating vary from city to city.
Especially larger places are planning price increases.
Starting in January, for example, households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové will have to pay up to 50 kroner per month for district heating, and more than 1000 kroner per year for families in Liberec.
The residents of Prague, on the other hand, face a 9 percent increase in water and sewerage fees in the event that the city increases infrastructure rents.
If the rent does not change, it is only 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague is still among the lowest compared to the whole of the Czech Republic.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sewage charges are expected to increase by 7.4 percent.
Enormous rental price increases are to be expected, for example, in 140,000 rental apartments, where the so-called rental regulation will be eliminated from January.
For example, the housing company CPI Byty, which owns 2500 apartments in <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem, plans to increase rents by one hundred percent from January onwards.
Those who do not agree with this rent increase, the company wants to prosecute them in court.
The regulated rents, which are still paid in approximately 300,000 homes today, are expected to increase by more than 10 percent next year.
Czech children get drunk with Fernet and rum beer is out - it just works too slowly
Fernet, rum and vodka, exceptionally also a good whisky, which has been stolen from the father of the house bar.
These are the drinks after which drunk Czech teenagers under fifteen need to be treated most often in emergencies.
No exception are children who have to sleep their hangover repeatedly in the hospital.
This is evident from the experiences of doctors who are confronted with similar cases in the reception of the children's departments of clinics.
“Beer or wine are completely out of fashion because it just takes too long to get drunk.”
"Today's trend is clearly hard alcohol," said Právo Lud<0xC4><0x9B>k Pelikán, the chief doctor of the children's department in the central Bohemian clinic Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovice.
"Whisky, if it succeeds in stealing a bottle from the father's house bar, and if not, then at least Fernet or vodka.
"Vodka has the advantage of being able to mix it with Juice, then it doesn't smell so strong," explains the chief doctor.
The spokeswoman of the Motol Faculty Hospital, Eva Jurinová, is right.
"The most common is about fernet or rum."
"This is the current alcohol trend, especially in primary schools."
"Singularly it was also about Slibowitz, which is taken from home," Ms Jurinová said.
According to chief physician Pelikán, thirteen- or fourteen-year-old drinkers in hospital admission are far from an exception.
Before the hospital in Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovice, where he has been working since this year, he worked for ten years in the pediatrics department of Motol Hospital, where the ambulances delivered drunk students from near and far.
"A girl had to be hospitalized four times."
"She started her career at the age of 12, when she was first introduced with 3.5 per mile of alcohol in the blood and in combination with 'extase'," the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was at the exhibition grounds in Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice at some dance party."
"The interesting thing about this was that it didn't even seem strange to her mother that her daughter didn't come home for 48 hours," the chief doctor said.
Precisely the lack of interest of the parents or their incredible tolerance when pushing with their own offspring is considered to be one of the main causes of the growing alcoholism of children.
According to experts, it is not about a real dependence in the true sense of the word in children.
"Alcoholism is a long-standing chronic dependence on alcohol and all related phenomena, and this is not the case with these children."
For those who repeatedly drink alcohol, a negative family-social background is usually characteristic," explains Pelikán, chief physician.
According to the spokeswoman of the Motol hospital, Ms. Jurinová, about forty drunk children were admitted to the local department of pediatric and adolescent medicine by mid-November.
However, only the cases of severe alcohol poisoning that required hospitalization are included in the statistics.
Drunk children brought home by their parents or, if necessary, by the police after outpatient treatment will not be registered.
Apart from the cases in which children only drink a bottle of liquor in the school bench, there are three seasonal amplitudes, according to Mr. Pelikán, on which one can rely 100%: Walpurgisnacht, New Year’s Eve and the end of the school year.
"The latter for two reasons - either out of sorrow for the bad testimony or out of joy on the holidays."
"On Walpurgis night, I also saw seven drunken children at once in the reception," emphasizes Dr. Pelikán.
A drunken child who spends the night under medical supervision is paradoxically better off than a child who struggles with only an unpleasant hangover the next day.
In fact, the headaches in the morning that result from dehydration and glucose deficiency can be dissipated in the hospital with a liquid infusion of glucose and nutrients that are lacking in the organism.
"They're clearly better off, because after the 'glorious' experience in the evening, they wake up with a good mood without anything hurting anywhere."
"They're just a little confused about where they are," admits Dr. Pelikán, sometimes at least ruining the patient's good mood by listing the costs of the treatment.
Because the transport by ambulance and the night in an acute bed come well and gladly on a few tens of thousands of crowns.
"Occasionally, I used this as a means of education when I directly predicted the children at the visit, what their drunkenness cost and that it can happen that they have to work all holidays to earn the money for a single such festival," Dr. Pelikán added.
In his opinion, however, the health insurance companies do not resort to recourse procedures to demand the costs necessary to heal the drunken children from the parents.
Two training aircraft L-159 in foreign hands for the first time - in Spain
Two light combat aircraft L-159 out of a total of five, which the Czech Ministry of Defence exchanged for the Casa C-295M transport aircraft, flew to the Spanish city of Seville on Tuesday, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS is located.
This is the first time that machines of this type have been owned by a foreign army.
Until now, they have only been seen in maneuvers or flight shows abroad.
This is the flight-capable two-seater version L-159T1, which was operated by the Czech Army.
The remaining three aircraft are single-seater L-159.
These are currently preserved in the Aero Vodochody, the intermediary of this business - the company Omnipol - took them over last week.
Jan Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek, spokesman for the Ministry of Defence, is not yet known when she will physically expedite the aircraft from Vodochody.
The L-159 single-seater fighter aircraft, in turn, were separated from long-term stocked aircraft without further deposits and investments by the Ministry's department.
"The double-seat L-159T1 was replaced in its current state and appearance," Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek told the newspaper Právo.
He added that the army would not have to do without two-seater fighter planes, as the Department of Defense signed a 200-million contract with Aero Vodochody in May 2009 to convert four superfluous L-159 to a two-seater version.
A new aircraft took over the army in July, and the second plane wants to take over by the end of this year.
According to Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek, EADS has pledged to enforce the fighter aircraft into the equipment of one of the NATO countries.
"The contract clearly states that the company EADS is a customer of the L-159 aircraft and that they will be used to train pilots from NATO countries.
"It is therefore up to the customer how he realizes the matter," Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek said.
The Wirtschaftszeitung (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish government has no interest in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 for a transport aircraft Casa and the purchase of additional aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns had been approved by the government of Mirek Topolánek last year.
At the time, the Ministry of Defence had not tendered for the procurement procedure, but addressed EADS directly.
The defence office at the time argued that this exchange would support the future export of the L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought Aero 72 machines, of which it used only 24, the rest it wanted to sell.
The purchase of the aircraft Casa, by the way, should also have a judicial aftermath.
The European Commission sued the Czech Ministry of Defence at the European Court of Justice for the reason that it should have selected the aircraft on the basis of a pan-European tender and not by responding to a single manufacturer.
The army has already taken over three Casa aircraft, the last being to land at Kbely Airport within fourteen days.
A longer index finger than ring finger means a lower risk of developing cancer
Men whose index finger is longer than the ring finger are obviously at lower risk of developing prostate cancer.
This is the surprising result of a study published on Wednesday by the British Journal of Cancer.
This is because it is supposed to be related to the level of the male hormone testosterone.
“Our findings show that the relative length of the fingers can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer, particularly in men up to sixty,” said Ros Eeles, a professor at the University of Warwick.
The finger could thus help determine which men should absolutely undergo a prostate cancer test, especially if there are genetic risks or other risk factors, such as family health burdens, Eeles added.
Between 1994 and 2009, she and her colleagues in Britain followed more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer, but also 3,000 healthy men.
In more than half of the study participants, the index finger of the right hand was shorter than the ring finger.
For these men, the likelihood of prostate cancer was the same as for 19 percent of those men whose ring and index fingers were the same length.
However, in men whose index finger was longer than the ring finger, this risk decreased by 33 percent, in men up to sixty-eight percent.
The ratio of the length of the two mentioned fingers, which already form at prenatal age, obviously reflects the different levels of sex hormones to which the child was exposed in the uterus.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer index finger.
Previous research has shown that testosterone in particular accelerates the growth of prostate cancer.
Václav Pa<0xC4><0x8D>es, leading Czech geneticist and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, told <0xC4><0x8C>TK that he knew about this study but did not consider the relationship between finger length and cancer risk to be "completely proven".
Czech Republic in the snow - D1 and D5 are locked
Just like most of Europe, the Czech Republic lies under a blanket of snow on Thursday morning.
On the roads and sidewalks there is mostly solid snow, the winter servicemen were in many places all night on the axle.
The highway D5 between kilometers 89 and 90 in the direction of Rozvadov is closed due to some accidents of trucks and cars and also the D1 near Brno in the direction of Prague "stands".
This was said by Novinky.CZ, the dispatcher of the Central Auto-Moto-Club (<0xC3><0x9A>AMK).
A truck crashed at mile 91, two trucks collided at mile 93, in this accident there are injured.
A few cars are also in the moat.
There are also problems at kilometre 185 of the D1 motorway in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks collided here too.
The drivers should leave immediately after Brno at kilometre 190 or cross Brno and drive at kilometre 182 at the town of K<0xC3><0xBD>valka.
Miles of traffic jams are formed there.
Also on the D11 an accident happened and that immediately at the access to Prague.
In Prague itself there is a several centimeters thick snow cover and the thermometer shows minus seven degrees Celsius.
Auto columns are formed in the Prosek district, for example, and the street <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>rboholská is also completely blocked.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
The trams run with delays, for example on the line between Karlsplatz and Friedensplatz.
At eight o'clock in the morning, the Prague Crisis Staff meets.
There are also problems with the railways and the airport.
The Czech State Railway had to cancel seven high-speed train connections due to snowshoes.
For example, there are problems on the route Prague - Kralupy or Prague - Beroun.
Travellers should be informed about the current situation.
Airport Ruzyn<0xC4><0x9B> is closed from Wednesday 11:00 a.m. to 5:00 a.m.
Most roads in South Moravia are only accessible with increased caution.
Three side roads are completely impassable around Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kov, in the surroundings of Brno there are snowfalls and in the surroundings of Blansko you are forced to use snow blowers on some higher roads.
One of the most affected areas is V<0xC3><0xBD><0xC5><0xA1>kov.
There, three roads are still completely closed: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Ku<0xC4><0x8D>erov and also <0xC5><0xA0>aratice - Mile<0xC5><0xA1>ovice.
Here too, snow blowers will have to be used for snow clearance.
When they can be driven again, it is not yet possible to estimate.
In the Hodonín region, caution is required in the area of the White Carpathians.
On the roads, which may only be scattered with inert dispersants for conservation reasons, there is a snow cover up to five centimeters thick, <0xC4><0x8C>TK said.
In the Czech Republic, fresh snow fell from two to ten centimeters, mostly in northern Bohemia - in places up to 18 centimeters.
Up to 15 centimetres of fresh snow fell in the Moravian-Silesian region.
In the Czech Republic, however, it slowly stops snowing.
American soldiers have a new “smart weapon.”
For the first time, American troops have deployed a new “smart” weapon in Afghanistan, known so far only by its code name XM-25.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon will influence the conflict there with the Taliban and shift the balance of power in their favour.
The new weapon is something like a super-accurate cannon.
Your projectiles are directed to the target by laser with an accuracy of only a few meters.
The special bullets of caliber 25 mm, developed for this rifle and containing highly explosive explosives, work practically like small grenades.
The projectiles can be programmed in such a way that they can explode not only upon impact on the target, but at any point of their ballistic trajectory.
That is, you can use them against an enemy hiding behind an obstacle - a wall or in a trench.
It is usually not protected from above, so the murderous steel splinter rain from above can easily put it out of combat.
According to Richard Audett, who participated in the development of the XM-25, the new combat rifle is the first infantry weapon to make use of "intelligent" technologies.
"The soldier basically proceeds this way: he aims at the target and sends out a laser beam that determines the distance, so he gains an exact point of sight, after which he corrects the angle of elevation, then he only has to press.
"Let's say you measured 543 meters."
"When you hit it, the gun recharges and shoots the projectile at a distance of 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters.
400 jobs will be relocated
The Fujitsu Group moves its branch office in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will move their workplace from the previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to the Astro Park.
The Japanese company Fujitsu is relocating its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the industry giant specializing in computers and their maintenance announced on Wednesday, in July next year 400 women and men will move their workplace from the previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to the Astro Park, which is a large office complex on Lyoner Straße in the Frankfurt district of Niederrad.
A Fujitsu spokeswoman explained that in the medium term, there should be another 100 jobs of the group, which are so far distributed throughout the region.
The rental offer was extremely attractive, and the open-plan offices in Astro Park would be better suited to the work of the employees.
In Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was only a tenant.
The responsible managing director Bernd Wagner said, “With Frankfurt-Niederrad, we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure.”
The excellent connection to the airport is particularly important for a global company like Fujitsu.
Yesterday’s relocation of an important company within the region brought joy to the winners and disappointment to the losers.
Frankfurt-based economics deputy Markus Frank (CDU) said that once again a "global player" had been won.
This is a “great location commitment.”
Fujitsu passes to the city, the settlement is an important impulse for Lower Rad.
The Mayor of Bad Homburg Michael Korwisi (The Greens) regretted the decision of Fujitsu.
The city was informed early by the management of the intention.
"Of course, we offered our help to the company," Korwisi said.
However, the friendly contacts could not have changed the computer manufacturer’s difficulties with the landlord of the property at Marienbader Platz.
In the end, economic reasons would have been the deciding factor.
Now it is about preventing a long vacancy in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building is cooperative."
The house used by Fujitsu at Rathausplatz and the adjacent "Little Vertical" were among the most controversial construction projects in the spa town ten years ago, along with the other buildings at Marienbader Platz.
As a joint project of the city and a private project developer, a new city entrance was created between the station and the town hall, which caused criticism both because of the massive development of the areas previously used as parking spaces and the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment consulting and rating company Feri, the software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, took over Amadeus, as well as the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, which was still connected to Siemens at the time.
The building used by Fujitsu was acquired in 2006 by the Frankfurt-based Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen Group together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and a year later resold to Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Tokyo-based Fujitsu Conuzer is the third largest IT provider in the world.
For example, it provides computers and servers to companies and also provides the necessary service.
The branch in the Rhine-Main area is one of the largest in Germany, but Fujitsu has far more employees in Munich.
From Bad Homburg, the subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions in Frankfurt-Niederrad, the other subsidiaries at this location will be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
For this purpose, 7,000 square meters were rented in the Astro Park office building.
In the twenty-year-old complex - the name alludes to its star-shaped floor plan - is located, among other things, the Central Association of Electrical Engineering and Electronics Industries.
Amazon shuts down servers - threats against Assange
Wikileaks is increasingly in trouble.
Internet service provider Amazon has banned the disclosure platform from its servers.
Possibly there is political pressure behind the release of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic cables.
Wikileaks founder Assange is reportedly staying in England.
Wikileaks is increasingly under attack in the United States.
The Internet activists lost access to their previous American server and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
US Senator Joe Lieberman has called on other countries and companies to boycott WikiLeaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol’s search lists, is said to be in the UK, according to a newspaper report.
"Wikileaks displaced from Amazon server."
"Free speech in the land of the free," the revelation activists said via short news service Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the internet company Amazon had banned the Wikileaks documents from its servers.
The Internet activists had used the Amazon Web Service (AWS) in the publication of the secret diplomatic cables in order to cope with the high number of access to the documents.
On Twitter, WikiLeaks said: “Well, our dollars are now being spent on employing people in Europe.”
If Amazon has such a problem with freedom of speech, “they should stop selling books.”
Amazon stopped using its servers by Wikileaks after employees of Senator Joe Lieberman investigated, CNN reported, citing Lieberman's office.
The chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee had threatened Amazon with a boycott, the British “Guardian” reported.
“I wish Amazon would have taken this action sooner given the previous releases of classified information by WikiLeaks,” he said.
Lieberman, meanwhile, called for the platform to be banned from using servers in other countries.
"Wikileaks' illegal, monstrous and reckless action puts our national security at risk and endangers lives around the globe," the partyless senator said in a statement.
"No responsible company - whether American or foreign - should help Wikileaks in its efforts to distribute stolen material."
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is being sought for rape by the authorities in Sweden, is on Interpol’s search list.
According to a report in the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian is staying in the UK, the exact location is known to Scotland Yard.
The Internet activist has always described the investigation in Sweden as an intrigue of his opponents.
WikiLeaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that there were threats.
"There were even calls for a murder of Julian Assange."
Therefore, Assange rightly fears for his safety, Hrafnsson said.
The Wikileaks founder will continue to hide.
Hrafnsson apparently responded to statements from North America.
In America, former Arkansas Republican governor Mike Huckabee had demanded that the person responsible for the Wikileaks revelations be charged and executed for treason.
In Canada, an adviser to Prime Minister Stephen Harper said — obviously ironically — on TV that Assange should be “killed” and Obama could “use a drone.”
Between the White House and Assange there was an exchange of blows.
U.S. President Barack Obama spokesman Robert Gibbs called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange had demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton if she was responsible for recent known espionage calls to diplomats.
"I'm not quite sure why we care about the opinion of a guy with a website," Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than its one website."
The U.S. government is now putting the protection of its databases under complete scrutiny.
Russell Travers, vice-director of the Center for Anti-Terrorism Actions, was appointed as Special Representative, the White House said in a statement.
Travers is responsible for developing “necessary structural reforms” that have become necessary after WikiLeaks’ disclosure of the embassy reports.
The White House also wants to have the ways in which the entire government exchanges and protects information reviewed.
The U.S. government has also announced that it will ensure the safety of dissidents and the most active should they be endangered by the Wikileaks publication.
"We did everything we could to get in touch with them," Foreign Office spokesman Philip Crowley said.
"We are ready to protect them if it becomes necessary."
The Ice University
At the "Gelato University" near Bologna, ice cream confectioners are being prepared for better seasons.
The three-day basic course for future gelatieri has the largest influx and visitors from all over the world.
Where does the whole ice come from?
From the gelatiere and from the gelataio.
The gelatiere, in German antique ice cream confectioner, produces the cream according to all the rules of the Italian ice making art.
The Gelataio takes the ice cream from the cooling counter with a spatula, smears it into the waffle and then sells it.
To know this, you do not have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But if you want to know more about ice cream, you can't miss the "Gelato-University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The ice cream university established the ice cream machine manufacturer in 2003, so that the ice cream from its machines everywhere lives up to the high Italian ideals.
The three-day basic course for future gelatieri has the largest influx and visitors from all over the world.
But there are also several days special courses around chocolate ice cream and internships in the in-house ice cream shop.
Some dream of a new career in the midlife crisis, others simply venture on the smooth ice of their vague longings.
This time, there will be 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil to Hungary and Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the slow food movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the country of industrial ice cream in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and after years wants to put in something of her own in a nerve-wracking job.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening an ice cream shop in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars - and Canadian housewife Julia comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal characteristics of the perfect ice cream.
Not only is good taste decisive, but also the silky suppleness and good consistency.
Luciano does not forget the cream of the national and even southern superstructure during his training: "Italian gelato is simply the best - and then there is a lot of romance."
The first step to manufacturing seems simple.
Luciano tilts the basic ingredients milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixer that heats everything to 85 degrees with an electronic program and then immediately cools to four degrees.
Then he turns up a cock on the machine, and out comes a pasteurized white base cream, base for all milk ice creams.
Immediately, the lecturer is assaulted with questions: Can ice cream be made only with natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can you let go of your own desire to experiment?
Luciano warns against being misled by the zeitgeist.
Anyone who talks about ice cream "only from natural ingredients" may still have used stabilizers - usually a natural product, such as guar kernel flour from the guar bean.
Of course, you can also make ice cream without a stabilizer, only then it has to be sold within a day, otherwise it collapses and the customer bites on ice grains.
Certain variations on the base mass are allowed.
It gets more exciting with the flavors.
For the taste in the ice cream, Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients that you buy in the fruit department or in the supermarket’s sweets.
There are also powders and pastes.
"The suppliers will all try to turn you dozens of flavored additives."
"But you should just experiment."
Either with the fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or just with the ice cream from the white base, which becomes a yellow cream with eggs and with cocoa powder as the basis for all kinds of chocolate seductions.
Students are now allowed to use the ice machines.
Luciano has them produce four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut ice cream - with or without eggs in the base, with more or less vanilla flavouring or other natural additives.
The fruit ice cream varieties are also subjected to the same experiment.
More flavourings, more fruit puree - taste is not necessarily better.
Hazelnut ice cream does not necessarily taste nuttier if it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular kiwi ice cream is produced by the working group, which uses more fruits, less water, and a little less stabilizer.
Only a balanced mixture really highlights the taste of a gelato, says Luciano.
Ice making is an arithmetic task: if peach puree is used with a lot of sugar, the sugar content in the basic recipe must be reduced.
An extra portion of sugar is required for lemon ice cream.
Luciano draws out a device with which he determines the sugar content of the fruit varieties (winegrowers use it to measure the oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, tables make computing easier.
Making ice cream no longer requires as much physical effort as before.
Not only does the device for the automatic production of the base mass help.
There is also a device in which the finished ice mixture is simultaneously beaten creamy and cooled to minus temperatures.
In spite of all automation, small breakdowns cannot be avoided.
The Brazilian Gustavo covers himself and his classmates with fruit puree from top to bottom when the oversized hand blender gets out of control.
"In every course," says Maestro Luciano, "it's only a matter of time before something like this happens."
Inspectors in Twilight
The European Food Authority Efsa is undermined by the industry experimenting with genetically modified plants.
This accusation is now formulated by the expert group Testbiotech, which sees itself as an independent institute for the impact assessment of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we've documented it well," Testbiotech CEO Christoph Then said on Wednesday in Munich.
The head of the Efsa expert group on genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and another Efsa expert have also been under contract with the lobbyist association Ilsi for years.
It is paid for by companies such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has worked significantly on the Efsa test regulations for genetic plants and is thus in a clear conflict of interest, criticizes Then.
The EFSA rules are, in part, word-for-word with Ilsi’s position papers and thus bear the handwriting of the industry, which is actually intended to be controlled by the authority in Parma, Italy.
This is the second time Testbiotech has complained of a conflict of interest.
For example, a high-ranking Efsa manager has recently joined the Swiss agricultural group Syngenta without any restrictions or transition period – and has thus changed sides.
The Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) also recently revealed personnel connections between the controlling EU authority and the industrial lobby, which has made the Federal Environment Agency as well as EU parliamentarians loud.
However, the Efsa cannot recognize any conflict of interest.
All serious data, including those of industry, are used as long as they are of high professional quality, the statement said.
The experts who work for Efsa are not required to have no contacts with the industry.
You would have to disclose them.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the USA.
This describes itself as a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics - among other things for risk assessment for biotechnology without lobbying.
In the matter, independent experts such as Then criticize the fact that genetically modified plants are currently approved without any feeding tests on animals and the response of genetic plants to environmental influences is not tested.
"We want to know what, for example, genetically modified corn is doing in the field," says Then.
Current practice is to test only isolated proteins, but not the whole gene plant, which does not provide reliable results.
"If you don't look for the risks, then how are you going to find them?", Then asks accusingly.
This is what Angelika Hilbeck thinks.
The scientist has been researching genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Technische Hochschule Zürich.
As in the USA, industry is now increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists in this field.
Therefore, there are hardly any researchers who are not intertwined with corporations.
Critical studies for companies would not usually be published.
"The industry controls security research," Hilbeck claims.
The Trace of the Stones
Uli Gsell also got some, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday evening he stood in front of Stuttgart station, the Tuba on his back.
It was a demo.
It was snowing.
The story is well known: In September, the excavators had approached and had begun to break down a large piece of the north wing.
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: tens of thousands protested against S21, the billion-dollar downturn of the station.
When it came to the construction stop, much of the wing was in ruins.
Broken in 6000, 7000 pieces.
Crailsheim shell lime, a soft coarse stone, installed between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He secured some of the pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"You can't go away."
He swore, "A cheap and poor stone, simple and earthy."
When he saw one, it smelled like cigarette smoke.
What he's gonna do with the chunks, he doesn't know yet.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell too.
The track of the Stuttgart stones leads into a forest near Tübingen to a former ammunition depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen has built his stone empire.
The 44-year-old dealt with old stones.
He bought all those who came to the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were ground to gravel or disappeared into the landfill," he says in his office, a wooden bunch that was once a watchhouse.
He was insulted and threatened, he says, when in September the newspapers said that he had bought the remains of the north wing from the demolition company.
But he's been talking to the S-21 opponents for days.
And he explained to them that he couldn’t do anything for the demolition.
And if it happens, then it would be the most reasonable thing if the stones were continued to be used.
Approximately 200 S-21 opponents then took one of the 80 kilograms weighing on average, a unit price of 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a souvenir, some but also in the hope of being able to return it in a reconstruction.
500 tons had bought Rongen, 25 large truck loads.
About half of them are still in the woods, and the rest have been sold for a long time.
Garden owners, landscape gardeners, house builders.
They had come from everywhere and had towed away what luggage compartment and trailer could carry.
The Stuttgart stones of stumbling have long since been transformed into "walls" or into limitations of herbal beds.
"Actually, this stone is nothing special," says Rongen.
“It wouldn’t be the political component.”
He climbs into his off-road vehicle, taking a tour of his 20-hectare empire.
He studied law and dropped out, later biology, then he became interested in computers and eventually became a stone dealer.
And stone lovers.
It stores 40,000 tons of stones.
From all over Germany he gathers his treasures.
He says he is the largest old stone dealer in the Republic.
He's braking.
There are artfully carved sandstones in the snow.
"They once belonged to the Dresden Marienbrücke," he says.
Elbe sandstone, yellow, warm, it swarms.
"My favorite stone."
It goes the way up through the forest.
It points to a pile: red sandstone, formerly part of the Karlsruhe railway station.
And onwards.
"Beautiful travertine."
The squares once belonged to the stands of the Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow stones and stories, Cannstatter Travertin from the Stuttgart police station, reddish granite from the cathedral of Sankt Blasien, Tuff from the Heilbronn hospital.
What work, what labor, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks of how the stones used to be carved by hand and moved with simple pulleys and oxcarts, he becomes quite awe-inspiring.
"It would be a scandal if you were to shred something like that."
He hasn’t become rich, he hasn’t become rich.
But 14 people are employed by the stone dealer today, and stonemasons, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glass blower and a gardener have settled up in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's satisfying," says the residual recycler.
Soon he will have to go to Cologne.
There are also stones to save.
Talent Battle for High Potentials
There's a lot of buzz in the buffet.
16 students crowded over salmon buns, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the automaker Volkswagen have invited the mechanical engineering and design students to a workshop.
In a kind of idea competition, they are to discuss the car of the future with VW developers - and get to know Volkswagen on the side.
In the competition for the smartest minds, many companies now go into melee combat and, like VW, rely on cooperation with the universities.
Their mission: to recruit the most talented graduates to the lecture halls as early as possible before they enter the job market and are recruited by others.
And because the universities do not publish statements about the achievements of their students, one tries to spot the exceptional talents in practical projects and to bind them to themselves.
On the second day of the workshop at the TU Braunschweig, the car company is promoting the talents.
A young lady from the HR department distributes ballpoint pens, rubber bears and wallets with VW logo.
She tells the hopeful young talents about internship programs and student jobs and shows them ways into the company.
Nico Selle from TU Braunschweig supervises the project with VW.
He sees the benefits for both sides: "Students get in touch with industry and gain experience."
At the same time, Volkswagen can get to know students, take a closer look at interesting candidates and consider who would be eligible as an employee.
Such collaborations, according to Selle, are not uncommon.
What is new is that students are being so offensively bullied.
"Otherwise, the focus was more on the technical project," says Selle.
The fight for the fresh graduates will probably get even harder.
In many industries, companies are no longer able to select their employees from a large number of applicants.
Rather, they have to praise themselves and, in particular, work around highly skilled workers.
Especially graduates from the engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the Association of German Engineers VDI, more than 40,000 engineering jobs remained vacant in October.
And the so-called engineering gap will be even bigger, according to VDI forecasts.
For the auditing and consulting company KPMG, Roman Dykta goes on the talent hunt.
He organizes elaborate recruiting events such as the KPMG Race, a kind of modern scavenger hunt in which participants have to find their way using GPS coordinates.
Eight promising students want to send the company across the United States next year.
By the way, participants can check out KPMG stores and get to know the company.
Those who are allowed to participate decide in two selection rounds in advance.
Only the Crème de la Crème of the many applicants flies to the USA.
According to Dykta, the guns are getting bigger and bigger as they hit and stab around the high potentials at the universities.
"We want to stand out from the crowd with the race."
"Just a simple sailing trip was too little for us."
For talent hunters Dykta, the bill seems to be open.
"To date, we have been in contact with all participants of a similar action in the past year."
“Some are about to graduate and want to apply to us soon,” he says.
In addition to the direct buzzing on the campus, small and medium-sized companies also go to the game at professional trade fairs.
"We try to reach graduates at trade fairs."
"About at Intersolar," reports Sitha Stübe, Human Resources Manager at solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
The Bonn-based company employs around 1500 people in Germany.
Stübe knows about the upbringing problem.
Currently, 35 jobs are advertised on the company website.
"It's very difficult to fill vacant positions right now."
“It takes a lot of time and money,” she says.
Another way is to contact the university professors.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"The professors give indications that you can do internships with us or write your diploma thesis."
Expensive promotions are not required by the solar specialist.
For this, the company tries to advertise for itself with other advantages: personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and easy communication.
"A large corporation can often not offer that," says Human Resources Manager Stübe.
Money no longer plays the main role in job searches.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good opportunities for advancement are other decisive factors.
Solarworld ranked 55th among the 100 best employers in Germany in a study by the Great Place to Work Institute.
The institute draws up an annual ranking of German employers.
In addition, it asks employees how satisfied they are with their work and their job environment and looks at the framework conditions for the employees.
Human Resources Manager Stübe hopes that the placement will also bring benefits to job seekers.
“I think applicants are especially looking for external reviews about a potential employer,” she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies who want to build a good reputation as an employer with a long-term strategy.
He advises his customers to have more authenticity.
And that means, according to Kriegler, mainly internal measures.
"The best way to make yourself attractive as an employer is through your own employees," he says.
In industry jargon, the internal employer is called branding, i.e. employer branding within your own workforce.
"Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors."
If you treat your people well and they identify with the company, they would advertise their employers to friends and acquaintances on their own.
"It's like playing with a gang," says Kriegler.
Obama to Stop New Oil Drilling
Off the coast of the U.S. state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico, there will be no new oil drilling in the coming years.
A similar ban has been enacted by the government in Washington – thereby definitively revoking its previous plans.
Also off the Atlantic coast, new drilling remains prohibited for the time being.
Interior Minister Ken Salazar said on Wednesday.
The trigger for the strict ban, which is expected to last at least five years, is the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform in April.
Before the disaster that killed 11 workers and led to the U.S.’s biggest environmental disaster, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and industry, had signaled his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
Proponents want to reduce the US dependence on oil supplies from abroad.
Who is responsible for the devastating oil spill in the Gulf has not yet been definitively clarified.
At the centre of the criticism is the British energy company BP, which is faced with billions of demands.
A commission of inquiry on Obama’s behalf is expected to present its findings in the course of December.
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar lifted the drilling ban imposed after the explosion.
Subsequently, various oil companies immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With tighter controls and stricter security regulations, Obama and Salazar want to rule out another disaster.
Currently, the competent control authority, which had fallen into disrepute after numerous allegations of corruption, is undergoing fundamental reform.
At the same time, Obama has announced to close lucrative tax loopholes for the oil and gas companies.
The industry now publicly warns that the production volume in the Gulf would be significantly lower than previously due to stricter regulation.
"The government's plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industry," is the result of a recent industry survey by the consultancy BDO - even before Wednesday's drill ban.
The American Energy Alliance also laments the uncertainty in the industry: “Nobody knows exactly what will change with regulation.”
Investments in new funding projects will be postponed until further notice – at the expense of growth.
Ogoniland is burned down
The water in the rivers is oil-brown, it smells like at the gas station: billions of liters of crude oil spilled have destroyed nature in Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live from theft, corruption and illegal oil cooking.
Celestine Akpobari is good.
"Don't bother," the eco-activist reassures the journalists: "You will still get enough oil sludge in front of the lens today."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has attempted to photograph a boy wading up to the chest in the water with the streaks surrounding him: In the rainbow-colored water gloss, the scene looks almost pretty.
The fact that brown crude oil swaths float beneath the surface is not visible.
It used to collect shrimp here, says Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River.
In the meantime, the sluggish flowing waters are completely dead.
Five years ago, huge amounts of crude oil spill into the huge wetlands from a bursting pipeline.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo now have to roam for six hours to get into fishy waters: Ogoniland, located in the heart of the Niger Delta, is considered one of the worst polluted regions in the world.
On the way through the mangrove swamps, which are crossed by streams, the whole extent of the devastation becomes obvious.
Instead of bright water, the motorboat stirs up brown broth, who immerses his hand in the water pulls out oily fingers.
The roots of the mangrove trees protrude out of the ground like black liquorice rods, sadly leaving palm trees hanging their veils.
Bird swarms, as is usual in wetlands, are searched in vain: as soon as the outboarder is silent, ghostly peace spreads into the former paradise smelling like a gas station.
"What is happening here is ecological warfare," says Celestine Akpobari darkly: "We live in constant danger to health."
The war comparison is appropriate.
The settlement area of the Ogoni is a battlefield that has been contested for decades: here more than 60 years ago the first explorers from Europe invaded, here in the 1980s the first resistance was organized with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, here the Shell Group had to stop its production in 1993, because it became too dangerous for its oil workers.
Even today, the company is denied the return to Ogoniland: While more than two million barrels of black gold are pumped daily from the entire delta region of three times the size of Switzerland with over 5,000 wells and 7,000 kilometers of pipelines, the oil fields in Ogoniland are broken, the situation for the Group is too unstable.
Every few hundred meters, steel frames protrude out of the water like bizarre sculptures: "Christmas trees" are called the heads of the drill holes far too tenderly.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them corroded to the mark.
Again and again such a drill head breaks apart, says Akpobari, then a constant stream of crude oil runs into the water.
Experts estimate that more than two billion liters have flowed into the delta ecosystem in 50 years: year after year, the amount of oil as it penetrated into the sea off Alaska in the crash of the super-tank ship “Exxon Valdez” 21 years ago – one of the largest environmental disasters in human history.
Who is responsible for the ongoing eco-GAU is disputed.
While Shell’s sabotage and organized oil theft account for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists see bursting drillheads and leaking pipelines as the main cause.
Shell imposed significantly lower security standards in Nigeria than usual in the world, U.S. scientist Richard Steiner accused the company in 2008: the rate of defects on the lines alone is "many times higher than elsewhere."
In a place that looks from a distance like an abandoned, oil-smelled workshop under the open sky, shapes emerge from the mangroves: they are split bare and oil-smelled to the neck.
Under one of the many barrels, which are partly connected with tubes, partly arbitrarily scattered on the grounds, a fire flickers: an illegal small refinery.
In the barrel, the crude oil is heated over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the head of the group.
First, gasoline penetrates through the pipes into the collecting pot, later, at the end of the pipe, drips out kerosene and finally diesel.
For example, Michael and four employees produce up to four barrels of 300 litres of diesel per day: "That brings us 34,000 naira" - around 22 dollars.
Delta residents are taking advantage of the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil state in Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The illegal cookers can still undercut the ridiculously low diesel price of just under 40 euro cents per liter: because they get their raw material for free.
It comes from "bunkers" who tap the pipeline network across Ogoniland: according to experts, the country loses at least 16 million litres of crude oil per day throughout the Niger delta.
However, only a tiny fraction of the provisional intermediate raw material is illegally refined: organised criminal networks, which are supposed to include politicians and high-ranking military personnel, fill the lion’s share in tankers and squander it on the world market.
The debate as to whether the environmental catastrophe is more due to the movements of the population or the lax mode of production, the activist Akpobari considers purely academic.
"If the oil companies were not perceived as intruders and had they not destroyed the livelihoods of the fishermen so thoroughly, there would be neither sabotage nor theft and illegal refineries."
Meanwhile, Ogoni’s relationship with Shell has been destroyed to such an extent that only a withdrawal of the company could be considered: “Perhaps other nationalities like the Chinese turn out to be better.”
Michael gets nervous.
"It's the best time you're gone," says the muscular oilman.
"The soldiers can come every minute."
If the illegal oil refiners are caught by the special unit of the armed forces, they are not threatened with arrest, but a painful bribe.
The soldiers, who are mainly from the north of the country, want to benefit from the raw material, as do all Nigerians.
"This damn stuff has brought our country to the dog in every way," Akpobari says.
Investigators discover dangerous construction defects in A380 engines
The A380 has a serious security problem.
Investigators have discovered a possible construction defect during the investigation of an emergency landing machine, which could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure".
The airline Qantas now wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of the emergency-landed Qantas-Airbus at the beginning of November were apparently much more fortunate than previously announced: The Australian aviation security authority has identified a major safety problem at the engines of some A380 aircraft in its investigation - and now warns of a possible construction error.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: With an oil hose connection, it could produce fatigue cracks and leaks, according to a statement by the ATSB authority published on Thursday.
This could have resulted in "a catastrophic engine failure".
Rolls-Royce-produced engines in 20 A380 aircraft are affected.
Among them is the Qantas-Airbus, which had to land in Singapore on November 4.
The Australian airline has now initiated legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
She filed a lawsuit with an Australian federal court in Sydney, allowing him to take further legal action against the company.
Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said his airline would demand compensation for the incident in early November.
In the fire of the engine, parts were loosened and the wings damaged.
Rolls-Royce identified an oil fire as the cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines will now have to be replaced worldwide.
The Australian investigators announced that they would conduct further safety tests on the superjumbos, which are equipped with the affected engines.
The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan.
The security issue was deemed sufficiently important to inform all concerned.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas aircraft, the airline had kept its A380 fleet on the ground for weeks.
Singapore Airlines temporarily dropped about three of its eleven A380s.
Lufthansa replaced the engine of an A380 as a precautionary measure.
The double-story aircraft is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
National snowfall triggers traffic chaos
Germany in white: snow has fallen almost overnight all over the country.
There is chaos on many roads, trains and flights fall out.
At least three people were killed in car accidents.
Winter freezes Germany: With icy temperatures, almost the entire republic is snowing towards Thursday at night - which leads to traffic chaos in many places.
In the north and east there are some 15 centimetres thick snow covers.
Traffic is severely restricted on several motorways and many roads.
On the A7 near Flensburg, the winter service was in continuous use, but was not able to cope with the constantly resurfacing snow.
In addition, heavy gusts swept over the Baltic coast.
On the Baltic Sea coast of Schleswig-Holstein, the Federal Office for Maritime Navigation and Hydrography (BSH) expects storm surges from the morning with water levels of 1.2 meters above the normal level.
In Saxony, the snowshoes on the highways and federal roads led to considerable problems.
According to the meteorological center Meteomedia, in Saxon Switzerland the alarm level was called for violet - the highest level ever.
Partly 30 centimeters of fresh snow fell there, fresh and strong winds caused displacement.
There were several trucks and cars stuck during the night.
In Saxony-Anhalt, the police authorities also reported major disturbances on the streets.
On the A2, snow and wind led to stagnant traffic and traffic jams.
In Thuringia, the A4 and A9 were affected by the snowfalls.
According to Deutsche Bahn, there are significant disturbances in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and in the north of Bavaria.
Snow on the tracks, fallen trees on the rails or destroyed overhead lines and turnouts are the main problems.
In Saxony, long-distance transport from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be discontinued.
In Saalfeld, Thuringia, an ICE had to stop its journey to Munich.
The 165 passengers were supplied with wool blankets, food and drinks on the train by firefighters and rescue workers.
Snow winds swept the streets.
At major German airports, the snow winds lead to numerous flight cancellations.
In Munich, according to a spokeswoman of the flight information headquarters, a number of cancellations have already been reported.
In Frankfurt am Main, 40 flights have already been cancelled, according to a Fraport spokeswoman.
The winter service is in continuous use.
Although only a few stranded passengers were at the airport, they would still have almost 400 campbeds ready for them.
There were accidents on many roads on Wednesday evening.
In the evening, a truck driver was killed in a collision with a train on a railway crossing in Ostholstein.
The driver was slightly injured.
A similar accident occurred near Nuremberg due to snow-capped roads: Here, too, a truck was caught on a crossing because the vehicle was stuck.
The driver died.
Four passengers were injured in the train - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was therefore closed until the morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after overturning her car on a smooth road near Aschaffenburg.
The meteorologists have good news, however: Although the snow will still be loose and powdery and therefore even in light gusts swirl up.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea is plagued by fast and stormy winds.
However, it remains very cold - locally up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to separate itself from its landmark: according to a newspaper report, the Geldhaus is looking for buyers for the two office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
Up to 500 million euros could be invested in the property.
Deutsche Bank has just made its corporate headquarters beautiful: The twin towers in the Frankfurt banking district have been modernized; the bankers have now been allowed to return to their old workplace.
But now the financial group apparently wants to recover the costs of the renovation - and is looking for a buyer for the two high-rise buildings, as the "Financial Times Deutschland" writes citing a spokesman.
Reasons for the proposed sale were not mentioned by the spokesperson.
"We always check whether it makes more sense to own or sell properties yourself and then rent them back," he said.
Germany’s largest credit institution is thus relinquishing its headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank had only taken over the double towers in mid-2007 for 272 million euros from the investors of an in-house fund and subsequently refurbished them extensively.
The energy conversion engulfed the data after around 200 million euros.
A sale would bring a lot of money to the bank.
According to the newspaper, industry experts estimate the value of the towers, now renamed "Greentowers", at around 500 million euros.
Whether the buildings will be resold to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor is currently open, the spokesman said.
Thousands mourn the death of their friends
More than 10,000 people in New Zealand have thought of the spilled miners who were declared dead after several explosions in a mine.
The bodies could still not be recovered, because the security situation in the accident shaft is still precarious.
Nearly two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred in the Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were buried underground.
A probe had been dropped into the misfortune shaft, but had not detected any trace of survivors.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and subsequent explosions, rescue workers were unable to descend for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and experts assumed that there was no chance of survival for the buddies.
The bodies have not yet been recovered.
Now family and friends remembered the dead with a memorial ceremony.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in Greymouth, New Zealand, in the sunshine.
They were silent for two minutes.
In honor of the spilled miners, there were 29 tables on which helmets, lamps and the names of the buddies could be seen.
Pictures and personal items, including clothes and surfboards, also found their place here.
In front of the country's government buildings, the flags were blown to half mast.
New Zealand had hoped that the miners would come back to the surface “from the depths of the earth,” New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told the participants of the commemoration.
"But they never came home."
He could not conclude with the death of his son until he had seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was spilled in the pit.
In addition to the Prime Minister and relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats attended the commemoration.
In the first explosion on November 19, miners of British and South African origin were also spilled.
Rescue workers began extinguishing a fire inside the coal mine on the South Island of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases are displaced, it will begin to cool down the glowing temperatures inside the mine, police chief Gary Knowles told journalists.
Hell, warrior!
Does Splatter fit the art cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn reimagines old genre boundaries with his fighter epic "Walhalla Rising".
What audience might the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought of when he shot "Walhalla Rising"?
A captured Viking warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his tormentors and rows his opponents with almost superhuman powers - sounds ideal for young male spectators in search of bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to use rabid killing methods and his enemies have already ripped the guts out of the bad body.
On the other hand, Einauge, as he is actually called, does not say a word about the whole film, and the other characters can also be carried away at most once in one or two sentences or a few painful death screams.
Otherwise, you will be silent and swallowed up in the creepy beautiful hills of Scotland, which provide the backdrop to the Viking world of about a thousand years ago.
Ideal rather for adult cinematologists with an interest in existentialism and very quiet camera rides.
It’s nice if a film has multiple audiences, but it’s a pity if they exclude each other.
Director Winding Refn has been regarded as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino since his wild and styled drug dealer trilogy "Pusher", but stoically refuses to make his works available to the mainstream with a little more humour or a little less brutality to the arthouse.
Most art cinema friends are likely to be deterred by the splashing brain mass and the intestines.
The action fans die of boredom at the latest when, for freely interpretable reasons, eyewitnesses with a troop of violent Christian missionaries set out via ship to Jerusalem and stuck in silence and fog for an eternity before the crew apparently arrives in America and continues silent there.
No wonder, then, that "Walhalla Rising" has not found a cinema rental in Germany and has now only appeared on DVD.
This is especially a pity because of the magnificent pictures, but also because behind the pretentious to blood-drenched facade is a sometimes exciting piece of cinema that deserves some attention.
This film is not about dialogue or a stringent plot, it’s all an atmosphere, a film-made fever dream.
And there is no escape from it for the spectator.
Refn barely gives him a moment of relaxation and slowly laces his throat with his icy pictures and the dark trance-like soundtrack, but especially with the incomprehensible hatred that strikes him from the hearts of the characters.
Only a little blond boy who stands loyally by the side of one eye preserves something like innocence, everyone else is driven by anger.
Mostly the one-eyed hero whose motives are never explained, but who eventually becomes a warrior from hell for enemies and temporary allies, possibly the ambassador of the devil himself.
It means destruction, but perhaps only for the already corrupt.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that you can hate and admire to anger, excitement and wonder.
An experience.
Mysterious earthworks
The IAEA has new evidence of a secret nuclear program in Syria.
However, the country resists to take a stand on this - nor does it allow controls.
At midnight of September 5-6, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter jets attack a mysterious cube-shaped building in Syria.
It stands on the banks of the Euphrates; the nearest major city, 30 kilometers away, is Dair as-Saur.
Her name appears in documents from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) when it comes to the reactor that Syria allegedly built with the help of North Korea in the quarry, hidden in a valley departing from the electricity.
According to a briefing by the CIA at the end of April 2008, the reactor, also known as the nearby village of el-Kibar, would have been well suited to producing plutonium - from which nuclear weapons could be built.
For other purposes, on the other hand, the technique from the fifties is hardly suitable.
The CIA presented a video presentation with blurred satellite images.
By computer animation, it showed where the components of the reactor were supposed to have been before the destruction, which was a miniaturized copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon nuclear center.
She also presented photos that show the building up close or even the interior.
The reactor was just before commissioning, it was said, but was not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, little more is known than then, yes, the riddles became rather larger over time.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that while the CIA was quite certain before the attack that Syria was building a reactor in el-Kibar, it saw little evidence that there was "an active nuclear weapons program" in the country.
Some intelligence officials in Europe prefer to be even more cautious and speak only of a “supposed reactor”, even if they consider the CIA presentation to be “plausible”.
They lack hard evidence, as does the IAEA.
Asked how sure he was of having a reactor in front of him, a senior UN diplomat in the summer only replied lapidary that the IAEA had "enough material to ask questions."
The Syrians hurriedly set aside the debris of the alleged "unused military building" and thoroughly planned the site.
Nevertheless, in June 2008, an IAEA team under former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of human-made uranium in el-Kibar.
In addition, via a member state, the IAEA received satellite images from commercial providers right after the attack, which are likely to be more meaningful than those presented by the CIA.
However, these recordings are not available on the market because the unknown client - perhaps Israel - bought them exclusively.
The IAEA cannot therefore independently verify its authenticity.
Syria has always claimed to have never operated a secret nuclear program or built a reactor.
The uranium comes from Israeli weapons, Damascus said.
However, the IAEA rejected this as unlikely after analyzing the particles.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss it – as well as the satellite images.
In addition, it denied the inspectors a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the debris of the bombed building.
But Israel is also silent.
"We will never comment on this," said Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who was in office at the time of the attack.
For example, the investigation of the case has been unsuccessful since June 2008 and "evolves increasingly into a serious credibility problem for the authority," as a senior Western diplomat admits at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna - after all, there is a serious violation of the non-proliferation treaty that the IAEA is watching over.
As the key to progress in intelligence, the IAEA apparently sees three other facilities that are supposed to be "functionally connected" to the alleged reactor - and other than this still exist.
So far, the inspectors have not disclosed which facilities are involved, nor what function they have or what makes them suspect.
According to the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they are internally referred to by the IAEA as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, in turn derived from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) has identified these locations and located on satellite images a building complex at Masyaf, which is most likely one of the suspected objects.
It may be located in or right next to a military base – precisely for this reason, Syria is denied access to the IAEA’s three sites.
In Vienna, the Syrians feared a fishing expedition – that the IAEA would be sent forward by the US to spy on military facilities.
Because the nuclear detectives had become aware of the facilities by a tip from the U.S. intelligence services.
The IAEA has evidence, including satellite photos, that material has been transported back and forth between the three locations and the quad on the Euphrates.
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said at least one of the plants could be “related to fuel production.”
However, there are "no indications of sensitive activities", i.e. uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes that are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is operated with uranium, which is not enriched.
But where the uranium should have come from and where the plutonium for the bomb should later be separated from it, there are plausible conjectures on these central questions at best.
It is also unclear whether debris that could contain valuable traces were stored at the three locations.
As if the hundreds of truckloads had disappeared from the ground, no one wants information about where the rubble has been left.
Just a few kilometers from El Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, the salt mine al-Tibni, which Syria examined in 1998 for its suitability as a radioactive garbage warehouse, is considered unlikely by the IAEA.
Former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley recently linked it to the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the renowned Jane's Intelligence Review magazine.
However, footage from orbit shows that Syria underwent earthworks at the three suspected locations and removed large containers after the IAEA demanded access.
This may be a coincidence, but has hardly helped to clear the suspicion.
In addition, diplomatic circles say that the IAEA has spent several months developing a plan for inspections there that should allow Syria to keep any military secrets - only the effort shows how great the interest of the inspectors is.
However, Damascus also ironed off this proposal.
A year ago, Western diplomats in Vienna had calmed down that the reactor was destroyed, so the matter did not have a high urgency, for example, US Ambassador Glyn Davies has been putting so-called special inspections into play for a few months, one of the sharpest means that the Vienna Nuclear Authority has to enforce controls.
IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option I am open to in the future," but he is still hesitant.
There is a high risk in this way: on the one hand, it requires a majority in the IAEA Board of Governors, and some of the 35 countries represented there are anything but eager for escalation.
Secondly, as a diplomat suggests, "What if they don't find anything at all in the end?"
Love in times of war
Since Angelina Jolie started working on her still unnamed directorial debut in the summer, there has been trouble.
She wrote the script herself, a love story between a Bosnian woman and a Serbian man.
You don’t know much more about it – but that’s enough for unrest.
The rumor persists that the woman, a Muslim woman, fell in love with her Serbian rapist during the Yugoslav War.
Bosnian women’s associations immediately protested, after which some filming days planned in Sarajevo were moved to Hungary at short notice.
Meanwhile, the film has been shot in Hungary and in post-production, but it is still being protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the Organization of Women Victims of War wrote about the UNHCR to Jolie and demanded a meeting with the actress, a Bosnian newspaper has now reported - Jolie is herself ambassador of the UN Refugee Agency.
She is not diplomatic - she offered the women a meeting in Hungary weeks ago, but they refused.
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, Hasecic said.
There were no love stories in rape camps, and Jolie’s attitude towards the victims tells her enough about the script.
According to the UN Refugee Agency, her organization has recommended dismissing Jolie as ambassador, the Guardian reports.
But what exactly did Jolie write for scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which got her script to read, has issued a back and forth shooting permit for Sarajevo - it is not entirely clear why Jolie nevertheless did not come.
The young author herself asserts that she does not pursue any political intentions with her film, that she has worked hard to get involved in the Yugoslavia conflict, that she wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all the sides involved.
In terms of content, however, it remains vague.
A second synopsis of the film circulates on the web, which sounds quite different: The lovers knew each other before the outbreak of the war and meet again when she, a Bosnian Muslim woman, is taken to a Serbian camp where he works as a guard.
What sounds significantly different than the variant "rape victims crush themselves in Tortureknecht".
That Jolie's film actually starts before the war - that's for sure.
The pressure on her, Jolie said, was “unfair and based on misinformation.”
Now only Hollywood’s hackers can bring peace to her: by illegally putting the script on the net, as so many have done before.
Nothing like getting out of here
This evening, the Irish are finally back on track.
No sign of sadness.
For this, the home team dominates its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA too much.
The fans yelled with joy at loud music, they stamped with their feet.
The Bailey pub in Cork, southern Ireland, is shaking as players throw table tennis balls into beer mugs over a three-meter distance - and hit them.
"Bierpong" is called the bizarre spectacle, to win there are 500 euros victory bonus plus air tickets to Las Vegas for the beer pong world championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy; this shrill drinking game and the restrained computer scientist, that doesn't really fit together.
And yet the 26-year-old tries to have fun, distracting himself from the drilling question of what the future will bring.
His plan is not to have fun in Las Vegas, he will have job interviews in New Zealand in January.
"I have a mullet feeling," he says.
“It’s so far away from home and I don’t have a job there yet.”
After all: his girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "she had ruck, zuck her desired job as event manager, maybe a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Due to poor prospects at home, two of Tanner’s three siblings have already sought their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a job as an IT consultant in London.
The boys go: As with the Tanners, it looks like many families on the island.
100,000 Irish people are likely to leave the country in the near future, experts from the Economic and Social Research Institute ESRI in Dublin predict.
In fact, they expect 200,000 emigrants by 2015.
For the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants a heavy loss.
If the forecasts are true, there will be an emigration wave comparable to that which Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of upswing that brought great prosperity to the Irish, Tristesse is once again spreading.
The economic crisis is especially uncertain for the young, well-educated Irish, for whom it has hitherto only been uphill.
Loss of jobs and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone was needed, money was in abundance.
In the meantime, three out of ten women and men under the age of thirty are unemployed.
In the Irish Times, there are plenty of reader letters from young emigrants complaining: "Everything goes down the stream in Ireland."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers - but who can, goes away and our country loses an entire generation."
"The last one, please, turn off the lights."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Student Union, sees a gloomy future coming up because the government is only sweeping its eyes and no longer offering young people future prospects.
"They are reducing minimum wages, but they don't have a strategy on how to create new jobs," says the 20-year-old.
She watches her fellow students hanging from one unpaid internship to the next.
Her biggest concern, she says, is whether it is to have to emigrate in four years itself.
"This thought is sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen McLarnon are trying to make a positive impression on the subject.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a trade fair that offers an all-round service on the topic of working abroad.
"For beginners, working abroad is a great opportunity to take the first steps on the career ladder," says the manager.
On his website, photos show surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: working abroad is not a galley service, but also brings freedom and fun.
Seán O’Donovan has known how it feels to build something else for six months.
Because there was nothing left to do for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland, he is now working with 15 Irish colleagues on construction in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen they are just raising a fashion house.
In January, we will continue to Hanover or Berlin, to the next project.
In the meantime, O'Donovan rarely sees his home, as he makes extra shifts to pay off the loan for his home.
"The situation is already a bit crazy," he says when he stepped over the threshold of his house for the first time after a long time.
"I'm making money in Germany for a house in Ireland where I'm almost never again."
He laughs a little embarrassed and walks through chilled rooms.
The small house is in a fine residential area with well-kept gardens, in the driveways park large, expensive cars.
Together with a sister, O'Donovan bought the house for four years ago for 380,000 euros - 100 percent loan-financed.
"It was crazy times, there was simple money without many questions," he says.
Is he afraid that the credit could go wrong?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, pours hot tea and says, "I don't have children to feed through and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start anew."
The civil engineer does not like the lamentations he hears often at the moment.
"Nobody has to starve - our situation is far from as dramatic as it was in earlier times here on the island," he says.
"Working abroad for a while, that's not the worst thing that can happen - maybe it makes us feel like Irish first."
He laughs and then tells about his father, who went to England in the last major economic crisis.
"After seven years, he was back and life continued in Ireland, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Leave the future open and just see how things are going with life elsewhere.
He has a few years of work in London and why shouldn’t things go well for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand?
But there is one more thing that worries him these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He fears it could turn into a farewell party.
"Just don't have too many emotions," he says, drinking a big sip of his beer.
"Goodbye, that sounds scary."
"We'd rather call it a party, very relaxed, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
The Democratic Routine
The democracy movement in Latin America is becoming stronger, as is the support of private companies.
Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, Brazil’s influence is greater than that of the United States.
These results came from the Latinobarómetro survey, which was conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist.
This survey has been conducted regularly since 1995 and thus shows the change of opinion in this region.
Two facts are particularly striking in this year’s September and October survey.
First, the good mood in Latin America
and secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its main institutions.
In many countries on the South American Pacific coast, the democratic movement has increased sharply (see Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy has grown by about 6% annually since 2002, the number of democracy advocates rose from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
Such a trend is also evident in Mexico, where the economy has recovered since last year’s sharp downturn.
But only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries in the region, are convinced Democrats, which lowers the regional average (see diagram 2).
Approximately 44% of respondents said they are satisfied with their country’s democratic practice, as many as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (Diagram 3).
Approximately 34% trust their country’s congress and 45% their government. Both figures are similar to those of last year, but show a significant increase compared to 2003 (17% and 24%, respectively).
A decade ago, Latin America’s economic crises undermined efforts for more democracy.
The fact that this continued during the Great Depression may be due to the fact that the countries of Latin America experienced only a short recession period and quickly recovered.
In addition, the poor were caught up by a stronger social network.
(According to reports from the UN Economic Commission for Latin America this week, the poverty rate in Latin America rose only slightly in 2009 and fell by 32% again this year.)
However, there are strong differences in mood from country to country (see diagram 4).
Brazil’s strong economy and the popularity of outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva are reflected in a widespread thinking of progress.
This is less the case in Mexico and Central America, where the recession has been more pronounced and violent crimes have increased.
For the second time since the start of the survey, many respondents in Latin America see a greater problem in crime in their country than in unemployment (see diagram 5).
Approximately 31% say that either they or a family member were victims of a crime in the last year, but compared to 38% in the last year, the figures have fallen, reaching the lowest level since 1995.
The rising economic output is reflected in the increased support of the private and market economies: about 71% of respondents across the region said that the private sector is essential for development, compared with 56% in 2007 (see diagram 6).
Approximately 58% said that only the market economy can bring progress to their country, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela have maintained this view (and 80% are for a private sector), although their left-wing president, Hugo Chávez, nationalized many private companies.
Brazil has the largest weight in the region, according to 19% of respondents (18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% last year).
Respondents in Mexico and most Central American countries, on the other hand, see the US as the most influential country, with this role being assumed by Venezuela in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A voting slump
No one expected the November 28 elections to be perfect in Haiti.
But the facts far surpassed the fears of the voters who rushed to help the wrecked country.
Overcrowded ballot boxes, multiple votes, ballot papers in the pit, destroyed polling stations and intimidation were just a part of the problems.
Electoral offices opened with hours of delay.
Many Haitians, many of whom were homeless after the January earthquake, roamed around looking for a choice.
Some eventually gave up completely.
A dozen presidential candidates, including some suspected leaders, demanded the suspension of the election results due to an alleged fraud.
There were some violent protests all over the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the head of the UN mission in Haiti, described the election as “pretty good in many respects.”
According to a cautious statement by observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community, “these irregularities, however serious they may be, do not necessarily invalidate the process.”
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, allegedly committed to the unpopular outgoing president René Préval and his candidate Jude Célestin, will announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The expected second round is scheduled for January.
There is still hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, rap musician Michel Martelly and former first lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial nullity suit.
If Jude Célestin, who receives little or no vote from the electorate, declares that he is the winner of the second round, this could lead to problems.
Due to the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million of the earthquake victims still live in tents, low turnout was feared.
On election day, many Haitians were prevented from voting due to a lack of organization.
Shortly before the election began, about 250,000 ID cards required for the election had not yet been issued.
There is a lot at stake.
The donor countries see a legitimate, recognized government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
The Haitians themselves are of the same opinion.
Heimlich in the middle
In the weeks following her husband’s sudden death, Argentina’s president, Cristina Fernández, experienced a wave of sympathy that pushed her popularity rate up by 20 points to over 50%, the highest value since her election in 2007.
However, whether you will get this re-election next year depends on whether the apparently grieving Cristina Fernández is more willing to compromise than her late husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
The signs of this are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, who guided economic policy even after his wife’s election, often drafted budgets that did not fully take tax revenues, economic growth and inflation into account.
This allowed the presidential couple to spend the extra revenue at their discretion.
On paper, the Fernández government lost the majority in Congress last year.
But the opposition is divided and Kirchner’s death after a heart attack on October 27 led to further disagreements.
Some regime critics from the ranks of the ruling peronists stood behind Cristina Fernández.
But after chaotic sessions (in which one parliamentarian punched another in the face and others accused the government of bribing), Congress failed to pass the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to discuss it," the president said.
The 2010 budget now also applies to the next year, which gives the President even more opportunity to spend money at her own discretion.
The economy is running hot: it is likely to grow by up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently 11.1%, but numerous private estimates - and wage demands from the trade unions - drive the value to almost 30%.
Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina was shaken by economic crises, declared growth and poverty reduction to be his main goals, not inflation reduction.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, harassed the private sector, and cleaned up the National Institute of Statistics and Census INDEC, which subsequently blew up the official inflation statistics.
Can Fernández now take a more moderate path?
It has called on the private sector and trade union leaders to talk.
And according to official statements, wage increases are to be limited to 18% next year.
The high world market prices for Argentina’s agricultural products have given the economy a strong boost.
However, inflation undermined the growth spurt by a major devaluation in 2002.
For this reason, Cristina Fernández may want to reconnect Argentina with the rest of the world financially.
Earlier this year, the government reached an agreement with securities holders who had rejected the country’s previous debt restructuring in 2001.
Now Fernández seems to be pushing for an agreement with the donors from the Paris Club, to which she owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners had always refused a review by the IMF, as usual elsewhere.
But last month, Minister of Economic Affairs Amado Boudou announced that the fund will provide "technical support" to the creation of a new national consumer price index, which appears to be the first step towards purging the INDEC.
It is not known whether Fernández will be politically active after her term of office, even without the support of her husband.
If so, it needs the support of the middle class, who has largely had enough of Kirchnerism.
When the Argentines return from their summer holidays in March, the wave of sympathy that has been shown to her will be gone.
If she wants to win another election, she has to decide whether to quietly cancel many of her husband’s political decisions.
Weak applause for China
Taiwan’s voters are slowly getting closer to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother beyond the Strait?
On November 27, more than 7.5 million voters, 70% of all eligible voters, set out to elect mayors and city councils in the five districts. This is considered a broad assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou.
Through the establishment of groundbreaking business relations, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma himself is a symbolic figure for relations with the mainland. His policy has changed the relationship with the Chinese motherland for the first time since 1949.
Ma passed the exam, but only for a short time.
Although its Kuomintang party (KMT) represents three of the five mayors, it did not receive a majority vote.
Instead, the Democratic Progress Party (DPP), which advocated greater independence from Taiwan, received almost 50% of the vote, the KMT received 45%.
In the case of a presidential election, this would have been a problem for Ma.
Since his election two years ago, his party's vote has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even moved into the city councils together with the KMT.
During the election there were the usual events in Taiwan such as truck convoys with rioters, flag-swinging mass moves and only sparsely dressed dancers.
There was even the mandatory, mysterious murder attempt.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan and honorary chairman of the KMT, gave a speech on the eve of the election to a KMT candidate,
when a man from the crowd shot him in the face. Lien was wounded and a nearby spectator killed.
Bizarrely, it is not clear whether the shooter wanted to kill Lien or resolve a dispute with the candidate.
Regardless, the attack, according to Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, impaired the election and put the DPP in a bad light, which gave the KMT more votes.
Perhaps China was the biggest winner of the campaign.
Remarkably, relations with the mainland were not discussed.
Instead, the candidates debated plans on social housing and job creation.
The Taiwanese love their de facto independence and reject China’s military threat.
For this reason, the KMT does not like to put its relations with the Beijing government in the foreground.
But this time the DPP also avoided stirring up the anti-Chinese feelings too much.
It responded to the new awareness that Taiwan’s economy cannot survive without China.
Ma, for his part, wants to be confirmed that the majority of Taiwanese endorses his China policy.
The Beijing government will continue to pursue its strategy of bringing Taiwan back to the Community with economic incentives.
China immediately sent a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment security and medical cooperation.
Certainly, it also wants political integration, but the most important thing first.
It would be better to wait until the 2012 presidential election.
In the meantime, the DPP has reinvented itself.
Two years ago, she was severely weakened: former party leader Chen Shui-bian was imprisoned for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he strongly advocated absolute independence.
But under Tai’s reign a new generation of moderate politicians developed and the DPP is fighting for the voices of professionals and youth.
Tsai, as the presidential candidate of the DPP, received great approval, such as Su Tseng-chang under Chen.
Her party is now doing everything in its power to show that she too is capable of building close ties with Beijing.
Tsai plans to create an idea forge as a point of contact between the DPP and China, but this presupposes unbiased discussions.
Tsai publicly stated that her party offers a "trusted alternative" to Mas's premature approach to China.
Chen seems very upset about this change.
From his cell, he explained that the candidates of the DPP would have done better to insist on Taiwan’s independence.
He even called on the pragmatist Su to renounce the presidential candidacy.
Even without Chen’s interference, the DPP finds it difficult to elect its potential candidate.
KMT will have to undergo its own self-analysis.
But values are bad, despite the rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to run their election campaign without him.
The main reasons for his unpopularity seem to be unemployment and the ever-increasing gap between rich and poor.
According to a KMT spokesman, he will reshape his cabinet and local facilities.
The strong presence of the DPP suggests that Taiwan is only partially in favour of a re-approach.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, “there is already no turning back.”
Grammy nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding surprisingly won in Newcomer of the Year category
If you perform at the request of a president, people will notice.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to perform at the 2009 Nobel Prize ceremony, and now the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer has been nominated for this year’s Grammy in the Newcomer of the Year category.
Given that Spalding has been a celebrated star in the jazz scene since her album "Esperanza" in 2008, the nomination seems a bit unusual, but it is in line with the Grammy rules, according to which an artist may have released a maximum of three albums before the release of the album with which he became known to the general public.
Their ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", is certainly a step forward, and with her vibrant voice and a good sense for pop, funk and Latin music, Spalding can be compared to Norah Jones 2003, whose great success in 2003 as a jazz interpreter comes closest to Spalding's nomination in this category.
The album "Historicity" of the Vijay Iyer Trio was nominated in the category of instrumental albums. This favorite of the critics experienced a huge success.
Among Iyer's competitors are "Moody 4B" by experienced saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" by keyboardist John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a predatory New Orleans favorite and frequent guest on HBO's "Treme," was awarded in the Contemporary Jazz category, which typically features albums by Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin, and Jeff Lorber.
The Secret Societ of wild steampunk musician Darcy James Argue received well deserved attention in the big group category, competing against the Billy Childs ensemble with his chamber jazz and adventurous Dave Holland and his octet, whose life-ablum "Pathways" is a good example of a bassist as a democratic bandleader.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in the classical categories
The classical nominations for the 53rd Grammy Award include a colorful mix of musicians and composers from all over the world.
The list is led by Michael Daugherty's "Deux Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra with five voices, and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestral work, with three voices.
Among the nominees with connections to southern California is the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt with his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles". This piece was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and premiered at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
L.A.-based composer Avner Dorman was also nominated for his mandolin concerto.
Classical nominations are divided into 13 categories, from orchestra, opera, choir to solo recordings.
In the category of classical producers, five artists were nominated this year - Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Among the nominated classical albums are Bruckner's Symphonies No. 3 and 4 by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" played by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey's "Dreamhouse" by the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" performed by various artists.
In the opera category were Berg's "Lulu vom Orchester des Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse's "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" von Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariahos "L'Amour de Loin" vom Deutschen Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin's "The Enchanted Wanderer" vom Orchester und Chor des Mariinsky Theaters "BBC of thea.
As composers, Pärt was nominated for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer" for a Grammy.
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 was premiered and recorded on January 4 at Disney Hall by the L.A. Philharmonic under the direction of Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The 30-minute piece is entitled "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is in jail in Russia.
Dorman's "Mondoline Concerto" received a nomination in the category Instrumental Solo with Orchestra.
The composer from L.A. said he wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for mandolin artist Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New York Metropolis Ensemble.
"I used sounds from the Middle East and numerous North African sounds and rhythms," Dorman said in a phone interview.
The conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the category of orchestral performance for a recording of Stravinsky’s works with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under his direction.
Pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin, organist Paul Jacobs, violinist Julia Fischer and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson were nominated as instrumental soloists.
Only women were nominated as vocal soloists this year, including Anne Sofie von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classical crossover category, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song".
Mosque in Temecula wins approval of planning committee
The construction of a mosque in Temecula, after a five-hour, often heated public hearing, received the unanimous commitment of the local planning committee.
Critics accused the project of promoting both terrorism and traffic jams.
But according to a statement from the Commission Wednesday evening, the new religious center complies with local regulations and will become an aesthetic eye-catcher.
"The project is supported by many good people - Christians, Jews, Bahais, and many others," Hadi Nael, chairman of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley, said on Thursday morning.
“As an American, that makes me proud.”
"It shows that justice prevails."
"There are few opponents," he added.
"They're just very noisy."
"In this valley there are wonderful people."
The meeting began at 6 p.m. and the discussions for and against the construction of the center lasted almost until midnight, with the votes on both sides being fairly evenly distributed, according to Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper’s website.
“There is no more America,” he said.
"It's another planet of monkeys, and the Statue of Liberty is dead in the sand."
“America is at the end.”
Planned Islamic centers have also led to protests in other parts of the country, e.g. near Ground Zero, the scene of the terrorist attacks on the City of New York on September 11, 2001.
In Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush called for nonviolence.
His community of about 135 families has been peacefully living in Riverside County for years, but they wanted a bigger and better place than the camp they rented together with a water filter plant manufacturer.
The new, about 2,300 m2 mosque in the Mediterranean style should have two minarets and be about 13m high.
It is to be built on the approximately 17,500 m2 plot on Nicolas Road near Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal the project to the City Council.
Arsenic-resistant microbes could enable new forms of life on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of an alien species of bacteria that can live on arsenic, among other things, opens up new possibilities for new life forms on Earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists have discovered this unusual bacterium here on Earth, they believe it is a sign that life is possible even without the elements previously deemed vital.
"This organism has two options."
"It needs either phosphorus or arsenic to grow."
“This makes it very special, even though it’s almost a sort of ‘foreign’ form of life,” said Paul C.W. Davies of Arizona State University and co-author of the report, which appears Thursday in the online issue of Science magazine.
So far, six main elements have been considered vital - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
But as the scientists found out, the bacterium in California’s Mono Lake continues to grow even when it replaces phosphorus with arsenic.
“You’re wondering what else is possible,” said Arizona State University co-author Ariel D. Anbar.
The discovery is an important step in the search for extraterrestrial life, as scientists have to recognize life and its forms, says Anbar.
The study deals with microbes found on Earth.
The announcement of a press conference in which no details of the discovery were disclosed gave rise to widespread speculation on the Internet that the report of the discovery could be about extraterrestrial life.
This is not the case.
The discovery "demonstrates that in other planetary systems, organisms can use other elements to initiate biochemical processes, and that the 'standard elements' that we believe are absolutely vital are not necessarily predetermined," said Charles Cockell, professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute at the Open University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom.
Cockel was not part of the research team.
"This work is a novelty because it shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures, one element can be replaced by another," Cockell added.
This discovery was not accidental.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon from NASA’s Astrobiological Institute, who led the study, chose Mono Lake because of its high arsenic content.
Since arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar, they assumed that microbes exposed to both may be able to replace one element with the other.
"The toxicity of arsenic is primarily due to its chemical similarity to phosphorus."
"This makes it difficult for organisms to distinguish one element from another."
"But the difference is so great that arsenic acts differently from phosphorus. It enters our biochemical system, where it smears almost everything," explains Anbar.
The researchers exposed the bacterium GFAJ-1 to an increasing concentration of arsenic, and it adapted and grew.
Although the microbe grows better in phosphorus, the fact that it can survive in arsenic also shows that an arsenic-based lifeform can occur naturally, either on Earth or on another planet or moon, where arsenic is more common.
According to Jamie S. Foster, a professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic is not new, but there hasn’t been a working example yet.
Arsenic was more common in the early Earth years, she says, which is why science has assumed that early life forms used it.
"This gives reason to believe that life may have evolved differently than in the early Earth age," said Forster, who was not a member of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Health Authorities.
Other Stolen Exhibition Dogs Found in Compton
The remaining two of the four exhibition dogs stolen in front of a Bellflower motel were found, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's statement Thursday.
The four exhibition dogs—two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis—disappeared on Tuesday when unknowns stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express van that housed the animals in front of a Bellflower Motel 6 at night, authorities say.
Two of the dogs were spotted on Wednesday afternoon, and the last two on Wednesday evening, explains Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is that the dogs are well," Whitmore said.
"They are in good condition."
"They were returned to their rightful owners."
Whitmore did not provide any detailed information about the dogs' location or the circumstances that led to their discovery.
“The investigation is still ongoing.”
"We don't want to say anything more about this," Whitmore explains.
"We're tracking some tracks."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not available for information on Thursday.
They received their two dogs on Wednesday afternoon at a county animal shelter in Downey.
Representatives of the sheriff found the van and the two dogs in different places in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old bitch - were uninjured, according to authorities.
But the Corgis Bunny and Peter, who wanted to introduce Rickard and Peek to the competition this week on behalf of their Japanese owners, remained missing until Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in town this weekend because of the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach because Trace was supposed to take part in the competition.
As Peek told the Times on Wednesday, the other dogs should participate in other competitions on the days before the AKC/Eukanuba show.
Southern California is a stop on the couple’s nearly one-month tour from dog show to dog show.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked into the motel.
They often stay overnight in motels and park their van in front of their room window.
They took three more dogs — a boxer puppy, a Parson Russell Terrier, and a Brittany — into their motel room.
The thick-skinned Akitas and Corgis stayed in the van because it was cooler there.
They left the window wide open so that the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their car was stolen on Tuesday at 6:00 a.m.
Peek promised anyone who could give a clue to the Corgis a finder's pay, and microchips were implanted to identify the animals.
On Thursday, it was not yet determined whether a finder’s wage would be paid.
The lion roars again after court approval of MGM restructuring
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green light for a new start.
A New York bankruptcy judge officially blessed the “prepared” believer plan on Thursday to pay off $5 billion in debt and pave the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company for new movies and television shows.
According to Thursday’s statements, the plan meets the requirements of U.S. bankruptcy law, so that nothing stands in the way of the relaunch of MGM under the leadership of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglass Entertainment.
The number of employees will be reduced from over 400 to about 320.
For MGM, Chapter 11 does not actually come into force until JPMorgan Chase has completed a $500 million planned bond to finance the new MGM productions.
At the moment, a consortium of the investment bank, which itself is raising $75 million, is heading the company.
The restructuring of the studio began in May 2009 with the order to help investment bank Moelis & Co, the company's management, who struggled with interest payments of $300 million/year, solve their financial problems.
In August, CEO Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO at Enron and restructuring expert who became known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis & Cooper’s efforts to solve the financial worries of MGMs and pay out the studio’s more than 140 creditors took longer than expected.
After months of discussions, the parties decided at the end of 2009 to offer the company for sale.
But the auction attracted few bidders and no one wanted to pay the $2 billion demanded by the creditors.
In the spring of this year, it all started all over again when the MGM team started the restructuring plan, which was finally signed by the creditors at the end of October after months of debate and internal disputes.
If MGM has officially survived bankruptcy in the next few weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive a multi-million dollar bonus for their work.
The share for Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, amounts to $9.5 million.
Cooper, who was paid $375,000 monthly for running the company, will receive a $4 million "success bonus."
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM. This year, the studio released only one film and created an annual plan with seven or eight films to be released in cinemas in early 2012.
They are also planning two films after "The Little Hobbit" in co-production with Warner Bros.
The studio needs a separate bond of between $265 million and $275 million for its financial share in these two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who financed approximately 18% of the MGM loan, attempted a merger of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, whose largest shareholder he is.
However, the recent negotiations between the two companies did not lead to any results.
Tech Toys keeps your gift budget in balance
This year’s favorite among the gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console, both of which can rip a significant hole in your gift budget.
An iPad costs as much as five BMX wheels for $99, while the price of a Kinect game is about 10 classic jumping ropes or about 48 cans of Play-Doh.
But you can save your gift budget.
Recently, looking for three electronic toys under $80, I visited three national toy retailers - a Wal-Mart, a Toys "R" Us, and a BJ's Wholesale Club.
I immediately realized that Moore’s law had come into force, and this year the technology toys are more powerful and cost a little less than last year.
And although fewer new toys appear with their own website, the most famous of these, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have a wider range.
More and more button cell-powered toys are coming out on the market, and many include rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(Unless otherwise stated, all prices are from Toys "R" Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for children from 3 years old) are plush figures, as tall as guinea pigs, that sing a note when you press on their belly.
Once pressed corresponds to a note, by pressing several times you can play a song.
Several sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony.
Note: Once you have started pressing, you can’t stop.
For a combination of envoy and dance, the Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price $60, for children from 2) is the best choice.
Based on the Elmo Live technology developed last year, the animatronic doll offers interchangeable plays like 'Simon Says', and thanks to its novel hinge feet with wheel blocking, it masters the moon walk.
Children who tested the device used Mickey as a dance teacher, but their parents complained about the lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, you surely remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
Now he’s back (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for kids from 3), with a whole bunch of question cards that can turn a car ride into a lesson, with a better-wise with auto-correction function as a teacher.
If you don’t want to trust your child with your smartphone, here are three independent alternatives.
MobiGo by VTech ($60 for kids aged 3 to 8) is the cheapest and most user-friendly solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard, but the games included are not as educational as the one on the Leapster Explorer ($70, for kids aged 3 to 12), which is equipped with a new, brighter screen after Leapfrog’s first major revision of the Leapster series.
None of the versions are compatible with older cassettes.
iXL by Fisher-Price ($90 for children aged 3 to 7) uses a system similar to iTunes for the games and eBooks, and thanks to the SD card drive, family photos can also be viewed on it.
Last but not least, there is Scrabble Flash ($30 from Hasbro, for children over 8). The five blocks are no larger than a match box and have their own LED screen.
The game is about putting the blocks together into words before time runs out and it’s great for an improvised spelling competition.
More and more toys have some kind of online connection.
If you go to the toy stores alone after the offer, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important.
To give your child an online pet at Club Penguin, you can, for example, buy a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack ($5 for children aged 6 to 12), which contains a coin with a secret code.
If you enter the code online, your child will receive enough credits in the Club Penguin Store for two more parts.
This can be roller skates or a puffle stuffed animal.
The latest head cell-powered microrobot, Hexbug Nano ($10 for kids from 5) is no larger than the head of your toothbrush.
The beetle moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone legs in any direction.
It's fun to send him through a labyrinth of blocks.
And he endures a lot.
Ours fell from the kitchen table and even survived some time in the mouth of our dog.
Police operations in China are getting softer
Like a training officer, Tang Shenbin walked over an urban square, checked his nervous subordinates, giving orders with military authority and muted voice.
He wanted his female members of the Chengguan – China’s robust guardians of the urban order, feared and despised for their arbitrary raids and their propensity to violence – to impress viewers.
“Just stand up!”
"Look straight ahead!"
"Show them," he whispered, "how pretty girls are!"
Four girls, barely older than teenagers, with white gloves and identical olive green jackets and trousers stood tight.
Four pairs of black pumps were in a straight line.
Four neat hats sat perfectly on the hair held with blue and white striped bows.
"They look average to me," Mr. Tang remarks insignificantly.
"Models are pretty."
Several governments have already tried to polish the image of China’s city inspectors.
In a city, all new applicants must have a university degree.
The province of Guangdong introduced a glowing blue uniform instead of the grey-green one.
Wuhan in central China replaced violence with low staring: In 2009, 50 officials reportedly circled around an improperly positioned snack car and stared at the operator until he packed up after half an hour and left the square.
Xindu, a district in Chengdu with 680,000 inhabitants, wants to fundamentally change the image.
Since 2003, 13 women have been reinforcing the urban police strips and have been selected specially for their appearance, good figure and youth.
They should give the brutal police a softer, feminine aspect.
But unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson would hardly succeed in improving the poor image that the Chinese have of these city commands.
Rightly so, the critics.
Unlike the police, these officers are only allowed to enforce municipal laws by means of fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media routinely show a different picture.
In January 2008, officials in Hubei province beat a spectator to death as he filmed them with his cell phone striking down a protest against a dump.
Last year, a training manual of Beijing officials was stolen and published on the Internet, describing how criminals can be beaten without bloodshed.
This year, a Shanghai watermelon dealer suffered brain injuries after a clash with five officials.
A video game brimming with violence that can be downloaded from the internet shows Chinese-trained officials in an attack on street traders.
"Chengguan scares the government," the national newspaper China Daily lamented last year, after further controversy over the tactics.
The newspaper called for a “really thorough cleansing.”
Skeptics consider the current approach to be clearly inadequate.
When the district searched for eight female recruits by advertisement in October, an editorial in the Beijing Evening News asked whether the women should have real tasks or only serve as an optical distraction.
Probably both.
According to the job advertisement, women aged 18 to 22 with good figure and "harmonic facial features" were searched.
They should be above average size - over 1.5m or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inches.
The employment relationship ends on reaching the age of 26.
According to the officials, the activity is too physically exhausting for women over 25.
“The most important thing is their image,” an unnamed district official told the government website Rednet.com.
"Whether the candidates get the job depends first on their outward appearance, such as height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes temperament and "inner qualities".
"Female Chengguans are like flower vases," he said, adding, "but beyond that, they have other duties."
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Head of District City Administration, does not agree with this description,
But admitted that in China, size specifications in job advertisements are not uncommon for both sexes.
The same goes for uniform facial features.
Whether this is equivalent to good looks is controversial in China.
But people with disabilities or physical disfigurements do not need to apply.
"Unfortunately, we can't use lame ones or buckling ones here," says Mr. Zheng.
"Your image would not be good."
Liu Yi, who patrols in Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22, has apple pastry and a well-shaped mouth.
She did not feel sexist that such importance was placed on her appearance.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asks with an ironic look.
Her co-worker with the dimples, 21-year-old Xu Yang, commented, "We have the task of representing the image of the city."
According to them, they do not regret the brief hiring, as they have more ambitious career plans than just shoving traders through the alleys to prevent them from doing business.
Every morning, the squad deals with about twelve street traders who try to sell as many buns and tofu dishes as possible on foot or by bike before they are chased away.
"Mr. Wang, please get out of here."
"We've told you that so many times!" explains Fr. Xu to a dealer who had fled on foot and had temporarily abandoned his pasta kitchen attached to a bicycle cart.
According to the officials, the activity is more monotonous than strenuous.
"It's almost the same every day," explains Huang Jing, 20, who studies in leisure sales.
"Everything routine."
One reason for this is that the female officials are not allowed to confiscate the merchandise of the merchants, like their male counterparts.
They can only threaten offenders to report them to their male superiors.
This is to protect them from public hostilities, which officials in China are often exposed to.
This year, hundreds of residents of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, ransacked after rumors circulated that Chengguan officials had killed a merchant.
More than a dozen police officers and Chenguan officials were injured in the night incident, 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
Xindu has been spared from such violence so far.
But unrest cannot be ruled out.
Just two blocks away from the quiet Baonguang Square, where the female officials were patrolling that morning, over 50 people gathered at a street corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle that was unlawfully repaired on the sidewalk instead of in a workshop.
The owner shouted Zeter and Mordio.
After 15 minutes of hesitation, the officers with a grim face made their way to their vehicles and drove away with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, a 40-year-old male coordinator, was left behind, turning his white nameplate to remain anonymous.
Like their colleagues, the coordinators – men over 40 – play a purely supportive role.
But they were not trained to present a clean image.
“Sometimes we go verbally.”
"Sometimes physically," explains Mr. Li soberly.
“Most of the time, people start arguing.”
Prosecutor will not indict Senator Ensign
Prosecutors at the Department of Justice have acquitted Senator John Ensign of the accusations made against him after his affair with a former electoral assistant and his attempt to get her husband to lobby, Senator's lawyers announced on Wednesday.
This decision puts an end to the most serious accusation against Senator Ensign, the Republican from Nevada, and until the scandal that made headlines nationwide and dampened his career, he was considered a potential Republican presidential candidate for 2012.
As Senator Ensign's office announced, he was "highly delighted" with the verdict after the one-year inquiry.
However, the Senate Ethics Committee could still impose a disciplinary penalty.
According to Ensign’s lawyers, they were informed by the Department of Justice that the investigations against Senator Ensign had been terminated and that there were no further charges in this matter.
The Justice Department did not want to comment on the case.
The verdict was a surprise for many ethics lawyers outside the Department of Justice, and they believe there was sufficient evidence that Ensign disregarded the lobbying ban.
Interviews, emails, and other documents first published in the New York Times in October 2009 gave rise to the assumption that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his electoral assistants, was too lucrative to buy his silence over an affair with Hampton's wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton served as treasurer during an election campaign for Ensigns.
Ensign contacted some political friends to get Hampton work, and according to the documents and interrogations, he took over Hampton's lobbying for them after hiring.
As Hampton was recently on Ensign’s electoral team, he was not allowed to lobby for his former employer or the entire Senate for a year.
According to ethics experts, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, violated the so-called ban on revolving door lobbying.
According to the published evidence, “it seems to be a collusion and a violation of the revolving door statutes,” said Stanley Brand, a Washington attorney specializing in the defense of clients targeted by the government.
While the Justice Department formally declined to disclose the reasons for the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other Ethican lawyers said the ministry seemed very cautious in picking up political charges following a variety of defeats pursued by the media with great interest, including last year’s decision to drop the charges against former Senator Ted Stevens for misconduct on the part of the state attorney.
Prosecutors “are obviously terrifying,” said Melanie Sloan, the chairwoman of the association “Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington” (an organization whose goal is to fight corruption in U.S. parliamentary and government circles), a group of lawyers who have brought various charges against Mr. Ensign to court.
"This basically means that senior government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, chief defender of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a prosecutor on Monday and another the next day informing him that the ministry would not file any lawsuits against his client.
Mr. Ensign’s defense attorneys had cooperated with the prosecutors to convince them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement on Wednesday, had “acted in accordance with the law.”
Mr. Coggins declined to explain in more detail the legal arguments he had made to the prosecutors.
"I'm not comfortable going into the details of the conversation between the Ministry of Justice and me, but I think we've made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to close the investigation on a separate lawsuit by the ethics group, according to which a $96,000 payment from Mr. Ensign's parents to the Hamptons violated the federal election law.
The Electoral Commission said there was not enough evidence that the money was something other than a gift.
NV Energy, a large Nevada company that long supported the Senator, was one of the companies where Mr. Hampton found lobbyist work thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign.
An email from December 2008 proves that after the company moved on to Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensing's chief of staff, John Lopez, had an interview with Mr. Hampton, in which he told him that he was "knocking" at the Department of the Interior for a matter.
Mr. Ensign was also having lunch with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada client, Allegiant Air, and asked the Secretary of Transport to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline, after it had stopped Mr. Hampton for lobbying.
When information about this affair first came to the public last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his voters and resigned his position in the Senate, where he was fourth in the Republican ranks.
After not being noticed for many months, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he was seeking a third term in the Senate.
In announcing that Mr. Ensign will no longer be the target of police investigations, his press spokeswoman, Jennifer Cooper, said the senator hopes that the Ethics Commission will quickly follow the example of the Department of Justice and stop its investigation.
"Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing its hard work at the service of the people of Nevada," she said.
Cheshire appeal draws attention on Twitter
Half a dozen of them typing away in the riots in the courtroom.
Every minute, they sent their reports of horrific testimonies via Twitter.
In the end, according to the defense, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the rape trial and bed-chained children in a house that went up in flames.
On Thursday, the closely followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was accused of killing three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, will find an official end when the judge's verdict on the death sentence, which the jury has issued, falls.
However, Mr. Hayes lawyers have already filed applications in court, which set out the grounds for an appeal and which the courts will be busy for years to come.
One of the most provocative reasons is that the intense reporting on the process – including the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters – has led to a “circus atmosphere” and so widespread, immediate penetration of insurgent details that the jury has been inadmissibly influenced by public indignation.
This appeal could lead the Courts of Appeal to consider whether the new technologies make new rules necessary in the courtroom.
"As I have experienced it during this trial, I believe it is really a danger if the entry of new technologies into the courtroom affects everyone's right to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes' chief defense attorney.
The Supreme Court’s chairman, Jon C. Blue, dismissed the motions briefly and fluently last week when he said that the New Media would be “carefully controlled” and that there was no evidence that the jury had been driven by passions.
But that certainly wasn’t the last word on the matter.
For decades, court appeals have found that reporting on infamous cases raises doubts about the fairness of a trial.
In its historic 1966 ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the verdict against Dr. Sam Sheppard, a Cleveland osteopath who allegedly killed his wife, saying in his ruling that there had been a “carnival atmosphere in the courtroom” because of the New Media.
Some people believe that the television series and feature film "On the Run" is based on this crime.
Some lawyers say court appeals considering Mr. Haye’s conviction half a century later could follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to regulate the channels of communication from the courtroom that were still unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard’s case.
"There is a good reason to be concerned about the influence of the New Media in trials pursued by a broad public," said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who has investigated the death penalty in Connecticut.
Professor Donohue said some appeal courts might be intrigued by the idea that restricting prompt communication from the courtroom could make the trials more fair.
The Twitter issue is just one of many that Mr. Hayes’ lawyers set out to discuss for years and thus delay a conviction.
The defendants also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes may have already been convicted when Judge Blue did not allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them gruesome photos of the crime scene during jury selection.
Some of the jurors have said photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her breeder, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11, had filled them with disgust.
The defendants say they would also question the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution, arguing that the judge mistakenly exchanged a juror who had been a critic of the prosecutor’s office, and that he had inadmissibly put pressure on the verdict when he made the unusual decision to release the jury over the weekend.
The jurors were not isolated.
But her arguments about the impact of extensive reporting on the process may be the most interesting.
In a ruling appeal they filed last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed by the candidates during the campaign for the office of governor and for the U.S. Senate.
They argued that the New Media had continuously rekindled the flames of emotion about the case.
“The daily rush of media beepers, cameras, and reporters outside the courtroom,” the lawyers wrote, “hasn’t been seen before in New Haven and perhaps even nationwide.”
Their focus on Twitter’s coverage is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that these direct messages are more upsetting than reports that are refunded more slowly is an anti-technology look that impoverishes the coverage of future trials.
However, some lawyers said that appeal courts are often confronted with the argument that social and technical changes need adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayer's lawyers reinforce this claim.
In their appeal, they referred to the 1966 Supreme Court ruling, which overturned Dr. Sheppard’s conviction on the basis of reporting, and made it clear that the New Media required new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can courtesy connect the dividing?
After a campaign of slander and negativity, little politeness has broken out in Washington this week.
Is it the omen of a real two-party cooperation or a moment of illusion before one quickly returns to the struggle of the parties in the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and tops of Congress did not bring a breakthrough in the big issues to be dealt with during the so-called "lame duck session", the meeting at the end of a government period in which no decisions are made.
According to all that one hears, it was neither a polite discussion between two different sides nor an observation of their shared responsibility to govern, but rather an empty episode of a partisan point-gathering.
The president’s public meeting on Wednesday was also civilized, despite the political differences that continue to exist between the members.
It seems clear that close interaction over a period of months creates a mutual respect that obscures the ideological divide that continues to separate members from each other.
This is hardly enough to say that a new era of cooperation has begun.
Both sides are now in a test phase - in which one of the other demands signs of cooperation and compromise willingness, while trying to weigh the boundaries of public opinion and the patience of the voters after a renewed party warfare.
Therefore, the meeting on Tuesday itself and its assessment by the participants were limited to a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too great and too deep to expect a rapid change in the atmosphere that has prevailed over the past two years.
Whether it is about taxes, donations, health or entitlements, the two sides are miles away from each other.
Last but not least, the November election in Washington voted mildly for at least a short time.
“No question, the tone of voice has changed,” said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush administration who now works for the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
“This is inevitable after elections.
Elections awaken party passions that are dying again.
And that's good."
On some issues, especially those that are on the agenda of the "lame duck session," Republicans and Democrats have little choice but to find a solution."
Bush’s tax cuts end at the end of the year, and no one advocates that.
Both sides want to find a way to receive some or all, whether temporarily or permanently.
Likewise, a compromise on increased unemployment benefits is to be expected, if only because the Republicans cannot afford to believe the favored tax cuts for the rich while refusing to support unemployed workers.
After the meeting in the White House on Tuesday, the optimism has increased that one can agree on these issues during the "lame duck session" and simultaneously ratify the New START Treaty.
However, William Glaston of the Brookings Institution warns that a successful cooperation on urgent issues of the lame duck session" will not necessarily lead to a lasting cooperation of the parties when the new 112th Congress is convened in January.
Instead, he says, a phase of disagreement is more likely, perhaps even inevitable.
"After the things that need to be done are done, this short-term psychology will turn into confrontation," he said.
Wehner is also skeptical – and this skepticism is shared by many – that courtesy leads to true cooperation.
“I see a lot of what is happening from today until 2012, as a prelude, or shadow boxing, to the main event of 2012,” he said.
The reasons for this have a lot to do with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the tea party voters who helped to form them.
No matter how concerned the Republican leaders may be about poker being too high, they know that they must try to keep their promises of lowering government spending and overturning health care reform.
These party lines are already clear in the initial responses to the recommendations of the Deficit Commission, which include tax reform and the raising of some taxes, as well as raising the retirement age and lowering government spending.
Deputy Chairman Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, have pushed so much to put the deficit issue on the public agenda that it can no longer be ignored.
But they need 14 of the 18 votes within the Commission to make their plan the official recommendation and they are struggling very hard to get even close to that number.
The greatest resistance is found in the elected representatives of the body, because in financial matters, at least today, there is little room for manoeuvre or little sympathy for compromises.
Galston predicts two stages in the battle between the White House and the Republicans in Congress.
The first fight will take place in the form of party clashes next year, when Republicans challenge Obama in terms of state budget, taxes, and health care system, later followed by a phase of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
The public opinion.
It is proven that, despite the partiality of the current election, the majority of Americans still want the two parties to work together.
If confrontation leads to a dead end, as it did in 1995, then both parties must pay close attention to the public response.
Whoever is condemned to lose will have to change course and seek compromise.
This may indeed be an optimistic view.
Partisanship and polarization are greater today than they were in the mid-1990s, and they seem to be a larger ideological divide between Obama and the Congressional Republicans than they were between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans at the time.
At the same time, the activists of both parties see 2010 as a pure prelude to a far more far-reaching election in 2012.
In this way, the courtesy shown this week may be welcomed by many Americans.
But it will take much more effort on both sides to find a common denominator in the issues that still separate the two.
Leaked US document portrays Moscow as a port of corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of the "cleptocracy" and it passes on part of the bribes and the protection money it collects to the Kremlin, as reported by the American embassy in Russia in a memo in February.
Both the police and the State Security Service are extorting high protection money so that they can maintain their expensive standard of living in Moscow, it is said.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses, but also from organized criminal gangs.
Each layer of bureaucracy—what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called “vertical of authority”—takes its share of the money that moves the ladder upwards.
The memo, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published by WikiLeaks on its homepage on Tuesday.
The memo is based on sources whose names have been edited.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still the mayor of Moscow, and it accuses him of corruption.
He was fired by President Dmitry Medvedev in October, but there is hardly any evidence that had been cleaned up in the meantime.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a well-known construction company, have repeatedly rejected allegations of corruption for years, and he has won numerous defamation charges against such allegations.
In September, he explained to a Russian television station when asked about a documentary that suggests he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's dirty, it's dirty."
> An incredibly large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt, polls have shown.
But it is unusual that, as happened in the Ambassador's report, individuals are called, and it is unheard of that is done by a diplomat of a foreign country.
"The direct link of the Moscow government to crime has led some to call it 'disturbed' and conclude that the government acts more like a kleptocrat than a government," the memo reads.
"Criminal elements enjoy a 'kryshna' (a term from the world of criminals/mafia, which literally means 'roof' or protection) that extends across the police, the State Security (FSB), the Service Supervisory Authority (MVD) and the prosecutor's office as well as the entire Moscow government bureaucracy.
Experts have discovered a three-layered structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"FSB, MVD and the militia are on the second stage."
"Finally, the ordinary criminals and the criminal inspectors follow at the lowest level."
"This is an incompetent system in which criminal groups close a gap in some areas because the city does not offer any help."
The report goes on to say that the FSB is collecting money from the biggest companies and that the police are arresting small businessmen.
One source, it said, "explained that Moscow's business owners understand that it is best to get protection from the MVD and FSB (and not from organized crime), as they have not only more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by law."
“For this reason, protection from criminal gangs is no longer as in demand as it used to be.”
The memo notes that while collecting the funds is comprehensive, the protection itself is not very modest; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who do not pay find their business closed very quickly - due to one or the other pretext.
Medvedev has spoken on several occasions about fighting corruption, but at the same time noted that he has made little progress.
The memo of the embassy contains descriptions of men going to the Kremlin with suitcases that were presumably full of money.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on the bureaucrats," said Georgy Satarov, director of Indem, a Moscow expert commission, in a recent interview.
"But he's part of that bureaucracy."
"It is not part of the political class because a political class no longer exists in Russia."
Without politicians, without opposition, without a separation of powers, he says, corruption is inevitable.
Nationally, Indem estimates, corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country ranks 154th in a recent study on the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (countries are listed from "least corrupt" to "most corrupt").
The revelation of the American embassy memo, which took place late in the evening after Moscow time, will certainly trigger dissatisfaction within the Russian government, although since Luzhkov can be accused of Moscow’s mistakes, it can also be a way for the Kremlin to claim that the problems are solved.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that the WikiLeaks documents could be a fake and responded angry to the revelation that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth is that it's about our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't expect this to happen with such arrogance, with such pressure, and in such unethical ways, you know."
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to confront the past
In a dimly lit, concrete classroom with dirty and peeling walls, the director of Anlong Veng High School recalls the man who built it, later Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and he took care of his people," Sreng Kor Ma, 42, said.
Due to his brutality during Khmer Rouge rule known as "the butcher", the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge stronghold in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals and bridges, developed infrastructure, and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, longstanding supporters are challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local Truth and Reconciliation Forum allowed the victims to publicly confront the people who once supported the regime.
In June, the government distributed a textbook that, for the first time, tells children of former soldiers the history of the Khmer Rouge.
And in July, a community tribunal of the UN and Cambodia first sentenced a former member of the Khmer Rouge when it sentenced the former head of the infamous Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these developments, fear grew among Khmer Rouge veterans Alnlong Vengs, making their efforts to reconcile and reintegrate into Cambodia’s society more difficult.
"There is still rejection and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said Chhang Youk, head of Cambodia's Documentation Centre, an independent organization that investigates the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"It divides families itself."
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of illness, overwork or starvation.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the Pol Pot-Ied government in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its military fled to the border of Cambodia to Thailand.
Here they spread unrest until December 1998, when the last movement surrendered.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war from their base in the west of the mountains and jungles of Cambodia, Ta Mok attracted the next generation in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, when a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the country’s first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to overrun into government, leading to the surrenders of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural death in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had not yielded, was arrested by government forces at the Dangrek Mountains in 1999.
He died in 2006 in Phnom Penh Prison, where he waited for trial.
When their patrons no longer protected them, most of the former Khmer Rouge fighters fled to the excruciating poverty of rural Cambodia and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory.
Even though a few elite Khmer Rouge officials retained their local government posts for laying down their weapons, the ordinary soldiers remained poor, uneducated peasants.
"These people have benefited very little from the surrender," said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which holds public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They are anchored in the regime's utopian agrarian ideology."
"They grew up without any professional knowledge."
Sor Lim, 55, who had joined the Rhmer Rouge in 1974 as a teenager, fought in the jungle for Anlang Veng before settled in 1998 to live a life as a poor rice farmer.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Ta Mok has given everyone something to eat."
"But now life is hard because we have to take care of ourselves."
The ongoing Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also raised concerns here.
Earlier next year, the court will try to bring Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, as well as Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister.
The court’s mandate is to condemn the old leaders and those who are chiefly responsible for the atrocities, but it is not said whether it will pursue further acts beyond these four cases.
This has done little to alleviate the fears in Anlong Veng.
Current media speculation has focused on Im Chaem, 64, who had been district chief in Manteay Meanchey Province during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told representatives of the Cambodian Documentation Centre that she was in charge of the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project in which thousands of forced labourers were believed to have died.
On a hot evening, Im Chaem returned from work in the fields to her wooden house on a dirty road outside Anlong Veng.
When the sun threw long shadows on the dry grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss their past at the Khmer Rouge.
Should the court summon her, she would refuse to leave, she said.
"Cambodia lives in peace and stability," she said.
“If there were no more persecutions, there would be war.”
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who fled the Khmer Rouge in 1878, has also repeatedly warned that if the situation became uncertain, the court would indict more suspects, although experts and historians are discussing this.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But confrontation with the past is what Cambodia needs to do in order to move forward, said Chhang Youk of the Documentation Center.
“Reconciliation with the Khmer era means bringing together the broken pieces,” he said.
"It is our duty to put these broken parts together so that we can understand everything."
The center created the first government-approved textbook on the Khmer Rouge, the 75-page "History of Democratic Cambodia".
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an appendix to the history book for the Ministry of Education High School, which contains less than four pages about the Khmer Rouge.
As often as in Cambodia, the young people in Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city’s ties to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new textbook helps students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents were skeptical when he brought the book home to read it.
"My family rejects many parts of the book and the court," he said.
"They are suspicious because they are not sure how many people will be convicted by the court."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the textbook, and the court are gradually gaining influence," he said.
The Khmer Rouge still has a powerful attraction here.
Above the Dangrek mountains, a path overgrown with shrubs and dirty plastic waste leads to a rectangle of black soot covered with a rusty tin roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here after his death in 1998 on a tire pile.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a cell phone saleswoman on the roadside, said she didn’t know much about the man who had been burned here.
"But he has a strong spirit and many people here go to him to pray," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea’s birthday, and later that day she wanted to go to Pol Pot’s last resting place, where she would lay a bush of ripe bananas – hoping that he would bring her luck.
Belarus agrees to no longer accumulate weapons-capable uranium
In a surprising victory for President Obama’s campaign to secure global nuclear material, the government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that it will no longer collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint statement following a meeting of Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article at the security summit.
The U.S. government had tried for years to convince Belarus not to collect any more highly enriched uranium and seemed to have reached a hurdle last spring.
But U.S. government officials told the Washington Post that in the past two months two secret agreements have been made with Belarus to remove 187 pounds of weapon-capable uranium from a Belarusian research facility.
That paved the way for Wednesday’s agreement to remove the rest of the material – according to an official employee who remains anonymous due to the topic’s sensitivity, about 500 pounds.
The deal appears to be one of the most important outcomes of Obama’s April “Nuclear Security Summit of 47 Nations” that ruled out Belarus.
And it was obviously good enough to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really excited about the fact that they want a seat in the Nuclear Security Summit (2012)."
"This proves to me that it works," said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a nuclear security promotion group.
Clinton called the agreement “a very significant, important step” by Belarus.
In April 2009, Obama pledged in Prague to secure all precarious nuclear material within four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did it under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama’s nuclear security summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko declared that the nation will never give up its uranium.
"How to keep highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is fundamentally capable of weapons, and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said at the time.
"This is our raw material ... we will not make any dirty bombs out of it and we will not sell it to anyone."
"We use it exclusively for research purposes, that's all".
However, Belarus approached the US a few months ago when it expressed interest in reaching an agreement.
The first attempt to remove uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the material was slightly radiated, officials say.
It was loaded into a special train that took more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal, officials say.
The second take-off was decided on Monday and was carried out by plane, according to officials.
The US government is paying $14 million for these efforts, with much of the money flowing into Belarusian research using weakly enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
“This was extremely carefully coordinated and coordinated to build trust,” which led to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Department of Energy working on Global Hazard Reduction.
The James Martin Center for Non-Disclosure Studies estimates that Belarus had at least 88 pounds of weapons-capable uranium this year, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
According to the joint agreement, Belarus wants to dissolve its camp by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been tense for years, primarily because of Lukashenko’s harsh disregard for human rights.
But Wednesday’s statement suggests a possible approximation.
“Welcoming the progress of these global security issues, the United States of America and Belarus announce that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue in improving bilateral relations and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens,” she explains.
No objections from the Spanish government to CIA flights
The Spanish government had no objections to the CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners over Spanish territory to Guantánamo, according to a telegram from the U.S. Ambassador to Madrid.
This reflects the documents enveloped by Wikileaks and forwarded to the daily "El País" (cable), adding that former deputy head of government María Teresa Fernández de la Vega demanded that the Spanish government be informed "to prove that foreign aircraft flying over Spain are adequately monitored."
In June 2006, following the publication of a report by the Council of Europe accusing the aid to human rights abusive practices in a dozen countries, including Spain, the former North American ambassadors Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega met.
The deputy head of government admitted that the Council's report "have met Zapatero offside" and affirmed that Spain has nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega underlined that Spain has no objections to the intelligence flights over Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" so as not to be "surprised unprepared," Aguirre reports via cable.
The former foreign minister, Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel Moratinos, also pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish government "does not want to pay much attention to this matter, even though the government has little influence, since it is in the hands of the judges."
Prosecutor Vicente González, for his part, told the embassy in January 2007 that he would not block the judicial initiative to request the declassification of the documents of the Spanish Intelligence Center (CNI) and the Secretary of Defense on the CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any incriminating or sensitive information," the ambassador said after a conversation with the prosecutor.
Nevertheless, the US was more concerned about the "apparent coordination between the Spanish prosecutor and the German prosecutors" than about the declassified information provided by the CNI and the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to handle discreetly between governments," Aguirre lamented.
At a lunch in March 2007, attended by the U.S. Ambassador and Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, the latter commented that "although the Spanish judges are insanely concerned about their independence and doing what they deem appropriate," he had given his staff instructions to "avoid bloated rhetorical comments in order to ease the tension."
The ambassador also expressed concern about the PP’s approach to this matter.
“Despite their generally pro-American stance, our experience teaches us that the PP will not doubt it, from an indication that the US government will capitalize on Zapatero’s actions, which could be interpreted as potential human rights violations, even if these revelations could have a negative impact on the US government,” he emphasized.
The child murderer confessed that she had complained on the internet about the “burden” of motherhood.
The young woman spoke of the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror in a Galician way"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" on the Internet.
Under this nickname, she keeps in touch with a cousin and at least one girlfriend, both from Noia, a village in the province of La Coruña where she was born.
The announcements are from 2008.
To understand these, one must know their love life, which the daily ABC reconstructs on the basis of testimony from their family members.
The 30-year-old Galician woman began a relationship with industrialist Iván Túñez in 1998.
She held for a year.
Shortly after she broke up her relationship, it became known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby belonged to him, but his ex never let him perform a DNA analysis.
Shortly thereafter, she entered into a different relationship.
The chosen one was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring parish.
She lived with him for a long time.
César lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balearic Islands to look around in the labour market, the little one stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But from the content of their messages, it can be concluded that their love relationship broke and they separated.
In March 2008, she is alone in Menorca and writes: "Alberto is very strange and angry because I came here to work."
"When I told him that, he thought it was good, but now, of course, he realizes what it means to be alone with the boy all day and not to be free, to be able to do and leave what he wants."
Later, she mentions a message she just received on her cell phone: "I want you to come back this month or give me an address to send the boy to you."
She complains, “If he doesn’t like me leaving the boy with my mother, I’ll pick him up when I get back.”
In May, she talks about returning to her village: "This week I will go there, but I will only stay there until the 19th, because I have to introduce myself to a job on the 20th if I don't want to lose it."
She explains that if everything goes well, she will take her firstborn with her.
"He'll be with where he has to be, that is, with me. Never in life will I leave him with anyone but my mother again," a dubious intention, considering their bad relationship.
There will be another mail in July.
When she writes this, it is assumed that the boy who came to the island on the 1st of the month and was allegedly murdered on the 10th is dead.
"On the one hand, César is satisfied, on the other hand, he is not."
"On the one hand, he's with me and he likes the place a bit, but on the other he has to go to school every day."
She talks about moving to Mallorca.
"There he (the boy) will attend a summer course, so I have less expenses for the nanny."
On the 17th: Memories and Complaints.
"A giant kiss from César asking me when you're coming."
"Alberto says he sent me some videos on the email. You see, if he wants to, he'll find me, like, shit."
On the 30th, one more thing: "The boy is fine. He's going to a summer course to learn Catalan."
From Víctor, their current partner, there is one: "He's shooting me money."
On the internet, in anime and manga blogs, there are messages from her.
She even had her own blog in MySpace, which is now locked, and in which she called herself "Muki, the Prison Releaser."
"Terror a la gallega (headline) ".
The last man who lived with her, a sworn hunting guard, declares to have remorse because he feels guilty.
He can’t believe it all happened because she didn’t tell him she was a single mother.
Mónica was transferred yesterday from the Center for Prisoners of Justice in Menorca to the Provincial Prison of Palma.
Defendant Carlos Maceda said she could not remember the course of the matter, "and she did not intend to harm the little one."
Before that, however, she had confessed to having drowned César in the bathtub and stowed his body in a suitcase.
The defense and prosecution requested a psychiatric opinion.
Partido Popular won 4 seats in Congress and PSC lost 9
With the results of November 28, the PP could play a decisive role in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the significant increase in votes and MPs in the last regional elections, the PP is already looking ahead to the parliamentary elections - whether they are preferential or not. Their expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes this party gets in these elections is usually twice as high as that in the elections in Catalonia.
For example, the Catalan People's Party received 610.473 votes in the 2008 parliamentary elections, while that figure was only 316.222 in the 2006 regional elections.
Last Sunday, the PPC scored 384,091 votes.
If this rising tendency - result of the PSC's vote diversion and the PP's voter retention - should continue, the analysts of the PP predict that in the parliamentary elections the PPC could rise from 8 to 12 congressmen, while also CiU would win four (it now has 10) and the PSC would lose at least 9 MPs (out of 25).
These calculations demonstrate the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the People's Party, the ERC would lose one deputy - currently it has three - while ICV could hold its deputy or win one.
However, if the election calendar is maintained, the next date with the municipal elections will be in May 2011, when the People’s Party (PP) can be the tongue in the balance to put an end to socialist domination, in four provincial capitals and with its majority in the city council of Barcelona, one of the city councils with the largest budget: 661 million euros for 2011.
Both the nationalists and the People’s Party agree that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, in which the socialists cannot gain a majority or resort to their traditional allies (ERC and ICV).
After the Republican debacle, it is not absurd that this party will lose its representation in the Barcelona Municipal Council, where it would have to win 5% of the vote.
The PP, on the other hand, saw an increase in its vote share in the four provincial capitals and could become the decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they could play the leading role in Tarragona’s change, where they had ruled together with the PP before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
En Lérida, the PP is only 500 votes behind the PSC. The mayor, <0xC3><0x80>ngel Ros, maintains good relations with Mariano Rajoy - they met several times during the last election campaign.
Also in other important places, such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus, the People's Party saw a significant increase.
Currently, the PP is represented in 34 municipalities of Catalonia and aims to form lists in as many places as possible.
The Catalan cell bought Al Qaeda thousands of passports
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three more in Thailand.
The seven Pakistanis and Nigerians detained by the police of the Barcelona Police Intelligence Office formed the jihadist cell controlled from Thailand, the various Al Qaeda groups, including the "Movement for the Liberation of Tamil Eelam" (LTTE) and "Laschkar e-Taiba" (Let) - the latter was the author of the bombings in Totay in 2008.
The Spanish Interior Minister attributes great importance to these investigations, which he goes so far as to assure that with the "Operation Kampai" the counterfeiting apparatus of Al Qaida has been "weakened" worldwide and "thus its ability to act".
The researchers estimate that during the two years in which the cell was active in Catalonia, thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where they were faked and then sent to the groups that make up the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda, so that their "combatants" could cross the borders of European and other Western countries without penalty.
The cell uncovered is not the only one of the jihadist network active in Europe, so in addition to the Thai investigative bodies, other European police units have also participated in the investigations. It cannot be ruled out that there will be similar attacks in the territory of the EU in the coming days as the one carried out last Tuesday in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested) another was carried out in Thailand, during which the Pakistani Butijn Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshanan Eh were arrested.
They had led the cell established in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network – part of which had been destroyed in 2009 – particularly stole tourist passports according to the so-called “International Islamic Front” guidelines.
This means that the documents were issued in the names of men aged 25 to 45 and had to be valid for several more years; they were not allowed to have visa stamps.
Investigative circles underlined that so far no links have been established between the arrested in Catalonia and the bombing in Bombay, although the author of this assassination, "Laschkar e-Taiba", was one of the recipient groups of the passports stolen in Spain and subsequently falsified in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it should be remembered that a few days before the assassination of Catalonia, several thousand dollars had been dispatched from through a money transfer company, which was "invested" in the purchase of prepaid mobile phone cards, which were later used by the members of the "command" that put an end to the lives of 106 people.
Police confiscated extensive documentation.
PP calls for Mas to postpone the tax agreement
The president of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, took the opportunity yesterday to personally present to Artur Mas her conditions in support of his takeover as Prime Minister of the Generalitat, which are unlike those already set during the election campaign and can be combined with the priority of the economic recovery and the omission of regionalist independence.
The leader of the Catalan People's Party addressed Artur Mas with certainty, who awarded her the 18 MPs she won last Sunday - a figure that is more than enough to feel indispensable because the candidate from the CiU bourgeois-regionalist party relies on at least one of the opposition parties to abstain from voting when he takes office.
The future alliances that the regionalists want to make in the upcoming parliamentary elections in Congress depend on a possible entente with the PP. However, the talks that Mas is currently having with the other party leaders revolve around Catalonia.
As for the PPC’s party leaders, they are demanding that, in support of the appointment, “all discourses concerning the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia” as well as an agreement on the financial balance between the state and the Autonomous Region – similar to the one in the Basque Country – and which the CiU’s party leader even wants to submit to a referendum, be postponed.
Both political leaders have in common that they want to make the built-up political apparatus of the regional administration leaner and abolish the inheritance and gift tax.
The details of the negotiations for the accession of Mas are dealt with by the PPC Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who announced a harsh opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will meet Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The elderly care home confirms that the deaths are not due to "missing measures"
The owners of the home in Olot do not rule out that their caregiver killed over eleven elderly people
The officials of the Elderly Care Home La Caritat in Olot (Gerona) gave a press conference yesterday, in which they highlighted the damage that the criminal actions of Joan Vila Dilmé - the nurse who had killed at least eleven elderly people during his work for whom he was responsible - had done to the institution.
The head of the nursing home, Joan Sala, accompanied by his lawyer, Joan Cañada, appeared in court and announced that "La Caritat wants to indict the responsible (for the deaths)", but "the law and our liability force us to accept the trial and civil liability".
The institution not only has to accept a loss of social standing because it did not detect the criminal acts of the caregiver in time, but now also pay a high amount of compensation, which is calculated by the legal representatives of the family members of the victims.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that he has continued to murder since then.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the elderly care home - as he suspected that no doctor had personally examined the deceased, but the formalities were handled by telephone based on their age and diseases.
The head of La Caritat denied this point roundly, stating that "lack of measures could not have been the cause of the incidents at any time."
La Caritat's lawyer added that "there would be no evidence in the lawsuit for negligent acts of any person other than the accused."
The "death angel" already christened confessed eleven murders before yesterday and declared that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and murdered the second old lady a month and a half later.
In this case, he killed with an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime in which he had administered a mixture of various sedatives.
The head of La Caritat said that the access of the staff to the medicines was difficult to control.
The nurse used the insulin syringes and the sedative cocktail in six of nine crimes committed to free the patients from their suffering with death.
But the results of the lab investigations will reveal whether Vila is lying and actually chose a less cruel death for his first victims, or whether he burned them out from the inside by giving them bleached liquor, as he had confessed to three women he murdered between October 12 and 17.
In La Caritat, the statements of the nurse are not believed, not even in the number of confessed murders, which could be more. This attitude is justified by the fact that Vila had made very different statements in court and that it makes no sense to suddenly change his approach after eight successful murders.
They say they made it available to the judiciary for this reason and to clarify the scope of these incidents.
The European Central Bank (ECB)
Investors reacted strongly yesterday to the threat from ECB President Trichet, who warned that "markets should not underestimate our responsiveness."
The risk premiums of the euro peripheral countries have risen dramatically and the shares of European banks have increased by more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we should not underestimate the possibility that the ECB can be deceived and that the euro has barely gained in points, which is a cause for concern.
Yesterday’s events are typical of an illiquid market that recovers to the extent that it collapses, however, as a result of the closure of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will not lose his fear for a long time.
Today, a month ago, the European Central Bank urged us to reverse our liquidity measures, after which the ECB would have to withdraw tomorrow for the fourth time in two years, and probably several more times in the future.
The Bundesbank called for the termination of the plan to buy sovereign debt, as it is ineffective, and the lifting of all exceptional temporary liquidity measures. Only a one-week unlimited access should be maintained.
Following the Ireland crisis, we expect the current liquidity measures to be extended "at least until March" and the quarterly tenders with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity will be maintained until at least June.
We also expect the bond purchase program to continue and give a strengthening signal.
If the expectations created are not met, the excellent response of yesterday’s markets will be thrown back and if stubbornly insisted that we withdraw our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
As with the ECB meeting in May, when the bank reaffirmed that it was not considering buying sovereign debt and markets collapsed, this story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May, she showed her teeth and on Wednesday, she said she had already bought a lot, provoking a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday, the auction of one-year state titles in Portugal was quite weak.
State asset management spent only 500 million to 5.28%, compared to 750 million to 4.81% in the previous auction.
Nevertheless, interest rates in Portugal fell by 30 basis points over the entire curve, reflecting a change in the perception of the markets according to the words of Trichet.
In Ireland, the numbers of the debt hole of Allied and Bank of Ireland were published.
The sum is estimated to be around 10,000 million in the short term and possibly another 15,000. There is time until February to raise private capital or these banks will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has completely lost its credibility after failing to recognize the problem with the July stress tests, the figures under the rescue plan are acceptable and help reduce uncertainty.
However, the government must get parliamentary approval for its new budget next Tuesday, and as it still lacks sufficient support, Ireland continues to be a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has made her discourse more moderate with regard to the summit of the heads of state and government on 14 December, where political unity is required to show that we play the same score together.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries the ninth symphony of Beethoven.
The Spanish Prime Minister presented yesterday the action plan, which is to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous regions, such as financial institutions, reduction of the public deficit, liberalisation, privatisation and job creation measures. Measures that sound in the ears of investors like Vivaldi’s Four Seasons.
The double effect of Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock exchange has grown by 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges.
Compared to February, the response of the government and the Spanish central bank was quick and convincing, and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today there is a significant auction of a three-year government bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect, so we are relying on a strong demand that will remove any doubts about our debt resilience.
For Spain, applying for an aid plan would be a self-sacrifice.
We would receive liquidity that we do not need. The Treasury has 40 billion euros available, three times as much as in March. Interest rates are extremely expensive and access to the markets would be closed without notice.
Nevertheless, our strategy should be in line with Caesar’s wife’s motto: “Now not only does the being count, but also the appearance.”
Courage, we can do that!
The Chairman of the Board of Directors of Owls contests the Annual General Meeting of Vega Sicilia at the request of his children
The storm in the open conflict of the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family, owners of the companies Owls and El Enebro, does not fade away.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, founder of the group of companies, will contest the shareholders' meeting of El Enebro, which will take place at the request of five of his seven children on the 16th, as he considers it "absolutely void". His children will try to obtain a majority to control the administrative bodies of the company - owner of the winery Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez and his children Jesús David and María José are preparing the legal measures for a new judicial chapter in their dispute over the control of a part of the group of companies.
The founder of the largest holding company for business services does not seem willing to give in in his legal dispute over the control of the bodies of El Enebro.
He was expelled from the Board of Directors by five of his seven children, who were appointed members of the Board of Directors at the Shareholders’ Meeting on 18 January this year, which is already registered as contested in the Commercial Register.
The general meeting of El Enebro, convened by the judge of the No. 2 Commercial Court of Madrid for the 16th, has triggered a new thunderstorm in the lap of the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family.
The invocation of the judge to convene the meeting is the only legal way to ensure the convocation of the shareholders’ meeting.
The last strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira <0xC3><0x81>lvarez Mezquiriz is interpreted by David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez as a "desperate means of the applicants - his five children - to have, by means of legal subtleties, fraudulent acts and abuse of law, the annulled assembly of 18 January", as official spokesman explains.
This argument is the basis for the retrospective challenge of the assembly to declare it "absolutely void".
The same protagonists, wrapped in discreet silence, tried in June already unsuccessfully to convene a meeting by judicial means.
At El Enebro - an asset company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets - David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez' seven children control 100 percent of the capital.
On the other hand, according to family protocols, the founder of the service group demands the right of use over 51% of the capital.
This is the actual background of the case that the judge has to decide in the hearing on the contested action, for which a date has not yet been set.
Red Bull wins in F1 with a Siemens secret weapon
The cars are improved with a software in real time.
Since Red Bull entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history has been shaped by surprises and successes in this exquisite universe of speed.
At first, no one paid attention to the newcomer and despite his steeply rising career during the last seasons, everyone bet on the victory of Fernando Alonso’s Ferrari at the final sprint last November.
Without wanting to reduce the skills of German pilot and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the power of Renault’s engine, the “secret weapon” that the Multi Siemens put in the hands of Red Bull, creating a winning team, has become a legend.
In reality, it is a powerful software for simulating processes that the German company launched in 2007 for purposes not related to car racing.
This computer science program, known as PLM, has been used to develop assembly chains in factories around the world, power plants and high-precision instruments.
The aim is to reproduce or simulate a product or process faithfully before it is actually built, in order to avoid errors and unnecessary costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft and Nissan’s most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens's industrial department, explains that with the use of this software in the Formula 1 factory, Red Bull can design and execute "in a few hours, almost in real time" the changes and improvements detected on the races and during the tests.
Russwurm reports that in 1992, an average of ten technicians worked in the racing stalls, who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements in a season.
Today, Red Bull’s team employs 180 highly skilled young people, who perform analyses and make all kinds of changes to the racing car using high-performance computer systems.
The PLM software is capable of analyzing and improving all components of Red Bull’s racing cars, with the exception of the engine, for which Renault is solely responsible.
The materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are changed.
The changes can be transferred from the virtual reality of the simulator to reality in less than 24 hours thanks to advanced production facilities and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limit set to this crazy technical perfectionism is the $40 million that a Formula 1 team can spend on their races in a season.
Red Bull has set up its high-tech factory to develop and manufacture its racing cars in a location 50 kilometers from London.
These are two buildings in which visits - especially by journalists - are severely restricted.
Everything that happens is top secret.
The workforce includes 580 people, including the two pilots, World Champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bull’s true Formula 1 hero is undoubtedly the newest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
Behind the enormous technological resources that the energy drink manufacturer puts at the service of its participation on the racetracks, there are other protagonists, whose support is invaluable and whose reputation is zero.
The plant’s technologist, Steve Nevey, emphasizes that five years ago, it could be said that the advances in R&D for racing cars contributed to the victory at 50 percent and that the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today, shares have changed. The technology accounts for 85 percent of the success, while the contribution of the pilots is estimated to be 15 percent.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by computers, because they are "unpredictable gladiators."
HP to open 20 stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) inaugurated its first exclusive store in collaboration with its partner Ront Reyes yesterday in Barcelona.
It is the first of a network of twenty stores with 80 to 100 square meters each, which the Multi intends to open in Spain over the next two years.
The company agrees this initiative with the already existing 16 multi-brand sales areas, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The deputy chairman of HP España, Helena Herrero, cited as an example the converted shop on the Gran Vía in Barcelona, property of Pont Reyes, with which HP has been working for thirty years.
The North American group intends to set up 200 sales outlets in Europe by 2010, including 20 in Spain.
The first ones were inaugurated last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia). Barcelona is the third store.
Herrera did not want to reveal the upcoming new openings, but did not rule out that Madrid could be the next target.
The vice chairman, who is also the head of HP Personal Systems, assured that the philosophy of opening stores is always the same, relying on a local distributor with experience and industry expertise.
The North American group of companies advises them and takes over the exclusive shop equipment (with interactive products to touch). In Europe, all shops will look the same.
HP is also responsible for training shop staff.
Helena Herrero said it was not a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive network of points of sale was intended to “optimize customer service and advice to small and micro-enterprises during and after purchases, and even packaging.”
The Barcelona store has a pioneer pilot program that solves the technical problems of HP devices with a warranty.
An online service establishes a connection to the technical headquarters in Maastricht (Holland).
"This way, we can solve problems in ten minutes, which sometimes take up to two days."
"This system was developed especially for small and micro enterprises as well as private customers, because the large enterprises already have their service contracts for technical after-sales service," explained Helena Herroro yesterday.
Sabadell wants to 'steal' one million customers from its rival in three years
Jaime Guardiola, the managing director of Banco Sabadell, is more optimistic than other managers. He believes 2001 will be a tough year for the banks, but initially dismisses a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the debt war.
Nevertheless, he anticipates a drop in interest margins that banks are trying to offset with increases in fees and loan prices.
Sabadell expects to capture one million private customers in three years - a subject that still remains to be dealt with.
Sabadell has found the way to exploit the next three years, and thus survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will introduce a new three-year guidance plan in 2011.
The goal is not only to survive without using the public aid from the FROB, but also to increase the market share by one million private customers - 700,000 if you subtract the customers that the bank will lose. This is the big challenge that this bank faces, because so far it has paid more attention to its business customers than its private customers.
This year, it has attracted 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Their market share for private customers is 3.5 percent, while business customers account for more than 10 percent.
Another principle of the 2011-2013 business plan is the increase in productivity, i.e. austerity, cost reduction. The challenges the bank faces will be presented together with the annual financial report.
Few banks dare to set and publish targets in these difficult times, as the financial crisis has disrupted all the plans of the banks around the world.
Sabadell will complete this year’s Optima guidance plan, which was initially designed for three years, but which has been extended by one financial year as a result of the market situation.
The customers who will leave the savings banks are the main objective of the bank.
At a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardiola emphasized that 2011 would be a "difficult" year "with a large reach".
The manager assumes that Spain would only “slowly” get out of the crisis.
In addition, it would be "very difficult" to "create work" in two or three years - fundamental to the survival of the banks.
Even if he assumes that the war on liabilities - which penalizes interest margins - will diminish, the risk surcharges that banks and savings banks have to pay for their issues to maintain liquidity will already be diverted to the price of loans as a compensation for dwindling profit margins.
"The issues of liquidity and financing are structural and they will put pressure on the loans."
"We haven't turned the rooster off, but the interest rate differentials are very high," Guardiola admitted.
Banesto issued an order to its branch network on Thursday to restrict the issuance of long-term loans and increase interest rate differentials (see Cinco Días of November 22 and 27).
The manager also admitted that the banks were currently pursuing the strategy of "increasing fees", but "within a competitive framework".
Sabadell’s guiding principle is based on organic growth, even though, as always, the group does not exclude corporate business.
It is not for nothing that he assures that in Spain "larger companies are needed."
“Everything will change next year,” he said.
He stresses that the demand for capital is currently "increasing enormously" and does not exclude that some Spanish financial institutions will slip into red figures.
He believes that the FROB can replace the money market in the case of capital stocks.
After reassuring that Sabadell could survive a temporary market closure, he refutes the argument of some bankers who are already prophesying a new liquidity crisis.
He stresses that nothing can be put into circulation, but unlike the incidents in June, one can obtain short-term financing through repo transactions and thus intercept the crisis.
CECA excludes a second wave of savings bank mergers
CECA’s Director General, José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday the possibility of a fusion wave of savings banks and stressed the speed with which the industry is being restructured.
When the Spanish savings banks started the concentration process, several savings banks insisted not to take part in the first phase and reserved the second round.
On the other hand, the Director General of the Spanish Savings Banks Association (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured that this second round would not take place.
"I believe that most of the mergers have been completed, and the inclusion of Cajasol in the Banca Cívica group cannot be considered a second round, but rather an adjustment."
"The bulk is completed. It may be that we have thirteen or fourteen instead of seventeen, but all important processes are already completed. They were controlled by Banco de España, which has strongly supported all operations."
At a breakfast organized by the Association of Managing Directors and Managers of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta stated that the process of concentration "was completed as quickly as possible and that we must be satisfied with the timely process that was established in earlier times, not now, as part of the business plans with Banco de España", he emphasized.
"The transition from 45 savings banks with an average of 28,000 million assets to 17 with 75,500 million each is a historically unparalleled process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62 percent and they are now much larger, which we have fulfilled the Basel Agreement," he emphasized.
Olavarrieta stated that "there would be a number of unanswered opinions about the slowness of the process that revealed untrustworthiness and nonsense" because "Banco de España exhorts us to close by the end of the year."
The Director General of CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain has one of the most rigorous financing systems in Europe and "perhaps" the whole world and added that those who doubt this would do so "without deeper knowledge".
The manager noted that in the current economic situation, we do not have to worry about the situation of financial institutions and savings banks, which have undergone a "very significant" concentration process, which will be carried out "as soon as possible".
He also recalled that Spanish banks passed the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July very well.
Zapatero and the Red Line of Germany
Berlin has opted for the retention of the euro, but at the same time set conditions for the entire European Union.
Tensions in the markets have triggered a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has proposed new adjustment measures, ranging from tax reductions for small and micro-enterprises, the regulation of temporary employment companies or the cancellation of the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>426 support for the unemployed who do not receive unemployment benefits, to the privatization of 49 percent of AENA, the administration of the airports of Barajas and El Prat, and 30 percent of the state lottery.
On the other hand, with the help of former Prime Minister Felipe González, the deputy head of government, Elena Salgado, supports the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as the person responsible for evoking the current crisis.
How are these processes to be understood?
It should be foreseen that Merkel’s position is not a mistake in her public relations work.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
In doing so, Germany is taking on a fundamentally new perspective for shaping our future, which conflicts with the maintenance of the traditional traditions of most of its partners.
Given the resistance in Europe, Germany is starting to speculate on three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first: a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the South would have to leave the euro area.
The second: the reintroduction of the German mark - although this currently sounds more like science fiction - supported by a large part of the public opinion, about 50 percent of the population.
The third: a restructuring of the euro in line with German proposals. This means: more macroeconomic control; strict financial management; punishing the countries that violate the requirements; possibly the cessation of payments by some countries and the expansion of the costs of potential adaptation measures to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been emerging for some time, so there are no excuses now.
First in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission created incentives for deficits and the German government pulled a constitutional reform out of its sleeve to prevent this from happening in 2016.
This was the first sign of the divergence between what Germany considered necessary (strict tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second sign was the Central European country, when Merkel painfully postponed the decision to save Greece.
At the time, this was heavily criticised, but the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and the public opinion were absolutely against a rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel came out with a clear position, calling for a reform of the European Union agreements in order to enable the rescue of a country while at the same time obliging private lenders to bear part of the costs.
This position was interpreted as anti-European as it pushed forward the Irish crisis and everything that followed.
In the coming months, we will be participating in the reform of the European Union, which will allow these measures to take effect from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not intend to cross.
It tells everyone that, even if unpopular measures have to be taken now, the old way of working of the euro will no longer exist from this date.
2013 will be the year of the birth of a new monetary area, in which the infringing countries may be severely punished, forced to declare themselves insolvent and, in this case, the private sector will have to bear some of the costs.
Germany shows us that we have to pursue a tough growth course, with high savings and investment rates, moderation of consumption, improved productivity and competitiveness, and positive external balances.
The other alternative, which is based on debt and construction with huge gaps in the balance of payments, as was mentioned by Spain in boom times, will simply not be accepted.
The offer is clear.
And we would be bad at not understanding it.
It is not just about reducing the government deficit to 3% by 2013.
The demands are much harder.
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions is cheat ourselves.
I hope that the current turmoil will pass into more calm.
And that we will take advantage of the opportunities offered to us by spring 2013.
It seems that Zapatero understood this, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the big companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures yesterday) indicates that despite the criticism of Merkel, the hypothesis of creating order in its own house has made its way.
But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it doesn’t look like it would change anything.
Among the options considered is the fact that we would have to leave the euro area, which is filled with few serious countries.
In this case, Germany could still tell us that it had warned us.
Sport and rule circumvention
Tricks like those of Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show ingenuity, but not the will to circumvent a sanction.
The alleged exclusion of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the November 23 match against the Ajax in the Champions League resulted in a lot of ink being shed on whether or not it was an anti-sporting act and whether both players should possibly be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is well known, the two players lost time a few minutes before the end of the game (their team had already clearly won) and played several fouls so that the referee showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since Real Madrid would lead his group, the two players will fulfill the prescribed penalty at the next league match against the Auxerre and thus enter the next game phase without cards.
Finally, UEFA's disciplinary committee punished the club's coach, José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different amounts of money.
Provoking a yellow card under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos – the unwritten but followed rules in this sport.
Part of the emerging debate around the presented case stems from a team of Real Madrid football club (who in his anthem professed generosity and honor and on other occasions had punished his players for similar incidents) playing the leading role, and from the dramatization by Mourinho, who added one episode more to his long history as a theatrical and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this practice, which is not expressly prohibited by the statutes, is contrary to the principles of sport, i.e. whether these acts constitute an circumvention of rules. In fact, this practice adheres to the statutes of sport, but seems to circumvent its meaning.
In this matter, the damage caused to the sports spirit should be investigated.
The sporting spirit defends the physical integrity of the opponents, an aspect that was not endangered by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to prevent the offending players from taking an unjustified advantage from the opposing team. Neither did that.
The paradox of the action of the Real Madrid players is that it does not correspond to what we usually understand by cheating or circumvention, because the rule was not secretly circumvented to avoid a sanction, but it should be as striking as possible so that it will be punished by the referee.
The players waited and gladly accepted the sanction.
Another question is what kind of advantage the offenders got from the deliberate fouls.
It should be noted here that the rival was neither put in a less favourable position nor demanded advantages for the game played, because the obvious result of this action was that the own team had to continue playing with fewer players.
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club does not have these players.
The advantage is obviously that players start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But this is a long-term advantage, to a certain extent uncertain, as the team could also be eliminated at some point, and players will also receive a sanction and move into the second card cycle, where they will be eliminated less than in the first cycle because of card accumulation with one card.
It is not clear whether this is really an advantage.
Ultimately, such practices are not against the sporting spirit, which also includes strategic decisions in order to get the most out of the regulations.
In this case, players didn’t want to circumvent a sanction (this would actually be a clear case of rule circumvention), they were more likely to choose when to undergo it.
They made a strategic decision without avoiding or escaping from punishment.
Although the boundary between inventiveness and regulatory environment is blurred, I believe this matter is a clear case of inventiveness.
I have the impression that the polemic came about as a result of two factors: because it was about two self-exclusions and because of the nature of the provoked rule transfer.
The harm inflicted on the principles of sport by these acts is less ethical than aesthetic.
Offer offensive to catch customers for group Christmas dinners in Barcelona
The dictatorship of the calendar drops this year an avalanche of reservations on the days 16 and 17 December.
The celebrations paid by employees themselves are spreading. They do not want to spend more than 20 to 30 euros.
Like the Turrón and the Christmas lottery, there are also group dinners in the pre-Christmas season, which provide oxygen to the restaurant and leisure industry of Barcelona. But as a result of the economic crisis, they trigger a price offensive to capture also the customer segment, which represents the large crowd: Almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros for a lunch or dinner.
To make accounting even more complicated, the calendar (New Year's Eve falls on a Friday) dropped all orders in the week of December 13, resulting in an avalanche of reservations of dinners to two peak days (the 16th and 17th) and almost no orders in the week before.
Since 2008, when the bad times started, many companies have discontinued group dinners for household reasons.
In order not to have to renounce this tradition, many employees pay it out of their own pocket.
Whatever the economic situation, lowest prices are being demanded, confirms the chairman of the Barcelona restaurant board, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the umbrella association so far does not dare to predict what the holidays will look like this month.
“People think about it ten times before making a reservation.”
"They like to go out, but they pay a lot of attention to prices," he emphasizes.
The business will go well with those who "offer quality at good prices with good service," he adds, and reminds us that customers save in times of crisis, which is why prices around 25 euros are the most in demand.
A survey in several centrally located restaurants shows that the evening of 17 December leads the providers to collapse.
The group Soteras says that demands for this Friday with the intention of spending less than 30 euros would boom. The group has adapted its menus with complete offers between 25 and 35 euros to the economic situation.
With another leading group, Andilana, which has 16 restaurants in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to early reservations, even from the beginning of November.
"We have made the impossible possible to maintain the previous year's prices with menus for every taste from 19.95 to 30 euros," he explains.
At AN Grup, which runs El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 venues, one does not lose optimism after revenues have flourished again since the second quarter and good, albeit focused on a few days, prospects for the Christmas business are expected.
Sources from the group point out that the 18th will also be an overactive day with friends groups celebrating Christmas.
In addition to the six group menus, a Christmas menu for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 or more was added as a price hit, giving the impression that customers are willing to spend 10 percent more than in the previous year and in return want more details, such as cava.
Some companies also see green sprouts sprouting, which is why the employees are invited again. This gives the impression that the group meals are on the rise again.
On the part of the umbrella association Fecasarm (with associations such as the Bar, Restaurant and Leisure Association of Barcelona), Deputy Chairman Enric Gomà relies on it to see the end of the tunnel and notes that the reservations overall are quite "lively", even though customers "choke out a maximum".
The fun of celebrating, however, did not decrease, no matter who pays.
Pakistan’s nuclear program raises concerns in the US
Islamabad says nuclear weapons are “faster than any other country”
WikiLeaks reveals ties between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the North American Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. State Department, revealed by the Wikileaks internet portal, confirms the enormous concerns the Pakistani nuclear program in Washington is causing.
On the fringe of the clarifying and juicy details provided by the documents on the content of the talks and the mindset of the accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad, these reveal that cooperation between the two countries in terms of nuclear security is not being strengthened, but, on the contrary, "decreased", and that the unstable Asian country is producing more nuclear weapons "to a faster rhythm than any other country."
In particular, the peculiarity of the Pakistani nuclear program – that the weapons are not assembled, but their individual parts are stored to make it more difficult to destroy in the event of a possible attack – prepares Washington for sleepless nights.
The Ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, cited the risks in a report before the visit of the former head of the National Security Council, James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to the area attacked by the Taliban, the presumed dispersion of nuclear material and the vulnerability of transport of nuclear material".
The large number of people involved in the nuclear arsenals and missile programs is no longer seen by the US, but also by Russia, as a cause for caution.
"Pakistan must hire strictly faithful personnel to guard the nuclear facilities; because of the low level of education and culture, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recluse people working on nuclear or missile programs," said Yuri Korolev, an expert at the Russian Foreign Ministry, in a meeting with his North American counterparts.
New to the documentation revealed by Julian Assange’s internet portal is that the US-Pakistan cooperation on nuclear proliferation is diminishing and the increased pace at which Pakistan produces nuclear weapons.
In May, an embassy office, describing communication with Pakistan as "frustrating," declared: "There is often no transparency; we do not receive responses to aid or they are rejected."
In another statement, Peter Lavoy, a South Asian state intelligence official, confirms that "despite the economic disaster, Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons as fast as no other country."
Ambassador Patterson asks Washington, during a visit by the Chief of the Army, General Ashfaq Kayani, to “clarify” to the person in charge that “Pakistan’s army has to stop its tacit over-support of terrorist groups.”
Hunting for Wikileaks Chief
Obama appoints a senior anti-terrorism fighter to prevent new revelations.
Interpol issued a red warning on the persecution and discovery of Assange.
Everything related to Wikileaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth in which the facts are difficult to clarify.
Yesterday, Interpol issued a “red warning” to “find and persecute” Assange.
However, this is not a traditional order for arrest.
It’s not new, it’s dated November 20th.
It also has nothing to do with the recent unveiling of over four million U.S. diplomatic documents, but with the accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden.
WikiLeaks founder Mark Stephens said the police would know where and how to contact Mr. Assange.
Already on the 20th, the international police agency based in Lyon, France, issued the order at the request of Sweden, but it was not disclosed until yesterday after receiving the authority by the Swedish authorities.
The 188 Interpol countries are instructed to identify and locate Assange “to arrest and extradite him provisionally.”
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red warning, many member states, according to the organization, consider the red warning to be a freeze for an arrest — which must be carried out by the national police — especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case of Sweden and England, where Assange is likely to be staying.
The action outraged Assange’s lawyers, who yesterday published a letter informing them that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks is ready to answer questions from the Swedish authorities via videoconference.
They also recall that Assange requested to leave Sweden and received the appropriate approval from the prosecutor, who is compared to Stalin’s legendary security chief Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria.
"This is like a hunt, not a legal prosecution," the letter says.
While the world is looking for him - and his mother from Australia claims her son's innocence - Assange is staying in an unknown place, but not silent.
On Monday, he gave an interview to the head of Time magazine via Skype from an indefinite location, during which he requested the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be proved that she was responsible for ordering North American diplomats to spy on the UN and thus violated international agreements signed by the US, she would have to resign," he said.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who described the request for resignation as "ridiculous and absurd."
"I'm not sure why we should value the opinion of a guy with a website," he told CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a senior anti-terrorism fighter, Rusell Travers, to prevent new document disclosures.
President Barack Obama’s attempt to pay less attention to Assange is contrary to the opinions that conservative politicians and commentators have expressed these days.
Congressman Peter King, who will chair the National Security Committee of the House of Deputies from January, has called on the State Department to investigate the possibility of putting Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations "to seize their funds and prosecute anyone who supports them or makes a contribution."
Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, had gone even further, and he had to revoke his statement that Assange had to be "murdered."
"Obama would have to turn it into a target and use an unmanned plane or something."
Those who did not apologize were Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and potential presidential candidate.
"Anyone who has leaked information in the government is guilty of treason and anything that is not an execution is a too mild punishment," he told Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in the ERC with a wink to the Carod Closers
The Republican leader allows the party a secret vote on its continued existence in office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralist government and the end of the Assembly principle.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe for the tenth time to avoid an internal uproar in the ranks of the ERC after the loss of 11 MPs and half of the votes.
The party leader is aware that his threat of resignation is insufficient for the relatives of former party leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of this sector today is as weakened as its mentor himself and will not give him the same headache as other former currents.
That is why the leader of Esquerra tries to win the new critics with a wink, which would secure his position until the next municipal elections.
To begin with, yesterday announced that the ERC’s more than 200 regional councillors could speak out in secret about his stay in office.
With ballots, not with a raised hand.
If the carodists wanted to give the president a ticket, they could do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid both the impression of division and the impression of submission to his person.
In several interviews, he affirmed that he would feel unconfirmed with half the votes plus one, and he added that without specifying percentages, a result "in the Bulgarian style" would also not be good.
The Carod supporters demand more from the president than just to make his office available to the party, an insufficient gesture as Puigcercós controls the supreme organ of Congress.
But as they do not have a sufficient majority to accelerate resignations, they will agree with the Board of Directors on a plan of action from now until May.
For this purpose, they expect to be able to participate in the preparation of the document on strategic reorientation, which the management will submit to the vote of the Council on the 18th.
Their intention is to guarantor Puigcercós, who in return promises to move Congress forward to the autumn of 2011, which the party’s leadership already considers a fact.
The party leader of the ERC believes that the "polyphony" damages stability and he strives once and for all to enable the organization to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article signed by the acting conseller Josep Huguet in his blog is symptomatic.
Given that Puigcercós is an ideologist, the owner of Innovació considered it a fact that the party leader was supported "in exchange for different goals".
He listed five, two of which are in the foreground.
First, the "restructuring" of the board so that it represents at least 90 percent of the party members, that is, the inclusion of new faces from Carod's environment.
The second one could be the big news.
Huguet suggests that the ERC should finally abandon the principle of the plenary as a way of functioning.
In doing so, he advocates a reform of the statutes, which should allow the congresses to be held with elected delegates.
Puigcercós's team, which has been fighting for it at the last two congresses, is obsessed with ending the assembly model - an exception in the Spanish party system.
In fact, at the 2008 quake assembly, the party leadership was tasked with reviewing the principle of the Assembly at a congress that was to deal with the reform of the statutes.
This deadline is still pending, as infogle's internal rest of recent years has not been advisable to tackle this matter.
Now, without the critical sectors on the lookout, the time may have come to take up this matter again and close it forever.
23 murders in November, 290 in 2010
According to the MILENIO census, there were four fewer cases in Mexico than in 2010.
In November, 23 people were murdered in Mexico, according to the counts of MILENIO México, that is four less than in the previous month.
Among the murdered are three women and the discovery of two amputated bodies in the valley of Mexico.
In the penultimate month of the year, we have a total of 390 deaths, which are probably related to organized crime.
Among the cases, one stands out in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, a place in Toluca.
The subject had at least three firearm-induced shots, the grace shot was given to his head and feet and hands were tied with a cable.
The next day, the body of a person was found in the trunk of a vehicle parked on the road Mixtecas in the settlement of Santa Cruz Acatlán of the municipality of Naucalpan.
On Thursday, 4th, early in the morning, agricultural workers found a body with traces of torture and at least three deadly shots in the chest on the Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal highway on the section that crosses the village of Villa Guerrero.
Next to the body was found a message probably signed by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
A day later, a 50-year-old man was murdered with eight shots after leaving his home to do his job as a garbage driver.
On November 7, two 30-year-olds died in the head as a result of bullets in the settlement of San Pedro Xaloxtoc in the village of Ecatepec.
In Chalcro, the body of a man with a gunshot in the forehead was found on a lonely path in the settlement of El Naranjo and under the body a cartridge sleeve shot down with a firearm of the caliber.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were discovered in the sewer of the settlement of Playa Golondrina.
The emergency service searched for the remaining parts of the body, but did not find them.
Residents of Tepotzotlán notified of the discovery of a body they had discovered in the area of Peña Colorada. The hands were tied back and the head was tied.
The man had a wound that stemmed from the shot of a firearm in the neck.
In the middle of the month, it was reported that two men were murdered, wrapped in blankets and found in the trunk of a vehicle parked on the streets of Villas de la Hacienda in the municipality of Tizapán de Zaragoza, and two death threats were found in addition to the victims.
A day later, a human head was found in a cardboard box in the settlement of Valle de los Reyes in the village of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby settlement, the remaining body was found in a black plastic bag with a message signed by El Incorregible.
On the 17th, two dead women wrapped in blankets were discovered in the settlement of Zoquiapan in the municipality of Ixtapaluca, and the next morning, in Huixquilucan, the body of a man wrapped in a yellow-blue blanket, who, according to the news left by his murderers next to him, was probably named Mario Ríos, was found in Huixquilucan.
In the San Francisco Acuautla settlement of Ixtapaluca, the lifeless body of a woman was found with shots of firearms in the neck.
On the skin of the woman, tattoos of Santa Muerte as well as necklaces with corresponding illustrations were discovered.
In the last half of the month, the body of a man with at least three shots and a message signed by a criminal group was found in the municipality of Zinacantepec next to a vehicle.
Two days later, the bodies of two men, whose heads were covered with tape, and a message were discovered in the municipality of Puente de Piedra in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the body was a message, presumably signed by a criminal organization, that said, "This is happening to those who don't participate."
In Ecatepec, two bodies tied to hands and feet with traces of torture were found inside a taxi parked behind the judicial center of the San Agustín settlement.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were discovered in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl.
The first had been beheaded in the settlement of Cuchilla Ancón and enclosed in black plastic bags, alongside a message. The second had been tortured and was found in the streets of the settlement of Juárez in a plastic bag.
Next to him, the police found a cardboard with a message.
China maintains its greenhouse gas reduction targets
China’s representative stated at COP16 that its country has made tremendous efforts to reduce carbon footprints and it would maintain its offer to cut 40 to 45 percent of its greenhouse gases by 2020.
China is keeping its offer to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, Su Wei, the country’s representative at COP16, assures.
At his first public appearance at the United Nations’ 16th World Climate Summit (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country had made tremendous efforts to reduce carbon footprints and convert its industry.
He stated that over the past four years, his country has invested $245 million to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
On the other hand, he stated that China would not change its goals, but would work with the international community on this matter.
He explained that China’s climate change strategy is divided into four aspects: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and support for pilot programmes.
Progress has been made in all aspects, including the adoption last year of a new energy law that includes targets for reducing emissions of gases, he said.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, the state authorities had worked with those of the central government and the municipalities to achieve the goals of energy saving, effective use of energy and reduction of emissions.
In addition, he pointed out that several multi-year plans have already been undertaken or completed, both those funded by the Chinese government and those receiving funds from other countries.
For example, he referred to the Effective Use of Energy Program, which was introduced over the last five years and had received investment from the United Nations (UN), the government and private hands.
There is also a provincial-level project on climate change, another to replace traditional light bulbs with energy-saving bulbs, and another on mitigation and adaptation, he explained.
Martin Krol, the country’s climate change scientific government advisor, confirmed that China’s efforts are far greater than is commonly believed.
He pointed out that per capita emissions of greenhouse gases in China amount to six tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons. China is responsible for a 9% total contribution to pollution.
The energy efficiency has been increased by 20 percent over the last five years and is expected to be increased by 2020, he said.
Legal exclusion Espinos: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN declared that the former Panist Party leader had the right to appeal to the National Order Commission and demand what the right granted him.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was right and that the former party leader of the PAN had the right to contact the National Order Commission and demand what the right granted him.
In an interview that took place prior to the appeal of Gabino Cué Monteagudo as governor of the state, he stated that the exclusion of Espino was a decision made at the local level.
"This is an independent decision by the Sonora Ordinance Commission."
"Mr. Espino has the right to appeal to the Comisión de Orden del Consejo Nacional in his case, so that a decision is taken by a competent authority," he added.
On the other hand, he explained, it was not time to think about 2012 and that an alliance for presidential candidates had never sat at the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that Acción Nacional emerged strengthened from the internal vote on December 4 and 5, in which his successor is elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is a topic that has never been on the negotiating table, at least not so far. It was a proposal for the municipal election, it was successful and fulfilled its purpose," he said.
The Panist leader explained that the PAN looks back on 71 years of dialogue, therefore “we are not frightened by internal competition; on the contrary, “we enjoy it and it strengthens us,” he commented.
He said that the Council would undoubtedly elect the best president that Acción Nacional would need for the next three years, so he would hand over the staff to "those whom the Council would determine."
"I would be proud to give each of the five the chairmanship of the party."
He predicted that the party's upswing in the last July 4 elections will be reflected in the next elections, although "it's not time to think about 2012."
"Now it is about supporting Governor Gabino Cué in his task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments that emerged from alliances between Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa are carrying the flag and being observed throughout the country, therefore "many hopes and aspirations are placed in them and I am sure that Gabino is at the level of demands."
When questioned about the PRI’s criticism of President Felipe Calderón for his disc price during his four-year reign, César Nava called on PRI supporters to reflect on the six-year period of former Presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón, they should start defending them, they should finally come out of the closet," he affirmed.
He believes that the owner of the federal government could use expressions like those he uses in his speech at the Auditorio Nacional, because there would be no oral ban and even less censorship in this country.
Obama advocates law on Twitter for undocumented students
“If you’re in favor of passing the Dream Act law, call on your senators and push for it to pass,” the president tweeted.
President Barack Obama today supported the nationwide mobilization in support of the Dream Act - law to legalize undocumented students with a message on his personal blog on the social network Twitter.
“If you’re in favor of passing the Dream Act law, call on your senators and push for it to pass,” Obama tweeted.
His short message contains a cyberlink to a more extensive document, which calls on the public to contact their senators, as the vote on the law is imminent.
“With your voice we’re waiting for, it’s time to listen to you,” he said.
The news spread after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block all votes for any law, except the expansion of tax cuts from the Bush era and government funding would be expanded.
Such a blockade, announced on a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could have an impact on voting the Dream Act law and other projects such as ratifying the new START agreement with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned about the Republicans’ blockade of the Dream Act and other projects, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said he trusts that once the tax issue is resolved, a schedule for the rest of the projects can be drawn up.
"I think we still have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that the tax issue must be settled before the end of the year..."
"I believe we can make an agreement on this at any time and after that we can plan the course of the rest," he said.
Senate Democratic Majority Chairman Harry Reid announced Tuesday that "he would request the vote at the end of the debate" so that the Dream Act law, which would allow the initiative to legalize undocumented students to be voted on in the Senate starting next Thursday, would be more likely next week.
The version of the Dream Act law would legalize about 800,000 young people who immigrated to the United States when they were under sixteen years old, have lived in that country for the last five years and are enrolled in a higher education institution or the army.
But the advocates of the law need sixty votes to pass the initiative, which is why they rely on the votes of a handful of Republicans. Currently, the organizations of the advocates of this project are organizing an intense influence on the adoption of the law.
The Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, one of them, Senator Ben Nelson from Nebraska, said he would vote against and only a Republican, Richard Lugar from Indiana, has announced his support for the law.
Therefore, the defenders of the Dream Act must get several Republicans on their side if other Democrats decide to turn their backs on the initiative.
Among the most courted Republicans are those from Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as Senator George Lemieux from Florida, who took over the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past include Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but they stated they would no longer support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who voted in favour of the law, John McCain, has not yet determined his stance.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act faces the biggest obstacles in the Senate.
Put your finger in the wound with literature
The second round of 'Die Lust an der Sprache' was a walk where the participants stood up for the narrative
"I understand sex in the language, yes, but... The finger in the wound? What is expected of me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela, who was to open the second round of 'Los lugares de la lengua', a cycle that celebrated Spanish-language literature and on that occasion used the subtitle of her question (at another event the round table was dedicated to sex in the language, she explained).
The finger in the wound... "brings us into trouble," the Argentine writer sweetly spat at the audience, which was mainly composed of young people who came together at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to attend this round table moderated by Marisol Shultz, to which Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Garcro Montera participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, and then labeled Shultz as a great narrative. Luisa tells in the first person and is the protagonist who is looking to learn what a "wound" is, and goes from doctor to doctor, of which she does not get an answer, but gets clues for the guide of her narrative.
She leaves the infectologist convinced: "Patience is not my strength, maybe that's my wound."
Finally, after a frustrating approach to the traumatologist, who took her breath away in the middle of the corridor, but who explains to her that wound is not a scientific term, the psychoanalyst reveals the secret: "the wound is the truly open, the symbolic is the scar."
The main character of the narrative sighs relieved and concludes that she "simply learned from the wound that it really is open and does not exist", but she is convinced that the lust for language and its traps are intertwined.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also introduced a delightful narrative, which he called "praise of the invention," and in which the finger in the wound is not mentioned, but is discovered.
With allusions to magical realism, he tells of a famous wizard who touched the clouds, brought back far-traveled men or restored the virtue lost by a girl. The narrative turned around and told about America, the great novel that was not lacking in its own chroniclers from the beginning, and he quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who tells the abundance of the
"Cervantes, who invited us all [the writers], mocked the fake witnesses who appeared in the stories portrayed as true, but otherwise the history of America would never have been told - with imagination, which even lost the sense of shame."
However, he emphasizes that "it is the madmen and liars who best imagine things", and there reality and lie approach each other, where one no longer knows to which side the narrative belongs, where fictional literature reaches the summit.
He actually calls it the “Cervantes tradition.”
"We inherited from him to be what is being told."
When it was Mayra Montero’s turn, the author commented and praised the variety of interpretations to which the FIl’s invitation to the Round Table ‘The Finger in the Wound’ had contributed.
The Cuban and Puerto Rican consecrated her contribution to the great wound of social violence that afflicts her country – as well as all of Latin America – as a result of the struggles for drug trafficking.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit, unintentionally planned commitment," she explained after highlighting that literature is communication and commitment that builds up between the author and the readers as if in a "chemical reaction."
The evening was concluded by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose contribution also highlighted "this finger of the committed writer in the writer's wound".
He noted that in a fast-paced world, intellectual habits and control of consciousness also result in dogmatisms, and forgets that "behind every affirmation there is a little no and behind every denial there is a little yes."
"To be in possession of our thoughts and reality, we must nuance: and nuance often means to put your finger in the wound and harass those who feel much more comfortable when they think in the form of cartoons, in black and white, in prefabricated ideas without nuances, and also to harass the powerful who prefer to lighten the world in black and white.
Romano fights for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano can look back on three defeats in the finals, he has experienced ups and downs in his career, but he played decisive games three times.
The duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final also confronts two different styles predetermined by their respective coaches, and their encounter marked by contrasts is reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in the finals, he has experienced ups and downs in his career, but he has had decisive matches three times, and so far he has kept up well, which is why this opportunity is of particular importance to him.
The Argentine has become the second champion with the medal, he is one step behind the winners and, surprisingly, he has played consecutive finals with the same team.
The Santi strategist reached the first final as a coach at the 'Torneo Apertura 2002', when del Morelia had the reins in his hand, with which he suffered a big defeat against Toluca by 4-2; later, in the 'Clausura 2003' he reached the decisive duel, which he also lost by 3-1 against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna on the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010' where they played against Los Diablos, Rubén had to put in a setback again, as the game went out with 2-2 against Los Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the penalty he came forward with 3-1 and got two ways to put in his title, but ultimately three of his players missed the game to four.
Rubén had already lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his great rival, so he doesn’t want to be chased again by misfortune and get rid of the evil spell to celebrate a title for the first time, although he affirms that for him the most important thing is the game itself.
"I want to be a champion, I don't want to break statistics, that's for a club, for my affection, and that's why the title will come to me, but what happens before is the most important thing," he said.
The final final is still strong in his memory, he assures to have learned a lot from it: "The only lesson we can draw from it is that until the referee whistles the end, we can't celebrate, we're on the line ready, the players too, because the last time we were already prepared with two penalties, and I believe that's a lesson to be learned until the game doesn't end."
Knowing that this series could be decided by penalty shootouts does not bother him, because he trusts his players: "You never want to arrive at penalty shootouts, you want to finish in the regular season, but sometimes there is no alternative and you have to be prepared for it, in the previous tour we were prepared, but unfortunately, fate has already prepared us a bad game, sometimes as a result of nervousness or the best of the game, we are going to finish the game."
It is in Romanso’s power to no longer be a second champion and to taste the fame that the titles bring with them for the first time.
The U.S. changes the rules for obtaining a visa
The persons must present themselves to the consulate before their interview with the visa application services; costs will be reduced waiting times.
As of January 10, 2011, the procedures for applying for a visa in the United States Embassy and Consulates will change.
In the new procedure, most applicants must present themselves in the consulate to the visa application services (ASC, the initial letters in English) before their interview.
The staff of the ASC records the biometric data of the applicant, which is checked by the consulate before the interview.
The new procedure has certain advantages for the aspirants, including:
The total cost of processing the visa decreases, because it is no longer necessary to pay the appointment, the processing of the visa application and the transport service with which the document is handed out separately.
The applicant makes only one payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the counter value is $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visas with application (including visas for temporary workers) and $390 for dealers and investors.
Those who only want to extend their visa do not have to have a conversation in the consulate, they only have to present themselves at the nearest ASC, where they present their documents and their fingerprints are taken.
Since the biometric data is collected in the ASC, applicants who need a second appointment for the interview in the consulate will remain there less time than before.
Those who apply for the visa in the consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo no longer have to pay the service surcharge of $ 26.
Additional information on the new visa application procedure can be found on the following website: http://mexico.usembassy.gov/boletines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA announces discovery of extraterrestrial life
The North American Space Agency called a press conference tomorrow to present a finding that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The United States National Aerospace Agency (NASA) will announce an astrobiological discovery tomorrow, Thursday, that could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented tomorrow at 1 p.m. at a press conference at NASA’s Washington headquarters by astrobiologists, a science that explores the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the universe.
When the press conference was convened, NASA assured that it would present “a supervisory fund for the search for extraterrestrial life,” which sparked speculation among experts from other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that human-like creatures could exist in hostile environments previously thought uninhabitable, and it has been hypothesized that they could turn into intelligent creatures, just like humans, if their living conditions improved.
Apparently, it is a microbe found at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, living in an environment that was thought to be too toxic for all life forms because the lake is highly arsenic-containing.
In some way, the microbie uses arsenic as a resource for survival, and considering this ability, the chances of similar life on other planets that do not have our protective atmosphere increase.
When these organisms metabolize arsenic, according to the astrobiologists, it is proven that "there is actually another form of life, a second form of life, different from the one we know."
The space agency will announce the actual reach of its find at the press conference tomorrow, Thursday.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who is studying the possibility of life on Mars, and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who is studying Titan (Saturn’s largest moon) under the question of whether its chemical composition is similar to that of Earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patrón form an opposition bloc
With the reform of the Organ Act on Congress, the two-party system will be introduced, they complain.
The 60th legislature had just begun, and an opposition bloc, led by the deputies of the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who presented itself as an independent, had already installed itself. The four questioned the entry of the 'two-party system' into the Chamber.
Prior to the opening session of the 60th legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD and Patrón Montalvo protested against the reform of the organ law, which would exclude them.
With this reform, they repeated, a “two-party system” would be introduced, because now it would be two persons, the same number as parties that controlled Congress.
These four deputies, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones to vote against the presidency led by the panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca in his capacity as deputy chairman.
Corvera Quevedo explained that the PRI and PAN parties had introduced their political margins institutionally with these reforms.
He explained that in the next few days they would talk to the PAN and PRI representatives to change the scheme, based on their political will, and if they did not, they would be again subjugated by both parties, putting an end to the opposition coalition.
"Until here I come (the opposition coalition), that is what I see, because we are excluded from all decisions, who do not even take into account the opinions of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia stated that there were agreements with PRD, PT and Patrón and that therefore a pluralist group would be formed.
It cannot be allowed, he continued, that Congress, having been monopolistic, should now be “duopolistic.”
"It is not the spirit of law reform that an eternal bipartisan system should prevail in Congress."
"For starters, this group starts with five MEPs and they are talking to other colleagues so that they can become more," the Convergencia member said.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, alluding to PAN and PRI, explained that Congress has now turned into a 'loot' for two.
“It used to be just one party, now they’re splitting it up to two.”
Patrón Montalvo requested that the deputies be respected and assigned their place at the negotiating tables.
"The five, which are currently seen as split into different political groups, have decided to unite to take our place at the negotiating table, because because of the reform implemented and agreed by the others, we have remained outside and we do not agree with this reform."
200 000 pesos more for "the supplier"
The municipality of Mazatlán is paying another cheque to the disputed owner of the company for electrical material.
Another check of just over 200,000 pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the city council.
This means that the sum paid to the owner of the company for electrical material in the second half of the year is 1,200,000 pesos.
According to the page for greater transparency of the city administration, this cheque with the number 9258447 was issued at a sum of 200.144.56 pesos on the 16th of November with the purpose of "invoicing open invoices".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had already announced that more money would go from the municipality to this supplier. She is being watched by the Auditorio Superior del Estado for selling at excessive prices.
What has not been mentioned is the total amount still owed to her and, consequently, the number of cheques still issued in favor of Camacho Palazuelos.
"Nothing was bought from her, it's just paying the debt, just like the other suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: September 24, two of October 15, October 19, October 29, and this last of November 16.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal, as required by law, when a company is challenged by the ASE in order to avoid other administrations requesting its services, the Treasurer assured that their services would not be reused.
After the Noroeste newspaper published on July 25 the review of the checks issued by the municipality to its suppliers, it became known that from March 2008 to July 9, 2010, during the three-year term of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the municipality had paid more than 10 million pesos with 42 checks to Camacho Palazuelos.
There were also shops with Jumapam, where she collected checks worth over 3 million pesos.
Tourist sites need to be improved
Tourist companies regret the accident of the foreign tourist as a result of the poor condition of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in the burglary of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the tourism industry of Mazatlán applied to the authorities to pay special attention to the areas that are in poor condition and cast a bad picture on the port city.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, chairman of the trade association of the Zona Dorada, recalled that on various occasions it was called upon to maintain the destination and to transform the poor conditions found by tourists into new employment opportunities or routes.
He said the poor condition of the streets and sidewalks had a negative effect as tourists came to stroll and saw the disorder, after which they would turn their backs on nearby shops.
"The politicians don't know what it means to have to close a business one day and they don't worry about how much money you lose, because otherwise they wouldn't do the construction work slowly and unplanned."
Hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the fall of the tourist had drawn attention to the lack of prevention and the lack of maintenance work on the part of the city.
"The community has to take on its responsibility and avoid that such a thing happens again. How should it do that? Well, by means of preventive maintenance instead of fixing everything in retrospect," he explained.
"We are longing to have a clean city. Because not only because it is a tourist area, it must be maintained, but also we residents have a right to a clean habitat. The city administration must change its strategy to keep the city in good condition."
"There are other places that also look unkempt and unfinished," he said, "for example, Mazatlán's Escudo y el Venadito."
"Today, we need more than just advertising to attract tourists, a good product must be offered, a city that keeps its beaches and roads clean, and the tourist attractions constantly on fire," he added.
"These precautions have not been given enough attention and these kinds of incidents expose what is obvious to everyone: maintenance is urgently needed."
Raúl Llera Martínez, sub-secretary of Promoción Turística, expressed the importance of saving the tourist resorts of Mazatlán because they were not being used properly and created a bad picture.
He mentioned a number of places that, along with the city, would have to be brought to the forefront.To make the city clean, tidy and attractive for tourism should be a priority.
"Fortunately, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites that need to be cleaned and cleaned first of all in order to make them attractive to tourists and to bring them to the inventory with which we advertise this destination.
IP demands results from Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, chairman of the CCE, suggested that MEPs should take the great responsibility of setting an example for a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
Mazatlán’s corporate sector demands a worthy parliament, free of collusion between the parties and the government, because Sinaloa is disturbed and faces major problems.
Yesterday, the 60th Parliament was inaugurated. It is composed of seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 of PAN, three of Partido Nueva Alianza, two of PRD, one of PT, one of Convergencia and another of PVEM, making a total of 40 representatives of the people.
The new members of the State Congress are expected to do a clean job, to feel committed to society and the different social groups that rely on responsible parliamentary work, and not to repeat the same patterns of partiality and paternalism.
Eduardo Dávalos, Chairman of the CCE Entrepreneurship Coordination Council, suggested that the new MEPs should take on the great responsibility of setting an example for a better Sinaloa facing many challenges.
"We hope that MEPs really exercise their right to act free of collusion between the parties, because it is common for them to make agreements with which they represent their own interests, thereby transforming themselves into carnival compasses of the rulers and the leaders of parliamentary factions."
He said they should demonstrate their commitment to building the necessary bridges to support the current government.
“We make sure that they do a trustworthy job and that they are above all committed to society and its groups, because it was the residents of Sinaloa who expressed their trust in them in the last elections.”
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, chairman of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, believes that one of the major challenges facing the 40 representatives of the people is to drive and work together for the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is extremely complicated.
"The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, create investment incentives and infrastructure measures, which in some way will encourage job creation."
With regard to the tourism sector, he called on the new Members to give the Ministry of Tourism the necessary place in the state budget in order to promote it.
"I understand that it is the ministry with the second least resources, which is incompatible with an important economic activity that brings foreign exchange and investment to the country and is in direct competition with the agro-industry."
Funds must be allocated to tourist projects, state security must be supported and the alcohol law, which has not been reformulated in previous legislatures, must be updated.
The Holy King is sought
The children of the Coronado Valenzuela family yearn for dolls, cars, bicycles and other toys.
For parents, it will be difficult to fulfill these wishes on the next day of the Trinity, because the household is composed of no more and no less than twelve people and a goat.
Nevertheless, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not give up hope that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar will give them the toys and clothes they so long for.
The family lives in a modest house in the settlement of Salvador Allende. They live from hand to mouth, because the father does not have a permanent job.
"Sometimes hard times are called for because my husband doesn't have a job. But we sell mandarins and potatoes... Already in the afternoon I go out on the streets with the boys for sale," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
The four-year-old Adelaida would like a doll or a bicycle, while her three-year-old sister Isabel would like a Barbie doll.
Ten-year-old José Alfredo has been looking for a ‘monster car’ for some time and for his eight-month-old brother, Jesús, Cayetana proposes one-year-old clothing.
“[José Alfredo] said to me, ‘I’d like this monster so much,’ but I replied to him, ‘Let’s wait, boy,’ because it was very expensive,” Cayetana recalled sadly.
For the older children who were in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
Eleven-year-old María Guadalupe is 12; ten-year-old Isaías is 10, while eight-year-old Miguel is 8.
The 14-year-old José Juan lacks tennis shoes. A pair in the size 5 1/2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you want to help realize the dreams of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family, you can participate in the campaign 'Holy King is sought' by donating a toy or cash in the reception hall of the newspaper Noroeste.
14 suspected drug dealers arrested
On Wednesday, 10 house searches in the Estria region were carried out as part of the dismantling of a cannabis production and sales network.
Fourteen people were arrested and will face various charges.
The house searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, where they were believed to have been mainly drug-producing sites.
"Approximately 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, cash and equipment that served the production have been confiscated," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for the Quebec Security Police.
A total of eleven men and three women were arrested, two of whom are from Sherbrooke.
The suspects appeared hours after their arrest in front of the Sherbrooke courthouse.
They could be accused, among other things, of accusing them of producing cannabis, selling its possessions, plotting and serving crimes.
These house searches were carried out as a result of a lengthy investigation that lasted more than a year.
"The information obtained from the public authorities has enabled us to carry out these arrests," M. Ruel said.
Around 70 police officers from the Estria Regional Investigation Unit of the Quebec Security Police, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Department had participated in this police operation.
Hidden immigration could be easily tracked
The Conservatives’ bill, which the government says will address the problem of ships laden with clandestine immigrants, is likely to be tapped after the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they cannot endorse the proposal.
"I strongly oppose this charter."
"I'm sticking with a party that has put chains on your feet," Liberals chief Michael Ignatieff said after the weekly caucus session ended in front of the assembled MPs.
The Liberals claimed that the bill, which allows any person to be detained for up to a year by a sea-going ship identified as transporting illegal immigrants, violates the Canadian Constitution.
Gilles Duceppe, head of the Bloc Québécois, also indicated that he could not support the bill, as it turned against the wrong target group.
"We are against it and it seems that all opposition parties are against it, so we will wait and see what the government is doing," Duceppe said.
The criticism of the immigration issue by Olivia Chow, NDP, has rejected the critics who demand that her party does not behave steadfastly enough towards the clandestine immigrants.
"The neo-Democrats agree to take action against the blind passengers, and this is what we are trying to do by mediating another draft law, the C-35," Chow said.
We therefore do not endorse the Conservative bill because it seeks to blame the refugees and keeps children captive for at least a year," Chow said.
Immigration Secretary Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties of playing with politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
"The Canadians strongly inform MPs that they do not tolerate this kind of clandestine immigration, these criminal acts that affect Canada and that treat the country like a pedestrian."
"They expect Canada to take tough measures," Kenney's response said.
"The government has not announced any vote of confidence regarding its bill that could have led the country to elections that the government would have rejected.
However, a conservative spokesperson told the QMI agency that the government would convene a vote so that every opposing MP would immediately declare himself to his voters.
The new unit will not find unanimity
Despite the announcement by Jean Charest of the eventual creation of a new standing unit for the fight against corruption and collusion, many observers continue to call for the formation of a public committee of inquiry on this issue.
Public Security Minister Robert Dutil claims that this idea is not from yesterday: Quebec had already consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this issue last January.
The metropolis has had a standing unit against corruption since 1870.
However, Wednesday’s announcement surprised more than just one.
It must be said that this measure was not discussed in the slightest at the meeting of the permanent committee of the Quebec Police Service on 29 October last year, despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
Nor was it lacking that Stéphane Bergeron, critic and member of the Parti Québécois, qualified this announcement in terms of public security as "a rabbit conjured out of the hat" and "a solution crafted at the end of a table".
Minister Dutil, for his part, had addressed those who feared that political power had too much influence on the question of future unity.
“They will see the result when we announce it,” he said.
“You are aware of this problem.”
According to Réjean Parent, the president of the CSQ, nothing can replace the conduct of a public survey.
"The more M. Charest insists on trying to prevent the formation of this committee of inquiry, the more people like you and I think he has something to hide," he said.
"The only way to be able to form a committee of inquiry is to resign Jean Charest," said Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and policy systems at ENA.
In order to get out of this deadlock, he proposes that Quebec be given a special mandate to the audit so that it can conduct appropriate investigations into corruption and secret collusion.
"You should be able to extend the mandate of the audit control," he said.
He also believes that Quebec could grant the same powers as commissioners, which would also allow it to oblige people to testify.
The formation of a standing unit is not the only project in the drawers of the Charest government.
Quebec will also require Ottawa to amend the criminal law in order to be better prepared for this type of crime.
This demand comes from the Chief Prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law in this type of prosecution is not clear.
Vic Toews, Minister of State for Public Security, for his part, confirmed that his Justice colleague, Rob Nicholson, is currently dealing with certain amendments to this dossier.
During Operation Printemps 2001, which affected the groups of motorcycle policemen, 131 people had been arrested, although the criminal law had not been revised.
As a result, Ottawa enforced the law against gangsterism.
Rivers under strict surveillance
Several rivers remain under strict surveillance due to the high rainfall that has been spilling in some regions of the province since Tuesday.
In Shawinigan, in the administrative region of Mauricie, there was a landslide on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses were evacuated preventively.
In the evening, another landslide took place in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in the administrative region of Lanaudiere.
A road has collapsed in itself.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rainfall of 40 to 70 milliliters of rainfall has poured into several regions.
Between 20 to 40 more millimeters of rainfall were expected here according to the regions by Thursday evening.
The areas north of the river and the Outaouais Valley were the most affected.
A total of up to 100 millimeters of rain showers had fallen here.
Since the snow melt, which has already accumulated in certain sub-areas, is to be added to these precipitations, the crossing of several watercourses is feared.
On Wednesday evening, the Quebec security service issued warnings about the flood alert concerning the rivers Ouareau and Achigan in the Lanaudiere region.
The rivers in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentian Mountains and the Chêne in Lotbinière become the object of flood surveillance and remain under observation.
In the Lanaudière region, the heavy rainfall has resulted in the passing of some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, an escape bridge was torn away due to the heavy rains.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In Outaouais, crossing certain lakes has caused the closure of several roads, especially in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The security service remains on alert and closely monitors the situation, according to Security Councillor Annik Bouchard.
The Quebec National Flood Centre, for its part, issued warnings on Wednesday of the sharp rise of several rivers, in particular from Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partially corrected
Quebec broadcaster Stéphane Dupont has suffered a partial setback before the Canadian Broadcasting Standards Supervisory Board (CCNR) because of his controversial statements on social welfare and Haitians as well as because of his outrageous speech via radio.
The CCNR believes that while Mr. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team have the right to express their opinion, certain statements have contained “inaccurate information about social welfare and unjustified negative representations of Haitians, as well as such an unholy speech that is inappropriate to the broadcasts broadcast during the day.”
The Supervisory Board had also concluded that a discussion of suicide involving the distribution of the names of two persons who committed suicide violates the broadcasting code.
The CCNR had received several complaints concerning the comments made during the 2008 and 2010 broadcasts.
The first injunction was filed as a result of a complaint by the Front commun des personnes assistées sociales du Québec.
The activist organization had complained that the amounts mentioned in the broadcast were inaccurate.
Moderators should provide solid information rather than misleading information.
With regard to the topic of suicide, moderator Stéphane Dupont believed that suicide was an expression of cowardice.
The majority of the Supervisory Board members had concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life crises.
"The majority of the Supervisory Board considers that the controversial consequences of the broadcast "Dupont le midi" would have tackled a sensitive issue in a family-friendly and appropriate manner."
Therefore, he was not blamed in any way for his person.
The last issue was the statements related to the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had had a media-effective dispute in this regard, which caused a lot of reactions.
The CHOI moderator had stated that he did not donate to Haiti aid, as it was not known for sure whether the needy would actually receive the money.
The Supervisory Board is of the opinion that these comments were not abusive in nature, but that their cumulative effect presented an unjustified negative representation of the Haitians.
"I have already cancelled my three-day suspension sentence on this matter."
"My file has been virgin for a year and a half," the moderator said.
In all resolutions, the Supervisory Board denounces the dissemination of a ruthless wording.
In all cases, the CHOI-FM broadcaster acted "beyond its obligations".
The consequences for the broadcasting station, which, among other things, was supposed to communicate its decisions once during the main broadcasting period within a period of three days, are minor.
A King of Kung Fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, of Montreal’s Algerian origin, has taken a very special course.
The athlete, who shines in "Sanda" (full contact kung-fu), in kickboxing and in Thai boxing, now rises to the tatami and to the boxing rings of the world in search of new challenges.
“I started martial arts like kung fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria,” said Zemmal, who has been in the metropolis since 2008 to develop among the professionals.
I personally seek the fight everywhere, because for those who do not like the ground fight, as the mixed martial arts present it, competitions in North America are rare."
Recently, working as a security officer and employed by UPS, he had given bad news to his rivals, in which he won two gold medals from the World Karate and the Kickboxing Association (WKA) at the World Amateur Championship held in Edinburgh, Scotland, between 23 and 30 October.
"I have won in the categories of full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing," he said.
"I'm currently preparing for the World Cup at San Shou in China."
"There were those fighters from every category who had placed themselves among the first four at the last World Cup."
"I babe brought bronze in Toronto in 2009."
"I got behind in Vietnam in 2005."
"In 2007, I finished fifth in China, while I finished third in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"It's worth noting that I've made progress in every competition."
"With this rhythm, I will be first this time or next year!"
"San Shou" or "Sanda" are disciplines originating in China, in which punches and foot kicks as well as ground throws are permitted.
The duels usually take place on a platform, less often in a boxing ring.
The most prestigious boxer who emerged from this type of martial arts is the American Vietnamese of origin, Cung Le, who is well known in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal retained only one event in his career, he would certainly call his presence at the Super Tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of Kung-Fu.
"This competition is the highest-ranking and most respected in China," the sympathetic Pfundskerl said.
"It's a bit like the equivalent of Lumpinee Stadium (Thailand's largest stadium)."
“It was a super experience.”
Zemmal had won his first fight in the semi-final of his category (80kg) before losing in the final.
"The one who defeated me was a real professional," he said.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals meet each other in the final of their category."
"Then the winners of each category face off to crown a single champion, the King of Kung Fu."
450 million in contracts without tender
Hydro-Québec has agreed to grant $450 million in contracts for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydropower project to project planning firms.
In the middle of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is a consortium consisting of the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which received the most important share, namely that of the project management, to a sum of 295 million dollars without a tender.
This consortium, called "Énergie Générance", was formed in 2004 as a corollary of the decision of Hydro-Québec, the private sector's responsibility to hand over this important hydroelectric project in the amount of $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium "Énergie Générance" obtained the lucrative contract without a public tender.
For the Parti Québécois, the recourse to corporate consortia is a serious ethical problem, which raises the risk of distortion of competition and a price increase.
"This is a new way of mapping a game and depriving the competition."
"This means that instead of mapped games, instead of secretly, you are now performing games in open form," PQ MP Sylvain Simard said at the press conference yesterday.
In the early morning, Simard had raised the question before the National Assembly, because it seems difficult for him to understand how the public interest can be served in this way.
Resources Minister Nathalie Normandeau had responded in the afternoon by vehemently denying that this contract was a mapped game.
"I remain faithful to my line," she weathered, emphasizing that the PQ had acted "unfairly" and that it "lacked hardship."
She said it was "at least" that the PQ apologized.
The model of the consortium is common practice worldwide.
It is usually a temporary alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their expertise regarding a bid on a bid for a complex project.
The project "Eastmain" has a high level of complexity in terms of its work dimensions.
The construction process is underway and is scheduled to be completed by 2012.
Nevertheless, the contract was awarded without any competition; negotiations had already taken place.
In addition, the model of the consortium in Quebec is no longer an exception, even for relatively simple projects.
As the newspaper "Le Devoir" noted last week, the consortium's model applied in the field of civil engineering and consulting is the subject of government investigations.
A brief overflying of the Quebec business register allows to name more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to be of permanent duration.
In this way, for example, Dessau works in partnership with the majority of its core competitors, including CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin or Roche and Tecsult.
Any link, and there are several dozen of them, leads back to one and the same legal entity, namely Dessau.
As regards the Energy Gérance consortium, Minister Normandeau has stressed that "the territory of the Baie James is subject to a particular labour dynamic and that Hydro-Québec has been paying special attention to this fact since the 1970s".
Réal Laporte, the major employer of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has made a statement that has hurled the nose at the fact that the contract for the project management was approved by agreement.
"If you make a bid and there are few applicants, your prizes will go up fast."
"So you have two options: either you take the people who are on this mart and say to yourself, 'You're going to negotiate a satisfactory deal at a good price.'"
"The idea, however, is that it is not the price that is decisive, but the expertise of the people," Laporte affirmed.
This contract granted to the Energy Gérance consortium is part of a long list of contracts for more than 50,000 dollars received from the Parti Québécois.
The contracts were approved by either Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After review, the newspaper "Le Devoir" counted more than 100 engineering and consulting contracts awarded to companies or their branches, including, in particular, resource laboratories, between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC-Lavalin had obtained 22 contracts, Génivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without including their participation in "Énergie génération".
All these contracts have been negotiated.
They totaled $449,783,344, including the $295,131,564 contract with Énergie Gérance.
Sylvain Simard had stated that the four companies that form the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are well known to the "Parti libéral du Québec".
Minister Normandeau said the PQ was equally connected to the companies it "financed" before clarifying that it was their leaders.
Barometer of Responsible Consumption - The "green" label is not trust-inspiring
Greener, but unmistakably skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has little confidence in the main actors of sustainable growth, but also in the labelled brands or eco-labels that are supposed to control his choice.
It is a pity, although it bathes in a media-active universe where it is plentiful with information in favor of a more responsible consumption: the barometer of responsible consumption has to complain of a lack of credible information, an inadequacy that shows itself as a brake on its commitment, as the first reading, which was held yesterday, showed.
Although they pushed the consumption of so-called socially acceptable products in 2010, the Quebecers still seem to pay little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two-thirds of the Quebec population admit that they do not really believe in the environmental commitment of companies as much as they do in green corporate advertising, according to the ingenious measuring instrument developed by the responsible consumer centre of the University of Sherbrooke.
Another finding: half of consumers doubt the trustworthiness of the official certificates attached to the supposedly fair products, but also the credibility of the products and brands that declare themselves environmentally conscious, according to the barometer.
According to the same pattern, the discourse of politicians on this issue is taken seriously by only 14.6% of the Quebec population.
However, information about responsible consumption seems important for stimulating this consumer segment, which is currently enlivened by almost one-third of Quebec consumers.
In fact, emptiness and dubious nature of information dampened the zeal of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the barometer after the higher price of the products.
In addition, one-third of Quebecers are suspicious of the stated performance of the green products and services they are trying to provide.
According to another statement, more than half of consumers had already changed their habits in 2010, mainly changing the brand of one or more products to express their beliefs.
According to the barometer, they also favored 61% purchases from their neighborhood’s merchants and favored the purchase of food grown in their region.
Greener and more responsible - the index of environmentally conscious consumption had reached a 64 of the maximum value of 100 this year - the Homo consumus of Quebec loves to present itself as the king of recycling, trying to reduce its traces left in the environment by taking care of animal welfare.
But social and ecological awareness still seems to stop in front of his car, according to the barometer: only 28% of Quebecers have indicated that they used public transport in 2010 or preferred the ride-sharing center to demonstrate their ecological interest.
Walking and cycling were also endorsed by 39.1% of participants in this comprehensive behavioral survey, which feeds the clichés.
Government bond for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Quebec Government, which was invited by Société Angus and Parallèle to participate financially in the acquisition of the eXcentris cinema complex, agreed to cooperate, but only in the form of a competitive bond.
The developer company Angus and the company Parallèle, who had hoped for a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to take over the Daniel Langlois-owned cinema complex eXcentris on the boulevard Saint-Laurent in order to return it to its actual cinematic function, apparently do not receive what they requested.
The government has accepted to be involved in this matter, but on its own terms.
Instead of the anticipated donation, the Quebec government is offering a bond in less than the initially hoped amount that could create a viable solution on favorable terms, at least in the opinion of sources extracted from the government’s rumours.
A first action plan and a request for 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, and the petition has been corrected to the bottom again.
A proposal together with an action plan have already been sent by the president of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), François Macerola, to Minister St-Pierre, who manages the eXcentris file.
Several days ago, he sent her a final report.
However, the Cabinet's counter-proposal was communicated to the SODEC on Wednesday.
Parallèle and Angus now have until 31 December to respond to this.
In any case, the premise of state donation seems to have really been pushed aside.
Let’s remember that the Quebec community of owners of cinemas and cinema complexes had rebelled against a direct state investment in support of the takeover of eXcentris by arguing that the Minister of Culture had no financial support to provide for real estate projects there that he had not provided to other cinemas.
However, several other market participants in the segment complained of substantial economic assistance.
After the self-financed construction of the cinema, director Daniel Langlois had presented the author cinema in the premises of his cinema complex under great difficulty for over ten years, which could justify the exceptional position on the part of the state treasury.
The lack of cinemas showing independent films is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris managed to keep its clientele on the bar.
Société Angus and Parallèle, headed by Christian Yaccarini, are heading a privately funded campaign, which they hope to raise $700,000 to boost the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, only one screen has continued to show films in eXcentris, namely Le Parallèle.
The aim of the future buyers is to reopen the three cinemas on 27 February next year with the screening of the very successful film by Xavier Beauvois "Des hommes et des dieux".
Christian Yaccarini, however, has not recalled the newspaper "Le Devoir" and ignored what he and his group think of the downwardly corrected proposals made to them.
Mystery of complexly shaken Canada revealed
The new American diplomatic lines spread through WikiLeaks are uncovering the secret of what the United Nations considers to be the inferiority complex of Canadians to Americans, but they are exposing the latter’s sense of superiority to Canada with the same blow.
Consequently, American diplomats are astonished that the Canadian voters do not have Canadian-American relations in mind during the ballot, and they believe that President Obama’s visit would have helped the conservative government enforce their 2009 budget!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were released publicly yesterday, provide even more spicy details than the mere substantive content you have to nibble on.
A link dated 22 September 2008, that is, during the period when the federal election campaign was in full swing, reports on the point at which the United Nations no longer participates in the operations discussed by its political leaders.
To the great surprise of David Wilkins, the U.S. Ambassador deployed in Ottawa.
Mr. Wilkins offers various explanations for this situation.
"An intrinsic inferiority complex inhabited by Canadians may cause Canadian political leaders to talk about everyday internal issues rather than pushing the United States to black Peter in this election (as in 1988 in the Free Trade Campaign)," he describes.
The United Nations, he concludes, is thus "the proverbial goliath of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to speak of it."
The ambassador understands this "deafening silence" all the less, as the two countries have intense political and economic relations.
"Logically," he assesses, "should it be the ability of a candidate, a party, and much more of a party leader to maintain such an essential relationship that the voter has as a key factor in mind during the polls."
The other expression of this sense of importance reads in the message sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, business manager in Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
“Their journey will help ensure the government’s continued existence in the federal budget confidence vote at the beginning of February, where Canada will announce its first deficit in more than a decade, created as a result of a $30 to $40 billion revival program,” Breese said.
Nowhere did he mention that the government had had to postpone the parliamentary session before Christmas in order to prevent the parliament from being overthrown by the coalition and the conditional continued existence of the opposition parties would affect the quality of the proposed revival program.
Another January 2008 message written by Ambassador Wilkins informs Washington of the increasingly negative picture that the CBC broadcast dramatic series spread from the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about programs such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which you can observe little subtle allusions to Maher Arar, the "no-fly list" or kidnappings for the purpose of interrogations carried out by the CIA.
In another statement, Hillary Clinten asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner at her first bilateral meeting whether Europe was willing to accept certain Guantanamo prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner is said to have answered the question with yes, but on the basis of an individual "case-by-case" decision.
At the end of the meeting, as described, "he handed a paper to the Secretary of State regarding Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary of State has pledged to review the file again".
Finally, let us note that the minds are warming with regard to the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper very close advisor, had stated via CBC that those responsible for this massive leak should be "killed."
He spoke here to Mike Huckabee from the United States.
Global plan to renew lighting
Yesterday in Cancun, the UN proposed a plan to renew home, trade and industry lighting in 100 countries with a view to achieving a reduction in greenhouse gas (HFC) that corresponds to nearly a third of the additional reduction that needs to be implemented to stabilize the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan takes its position in the steps of the concrete large-scale projects that the UN hopes to implement in Cancun to compensate for the absence of mandatory reduction commitments by developed countries.
According to the plan put forward yesterday, the main problem in the form of the 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of CFCs released due to illumination to the earth would be avoided if the white-glowing bulbs, which are still a monopoly of 50 to 70% on the market, were replaced by fluorescent or better yet, by LEDs.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This corresponds to an equivalent of 70% of the global fleet of exhaust gases.
In Copenhagen last year, major exhaust emitters such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, pledged voluntary reduction plans to reduce global CFC emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, it would still be necessary to deduct 5 Gt from this balance sheet to stabilize the climate increase by 2 degrees Celsius from today until 2020, in order to prevent it from getting out of control.
In the white-glowing pears 95% of the energy escapes in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce the light.
With the compact fluorescent bulbs, the energy consumption is reduced by 75%, with the new LED bulbs, this energy requirement is reduced by twice again.
The compact fluorescent bulbs last on average between 6000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those launched by the manufacturer Philips this week - this company, by the way, participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a white-glowing bulb, which conveys an indication of the savings of the replacement plan to be applied in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that completely new kinds of incandescent bulbs emit very little heat, they can also work with a regulating resistance.
And they do not contain any mercury.
Several specialists have shown that compact fluorescent bulbs have reserves because they contain mercury and that they therefore have to be disposed of as special waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless the producers provide a pick-up point.
However, according to the report, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the compact fluorescent bulb, but rather the coal-fired power plants, which emit substantially more mercury to produce the electricity wasted by the white-hot bulbs.
In the United States alone, these coal-fired power plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury annually.
The report describes in detail the profits that each country would generate thanks to this international programme.
Indonesia, for example, would save $1 billion a year on electricity purchases and 8 million tons of CO2, an equivalent of 3.5 coal-fired power plants, the construction of which would cost Indonesia 2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast Expects Excited Announcement of Election Results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called for the "immediate" publication of the results of the Ivory Coast presidential election immediately after the deadline.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the Independent Election Commission to maintain its work and announce the preliminary results without further delay," a press spokesman for the UN said.
"He asks all parties and institutions of Ivory Coast to prove their responsibility and abstain from any initiative until the announcement of the preliminary results."
Despite pressure from certain foreign governments, the election commission had let the deadline, which was set for Wednesday at midnight, pass three days after the election on Sunday, without publishing the results.
Approximately forty minutes before the deadline, the president of the CEI had confirmed on television that the Commission would “continue working” to announce the results.
On Wednesday, numerous calls from all over the world have been made, the CEI may finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round of voting under the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and his opponents Alassane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo camp anticipates the cancellation of "fraudulent" votes in the north by the Constitutional Council, which were achieved by the former rebel camp of the Forces nouvelles (FN) during the failed coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N’Guessan, head of the Ivory Coast presidential campaign, had confirmed that the FN’s intimidating maneuvers had deterred the president’s supporters from going to the election.
The entire election could be cancelled if Gbagbo's actions were taken into account by the Constitutional Council.
However, the Gbagbo opponents are now more of a view that the country’s highest court is not neutral, as it is headed by Paul Yao N’Dré, a politically closely related to Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man of the North who denies any connection to the ex-rebels, has judged the delay in announcing the election results to be "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, even if he has not gone so far as to claim the victory.
His allies reaffirm that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results, knowing that he has lost; and filing a complaint before the Constitutional Court after preventing the Electoral Commission from publishing the results is illegal.
The second round of Sunday’s presidential elections were considered to be the culmination of the unification and reconciliation process of a country that had been split into two over the years.
The United Nations had warned Ivory Coast politicians on Wednesday that they could be held responsible for any riots.
Laurent Gbagbo had won the first round on 31 October with 38% of the vote against the 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who enjoyed the public support of former president Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round), as the top candidate.
Unemployment in France remained stable in the third quarter
According to the International Labour Office (IAA), the unemployment rate in France is stable at 9.3% in the metropolis (including the overseas departments at 9.7%), according to the preliminary, seasonally adjusted data published on Thursday by the Insee Federal Statistical Office.
The unemployment rate in the metropolis is established at 2,631 million.
The figures for the second quarter amounted to 9.3% of the working population in the metropolis and to 9.7% with the involvement of overseas departments.
Over the year, the unemployment rate increased by 0.1 percentage points.
More in-depth, 3.4 million French metropolitan workers were unemployed in the third quarter, but wished to find a job, including whether they were operational every two weeks or not, or whether they were looking for work or not.
The situation of young people on the labour market has continued to deteriorate with an increase in the unemployment rate of 24.2% in the metropolis (+0.9 percentage points over three months, +0.5 percentage points over the year) and 25% with the inclusion of overseas regions.
In the third quarter, 637,000 of the 15- to 24-year-olds were unemployed, according to the IAA.
The elderly, for their part, have seen a slight increase in the unemployment rate of 6.4% in the metropolis (+0.2 percentage points over three months and over the year), i.e. 482 000 of the people over 50 years old, 6.6% with the inclusion of overseas departments.
Only the 25-49 year olds could benefit from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter; 8.3% in the metropolis (-0.1 percentage point over three months, +0.1 percentage point over one year) and 8.8% in France as a whole.
After a discussion about its calculation methods, the Federal Statistical Office of Insee no longer publishes the monthly unemployment figures since 2006.
Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, on the other hand, continues in this method, announcing on Tuesday a quota of 9.8% in France for October (including the overseas departments) against 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini charged and arrested
Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of a waste management company and brother of the President of the General Council of the Bouches-du-Rhône (PS) region, has been investigated and sent to the Luynes prison near Aix-en-Provence as part of an investigation into public markets suspected of fraud.
Alexandre Guérini was charged with robbery of social assets, embezzlement of public goods, stealing, complicity in corruption, unlawful bribery and possession of weapons, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is ready to fight and plans to comment on all the questions that the prosecution will ask him, instead of spreading brainstorms."
"It is easy to place a number of criminal charges on him, another thing is to prove them," his lawyer Florence Rault told the AFP (Agence France Presse) before hearing his client.
Mr Guérini, brother of Jean-No<0xC3><0xAB>l Guérini, the first man of the PS (Parti socialiste) in the department, had made a point of sending a memorandum to the judge by means of his lawyers before his hearing.
A member of Guérini’s family, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and imprisoned on Wednesday evening.
According to lawyer Lucien Simon, her client had never done anything other than keep his landfill running.
He would never have known about the area of business competence or the destination of the associated funds, Simon said.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former director general of the public service of the Aubagne metropolitan area, was also charged on Wednesday with embezzlement and complicity, but then put back on the condition of staying away from the protagonists of these acts under judicial supervision.
"My client was able to provide explanations of the facts that were accused of."
"The senior prosecutor has taken into account not to deprive him of his freedom," said his lawyer Yann Arnoux.
Four more people were charged and released from detention on the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, including two of them under legal supervision, according to Deputy Chief Prosecutor Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy managing director of the Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM) waste management company, is being prosecuted for "unauthorized interference and passive bribery".
Two state officials of the Aubagne metropolitan area, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, were also arrested, one because of the title "evasion and embezzlement of public property by a public service officer", the other because of "complicity in embezzlement of public funds".
Alexandre Guérini's companion, Jeannie Peretti, was also accused of "hacking and misappropriation of social assets".
Among the people confronted by Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who has recently been imprisoned for a similar public scam involving Corsica.
The investigators suspect his company of helping to wash money coming from "high" criminal circles.
The investigation against X for alleged fraud in the procurement of public contracts, here in particular in the waste management sector, will be conducted in April 2009 as a result of anonymous letters in the files of several open investigations.
Close sources of investigation indicate that the investigation focuses particularly on the conditions of the contract and the operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which relates to waste from the Aubagne area as well as from certain cities of the Marseille (MPM) urban basin.
Affaire Clotilde Reiss: the Elysée Palace exaggerates its intermediary role for Syria
Within more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher detained in Iran for "espionage", held the French public in suspense, put diplomacy on alert and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All this under the attentive gaze of the diplomats of the United States.
The American documents obtained from WikiLeaks and reviewed by the newspaper "Le Monde" reveal some backgrounds to this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée had explained its strategy to the Americans, who went as far as giving this advice on how to deal with their own crisis of “hostage taking” in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how the French authorities tried to convince Washington that the liberation of the young French woman did not involve the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian imprisoned in France and sought by the American judiciary for trafficking in material in favour of the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they highlight the way in which the French Bureau has tried to manipulate the media for the purpose of making them believe that Syrian President Bachar al-Assad played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
In truth, he had done nothing in this regard.
A diplomatic telegram edited in Paris on 12 August 2009 is entitled "Iran: French comments on the way of dealing with hostage captures".
François Richier, Elysée advisor on strategic issues, was accompanied by Patrice Paoli, director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, and spoke with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explained the French method to her.
They advised the Americans to do everything in their power to repatriate their own nationals who would be forcibly detained in Iran.
"Make noise," they said, "articulates loud and clear and incessantly" the words "fundamental human rights", "innocence", "immediate release" in the media.
This is necessary to embarrass the Iranian regime, which is very sensitive to its image.
"Behave this all the more, especially since the Iranians are asking you not to do that."
Because "silence does not solve anything", past the discussion attempts on inconspicuous ways, the Iranians are "masters in evasive manoeuvres".
Mr Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is a "common, Iranian tactic": "taken hostage for the purpose of political extortion."
He announces that the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which was to occur on August 16, the day she flees to the French embassy) "requests the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians" (230,000 euros bail).
And he leaves it apparent that the Elysée is anticipating further hostage captures, a phenomenon that "will intensify".
The Iranians could "arrest another of the approximately 1,800 French citizens living in Iran in the near future," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss was released from prison twelve days ago, but is still being held in Iran.
An information was circulated: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition the United States demands on the basis of illegal trade in sensitive electronic material to Iran, has been released from detention following a decision by a judge in Paris.
The American Embassy, like many other observers, is asking questions about this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, which is pursuing the illegal Iranian networks of acquiring the material intended for the nuclear program, the release of Majid Khakavand is a bad news.
Has France accepted a cow trade?
The liberation of the Iranian against that of the French?
On the occasion of a renewed interview with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September, François Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not only "completely surprised by the judge's decision", but also tried to rebel against it.
"There has been a lively exchange between the French Bureau and the French Minister of Justice" (currently Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the judicial decision," he explains.
Mr Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand continues to be under "strict" supervision of the French intelligence service.
The Elysée adviser dials a phone number, re-launches, then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian “is currently in the buildings headed by the Iranian embassy in Paris.”
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée does not spare its efforts to make the Syrian President Bachar al-Assad play an "important" and "influential intermediary" through announcements and media-organized "escaping attempts".
Americans do not observe this activity without irony, noting that the manipulation is bearing fruit, as several press articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 evokes "the media flash of the French authorities".
What is the basis of so much "thank you" to Mr. Assad, the Paris Embassy asks itself.
"Despite their statements full of praise, the French authorities secretly admit that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians actually did."
The document then deals with the reasons that led the Elysée to fall into this fiction.
The intense communication efforts "are aimed at confirming Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria," he analyses.
A policy launched in 2008, which was then "perceived by numerous critics in France and abroad as premature and undeserved."
"Building up the Syrian role" Paris "trys to show Syria what praise one can achieve by playing a constructive role in the region".
It also aims to “seed discord between Syria and Iran.”
The American Embassy knows this from a good source.
On August 11, François Richier confided to her: "Of course we do not know if the Syrians did anything."
"But we thanked them despite everything."
"This should at least cause confusion among the Iranians".
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy welcomes her in the Elysée.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their “active role in favor of the release of our countryman.”
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government will pass a law called "The Cinderella", which will prohibit young people from playing online games after midnight by blocking them from access, government officials indicated.
A bill to call on online gaming operators to deny access to these games to young people under the age of 16 after midnight will be presented to parliament in December, representatives of the ministries of culture and family described.
"Many kids play these games all night long and then have difficulty learning at school and also having a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said Jo Rin, ministerial commissioner of the French press agency Agence France Presse.
The online games will be available again from 6 a.m.
The producer companies would have a year to prepare for the application of the law, he said.
The government is also planning to ask manufacturers to reduce the time limit granted daily for access to these games to those youngsters whose parents ask for it, the official added.
It will also provide free programs to those who wish to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries, and newspapers regularly report on various events associated with intensive Internet use.
The country is also undisputed champion in worldwide online game competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals in the World Cyber Games against 58 other nations.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA appoints host country
On Thursday, the FIFA Executive Committee will appoint the host countries of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, a highly political election in which raging for influence and lobbying threaten to push the technical criteria into the background.
However, one thing is certain: the 2018 edition of FIFA’s Royal Discipline will take place in Europe, its traditional stronghold (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will then be a bit more exotic; the International Football Federation hopes to win over new territories (Qatar, Australia) after its premiere on the African continent in 2010, or to pursue its establishment in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of delegates (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch Prime Ministers, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) sets out the level of economic and political commitment to a World Cup.
The activities behind the scenes threaten to stop until the last minute.
It is difficult to establish a hierarchy of candidates.
According to FIFA’s evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) files offer better arguments than those of their competitors.
But these considerations will not be so important for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the election.
The Sunday Times, which was at the beginning of the revelations with the suspension of two members of the executive committee (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could just as well have ruined the chances for their own country, the cradle of football, which was only allowed to hold the World Cup once, namely 1966.
The BBC had once again provided a breeding ground to this on Monday by broadcasting a documentary report that targeted three influential members of the committee, namely Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Reason enough to upset FIFA and embarrass the English leaders, who had been doing intense lobbying with David Cameron in the last few weeks.
The head of government hopes for a new edition of the move succeeded by his predecessor Tony Blair, who in 2005 had achieved the organization of the 2012 Olympic Games for London.
Would this intensive effort be enough to re-enhance the image of England before the Committee?
Nothing is less certain, because the duo Spain-Portugal lacks no trumps with its already finished stadiums, its expertise (World Cup 82 in Spain, Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, European Championships 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the economic and financial downsides of the two countries could dampen their ambitions.
The possible retaliation against the English as well as the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal increase the chances of Russia, which, despite its gaps in the dossier (stadiums, hotels, transport), has become a weighty outsider.
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, however, has decided to denounce the unambiguous insinuation of the accusations by the English press of "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote" by the committee members.
"You throw them dirt, you try to compromise them," Putin said.
For 2022, the United States, strengthened by the 1994 experience, seems to be the logical favorites.
First economic world power, headquarters of FIFA’s main sponsors, the country seems to have a long list of advantages over Japan and South Korea, which have separately set up a very nice project.
But these new candidacies seem premature for two countries that co-organized the competitions in 2002.
Another threat: FIFA’s much-awaited approval of the 2026 World Cup for China, which makes the Asian chances of 2022 obsolete.
With Australia and Qatar, which had drawn all records with the advent of futuristic stadiums, FIFA is pursuing its expansion towards new territories, but these two countries pose a greater risk, because certainty.
Australia, as well as Japan and South Korea, could suffer from the fragility of TV rights (due to the time shift) acquitted by European countries, FIFA’s sensitive nerve.
Second mandate: the obvious
De Gaulle really did.
Mitterrand had made him believe he was stumbling.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not show the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than that.
A mandate in the Elysée calls for the next.
The current head of state will be ergo candidate in 2012.
But the obvious side of the mystery attached to the presidential function is not well seen.
So you have to act as if there are doubts from now on.
On the one hand, as well as on the other.
In 2006, the supporters of Jacques Chirac claimed that a third mandate could not be ruled out without believing in it themselves.
On November 15, Nicolas Sarkozy assured in a serious tone that he would make his decision "sometimes in the fall of 2011."
That he would sound the perspective of "two mandates" on Tuesday evening in the Elysée in front of the UMP parliamentarians, had spread a little feverish.
Was this the official announcement of his candidacy?
Far from missing.
The President merely pointed out that the 2008 constitutional amendment limits the number of five-year terms to only two.
He made a statement, not an announcement.
This is not the first time he has mentioned the presidential election on the occasion of such meetings in a humorous tone.
“You still have seven and a half years with me at worst, or at best,” he told them in July 2009.
On a new one in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not thinking about the phase afterwards."
His words of yesterday make him no more a candidate than he did the day before, but no less.
If you have comments, it is for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race for the candidacy with the PS on one side.
But it is not the start of the competition with Ségolène Royal that drives Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidacy in 2012 that many members of the PS admonish earlier than assumed to the battle challenge.
The bad polls on the other hand.
For the first time, right-wing voters would prefer a candidacy of François Fillon to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% versus 44%, according to the BVA-L'Express survey).
"We have a candidate, and there is no discussion with the UMP about it," the Prime Minister's environment responded immediately and cautiously.
"If he found a defeat possible, he would not be a candidate," Raffarin said.
"He will always believe in being able to win," corrects Alain Juppé, who has resigned to the obvious.
Euro: the ECB is forced to keep its purchases of government bonds
The last meeting of the ECB’s Central Bank Council last year should provide an opportunity to show ways to get out of the crisis, or at least to announce the arrangement of a large number of unconventional monetary policy measures to be completed by the end of the year.
The crisis of European sovereign debt obliges the central bank in Frankfurt, undoubtedly, cannot afford to dislodge the current, more than tense situation in the European bond markets, in order not to cause its aggravation.
The political costs would be far too high.
French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde welcomed yesterday at a press conference the ECB’s active role in resolving Europe’s public debt.
She has not dared to say whether she believes that the central bank can do even more, for example by boosting its program of government bond purchases.
"I reserve my considerations for my European trading partners (...) ".
Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, had not been very eloquent about his plans the day before in Brussels on the occasion of his hearing by the European Parliament’s Economic and Monetary Committee, but rather contented himself to point out that the program of purchases of government bonds on the secondary market would be “re-opened” and that we will “see how the decisions will turn out” at the meeting on Thursday.
The only certainty is that the ECB will remain unchanged at 1%, the historically lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, the ECB’s bond purchases were doubled last week to approximately EUR 1.35 billion.
And according to indiscretions of some traders, she is said to have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese government papers yesterday.
The Eurosystem’s central banks have made purchases totalling EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
Among the merchants, the anticipation of a continuation of the purchase price is by no means doubted (see page 29).
Economists are no longer expecting a remarkable change of course.
If the bond transactions of more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB’s arsenal, the latter will still have to cope with the unrestricted cash reserves in a generous manner, over a period of one week to three months.
Economists are already expecting this measure to be extended by a few more months.
"I cannot imagine that the ECB will substantially amend its programme".
“Otherwise, it would take the risk of provoking new tensions in the short term,” said Michael Schubert, economist at Commerzbank.
"A progressive exit planned for the course of the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely to me," anticipates Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In terms of its interventions in the sovereign debt market, "the ECB should maintain such a volume of purchases of bonds that stimulates the sluggish market," Norbert Bräms adds.
Given the relevance of the exposed position of European banks in the eurozone sovereign debt markets, the central bank has no choice but to maintain its presence in the market.
"It must step at any cost to the placeholders of the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent the quick excitement about the returns paid to the weakest states," testified yesterday an important bond holder.
Because if interest rates start to rise, the states would be even more prevented from reducing or even stabilizing their debt.
This is the price to protect the euro.
The Berlusconi government in Italy
After a worrisome beginning of the week for Italy, the situation has eased a bit yesterday with the fall in corner rates to 10 years.
A return to deceptive silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister of Economic Affairs, the regional chairman Giulio Tremonti had qualified the situation as "undecipherable" and had heard him expect an "unpredictable" weekend, which he immediately denied.
On Tuesday, at any rate, the German interest rate scissors had reached its record of 210 basis points, and the prices of the contracts to cover bankruptcy risk had risen to 263 points, which had caused some headlessness in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi had pointed out at his Council of Ministers that Spain’s discrepancy with German interest rates is at 400 basis points.
However, his right hand, Gianni Letta, had expressed "heavily concerned" about the "market turmoil" and a possible risk of contagion from Ireland.
“The good news is that Italy, the eurozone’s third economy, is not like Greece or Ireland.”
"The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute.
In a nutshell, this means that its problem is the absence of economic growth and the associated dwindling tax revenues, which put the state at risk of no longer being able to meet its financing needs.
The last Brussels forecast was a cold shower for the government.
In the future, Italian growth is expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... although the budget for the Senate under review is expected to be 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, the EU Commission calculates, the budget deficit will still account for 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to the 3.9% forecast by the governments) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the turmoil around a new household collective, which could be used after the holidays at a sum of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, new austerity measures must be taken," says auditor Olli Rehn.
Italy is currently receiving support from international institutions.
"The foundations of Italy's economy are in order and its accounts are regulated, we have been repeating this for a long time," said Arrigo Sadun, Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund, who is entrusted with Italy by the IMF.
"At the moment there are no problems, either in the short term or in the long term, as Italy, despite its high debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, A.D.), is demanding less stabilisation progress than other countries," observes Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist at the OECD.
The question of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure by the Chamber of Deputies, according to which the early elections could be organized as early as the end of March.
There is therefore an unfavorable period ahead for decision-making on a serious crisis.
Europeans are considering expanding anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde said at a press conference in Paris: “I think it has been proven on Sunday afternoon as well as in the evening: the Europeans are clearly holding together, are ready and committed to defending their currency and their currency territory.”
Although completely relative - yesterday's subtraction on the interest rates of European government bonds was water on the mills of governments and the ECB.
However, the beginning of normalization cannot yet be talked about.
The rating agency Standard & Poor’s had announced that it could lower Portugal’s debt rating, which is arguably the most effective target for speculators today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, which weighs particularly on the banking systems," said the economists of Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially since "political times pass much slower than those of the markets."
The European countries, which are well aware of both this gap and the danger that it poses, are intensifying the discussions on strengthening the anti-crisis measures already in place.
The informal discussions between the finance ministers most directly affected and, in a broader sense, with their counterparts in the G20 are progressing well.
And this also in view of the meetings of the Eurogroup and Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
The plan includes the unconventional measures to strengthen the backbone of the eurozone countries in the crosshairs of the markets (see below).
As far as the EU Stability Funds are concerned, its executive director Klaus Regling has already started his Asia tour in Singapore on Tuesday to inform investors in the Far East about developments regarding the crisis in Europe.
If the goal of his visit is not explicit fundraising, he certainly prepares the ground for this.
The EU Stability Fund’s first refunds are scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, an official U.S. representative had entrusted the agency to Reuters that the United States was supporting a possible increase in funds mobilized through the IMF’s additional direct engagement.
Portugal and Spain, the countries in the first row, in turn are preparing to undertake structural reforms, in particular in the area of labour market organization.
Reforms that add to the austerity measures, but should have an impact in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid are taking a different path than Greece and Ireland did.
Both the one and the other are concerned at all costs with avoiding having to ask for international assistance before they have drawn up their own budgetary corrections and have decided on indispensable structural reforms that will bring them back confidence in the long run.
European investors, in turn, are discussing the options available to accelerate the normalisation process of government bond markets.
Axel Weber, who was passing through Paris on November 24, was the first to come up with the idea that if the 750 billion euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to take back its own pocket.
The economists of Barclays Capital, a leading player in the market for European sovereign debt, consider that an extension of around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 billion would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of a direct liquidity injection.
This means exists: the European mechanism of doped financial stabilisation, which currently amounts to EUR 60 billion.
An advisory board that has every chance to be carefully examined in the European capitals.
Especially when market conditions are getting worse.
Snow and ice: 24 departments in Orange alert
The snow episodes still cause traffic difficulties, especially in Brittany’s secondary transport networks, and threaten to affect various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in Orange alert level due to the threat of snow and freezing.
The Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne regions have been added to the 20 departments already in alert state; 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, then later in the night.
According to Météo France, the intense snow showers touch the north of the Gironde as well as the Charentes, it snows slightly on the et Ile-de-France.
In the affected departments, snow covers are expected from 2 to 5 cm, sometimes also from 7 to 10 cm, and from 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm in the Paris region.
The regions concerned are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions of Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
The snowfall is significant enough to cause traffic constraints and interfere with certain economic activities, Météo France predicts.
In the Côtes d'Armor region, several regional roads are closed to heavy traffic of over 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac roads.
The traffic situation of the secondary transport networks in Brittany is very difficult, according to the traffic police, who advise against using your own vehicle only in an emergency, and the use of some TER buses was cancelled throughout the day.
In Picardie, school traffic was cancelled for Thursday.
No specific restrictive measures were provided for heavy transport on Wednesday evening.
The prefecture "invites drivers to take the utmost care on the roads and to adapt their driving behaviour accordingly."
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) called on the airlines to cancel 25% of their flights departing from Paris Roissy Airport and 10% of flights departing from Orly on Thursday due to the expected heavy snowfall.
The DGAB recommends that passengers contact their airline.
Gatwick airports in the south of London and Edinburgh, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Métro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate on the modernisation of the transport economy on the Ile-de-France is in full swing, it has been raining billions.
At least in the discussions.
In particular, it is worth remembering the 23 billion for the Metro Grand Paris, which will be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
In order to initiate the construction of the SGP, the state has declared a capital donation of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the sum that would then enable the SGP to lend a part of the financial sum to the markets to be doubled.
Today, the first estimates have finally been made.
The 2010 supplementary budget, reviewed this morning by the Finance Commission of the National Assembly, contains the measures envisaged to raise the first part of these funds.
There are two types of measures: the creation of a special tax on access and access and a higher taxation of the offices on the Ile-de-France.
The former, according to Article 15 of the bill, goes "to the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
“The product of this tax amounts to 117 million euros per year.”
The second is a restructuring of the existing corporate taxation: "to modernize it, to increase the product resulting from it and to hand over this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that bring in?
It's a mystery.
This sum is not specified in the text.
Of the 4 billion you are far away.
"It is stated that the tax resources will be added to the 4 billion euros of capital funding raised by the state and gradually provided to the Société du Grand Paris for the project," according to the explanatory statement.
With the SGP, this system is not offensive at all.
"Since the moment you book revenue (the two taxes, i.e.), you can cover the projecting for over three years and then only draw from the 4 billion," it is explained.
"This will be noted in the budget and gradually deducted".
The SGP estimates that 2013 will begin to record the 4 billion for the 2014 budget.
This measure, of which the promised 4 billion will be sought for a long time, runs the risk of provoking a rather moving parliamentary discussion.
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
Vengeful hackers and busy spies
WikiLeaks has a double meaning.
On the one hand, it has turned out to be an obvious scandal, a scandal that is merely a scandal in the sense of hypocrisy that governs relations between the states, the citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at the international level, giving a foretaste of the future dominated by regression.
But let's go one step at a time.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that every file created by a secret service (an x-any nation) is composed exclusively of newspaper clippings.
The “extraordinary” American revelations about Berlusconi’s sexual habits are nothing more than what has been read in any X-journal (except for those owned by Berlusconi) over months, and Gaddafi’s terribly caricatured profile has long provided cabaret artists with material for their sketches.
The rule that the secret files may consist only of known news is essential to the dynamism of the intelligence services, and not only in this century.
If you go to a library dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that every work (about the Grail, the Mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templars or the Rose-Cross-Cross) repeats exactly what has already been written in previous works.
This is not only because the author of occult texts does not want to publish research (neither because he does not know where to find news about the non-existent), but because those who devote themselves to occultism believe in nothing but what they already know and confirm what they have already learned.
This is also Dan Brown’s success mechanism.
Same with the secret records.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited spirit) is also the head of the intelligence service (otherwise he could be whatever, for example, editor at Libération), who only considers what he acknowledges to be true.
The top-secret information about Berlusconi that the American embassy in Rome had sent to the State Department was the same as the one that Newsweek had published the week before.
So why was such a fuss made about the revelations of these dossiers?
On the one hand, these state what every educated person already knows, namely that the embassies – at least since the end of World War II and since then the heads of government can call each other or take a plane to meet for dinner – have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of some small representation tasks, have turned into espionage centers.
Any viewer of investigative movies knows this very well, and it is not by hypocrisy that one acts to ignore this.
Nevertheless, the fact of repeating it publicly violates the task of hypocrisy and serves to put American diplomacy in a bad light.
Secondly, the idea that an x-any hacker can tap into the most secrets of the most powerful country in the world carries the significant blow against the prestige of the State Department.
In addition, the scandal brings less the victims, but rather the "sharpeners" in trouble.
But let us dedicate ourselves to the profound nature of what happened.
Once, in Orwell’s time, you could bundle all power like a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell’s prophecy could have proven to be perfectly correct since then, where you can control every movement thanks to the phone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the chosen highway and so on; the citizen would become a total victim of the eye of power.
But if one considers what is happening today, that even the secret crypts of power can no longer escape the control of a hacker, the control channel ceases to be one-sided and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker – chosen as a vengeance of the citizen – can discover the secrets of power.
But how can a power keep itself that is no longer able to keep its own secrets?
It is true, Georg Simmel already said that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge of Berlusconi’s or Merkel’s character is basically a secret free of secrets, as it reveals the public sphere; but to disclose in the style of WikiLeaks, that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets to power, means to steal.
WikiLeaks has not wronged Sarkozy or Merkel, but Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this insult inflicted on such a mighty power?
It is obvious that in the future, the states will no longer put any reserved information online - that would be like a sticker on the street corner.
But it is equally obvious that with the latest technologies, it is in vain to hope to be able to keep confidential reports over the phone secret.
Nothing is easier than to find out if and when a head of state moved on an airplane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How could private relationships be maintained in the future and only for certain ears?
I know very well that my prediction sounds science-fiction and novel at the moment, but I am compelled to imagine the government agents moving secretly on uncontrollable march routes, carrying their messages nowhere else but in mere memory, and hiding the few written information they have received, in the shoe set.
The information would be stored in a single copy in locked drawers: basically, Watergate’s spying attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is progressing like a cancer nowadays, namely backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communication, the Internet reconstructs a telegraph with (telephone) wire.
The (analog) video cassettes had allowed the film researchers to explore a film tape by tape, by rewinding from the back to the front and uncovering all the secrets of the assembly, while the (numeric) CDs nowadays allow nothing but to jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. in macro portions.
With high-speed trains you can travel from Rome to Milan within three hours, while this takes three and a half hours by plane, including the changeover.
It is therefore not unusual that politics and communication technology come back to cars and horses.
One last observation.
In earlier times, the press tried to understand what secrets were forged between the embassies.
At present, it is the embassies that demand confidential information from the press.
Climate: How France is talking about its financial promises
One year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to examine compliance with the fast-resolved financing promises (also called "fast start" or premature financing) realised by developing countries.
And now the rough French fairy tales have been uncovered.
Under the Copenhagen Treaty, developing countries pledged to allocate $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has promised <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.2 billion over three years, France <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.26 billion (i.e. 420 million per year).
On the occasion of the opening of COP16, the EU has drawn up all the registers to convince its partners of its commitment to fast-start funding: detailed action report from its Member States, press conference, major side events, brochure distribution.
Operation Transparency is remarkable and appreciated for its true value: developing countries and civil society would like to see all developed countries do the same at the same level of precision.
The EU announced it had released <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion in 2010, putting it on the right track to pay respect to its commitment of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look into the details, things are a little more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Treaty, this money should be "new and additional" in order to ensure that an additional contribution has been made without being made to the detriment of public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what “new and additional” means.
While the EU Commission had proposed harmonisation, certain member states, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the guideline that they deem best.
For example, the EU Commission has chosen itself as a benchmark for 2009: international financing will be retained and 150 million will be added to the Fast Start funding for over three years.
Other countries have chosen similar benchmarks, either in terms of year or in terms of conditions at the level of public development aid.
In return, France felt that the financing of “all new projects” of 2010 were “new and additional.”
In other words, there are no benchmarks for the expenditure of the previous year or at the global level of public development aid.
Specifically, the total amount of French support to developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease) - France pretends to comply with its commitment to "new and additional" financing.
Another crucial element is the breakdown into donations and loans.
There is no rule yet, and everyone chooses their computing mode.
Some, such as France, find 1 <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> borrowed as equivalent to 1 <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> donated.
Obviously, this is hard to justify: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans for certain profitable investments (often emission control projects based on the most effective technology) can be justified, it is deceptive to present the euro collected as the equivalent of a donated euro... In addition, only the cost of the loan to the investor country should be credited as a commitment (i.e. the equivalent rate of an interest).
But France has nothing other than the following consideration: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by taking 91.5% loans (389.8 million euros) and donating 8.5% (36.1 million euros) - see also the EU document to convince itself of this.
France is the only country in the EU that uses loans to a large extent.
Germany demands 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among others) carry out 100% of their commitments with donations.
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union spends <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1 to fulfil its obligations, France gives just 10 cents and understands a comparable stake.
Nice hocus pocus!
All in all, France’s fast-start financing is operating with a double fraud: partly with a further development of the action over time and partly with the reality of financial stakes.
France manages to make it believe that it has spent 420 million "new and additional" million in line with its promises, saving 36.1 million euros.
The manipulation of the Treasury (as it seems that it was Bercy who conducted the arbitration) could have a double negative effect; once within the EU (why do the other member states continue to donate, if it is enough to borrow?) and then in the negotiations, since the developing countries are not completely deceived...
The chapter of early financing is only a small question on a relatively short period of time compared to the whole of discussions about the climate.
But it could be the drop too much in the immense machinery of the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that this will not be the case.
Whatever the case, it is essential to learn the lesson from this first year of early financing.
First and foremost, France could announce a change in its accounting style for 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its obligations and balanced justice with the other countries of the European Union.
Above all, however, France could bring forward the discussions on the subject of long-term financing (another, crucial and currently debated issue): one does not escape the question of "accountability" or the way in which his loans are accounted for.
France could change its position to be as progressive on the issues as it is on other matters.
The hope is therefore based on the new Environment Minister Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprising announcement of France's fast-start and its vision of "accountability" and the use of loans would naturally raise the international trust base necessary for further discussions.
Alarm - pesticides taken by children
A 10-year-old child takes 81 different chemical substances during the day, according to a study published this Wednesday by the Association Générations Futures (former movement to protect the rights and respect of future generations).
The association, which explains that its findings "do not reflect statistically significant value given the small number of samples analyzed, but represent an illustrative nature of the problem dealt with," had bought between July and September the foods commonly consumed within four meals by about a ten-year-old child plus a snack in the supermarkets in Oise and Paris.
These typical meals – including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and fruit sections, three dairy products and 1.5 liters of water per day – were studied as well as snacks from laboratories in search of chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The plate balance is devastating: 81 chemical substances, including 42 potentially or likely to be carcinogenic and five safely carcinogenic, as well as 37 substances with endocrine disturbance, according to studies by several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Center.
"Even if the legal limits for each chemical individually ingested substance are not exceeded in the approximate totality of cases, this survey shows very well that the reality in which the consumer is exposed to potentially carcinogenic substances or substances with endocrine disruptors is alarming," notes the association.
At breakfast alone, butter and tea with milk already contain more than ten of the potentially carcinogenic residues and three have proven to be carcinogenic, as well as more than twenty residues that can affect the hormonal system.
The apple imported from Brazil, intended as a snack for the study, has traces of six chemical substances, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same goes for the green beans from Kenya, including lunch, in which the study found traces of a strictly prohibited insecticide in the EU.
In addition, the hack steak, the tuna from the can, even the baguette and chewing gum of pesticides and other chemicals were spiked.
In the case of tap water, the analyses have revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the salmon steak with 34 chemical residues determined was the "most rich", and even the plastic plate used to warm the meal in the microwave was not unloaded.
The ultimate risk of this "pollutant cocktail" for the consumer "is likely to be underestimated," according to the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecologie-Les Verts (EE-LV), for its part, has proposed "in view of the urgency of the situation" to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop the "increase in civilization diseases".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) had identified references to the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
