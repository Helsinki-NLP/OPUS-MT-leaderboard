Munich 1856: Four maps that change your view of the city
A mad institution where young people are supposed to meet today.
A tomb chapel, where the S-Bahn tunnel is now being dug.
Small farmers cultivate the former land of farmers.
The oldest official map in Munich promotes exciting stories.
It's annoying when maps aren't up to date.
Anyone who has ever had to get upset knows this, because the car navi indicated a green meadow instead of an bypass road.
The historical maps of the digital Bavarian Atlas, an offer of the state government’s geoportal Bavaria, are anything but current – but precisely for this reason very insightful.
Especially when you compare them with current online maps.
Then it becomes clear how cities and communities in the distribution area of Munich Mercury have changed since the 19th century.
The digital Bayern-Atlas is a patchwork that is not immediately recognized as such.
More detailed maps, so-called preposition sheets, were incorporated into the large overview map for cities and municipalities.
These were created according to data from the Bavarian Surveying Administration between 1810 and 1864 and originated from the first survey of Bavaria.
Your client: Napoleon.
The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographical recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.
Even though the French troops finally departed with the Treaty of Lunéville on 9 February 1801, it was today’s neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bavarian map.
Elector Max IV Joseph pushed the project further, founded the "Topographisches Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian Surveying Administration.
The Urpositionsblatt für München dates back to 1856 and can be found on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek.
The comparison between the former and the present is most impressive in the case of the state capital.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
An example of this is Untersendling, which still appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sendling was incorporated as a Munich district 21 years after the map was created, i.e. 1877.
Today Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.
The houses of Untersendling are concentrated around 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße, which was only named in 1878 after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.
Where the Westpark is today, you can see nothing but fields - at first glance: when zooming in, a smaller-sized map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: handwritten numbered hallway pieces from the so-called "Uraufnahme", from which the property tax was derived.
Small parcels no longer occupy farmers - but small gardeners of the plant "Land in Sonne".
A large green area appears north of Untersendling.
The Theresienwiese, since 1810 the venue of the Oktoberfest, was in fact still a meadow in the 19th century - and not a concrete desert.
On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the Urpositionsblatt, in the area of the present-day district of Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street name "am Gasteig" or from the hill "Auf der Lüften" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt".
Yes, here on the Auerfeldstraße people were once imprisoned with delusions.
In 1858/59, the Munich Kreis-Irrenanstalt "Auf der Auer Lüften" was founded.
From 1872 onwards, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the institution – the psychiatrist who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.
"He was progressive for his time and, for example, ended the chaining of the so-called madmen.
In addition, he has forbidden the staff to use force against the inmates," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the museum Haidhausen, who worked with the institution for an exhibition.
At first there was room for 280 patients, later it was expanded to 500.
At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in Haar in 1905.
Since 2006 the Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost, one of the largest psychiatric clinics in Germany, has been located there.
On the site of the former Auer Anstalt, young people now meet in the Salesianum in Munich.
The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training establishments.
West is the football field of TSV München Ost, east residential buildings from the 1980s.
In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was erected - in an architectural reminiscence of the original building of the madhouse, which had been destroyed in World War II during bombings.
The Marienplatz was listed as "Hauptplatz" around 1856, the Kaufingerstraße was called "Kaufinger Gasse".
The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.
In December 1944, the Allied bombs tore many holes into the city centre.
A large one remained to this day - at Marienhof.
The English Institute, small business buildings and a crypt chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at Marienhof, where these days the preparatory work and on 5 April 2017 the groundbreaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn line took place.
With the slider, the old Munich map can be compared with today's aerial view - and the hole at Marienhof can be filled.
Civil Rights Group Releases Travel Warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Color has issued a warning for colored people traveling to Missouri due to the state’s discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
“The NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is scheduled to come into effect by August 28, 2017, calls on African-American travelers, visitors, and Missourians to pay special attention when travelling across the state and to exercise extreme caution as a number of questionable, racial-based incidents have been occurring across the state recently and are being noted here,” the group said in a statement.
A recently passed Missouri law making it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as state law enforcement agencies disproportionately targeting minorities, prompted the group to issue the travel warning, the NAACP said.
"They have violations of civil rights that happen to people.
They’re being stopped because of their skin color, they’re being beaten up or killed,” Missouri NAACP president Rod Chapel told the Kansas City Star.
"We hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet."
It is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the United States.
The group cited incidents such as racist offenses against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances earlier this year after being left without gasoline while traveling through the state and taken into custody by Missouri police without being charged with a crime.
The Council also draws attention to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General’s Office showing that black motorists in the state are 75 percent more likely to be stopped than whites.
“The recommendation is that people be aware and inform their families, friends and co-workers about what could happen in Missouri,” Chapel said.
"People need to be ready whether it's bringing bail money or letting relatives know they're traveling through the state."
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI’s hate crime reporting program, which ranks the state at the country’s 16th rank in terms of the number of such violations.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after states passed immigration laws requiring local law enforcement to arrest people for immigration violations, which, according to the ACLU, will contribute to further racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but recently stakeholders have deployed the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the U.S.
Meadow fence project is elementary
The Fischerbach pasture fence project is a successful project and will continue next year.
CDU MEPs Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac have taken a picture on the spot.
At the Rechtgrabenhof of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fischerbach CDU local association met with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.
Markus Schwendemann first gave insights into his farm, in which he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, supplies 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and houses holiday guests in five apartments.
According to Schwendemann, the "Black Forest Milk" is for him the alternative-less marketing route for the milk of his cows.
On the table of the holiday guests comes exclusively regional.
Since he is also the BLHV chairman of Fischerbach, he described the pasture fence project as "elementary important".
I can't make a profit on such steep areas.
The grassland area requires a lot of work, many things have to be worked with the motorsense.
"We are struggling here with the conditions and with the topography," emphasised Schwemann.
In 2003, he took over the parent farm and ran it without chemical crop protection and fertilizer, even if he did not run an organic farm.
For Mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear: "The municipality has recognised the importance of the pasture fence project and is pleased with the Leader funding".
At a cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.
It is hoped that the reforestation of the areas could be extended for quite some time.
"The biggest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and are concerned about how they can continue their operations," the mayor stressed.
Farmers are often criticized for their support.
A total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 via the grazing fence funding.
The open holding area is thus 40 hectares, which may not be afforested by at least 2023.
Of the total cost of 71 500 euros, half was supported by Leader, a quarter was borne by the municipality of Fischerbach.
This left the farmers 12,610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of pasture fence.
"The big advantage is the longevity of the fences," Schwendemann explained.
Kordula Kovac stressed: "You are doing a really good job, without farmers and rural women it is not possible."
For Peter Weiß, it was also clear: "Best food is produced here".
The Landscape Care Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows the state to support pasture fences.
The goal is to keep the Black Forest open.
The prerequisite is the presence of a funding framework designated by the LPR.
In addition, the area to be fenced must not be towable (hanging inclination over 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation.
For the 2018 Fischerbach pasture fence project, the application is currently underway by eight participants with 24 plots who want to build almost 16 kilometers of fence.
The open area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.
Is nothing sacred anymore?
Now Trump's White House is taking over the Statue of Liberty
The safest sign of a regime change is when they start attacking the statues.
The Americans appreciate it as much as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein on Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe to the Statue of Liberty in a heated dispute with CNN’s Jim Acosta over the president’s proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration.
To be fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
A horde of boat owners and Liberty imitators would have lynched him if he had.
But he attacked their significance, and in particular the significance attributed to it, when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus was added to its base in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument.
As Miller taunted Acosta, "I don't want to go into a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem you are referring to that was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller is factually correct, but as he put it himself, it’s not really about history.
It is about the contemporary resonance to the shaking words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state invites not only some old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your tired, your poor, / your oppressed masses, who long to breathe freely, / the wretched waste of your rich shores."
There has never been a time when the “wretched waste” was better seen on our screens.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism – he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump’s US.
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural controversy: it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America.
Lazarus - and her friends who were committed to putting their words at the base after their death - knew very well that they were carrying out a highly political action.
The sculpture was intended to show the connections between French and American republicanism by depicting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical pictorial representation.
Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract – she has received a voice.
And she gives herself a completely different name: Mother of the Exiles.
The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people of the right wing wanted to change this back for a long time.
The great shouter Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for Trump’s coming, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was not inviting anyone, but rather an early neoconservative, bringing the American flame to the overnight world: “Lady Liberty is moving forward.
It is said to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch should not illuminate the way into the United States."
Quite unusually, Limbaugh stumbled upon something here.
The significance of the statue is entirely a question of the point of view of perception.
The great imaginative deed of Lazarus was to see it as it was seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.
It’s literally about seeing the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome that they must hear.
And that, of course, is not the perspective Miller and Trump would ever want to acknowledge.
Their torch is not to illuminate the way, but to light the hatred which is their only source of power.
World Championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots were part of the UK team
The UK's performance director of athletics, Neil Black, says the 16-member Scottish contingent in the World Championship squad "will make a massive contribution to the team."
A record number of Scottish athletes were selected for London 2017, which will start on Friday.
Black believes that "something special is developing in Scotland" and the UK's athletics needs to learn something from it.
"We welcome it, and we're trying to understand it, and we're going to continue until we find out," Black said.
“I’m talking to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they’ve done.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.
British athletics: It has something to do with what they have done.
And also with the guy on the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, it’s absolutely brilliant.”
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal contenders, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track, while Eilidh Doyle was elected team captain by the team.
"Eilidh is quite modest.
Her captain's speech was incredible," Black says.
“A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or work out, went out of the room and felt very proud and very motivated.
The passion and real feeling that Eilidh naturally brought in was great.”
The Commonwealth silver medalist, who will compete in her fifth World Championships at the 400m hurdles, says it's "incredible" that 16 Scots are in the British team.
Scotland's best overall number of athletes to date at the World Cup was seven, achieved in 1983 and 2015.
The mid-range runner Muir leads this path and has set five British and two European records last year.
She will participate in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs.
Chris O’Hare, running 1,500 metres, is another Scotsman to watch after a great season that included winning the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers their first World Championships when the only other Scotsman on the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says she is "extremely proud" of the fact that many of her compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases will also participate in the medals and the finals.
“The special thing about being a team captain is that she was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and voted for me makes it very special to me,” she added.
"Obviously, I'm very proud of all the Scots who are part of the team.
It just shows how far we've come.
And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb podiums.
As for my speech as captain?
Yeah, I think she went well.
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.
So it’s really important to rely on this home support and benefit from being back in the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and there will be such a great atmosphere out there.”
Blocking Critics on Facebook: Don’t Apply for a Public Office If You Can’t Toler Voter Heating
The father of our country knew something about bad press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn’t take long for the newspapers to beat him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
He whispered about the criticism, I’m sure.
But he did not silence his critics.
For in 1783 Washington said, “Freedom of speech can be taken away – and, stupid and dumb, we are led to slaughter like sheep.”
That brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington.
Hogan’s employees have blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
The American Civil Liberties Union sued him earlier this week.
The governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a counter-reaction with "Well, and?" .
“It’s just Facebook,” many people said.
But it's important.
And it's especially important if it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state that is amazingly popular.
He has the second-highest approval of the nation's 50 governors.
Hogan is not a reactionary hothead.
He has shown a firm hand in leading his state and strict adherence to the principles.
He was also very skilled at using Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and playfully debut his hairless head on his page after chemotherapy.
Therefore, blocking people who come to the governor’s side — which is a public forum called official and staff paid with public tax dollars — is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan’s spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor’s actions, arguing that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.
But it’s too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people swinging the whip online.
The Post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are only real people talking to their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, not trolls.
They all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not profane.
The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked about hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the comment section of the news broadcast "The Post."
"I don't appreciate this idea either, if a number of people take a position on the same subject, then they are more likely to be disregarded by some as a so-called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of citizens concerned."
What the governor's staff called a "concentrated spam attack," others would probably call "advocacy."
The Facebook era makes it easy to crop a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in the past if you had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials or to arrest and silence protesters.
But that’s exactly what’s happening digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for blaspheming Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones in this issue fell in Virginia last week.
Loudoun County’s Chairman of the Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a voter from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
That shouldn't be that hard.
At the time of Washington, the era of affordable Porto had a similar effect to the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers slapped on his leadership.
And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.
The people who used pseudonyms like "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" all wrote letters to newspapers that downplayed Washington's decisions.
Petitions criticizing his position on Amity’s treaty, trade, and shipping with Britain overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the George Washington Project’s online papers.
But he did not silence her.
Freedom of speech, disagreement and discourse are the foundation of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comfort at Renaissance Club
Former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for home comfort in the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Nordire, who led the Archerfield Links to the finals last year before losing to Paul Eales, is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador on behalf of club founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I've seen the Renaissance club being built, and we're seeing it reach its glory with this event," Rafferty said.
"The players will see this course at its best, it is in great condition.
Jerry did a great job setting up this place.
He is an avid advocate of this game and is proud of his achievement here.
This is a great showcase for this course."
Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, despite winning both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"That really feels special," said the Southport-based player.
"I was unable to defend the Extremadura Open because it was removed from the program the year after I won it.
Getting back to this part of the world is magical.
It is a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories from last year are coming back, and it was special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate.”
Gary Orr, who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50th birthday earlier this year, is returning to action on home soil.
This event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little more when you play at home," said Orr, the man from Helensburgh.
"You want to do it well, but you also feel that extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again, and I played a solid golf.
I’m happy about how it has gone so far.”
With the trio on the field, former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scots on the field, the others being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.

Less lung cancer deaths from passive smoking
Over the past two decades, fewer and fewer people have died from lung cancer due to passive smoking.
Scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) have come to this conclusion in a study.
"According to our estimates, 167 lung cancer deaths per year are due to passive smoking," said study leader Heiko Becher.
As a comparison, he used his own study on this topic from 1994.
At the time, there were 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking per year in Germany.
The new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health.
House connections prove to be very complex
Construction works on Villinger Straße are in full swing and "are fairly in time," according to the head of the construction yard Fred Heinze.
In the area of house connections, the situation is more complicated than suspected, as much is hidden in the underground, which is not noted in the plans.
Traffic, which repeatedly hinders the construction work, represents a major problem for the construction team of the company Stumpp.
"The drivers' ignorance of red traffic lights and barriers is already enormous," Heinze reports.
The road is closed and only the buses are allowed to pass through.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from the company Stumpp have been working on the bridge for weeks.
"The hot days were quite exhausting.
But fortunately, our friend Fritz Matt supplied us with cool mineral water,” says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and Death in Indonesia's Gold Country
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove.
She rarely even uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai Regency in the restless Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually puts a sweet potato – locally referred to as a “note” – right in the fireplace.
After half an hour, the charred tuber is removed with eager, unwashed hands and swallowed.
Degei sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also does her daily work, such as washing clothes with cloudy water from the nearby swamp.
A bucket in a roofless room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of her husband’s four wives, she was not assigned fields.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: most villagers are unemployed, and many drink heavily, and there are soldiers here.
"No one dares to walk around the village after 5 p.m.," she says.
It is a rare glimpse into daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was admitted in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia when only 1,026 elders were to vote in front of the occupation forces through a public hand survey.
An existing movement that stirred up independence against Dutch rule quickly turned against the government of Jakarta, which maintains control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers from it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea comprising the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it is deserted. The trip includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital of Jayapura to Nabire and then a morning 5-hour drive by car.
There is no public transport.
The city with about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and corrugated sheet metal roofs that have been converted by rust into various yellowish-brown shades.
Very few Indonesians have made their trip here, let alone journalists and virtually no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans worshipped a god named Uga Tamee.
There have also been other changes.
“We weren’t used to wearing these clothes,” says Degei, pointing to her vivid hand-woven turban, dark shirt, and light skirt.
“In the past, we only had leaves on our bodies.”
Papua is Indonesia’s poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it’s also Indonesia’s gold country.
The world’s largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Phoenix’s Freeport McMoran, is just 60 miles from Paniai, a New Jersey-sized highland province with 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015, Freeport mined $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has an estimated $78 billion worth of timber resources.
However, these riches are a source of misery for Papua, ensuring that Indonesia’s powerful military maintains a suffocating presence.
A 2005 study in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten this golden goose and are treated mercilessly.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua’s tribal highlands in the 1970s became genocide according to the Asia Human Rights Commission.
In the region alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters last year.
“We will lose everything,” says a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane that includes reports of last year’s atrocities, such as unlawful executions and torture — rape and electric strikes are particularly popular according to another report — and the brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations.
“It’s difficult to count the number of victims as incidents happen every week,” says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have intensified as Papua’s resources bring in an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% Christian, but the demographic development is changing as Muslim economic migrants come from the populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese Warung canteens sell fried chicken and Gado-Gado, a mixed vegetable served with peanut sauce.
Local people are struggling to keep up.
“The migrants have started selling chickens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than local Papua,” explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai local who moved to work in the provincial capital of Jayapura.
"It has cost the native Papua - the mom-mom [the women] of Papua - their market."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, promised to tackle inequalities and violations of law in Papua during his 2014 election campaign.
The former carpenter secured 27 of the total of 29 districts of Papua - including Paniai - on his way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta.
But little has changed in Papua, and today the locals feel cheated.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014, with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored," You says.
In fact, only two months after Jokowi's inauguration in October, Paniai suffered a low.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were outside singing Christmas carols in front of a campfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the dark on a motorcycle.
The frightened children told them to turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers took offense at their tone and later returned with four soldiers, according to the local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers, who had been drinking, chased and beat the group with their gun butts, said victims and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
A child, 16-year-old Yeimo, was beaten so badly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escalated the next day.
Approximately 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered in a football field outside the local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They carried ceremonial hunting bows and performed the Waita dance – running in circles and imitating a birdsong – of Papua’s Mee Pago tribe.
Some protesters began to throw stones at police and military posts.
When the mood warmed up, a command was sent to the soldiers via an internal radio: "If the masses resist more than three times, they shoot them dead," according to an official document from TIME, which was not released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto district of Enarotali, saw the impending danger and called for rest and urged the crowd to return home.
No one was in the mood to listen.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in my left wrist," he told TIME on the porch of his colorfully painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired, but says the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was crowded, many shots were fired," he added.
The local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shootings.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," said John, who, like many Indonesians, bears only one name, TIME in a dark mood.
"I saw that he was dead ... I kissed him."
Papua Police Chief Inspector Yotje Mende told reporters that his officers only wanted to “secure” her station because she was being attacked.
"We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," Papua police spokesman Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
"It's about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many others injured.
The news about the killings came to Jakarta ‘filtered’ only the following day.
For three weeks, Jokowi gave a passionate speech in Jayapura, expressing sympathy for the families of the victims and vowing to address the historical grievances in Papua.
"I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it will not happen again in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he was setting up an out-of-court mechanism for resolving historical human rights violations.
But the excuses began almost immediately.
“Most of the injuries occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 90s and early 2000s.
The point is that we have committed ourselves to addressing these violations, but there are processes that need to be passed through," he said.
Then Wiranto made a withdrawal when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on June 5, saying he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, “everything will be regulated by law,” he said.
Wiranto, accused by the UN of “crimes against humanity” that claimed more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor’s 1999 bloody independence vote, said 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been settled, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai victims accepted such claims with grim disbelief.
"I've been interviewed four times in the last three years, but there's been no progress at all," says John.
"I'm tired."
He says that years later he still lives in fear.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid to be arrested by the military, I'm afraid to be shot."
His brother Yacobus reiterated the view that the people of Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after helping bury four of the victims.
"After I buried the bodies, the military searched for me," he says.
The shootings haven't stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot at villagers in Paniai's Deiyai neighborhood.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to bring an unconscious man to the hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
Excited villagers protested in front of the company’s site office.
Police said the villagers threw stones at officers who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals say the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting at the crowd and killed one.
"We were so panicked, we're afraid there will be revenge," says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and was a witness of how the injured were quickly admitted here, according to TIME.
“I’ve been hiding in my house for two days.”
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the officers involved to be held accountable and for the police’s mobile brigade to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a source of unrest for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development reinforces the dissatisfaction of the tribes Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in the green highlands of Papua.
Many joined the “Free Papua Movement” (OPM), the rebel army that claims to defend Papua’s rights by spurring sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people have been arrested and arbitrarily detained in Paniai in recent years under the pretext of "securing national sovereignty".
Some never come back.
Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place."
Poverty increases dissatisfaction.
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is just as out of reach.
The people here grow everything they eat: especially note and fruit and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the task of women, who can each work four or five fields of sweet potato.
They keep most of the harvest for the family, while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of note cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have grown between native Papua and new migrants, who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new flight routes to Nabire Airport.
The few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and wealthier migrants.
Papua rarely have the capital or the skills necessary to run their own businesses competitively.
"The young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council.
Isolation keeps the world’s eyes away from Papua.
In addition, restrictions on international media coverage remain tense.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for lack of coordination with related institutions, although they were given rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, Human Rights Watch’s deputy director for Asia, the promises of Jokowi’s campaign to lift restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development have not been realized.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report on Indonesia's troubled easternmost provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa refusal and a blacklist," he said in a statement.
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to the immediate neighbors of Papua.
In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "various and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
The same countries have historically supported the OPM.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir denied the group's allegations and told journalists in Jakarta, "In Indonesia there is still a democratic system, and there are free media, so it is difficult to cover up the evidence of human rights cases."
The local people want more foreign governments to take note of this.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, locals broke their silence and harassed him, "We want freedom," according to a source who also attended the meeting but wants to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but Papua say they are unlikely to vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a person who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai shootings," says Gobai, the chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military, are in poor educational and health services.
Gobai says that the Paniai people, like others in Papua, see their vote for Jokowi as a "debt" that he must pay back.
“They don’t need money, they just want justice,” he said.
Despite the threats and intimidation, families of the Paniai gun victims carried out one last symbolic act of defiance: the body of a victim was buried on a site just opposite the police and the military station.
They know that they may never get justice, but at least they don’t let those responsible forget their crimes.
"One member of our family was killed," Yacobus says with his head lowered.
"What else can we do?"
Fires capture Dubai's 'torch' skyscraper for second time
A fire broke out in one of the tallest residential towers in the world in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to flee from the 337-foot-high, 79-story building.
It is the second fire to sweep through the skyscraper in just two years, which happens to be called the Torch Tower.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame.
"We slept and we got up at the fire alarm and people screaming.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor," a resident who gave his name as George told Reuters.
Dubai’s civil protection authorities said firefighting units extinguished the fire and cooled the building around 4 a.m. local time (00.00 GMT).
The government said it is working to provide shelter for those affected.
The incident can revive questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high-rise buildings around the world.
An investigation by the management of the torch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage came from the cladding, the exterior cladding to decoration or insulation.
In the UK, police said they believe that the system of plates for insulation and cladding at London’s Grenfell Tower in June may have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire that killed about 80 people.
No Davis Cup reform: Next Best-of-five
The president of the International Tennis Federation (ITF) has failed with his big Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly.
At the session in Ho Chi Minh City, the revolutionary proposal for this sport of playing Davis Cup singles on only two winning sets was not supported by the two-thirds majority required.
The five-set classics, which are often very long, but also very appreciated for that reason, are thus preserved in the traditional competition.
63.54 percent of the member states voted in favour of the reform, the goal of ITF President David Haggerty was therefore narrowly missed.
"We respect this decision, but are disappointed that our member nations have not adopted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historical competitions," Haggerty said.
We will continue to work to improve the competition.
After many objections, the proposal to hold the final in a neutral place had not even been put to the vote.
New from 2018 are only comparatively smaller details: For example, the finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the right to host the first round in the following year.
In order to reduce the costs for the organizers, the requirements in terms of training places etc. will be facilitated and players will have to complete less official media appointments before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 in 5 U.S. travelers bring banned items to the plane, a survey finds
A survey of air passengers found that more than 20 percent deliberately or unconsciously smuggled prohibited items past U.S. Transportation Security Administration checkpoints, including at least 6 percent who entered the plane while carrying accidentally prohibited knives or other items with blades.
Less than 1 percent said they had discovered that they had travelled by mistake with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people – conducted by a jet charter service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc. – also found that younger travelers are more likely to disregard the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted knowingly trying to fly something banned by the TSA, 19.7 percent were millennials, compared to less than 15 percent who were members of Generation X.
The most common items that were deliberately passed by TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3% admitted knowingly carrying items with blades through the security checkpoint, while 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of male respondents also confirmed that they had intentionally brought prohibited drugs into the plane.
The company said it had surveyed travelers across the country to find out how many accidentally brought smuggling through airport security and how many had intentionally done so.
It’s no surprise that the people most likely to carry smuggling — knowingly or unknowingly — through security were the ones who fly the most.
However, the company points out that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often unsure what liquids they are allowed to take or how much of them.
So it’s no surprise that the largest amount of items confiscated by the TSA are forbidden liquids.
For a while, people thought the TSA could view books as smuggling.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk: Tens of Thousands of Tesla Customers Cancel Orders
Elon Musk is pleased to announce the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3".
He has so far omitted that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the ever-triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla CEO Elon Musk revealed for the first time in announcing the latest quarterly balance sheet a different, less brilliant figure: that of the cancellations on the new mass market model 3.
Musk had frequently advertised in recent months with the more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose delivery is just beginning.
Now Musk admits: Of the total of 518,000 pre-orders, 63,000 have already been withdrawn.
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations.
In the event of a cancellation, Tesla will refund the 1000 Euro (US$1000 in the US and <0xC2><0xA3>1000 in the UK) "reservation deposit" in full.
Currently, there are 455,000 such non-binding reservations, Musk admitted in a conference call with analysts.
However, the Tesla CEO does not believe that the cancellation of around twelve percent of all orders so far could become a problem.
His argument: The challenge of the ambitious growth targets is not demand, but production.
Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
In 2018, it should be - all models taken together - 500,000, in 2020 a million.
The demand for this is obviously there.
According to Musk, there are currently 1,800 reservations per day.
If you order a Model 3 today, you can expect to be delivered at the earliest in the second half of 2018 – if Tesla manages to drive its brand-new, never tested in practice production lines without major interruptions with maximum utilization.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
However, if there are major delays, then the non-binding of the reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
Because then the company cannot prevent dissatisfied customers from running away in crowds.
EPA Chief Pruitt Withdraws for Delaying Obama-Era Emissions Reduction Rules
One day after being sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, withdrew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of Obama-era rules to reduce the emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change as his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administrations.
He did not mention the lawsuit that had been brought against his previous position in a federal appeals court.
It is about a deadline that expired on October 1 for states to comply with 2015 ground-level ozone standards.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by one year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid “interfering in local decisions or hampering economic growth.”
Pruitt, who was Oklahoma State Attorney before being appointed by President Donald Trump, has long been a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved on to block or delay regulations that the chemical and fossil fuel industry oppose.
The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal setback for Pruitt’s regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a Federal Court of Appeals in Washington ruled that the EPO administrator overstepped his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of an Obama administration rule that required oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement published Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that his turnaround in ozone standards simply strengthens the EPO’s willingness to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely compliance with the new standards.
"Under previous administrations, the EPO often failed to meet the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be charged by activist groups and others, and in an agreement set the deadline for implementation," Pruitt said, who sued the EPO more than a dozen times in his previous job.
"We don't believe in regulation through court proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the law and the authority that it gives us seriously."
Nevertheless, the EPO's statement stated that Pruitt will eventually use its "power of delay and all other legally available powers" to ensure that the regulations are "based on a solid policy and the best information available."
The Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive revision of the ozone rules.
A bill approved last month is intended to delay implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who headed the coalition of states that sued the EPO this week, said the group intends to maintain legal pressure.
“The reversal of the EPA – according to our lawsuits – is an important gain for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the over 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities,” Schneiderman said.
New York joined in this case California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia.
Soil ozone is created when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The emerging smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people, contributing to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health representatives and environmentalists cheered over Pruitt’s surprising change of course.
“It’s disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable move from the one responsible for protecting the air we breathe in,” said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight against the Trump administration's ideological crusade of offering itself to environmental polluters and their special interests."
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church
750 years of St. Hilarius Church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the Bergkirche, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen will be invited to a serenade on Sunday, 16 July, at 4.30 pm.
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius complex is a popular place to stay.
Visitors to the sixth charity serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.
The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made Tumlingen’s friends and supporters their concern.
Walter Martini emphasizes: "It is a unique village gem".
In 1267, the St. Hilarius Chapel was first mentioned in the Württembergische Urkundenbuch: Count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church of Tumlingen and the Vogtei" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 marks of silver.
According to the text of the document, besides the former parish church, there was also a stately courtyard on the Tumlinger Berg, to which the church or the patronage belonged and not vice versa.
So people lived there too.
As can be seen from the description of the Oberamt Freudenstadt in 1858, next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still visible today in the village of Tumlingen, the "mountain" was the third, the stately settlement center of the village.
Ancient maps from around the year 1600 underpin these historical facts.
The patronage law originated from the early medieval ecclesiastical law.
A master who built, equipped, and occupied a church with a pastor continued to be the owner of that church and could also inherit that church.
This included the right to appoint a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The larger of the two broke up at Christmas in 1673.
The newly acquired bell first sounded in 1692, but had to be handed over later in World War II in 1942.
In the Thirty Years' War (1616-1648) the windows were smashed and the bell ropes were stolen.
The roof was leaking.
In 1796, French troops camped near the church.
They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.
Remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.
Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius Cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.
In 1823, the cemetery was enlarged and the Hilarius Church was demolished.
Only the church tower was left standing.
On New Year's Eve 1834, a storm split the church tower and half of it collapsed.
To prevent an accident, the tower was demolished.
Only the tower dwarf, which still exists today, was preserved as a witness to the 750-year-old church history.
Today, Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem from the "Schaffige Rentner" as successors of Dieter Dockhorn maintain the Hilarius facility.
As organizers, the friends and sponsors of Tumlingen invite to the sixth serenade on Sunday, 16 July, to the old cemetery to the St. Hilarius Chapel.
This is designed by the combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with speeches by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
Head of the town Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.
The program starts at 4.30 p.m.
Admission is from 3.30 pm.
At the end of the serenade, a drink takes place in front of the cemetery.
"Enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with the wide view over meadows towards the forest", the organizers emphasize the fantastic view.
The Serenade takes place only in dry weather.
The organizers hope for many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hilarius facility, which is important for Tumlingen and Hörschweiler.
The friends and supporters of Tumlingen feel particularly committed to home care, as Serenade organizer Walter Martini reaffirms.
Association wants to have approval of wind turbines tested
"Boisheim defends itself" sees no legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned to the Landrat.
The association "Boisheim wehrt sich" has asked Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette.
It was unlawful.
The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016, no wind turbines could have been approved in the Boisheimer Nette, since at the time in Viersen only a wind power concentration zone existed at the city boundary to Schwalmtal.
Within this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines are basically possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes an exclusion of the use of wind energy for the rest of the urban area.
Such zones are intended to prevent a "spargeling" of the landscape.
Although the city of Viersen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette a few days earlier by a change in the land use plan - but this had not been approved by the district government of Düsseldorf, due to a formal flaw.
"Due to the lack of planning requirements, the granted approval decision is still illegal and therefore also withdrawn," said Christoph Erkens, chairman of "Boisheim wehrt sich".
Current state of affairs: The city council has again decided on the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette before the summer break; an approval from the district government is still pending.
Erkens: "At this point, the granting of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is excluded by planning law".
The circle confirms the receipt of the request.
"The corresponding letters have been received at the Kreis Viersen since last week," a spokesperson said.
The circle takes them as an opportunity to re-examine the matter.
However, they are unlikely to result in the procedure being stopped.
With regard to ongoing proceedings at the administrative court, the district did not want to comment on the content of the argument of the association "Boisheim wehrt sich" on Thursday.
NEW Re, a subsidiary of NEW, is planning the construction of four wind turbines, each 200 metres high, on an area on the Boisheimer Nette.
Already last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved, had leased contracts with the owner of the approximately 65-hectare site.
With the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity demand of around 11,400 households will be covered - that corresponds to around one fifth of the electricity demand of all Viersen households.
New Re intends to invest around 20 million euros.
Last summer, Viersen’s City Council gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Linnich wind farm near Aachen, as well as a stake in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg in the district of Heinsberg.
Car and tractor crash together: Woman dies in terrible accident
A terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning around 10 a.m. on the L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhine-Lahn-Kreis).
A woman was fatally injured.
Two more people were slightly injured.
The road was closed for hours.
According to police information, a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich drove the L 333 in the direction of Bogel with her car as part of the accompanying driving with her 53-year-old mother.
City and retailers plan "home shopping" weekend
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are to rediscover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September.
The Gewerbeverein and the city administration want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to lure the residents to shopping in the city center.
As the chairman of the trade association, Christian König, announced, the "home shopping" weekend should raise the awareness of customers about what offers the own city has to offer away from the usual supermarket goods.
A market with regional suppliers, similar to the weekly market, is therefore planned.
In addition, local companies should present themselves with their training places.
In addition, the shops of the city center should invite to "midnight shopping".
The action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the nearest region.
In preparation are commercials on the radio, an internet video and printed bags, which point to the action weekend, according to Christian König.
The city administration and trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
With this, the trade association and the city are entering another stage of the project "Attractive Downtown".
These include new offers such as the first "active day" to the fountain festival including a Sunday for sale, discussions with all tradesmen and hosts to encourage them to participate actively.
Attractive offers for Saturday and the waiver of parking fees on this day are also part of the concept.
In addition, customer potential is to be newly or again unlocked.
These include spa guests and tourists.
But also many locals would have lost sight of the city centre when shopping.
In the end, everyone would have to contribute to revitalizing the city center - to landlords, the businesses of the whole city and clubs.
It is necessary to overcome the lethargy with a network, which has partly spread, King had said in the spring.
Birgit Streich, head of the IHK-Center in Mühlhausen, said that for the first time, five Thuringian cities will participate on the third national "home shopping" day.
In addition to Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.
The day should "promote the appreciation of local trade and highlight its importance for the common good of our cities," said Streich.
The action under the leadership of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen with his buying behavior can influence his direct environment himself.
Two dead and several injured after explosion at U.S. school
During construction work, there was a gas explosion in the school building.
New people were injured.
In a gas explosion in the U.S. city of Minneapolis, two people have been killed and nine others injured, some of them severely.
According to the fire brigade on Wednesday (local time) was still an injured in critical condition.
One person died when part of a school building collapsed in the explosion.
A first missing person was also recovered later.
The dead were employees of the school.
As the cause of the accident, the authorities suspected work on a gas pipeline.
During the holiday season, few people stayed in the Minnehaha Academy building.
Trump Pressured Mexico for Paying the Border Wall After Leaked Transcripts of Phone Calls
Transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been published by the Washington Post.
On January 27, Trump called on Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop publicly saying that he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The US president insulted him for publicly denounced the wall and reportedly told him, "You can't tell the press."
Trump launched his presidential campaign with a promise to build a wall on the southern U.S. border, and vowed to let Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also released, revealing a tense exchange.
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that taking over a trade for U.S. refugees who emigrated to Australia was "ridiculous", "mystic" and "stupid" and that insisting on the trade mediated by the Obama administration would make him look like a "stupid" after he proposed a ban on the relocation of refugees to the U.S.
Mr. Trump ended the call after saying to Mr. Turnbull, "this is the most uncomfortable call for the whole day."
Moore's Ford Massacre: Activists Resurrect Racist Lynchact as Call for Justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in rural Monroe, Georgia, and rumbled towards the Ford Bridge of Moore.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns stepped out to block its way.
The leader of the mob – a middle-aged man in a pinstripe suit – took a long train at his cigar and looked checking through the windshield.
Inside, the inmates were frightened.
"We want this n ---- r Roger!" cried the man.
"Get him out of the car!"
Screams tore the silence as a young black man was dragged from the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this horrible scene played on July 22 is just a recreation.
But then, when a sling was thrown around the neck of "Roger", almost everyone in the audience echoed very real sighs.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have come back to Moore's Ford Bridge to mimic the night when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one has ever been charged with the murders.
"It's really unbelievable that not a single person has been arrested in all these years - even though we see them in our communities, even though we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who assists in organizing the resettlement.
“It’s a stain on a story, but it’s a burden on our souls.”
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Georgia State Congressman and a lifelong civil rights activist.
For him, the recreation serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want law enforcement, we want termination, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we need to get justice," he said.
"We cannot attain healing and reconciliation until we receive justice."
A forensic surgeon lays a sheet over the body of one of the victims of the Moore-Ford lynch on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI files obtained from NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were suspected in the lynching process.
But no one was ever charged.
Although the suspects have been on the loose for decades, civil rights activists say that the double motivation for the Lynch actions has always been known throughout the city: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a decision by the Supreme Court allowed the black citizens of Georgia to vote for the first time in the summer primary campaign.
Approximately at the same time as the election, according to the FBI, black farmer Roger Malcom stabbed a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a fight – allegedly because of a woman.
Brooks said the rumor in the city was that Hester had slept with Malcom's wife Dorothy and that the baby she was carrying was not her husband's.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to free Malcom from prison, according to the FBI.
He was accompanied to jail by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But as they then moved away from the prison and approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a lynch mob surrounded the car.
"It turns out that it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders," the FBI said in a statement.
"It's also obvious that there was a conspiracy between state and local law enforcement that was not only involved in the murders, removing evidence, and covering up the identity of witnesses".
Brooks formulates it even more concisely.
"It was a suffrage massacre," he said.
“They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: ‘If you register and if you vote, this will happen to you.’”
For almost a decade, Cassandra Greene has led the annual recreation of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murders.
Their portrayal is vivid, poignant, and is rooted in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe no longer exists in America.
It’s hard to look, and even harder to look away, but Greene said that’s the point.
“We don’t want to talk about the lynching because we will then be confronted with its ugliness in all of us,” she said.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or hear what I've been through".
The rehearsals for this year’s production began in June, and on the first day, nearly 30 actors – a dozen whites and the rest blacks – crowded into a room and listened as Greene started a well-recorded overview of the play.
Wade Marbaugh is Greene's co-director.
He has played the role of chief clan member for years, but he said the role will never be easier.
"I feel dirty because I'm not like that," Marbaugh said.
"But I think it's very important to keep this story alive because we don't want to go back to these times."
On the other side of the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, rehearsed their lines.
The play begins with Malcom screaming at Hester and harassing him, angry that he has slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n --- he, get out of my property!"
Rascona responds to the fire.
There's a break.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) bursts into laughter.
Greene laughs the loudest.
"What?!" asked Rascona.
He is alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
"No," said Greene, still giggling.
"I just don't think white people said 'n' then."
"Yes," joked one of the other black actors.
"You just have to hit the hard 'R.'."
And that is where the energy in the room shifts, a sense of camaraderie replaces the discomfort.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four people killed.
The scene starts again.
This time, when Rascona says the N word, he says it sharply and emphatically.
Absolutely no one laughs.
This repetition ends violently and quickly.
There are screams, shots and then silence.
A woman dressed in a funeral gown stands over the bodies of the actors and performs Billie Holiday's mourning homage "Strange Fruit".
Your voice breaks every second word.
About a hundred meters behind, a group of about four dozen spectators wipes sweat and tears from their eyes.
The audience is almost equally divided between black and white.
A couple has come from Ithaca, New York to see the performance, many just come down the street.
They’ve all been experiencing Georgia’s oppressive moisture for nearly eight hours as Brooks takes them on a pilgrimage to the tombs of the Malcoms and Dorseys.
Up to this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, standing on the same land where the Lynch murders took place, the air feels spooky.
As the last notes of the song end, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the corpses.
Children squat at their heads, register the fake blood and silent bodies and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," murmurs a little boy, as if he wanted to remember.
After a few minutes, Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw away the lynching rope and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the clan member.
Nick Rascona hugs two of his fellow players and then breaks down in their arms in tears, the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through with him.
"It's okay," one of the women whispered.
“We know that’s not in your heart.
You did it for a reason.”
Later, the audience sits down with the actors for dinner.
At a table, a white couple from Atlanta chats excitedly about the recreation with a black couple they have just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words about the feeling the performance left behind.
"It's hard to hear these horrible words and deeds ... come from people who look like you and do it because they look like you," she said.
“What this really does to me makes me believe the lynching is still going on,” she added, “nowadays it’s just called police shooting.”
In the same room, Tyrone holds Brooks' court at his table, eating and remembering civil rights.
He said he had already started planning the performance next year.
“The recreation is inspiring in a way, because it describes the horror of what we have endured, but it’s also a moment of learning,” he said.
"It's like if we don't learn from it, it can happen again.
Those who do not study their own history, those who do not know their own history, are condemned to repeat it."
"Götterdämmerung" reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth
Also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner’s monumental work, director Frank Castorf relies on a colourful and frivolous staging in front of a gigantic six-story backdrop.
The revolving stage (designed by Aleksandar Denic) shows either a shabby street corner with the rest of the wall and the Dönerbude in Berlin, a "Plaste und Elaste" logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange.
In front of it parks an open Mercedes oldtimer, in which the Rhine daughters pose as rocker girls, or alternatively an Isetta.
Stacked oil barrels are reminiscent of Castorf's leitmotif - money, power, and greed - which runs through his "ring" staging.
The three Rhine daughters - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize wonderfully as in "Rheingold".
Kess seduces Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), drags a body into the trunk in Hollywood fashion and gives the Krawallo clique.
Stephen Milling sings the delightfully nasty hag that surrounds the aura of a heavyweight boxer.
Brutal the scene when he kills Siegfried.
Later, Gunther (Markus Eichen) has to believe in it.
The audience thanked the ensemble with strong applause.
Foster, Milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski are celebrated in a stormy manner, who modestly bends his hands to the Merkel-Raute.
The festival orchestra, which appears on stage for the first time, is highly applauded - again in casual casual clothing, given the great heat.
The appearance of Frank Castorf and his directing team was highly anticipated.
If he had had to give a good pipe concert in 2013, there was great cheer five years later, in which the isolated "Buh"-calls went down.
Festival director Katharina Wagner may have been happy about it.
"You notice that the audience has grown together with the "ring" in a way," she had said shortly before the performance of the dpa.
The audience had not only made some kind of peace with Castorf, but it had also grown an understanding of his point of view.
I have a positive summary.
Max Menge works as a volunteer
They work in several places during their volunteer year.
Where else?
Quantity: Usually in Steinfurt in the furniture exchange, once a week I help out here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
I also worked in open school all day.
What are your experiences with it?
Quantity: It’s a beautiful, broad spectrum that I see here.
I am dealing with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
You are now 26 years old, so a late-professional volunteer.
How'd that happen?
Quantity: I graduated high school.
And then a civil engineering degree, say, successfully discontinued.
I realized for myself that it is the wrong thing for me and I want to do something else, work with people.
And then I wondered, what are you doing?
Make a social year, there is an insight, you can see how it really is on the spot, perhaps in the focus.
And was it?
Quantity: I have collected great impressions.
I will start my studies in social services in the winter semester.
I will study dual, probably do a social worker training at the Jugendamt Herne and study at the University of Applied Sciences in Hamm.
Isn’t it a bit unusual to have several different locations during voluntary service?
Quantity: Yes, it is very variable.
It always depends on where you make your FSJ.
You can do it from a retirement home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work.
With me it was very varied.
I was also partly in the OGS, i.e. in the afternoon care.
For me, that was exactly the right thing that irritated me.
I could see my own strengths and see how it really goes.
Unlike in civil engineering studies?
Quantity: Of course, this is not about calculating statics.
You always have other people in front of your head, who each have a completely different story behind them.
Whether a refugee, or a teenager who has been taken out of the family - you always have to deal with it individually.
Very interesting.
And you had no fear of touch?
Quantity: I'm not the guy for that.
It is an area that gives you a lot.
Lots of love, lots of kindness.
There are also negative moments, but life is like that.
Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs and cuts dividend to revive business
British education group Pearson said on Friday it will cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividend by 72 percent as another restructuring program is launched to overcome the pressure the company is facing.
The job cuts, which John Fallon, General Manager, announced predominantly for the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019, come in addition to his previous restructuring, in which 4,000 jobs were already lost.
In a third cost reduction program in May, Pearson announced a plan to cut costs by an additional <0xC2><0xA3>300 million ($394 million) to revive a business that has been hit by the rapid move toward digital learning.
The company, which had sold its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann last month, said the outlook for the fiscal year remained unchanged after a 1 percent increase to <0xC2><0xA3>2.05 billion in the first half of the year.
Convoy attack from Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital of Kabul, killed a NATO soldier and injured several others, officials say.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, NATO said in a statement.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were also killed in the incident in the Qarabagh district.
The bombing is the last act of violence to hit Afghanistan this month – more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
In a statement, NATO said the explosion occurred Thursday evening when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a “person-carried improvised explosive device.”
The statement states that all the injured are in a stable condition and are being treated at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram Airfield.
Correspondents say the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a major concern for NATO troops in nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which about 20% in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shiite district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they carried out the attack.
On May 31, a massive bombing in the center of the city killed more than 150 people with the country’s deadliest militant attack since US-led troops forced the Taliban out of power in 2001.
The violence underscores the precarious security situation in Afghanistan as US President Donald Trump weighs in on increasing the number of US troops supporting the military and police in the country.
Correspondents say that the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public trust in the government, its policies and, in particular, in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPO reverses decision to delay smog rule after lawsuit
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has repealed a decision to delay a regulation by the Obama administration that states are obliged to curb smog-causing emissions a day after 15 states sued the agency for the move.
The EPO late Wednesday announced the decision to push forward the so-called “Ozone 2015 regulations,” saying it demonstrated the agency’s commitment to cooperate with states.
"We believe in dialogue with and in responding to our state partners," said Scott Pruitt, chief executive of the EPO.
Pruitt had announced the EPO’s intention in June to delay ozone regulations – which measure pollutant emissions in a part of the country to determine where cuts need to be made to meet stricter air quality standards – by one year until October 2018.
A group of 15 mostly democratic states, along with the district of Colombia, filed a lawsuit on Tuesday, saying the effort was illegal.
President Donald Trump’s administration has tried to pull back a wide range of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that, according to Trump, is supposed to boost economic growth.
However, the efforts have triggered the setback of Democrats and conservation groups, who are concerned about the impact of larger emissions on public health.
The EPA’s website says inhaling air that contains ozone can “reduce lung function and amplify respiratory symptoms” such as asthma.
City Council wants community space
In the end, the decision was clear: with two votes against, the municipal council of Fluorn-Winzeln decides to set up a common room in the future senior housing complex.
Before the discussion, there is an important information: The purchase contract for the still missing part of the property has been signed, Mayor Bernhard Tjaden reports.
Although it will still take some time for the area belonging to the church community to become the property of the community, there is now no longer any planning obstacle for the project to be voted on by a private investor.
There is a discussion about a common area.
One of the two investors still in the boat offered to meet the community.
On the ground floor, it would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with at least 70 square meters of space for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the municipal council intend to provide such a communal space not only as a meeting point for the residents of senior housing, but openly into the municipality.
As an example, the word "knit café" made the rounds.
The decision, which was predetermined by the allocation of funds for the current budget already last autumn, is being sweetened by funding opportunities.
The building is located in the renovation area.
According to Tjaden, the establishment of a common area would be eligible with 60 percent of 30 percent.
In order to signal to the investor that they do not want to throw a club between their legs in this respect, the proposal states that both the saddle - which is based on the surrounding development - and the canopy roof - which reduces the height of the trunk and makes the construction more economical - would be possible.
Unnecessarily, not only does Wilfried Sohmer mean this addition.
If it helps, he passes the panel unanimously.
It’s not that easy in the common room.
Daniela Ruf refers to the many own buildings, with which you don't get quite ahead, but you now lean out the common room window, she says: "I'm having a hard time with it".
Yvonne Staiger is absolutely in favour of the common area - but absolutely against municipal participation.
It sees behind it a covert subsidy to already wealthy or even foreign investors.
This is not the case, because with the acquisition of the land, one does not give a grant, but gets a real counter value, which can be marketed in case of doubt, is the counter-argument.
Staiger's request to split the decision accordingly is supported by three proponents.
So it remains with two votes against the original program, which Stefan Haller summarizes in this way: "If we take the decision in this way, we will take a huge step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure."
Collision with car: cyclist tossed on road
On Wednesday, while crossing the road, an 82-year-old cyclist was caught by a car in Garath and seriously injured.
As the police announced, the 82-year-old Langenfelder had been on the bike on the bike path of the Schwarzer Weg road coming from Hilden at 12.20 pm.
The senior wanted to cross the road at the height of the road Am Buchholzer Busch.
A driver driving in the same direction gave him priority.
When the Langenfelder drove onto the road, however, he apparently did not pay attention to the counter-traffic.
He collided with a car that was driving a 66-year-old Hildenerin.
The man was thrown into the street.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to a hospital with a rescue car.
FC Bayern Munich must give up David Alaba and Thiago in Supercup against Borussia Dortmund
The Super Cup takes place without him: David Alaba has to let the game kick off against Dortmund.
With staff concerns, FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory game of the new season.
Seven professionals are missing the defending champion in the Supercup against the cup winner.
The staff concerns at the German football record champion Bayern Munich are getting bigger before the Supercup on Saturday (20.30 h / ZDF and Eurosport) at cup winner Borussia Dortmund.
Coach Carlo Ancelotti has to give up David Alaba in the duel with the BVB.
This was confirmed by the Italians on Friday.
In addition, the Munich-based Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat are missing.
For the five defeats in the last six test matches, Ancelotti blamed his team's physical condition and lack of balance in the game.
“We know we’re not in the best physical condition,” Ancelotti said, adding, “The most important point is the balance in the team.
It was not good lately."
However, the 58-year-old believes in an increase in performance in the first official duty game of the season.
"Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team will show these qualities.
The team is ready.
We want to play intelligently," said Ancelotti, who expects a "difficult, intense game."
The duel between the two German football heavyweights captivates the fans.
The game is sold out with 81,360 spectators, the German Football League (DFL) announced on Friday.
Hiking from star to star in the resin
In the Harz, the first nationwide "star path" is to be created.
This is planned by the Association Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg.
There is a planetary path in Göttingen - since 2003.
A "star path" meets the information need of many resin visitors, it was said.
It combines nature, science, exercise and athletic performance.
The members want to set up panels along the planned route and provide information about stars and constellations.
In a first phase until 2018, the association plans "easily accessible installations at five to six locations" in the Upper Harz.
St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiß and Sieber are in question.
The information on the boards is to be supplemented via the Internet.
Therefore, good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of locations.
Accessibility is also a criterion.
Later, the Star Path will be extended train by train.
"On the star path, viewers learn a lot of interesting things, for example about the physics of the individual stars," the association explained.
They also learned why stars have different colors or why one star is brighter than another, even though it is farther away.
It also indicates in which constellation a selected star is located and when it can be best seen.
The association has been operating the highest observatory in northern Germany since 2014 in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg.
The site in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany, according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation.
Often, the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy can be clearly seen with the naked eye from there.
Since 2003, on the initiative of the sponsorship association Planetarium Göttingen, there has been something similar to the planned Sternenwerg - the planetary path.
Starting in front of Gebhards Hotel in the Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planetary path with its steles leads up to the Hainberg and the observatory - as well as an "extraterrestrial" location in Diemarden (community of equals) with the planet Sedna.
The steles with the individual planets - including the dwarf planet-degraded Pluto at the endpoint - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion.
The Earth thus shrinks to a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter, while the Sun, exactly 75 meters away, measures at least 70 centimeters.
The entire distance of the planet path is about four kilometers.
While the light from the sun to Pluto takes about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour to get to the stele with Pluto.
Pedestrians are faster than the light in space.
The march to the next fixed star, however, would take another half year.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing fight in the near future under <0xC2><0xA3>147, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia, the unbeaten World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked down the corridor to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization super featherweight champion.
After Garcia's victory by unanimous decision over former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on Showtime, both fighters are members of the top five pound-for-pound list.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, "How are you, Champion?
I wish you good luck.”
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday evening at 7 pm on ESPN.
As the couple posed for photos, Lomachenko's manager Egis Klimas noted that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect order of magnitude."
"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia recalled.
"I rose for Broner [to 140 pounds], but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to get down to lightweight.
And he has to move on to lightweights [135 pounds] and then we fight.
This is what the fans demand.
Let's give them that."
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxing needs this fight."
Klimas asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy Lomachenko has to fight with a 135-pound debut this year to agree a date with Garcia next summer (37-0, 30 knockouts) who also has interest in fighting against the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight title fight at the forum on September 23.
"This fight could take place in pay-per-view mode because all the fans asked for it," Garcia said, expressing himself openly later on, struggling with the network that offers the best financial package.
We're the best.
No other names can generate this kind of attention.
Whenever you are ready..."
Garcia said he valued Lomachenko as "an enormous fighter," and he may be participating in his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko stopped at the generous praise for Garcia and said that he thinks the Riverside three-fighting champion looks "very slow, sorry Mikey ... you wanted the co-off".
Garcia said the focus was to show strength, then boxing.
Both said they could feel the momentum built up for their own struggle.
“This is the fight that needs to be fought.
No other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I'm more than happy to work on it," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, “I’ve been waiting for the top fighters, and that’s Mikey.
It will be a great fight.”
Four injured after tyre breakdown
In an accident on the A7 on Thursday afternoon, four people were partly seriously injured.
According to initial information, the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle around 4.30 p.m. just before the market width junction, presumably after a tyre breaker.
The car hurled to the right into the embankment, where it overturned and then lay on the roof in the green strip.
The four occupants - two adults and two children - were partly seriously injured in the accident.
During the initial care of the injured by the rescue service, the A7 was closed to the north for about an hour, after which traffic on the left lane could be routed past the accident site.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "Three chain works better"
Andre Hoffmann hopes that after the 2-2 start of the season against Braunschweig, the optimization of the defence formation in Aue will bring points.
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first game of the season, and with the result too, if the two goals had not been in the 2-2 against Braunschweig.
"That was two goals too much, and we have to be even more careful in Aue," says the defender of Fortuna Düsseldorf.
In the Ore Mountains, the triple chain should also be further optimized.
And a goal after a free kick the fortunes no longer want to catch themselves.
"For the future, no one will be on the line next to Michael (Rensing)."
Hoffmann is convinced that his team can cope better with the three-chain even after the experience in the preparation than with the four-chain.
"I don't yet know how we're going to act in Aue," says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his cause, "because we currently have players in the three-way on the half positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann who can build well," Hoffmann said.
"The prerequisite is, but that we harmonise even better and we don't afford so many playback errors in the build."
Of course, Hoffmann goes to Aue to win the game.
"But if you can talk about a failed start after a draw, I don't know.
The performance could be quite ok," Hoffmann said.
"But if we can stand with four points on Sunday and focus on the cup, we will certainly be able to talk about a good start to the season."
His coach didn’t want to know about it.
"I only judge the start of the season after six to eight match days," said Friedhelm Funkel, who does not want to speak of an advantage over Aue, just because the game of the Saxons in Heidenheim had to be cancelled prematurely because of a storm.
"Now they can start the season with a home game," said Funkel, and Hoffmann believes that the players from Aue might even be a bit fresher, as they don't have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against an ascent favorite in the bones.
"But they don't know 100 percent where they are right now," Fortuna's central defender said.
Although the guests from the Rhineland go as an easy favorite on Sunday to the meeting in the finally (almost) finished stadium of Aue.
"The fact that we sweep them away just because we have the claim to be among the first six is nonsense," says Funkel, whose record is quite positive in just one defeat against Aue in nine games.
"There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga that you have to beat from the outset," says Fortuna's head coach.
"Making such a statement would be arrogant and presumptuous".
And so Funkel does not want to see his players on Sunday.
New results of Swedish asylum age assessment tests published
Recent results from tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, who have undergone a new method of medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80 percent of the individuals tested are over 18 years of age. But not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Forensic Medicine Authority (Rätsmedicinalverket) started conducting the tests last year.
During the asylum procedure, they should make the assessment of age more accurate after the Swedish Migration Authority (Migrationsverket) was criticised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minors.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases to be tested and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to July 31, 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were assessed as 18 or older, while in another 25 cases, the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was "possibly 18 years of age or older."
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person "possibly is under 18 years of age."
The tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are consistent in recent months.
"We don't see a big difference in the statistics of the past few months, the numbers are pretty constant," he told The Local magazine.
The high proportion of cases in which the person has been judged to be over 18 years of age does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied about his age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests, saying that there are 442 cases that “suggest that the person being examined is 18 years of age or older.”
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published findings, it found that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old this year.
The method of medical age assessment, in which X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI images of knee joints are taken, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticized in some areas.
A skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work involves assessing the biological maturity of humans to see if they have gone through puberty sooner or later than usual.
"I had reason to think about it, and I don't think the type of measurement should be used.
Judging the biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can’t say it for sure, we shouldn’t pretend we can,” he told the Metro newspaper.
However, Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests: “In general, you can say that the risk of misjudging a child as an adult is low.
The biggest risk is if the person is just under 18, in this case that's about 10 percent."
Fully in the plan
Work on the three bridges of Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well.
On Wednesday, a seven-ton concrete section was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance to Lauterbach.
"We are very good at time, it's going great," says Reinhold Leicht, construction manager at the Department of Roads and Transport at the government office in Freiburg.
In April, work began on all three bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach that were in need of renovation.
The construction is scheduled for October and Easy is sure that the schedule is complied with.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.
It is a vaulted bridge made of concrete, covered with red sandstone and has a total length of 4.80 meters.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it is now in the years.
In order to ensure stability and road safety, the three buildings are now undergoing thorough renovation.
The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.
They are made of red sandstone.
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve and 10.60 meters long, respectively.
The bridge at the entrance to Lauterbach has now received a 1.30 meter wide and seven tons heavy so-called bridge cap on the north side on Wednesday morning.
This is a rim fixture, which is also used as an operating route.
A 2.20-metre-wide bridge cap will be installed on Friday in the southern part of the bridge.
Then the pedestrian path should run.
The special thing about this is that these are finished parts, a patent from Schramberg company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.
The laying of cables through the building in Lauterbach has required a special touch of fingertip.
Because there is also a fiber optic cable, to which many companies are connected.
The residents were informed about the project in advance of the work by handouts.
In addition, fish and crabs had to be fished off first.
For the bridges between the construction yard building and the collecting pond in the direction of Schramberg, traffic is regulated by a traffic light.
For the construction work on the bridge at the entrance to the village of Lauterbach, the road in the area of the bridge at the level of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Sieben Linden" is fully closed.
The cost of the three bridge renovations totals 700,000 euros.
It is all financed by the country.
AfD in Gerolstein: Colorful protest at German potato salad
It does not happen so often that parties are pulling together, but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany (AfD), it comes together, which is otherwise difficult to reconcile.
The parties represented in the Vulkaneifel district council (CDU, SPD, Greens, FDP, FWG, Left) belong to a broad alliance that shows its flag peacefully on this day, because the AfD in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle Rondell invites to the poster "big election campaign start".
And brings well-known names to the start - such as Alice Weidel, who together with Alexander Gauland forms the top duo for the Bundestag elections on September 24, and the deputy Federal President Beatrix von Storch.
But those who are on site hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the AfD learners, but to demonstrate.
The motto "The Eifel remains colorful".
The city picnic was originally planned under the motto "All at one table" on the fountain square, but now takes place in the parking lot below the roundabout - and thus right in front of the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the Stadthalle.
A colorful picture that offers itself.
And what Christa Karoli, chairman of Forums Eine Welt and one of the authoritative organizers, really enjoys: "Amazing how many people have come together here".
There is music and lots of food, including an "original German potato salad, which the AfD could eat without any problems," says the woman who brought it.
The police have ordered many officers to Gerolstein, they show presence especially at the station, which is only a few meters from the venues.
How did the AfD get to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes of the AfD Vulkaneifel reports that he has made an effort for such an event and received the contract.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had initially asked in Daun, but there received a rejection because because of the already built Laurentiuskirmes there were not enough parking spaces available.
So now the Rondell, Hompes is pleased that "we can have such a nice event here".
Looking at the event on the Rondell square, he says: "This is the good right of the people, the main thing, it remains peaceful".
Around 8 p.m., a band will provide entertainment on the Rondell forecourt, and various speakers in the Stadthalle, including the Rhineland-Palatinate AfD chairman Uwe Junge.
In the hall are about 200 listeners waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election, Alice Weidel, and the deputy Federal President Beatrix von Storch to make their speeches.
The police presence is unchanged, but so far the officials have had a quiet evening.
The AfD event lasts a little more than an hour, the guests in the forecourt have a longer breath, but also there is a time to clean up shortly after 9 pm.
The police can escape - no special incidents.
Trombone meets trumpet
A rehearsal with the Wolfacher trombonist Frederic Belli will take place in the series of Haslacher Klosterkonzerte tomorrow, Sunday, at 8 p.m. in the Klosterkirche.
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov he gives a concert under the motto "Black Sea meets Black Forest", or even "Balkan Folklore" meets a classical German training with roots in wind music.
Both soloists are winners and prizewinners of numerous international competitions and hold solo positions in leading European orchestras.
Petkov is a solo trumpeter with the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is a solo trombonist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both combine the desire not only to cross the boundaries of their instruments, but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres.
Johann Sebastian Bach resonates in the two as if in a new garment, Daniel Schnyder's "World Music" combines with Bulgarian folklore, and in the piece "Exchange Suite" by jazz echo laureate Nils Wogram, classical music, jazz and free play blend into a fascinating total work of art.
This core piece of the program was first presented in Freiburg only this spring with huge success.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and more: The Haslacher Klosterkirche with its special acoustics is consciously included in the concert.
Kristen Stewart talks about her bisexuality
"Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives.
But I want to try everything out," Kristen Stewart said openly about her bisexuality.
“When I bite in grilled cheese, I think, ‘Oh that was cool, what’s next?’”
The Hollywood star's most famous relationship was with her "Twilight" colleague Robert Pattinson, who eventually broke up bitterly.
Despite all of this, the brunette actress assures Harper's Bazaar magazine: "I was seriously in love with everyone I've dated.
Or do you think I played it?”
After her separation, Kristen admitted that she was bisexual: "I've always lived the dualism and seriously believed in it.
It has never confused or hindered me.
I just never liked not being taken seriously."
She was particularly affected by this, according to "Bang Showbiz", but in school, when she preferred to dress like a boy: "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me a lot.
When I was eleven, the kids told me I would look like a boy.
I really felt attacked, scared and ashamed.
Now I look back and think, ‘Girl, be proud of yourself!’”
She doesn’t like to explain her love life to the public: “People expect you to behave in a certain way and that annoys me.
And maybe some call me ungrateful, but I don’t like having to justify myself in front of the whole public.”
The Governor of West Virginia Announces He's Changing Party
West Virginia Democratic Governor Jim Justice announced Thursday evening at a rally with President Trump that he would change party.
Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have moved away from me," Governor Justice said.
"Today I will tell you with many prayers and much thought ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia, I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor."
The rally erupted in cheer.
"Tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republicans," Justice added.
"As a coach, I would say it's time to play another game."
Mr. Trump previously promised a major announcement at the West Virginia Rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia by 42 points, and Justice did not approve of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, the only billionaire in the state according to Forbes, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, and inherited a coal business from his father.
It's worth about $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee issued a statement on Thursday evening saying, “Governor Justice’s change of party is another blow to a Democratic Party that would hinder us rather than work to make our country great again.”
“With only 15 governorates and the control of the fewest legislative entities in history, Governor Justice’s announcement is just the last rejection of a party that is top-to-bottom without a leadership and unable to find a positive, unifying message,” RNC Chairman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
Coe praises "honest" Russian apology for doping scandal
World head of athletics, Sebastian Coe, praised Thursday what he described as an obvious apology from Russia for a doping scandal, but he reiterated that it was not the time for the country to be reinstated into the sport.
Russia's athletics leader Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that his country's ban from the sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he's sorry for "all athletes who have been snatched away gold and silver medals in competitions."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favour of maintaining the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found clues to state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very open response today, a very honest presentation," IAAF President Coe told reporters.
"The entire Council and the entire Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has recognized in itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is being redesigned."
Coe said he was also "pleased" with Russia's acceptance of the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day, and I think progress has been made, but Congress supports the Task Force's recommendations that this is not the time to re-establish Russia," Coe said.
"We have to do everything we can in the next few months to normalize this situation.
The guiding principle has always been that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the depraved system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete as neutral players at the World Athletics Championships, which will start in London on Friday, following the strict IAAF criteria.
The head of the IAAF task force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia still needs to meet some of the criteria for re-employment.
Drug testing is still insufficient and banned trainers are still free to work, he told reporters in London after a lecture at the IAAF Council.
Grief for soldiers who have crashed in Mali
At a funeral ceremony in Fritzlar in northern Hesse, about 1,000 people thought of the two soldiers who died in a helicopter crash in Mali.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security precautions.
Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen (CDU) said nothing about the unexplained cause of the crash.
She described the two pilots as "experts in their field".
"We bow to this highest sacrifice they have made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she said.
The 33-year-old Major and the 47-year-old Chief of Staff from North Hesse were killed in West African Mali on Wednesday.
Their coffins were transferred to Germany and taken to the Fritzlar Cathedral of St. Peter on Thursday, accompanied by a guard of the Bundeswehr.
At noon, only the relatives in the church said goodbye.
Afterwards, the funeral began in the circle of family, closest friends, representatives of the Bundeswehr and politics.
Among them were Hessen’s Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the General Inspector of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker.
Grief guests laid down roses, the relatives stood arm-in-arm at the coffins.
In front of the church, Fritzlarer and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas.
Defence Minister von der Leyen described the soldiers who died as "highly decorated" and experienced in action.
The Chief of Staff had helped to build the flight operation of the Tiger fighter helicopter in Fritzlar and was one of the first six trained Tiger pilots of his regiment.
Volker Bauersachs, commander of the regiment to which the soldiers belong, also stated: "If this crew could not avert the crash, then no one would have been able to."
Doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not show Minister von der Leyen: the deployment is dangerous.
But it is also of great importance “for a country from which we are only separated by two states,” she said.
After the funeral, the coffins were brought out of the cathedral.
When and where they are buried, the Bundeswehr did not provide any information on this.
Prince Henrik doesn't want a grave next to his wife
The husband of the Danish queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death.
This was announced by the royal family on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish royal couple is buried in the cathedral church of Roskilde.
The sculptor Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn N<0xC3><0xB8>rgaard already made a sarcophagus for the two.
The Queen agreed with her husband's decision, the statement said.
Where Prince Henrik will be buried is still unclear.
However, he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland.
Prince Henrik had never concealed that he was not happy with his title.
After his wife Margrethe ascended to the throne in 1972, he would have liked to become king.
In 2016, he retired and also resigned the title of "Prinzgemahl".
Since Henrik did not get the title and function he wanted in Denmark, he did not consider himself to be equal to his wife - even after his death, Lene Balleby, the chief spokeswoman of the Danish royal family, explained.
Where the 83-year-old’s final resting place will ultimately be remains unclear.
However, he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland, but in Denmark.
He likes the country he has worked for over the last 50 years.
Born Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, son of a French noble family, Margrethe had met in London in 1965.
On the Thames he worked in the French Embassy.
During his later wife, the expressions of sympathy of the people always flowed in, Prince Henrik had a heavy standing with the Danes in his almost 50-year reign.
In an autobiography, Henrik commented about the first years in Denmark: "A few months after my arrival, everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was fluctuating, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk stockings instead of knitted socks, Citro<0xC3><0xAB>n instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises, who I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who in this country had the reputation of being the brand of socially critical intellectuals, I could not hope for indulgence.
I was different.
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not ashamed.
That was two mistakes!”
Prime Minister Weil wants a quick re-election
CDU and FDP ahead of possible majority in Lower Saxony
Lower Saxony's Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) is after the loss of the red-green government majority for a quick re-election of the Landtag, but he does not want to resign.
Because Friday was in favour of the dissolution of Parliament.
Previously, the surprising withdrawal of a Green MEP from her parliamentary group in Lower Saxony had plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the official date of the state elections, the red-green coalition in Hanover lost its narrow one-vote majority in parliament to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
Former Green MEP Elke Twesten justified her move with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she said on Friday in Hanover.
CDU Group leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend his group to include them.
Together, the CDU and the FDP have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony state parliament, the SPD and the Greens.
So far, the relationship has been reversed.
The new state parliament will be elected on 14 January next year.
Thümler said the red-green state government must now decide whether it can continue to rule without a majority in this situation.
Stephan Weil, however, considers it essential that the state parliament decides its self-dissolution as quickly as possible.
The CDU group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday.
The state constitution also provides for the possibility that the state parliament deprives the Prime Minister of confidence and elects a successor.
"Our Constitution offers several options.
These possibilities must be examined legally cleanly," said Thümler.
"You will quietly discuss all questions if they are legally reasonably examined."
Thümler called Twesten's step "but something curious".
The politician himself stressed: “I’m not a traitor.
I feel very good.”
She described herself as a supporter of black-green.
The Greens called on the renegade MPs to return their parliamentary mandate.
"We of course assume that she will return her parliamentary mandate, which she received via the green state list, with immediate effect," said the state chairs Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner.
Greens leader Anja Piel said: "We regret the decision of Elke Twesten extremely."
She deliberately decided not to hold a debate in the group.
"Even with the fact that there were no differences in content, we cannot understand this step."
SPD candidate Martin Schulz condemns the transfer of the Lower Saxony Green MP Elke Twesten to the CDU as a betrayal.
"The behaviour of the former Green MEPs in Lower Saxony is not only betrayal of the electorate, but also betrayal of the Red-Green," he wrote on Facebook.
He supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to have the state parliament re-elected quickly.
The exit of Twestens costs Red-Green in Lower Saxony the majority.
The politician puts "in her wounded vanity and in her frustration her personal interests before the well-being of the country," criticized SPD Secretary-General Hubertus Heil.
"It is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony participates in this dirty game of intrigue and tries to capitalize on it".
Lower Saxony’s CDU group leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend to his deputies to include Elke Twesten in the CDU.
The head of the SPD group in the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, accused Twesten of distorting the result of the 2013 state elections with personal career thinking.
The CDU was then the strongest force before the SPD, but the SPD and the Greens had a thin majority of one vote in the state parliament.
Minister of Agriculture in an interview - How do we protect ourselves from poison eggs, Mr. Schmidt?
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves?
Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt (CSU) is speaking and answering in an interview with the RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).
Mr Schmidt, how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to look closely at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp print.
On the consumer protection portal www.Lebensmittelwarnung.de, the federal states provide the latest information about the affected egg batches.
Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, according to everything we know at the moment, a health hazard is practically excluded.
Is Aldi now taking over the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the scout is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture?
Food monitoring is the responsibility of the federal states.
Nevertheless, my house immediately opened up and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the Germans became aware of their concerns.
All information and risk assessment is available to consumers.
Trade, as well as manufacturers, must ensure that the products sold are marketable and safe for health.
Where eggs have exceeded the maximum residue limit of 0,005 mg/kg, they shall not be marketable.
However, unloaded eggs can be sold and consumed.
This time it’s not the company’s fault.
Are production companies and consumers in the same boat?
According to the current level of knowledge, the production companies are not directly to blame.
Rather, they are expected to suffer economic damage due to allegedly illegal practices by service companies.
As always, there are too few inspectors in an emergency.
Is there only a lack of staff or a lack of coherent competence?
It was just the official controls that uncovered the process.
However, the truth is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 percent excluded.
It is precisely for this reason that a consistent explanation of such events and the handover to the prosecutors in cases where criminal offences may exist are of crucial importance.
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I expect complete clarification from the responsible authorities.
Is regular alarmism really necessary in food scandals?
Consumers have the right to obtain only safe and marketable foodstuffs.
When an unauthorized insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly outraged.
Due to the braced means, manufacturers, traders and consumers have come into a situation that is absolutely not necessary.
In principle, it must be clear that the illegal use of the insecticide fipronil in the keeping of food-providing animals is unacceptable and must be terminated immediately.
This needs to be worked on consistently and at high pressure at all levels.
I expect all competent authorities to clarify the matter swiftly and seamlessly.
How Football’s Financial Rules Affect Neymar’s Move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unhindered spending of European football clubs will not interfere with Neymar’s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to French Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences will still come for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, because the leading organization that supervises the European match has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial fair-play rules introduced by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will have to prove at some point that Neymar’s transfer was financed without major losses.
Barcelona has paid <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>222 million ($262 million) to buy the Brazilian out of his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar’s move to France.
PSG can certainly loosen up the money for Neymar to sign and take him to a galaxy of other stars, given the team’s funding from the energetic ruling family of Qatar.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on acquiring players, but have to counter with legitimate revenue sources that allow them to break even point in their football-related business.
FFP was conceived by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA President in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that had taken on enormous debts in their pursuit of success effectively cheated and risked ruining themselves if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP shifted from focusing on clubs’ debts to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003—buying a club with potential and then investing heavily to improve the team and build a global brand—should become a tougher matter.
During the current three-year FFP tax period, which runs until 2018, clubs can face losses of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 million.
And despite Platini’s disgrace with the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor, Aleksander Ceferin, continues to fight off excessive spending.
"Certainly, FFP is not dead and we will definitely strengthen the rules for the future," Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for FFP at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week.
Although PSG paid Neymar’s buy-out clause in a lump sum, it can allocate the amount for accounting for the duration of its contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the transfer sum of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>44.4 million for the next five years can be reported in the annual financial statements.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, the PSG, along with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, has hit with the heaviest sanctions.
The PSG was fined <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 million (then <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>82 million), which was later reduced to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 million - and it was ordered that the team members for the 2014/15 Champions League season be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outsmart its financial supervision by bloating their revenues through companies associated with the owners of a club.
While a Qatari company could sponsor the PSG if the value of the sponsorship exceeds the standard market rates, UEFA would not allow this to be considered a legitimate income.
This is exactly what happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the value of sponsorship of the PSA was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It has been reported that part of PSG payments to Neymar could come from payments made by the World Cup 2022 Organizing Committee in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar in 2022 have denied that Neymar will become World Cup Ambassador and that such a maneuver could be easy for UEFA regulators to figure out.
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA did not have any preliminary talks with PSG about Neymar's transfer, people familiar with the situation said on Thursday.
They spoke with The Associated Press on condition of anonymity, as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG achieved a profit of more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> 10 million in 2015/16 with a turnover of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> 542.4 million.
Accounts for the last financial year have yet to be published.
PSG expects Neymar’s arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.
The association expects sales to increase by at least 30 percent after the signing.
The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players go, and they tried to prevent Neymar’s departure by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP.
“It’s a clear case of ‘financial doping’ with the club and the state,” La Liga president Javier Tebas told the Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar’s ultimate ownership of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga's reservations against a state that funds a club.
"It is the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
“As soon as a country has an association, everything is possible.
It will be very difficult to respect financial fair play because you can go different ways or have different interests when a country has such a big actor to represent a country."
Swiss is looking for a new chocolate supplier
In recent years, Chocolat Frey has produced on-board chocolate for Swiss.
Now, the sweet cooperation is facing a possible end: the airline rewrites the order.
Swiss spokeswoman Meike Fuhlrott confirmed a corresponding report from the newspaper "Northwest Switzerland" on Friday at the request of the news agency sda.
According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products were checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control.
"We are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolat Frey," said the spokeswoman.
Around 17 million small red-and-white packed chocolate tablets of 14 grams per year are distributed by flight attendants to passengers before landing.
Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs.
Industry insiders estimate the order volume according to "Northwest Switzerland" at 1.5 to 2 million francs - the Migros subsidiary generates annual sales of around one billion francs.
But more important is the advertising effect: for a chocolate manufacturer, it is a prestigious order.
Swiss does not want to reveal how many applicants there are in the new tender.
Only Swiss manufacturers are considered.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey wants to seek a renewal of the contract beyond the spring of 2018.
For the SDA, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for comment.
Swiss has been distributing chocolate tables on board its flights since 2006.
Before the Swiss entered into a contract with the Migros subsidiary, Barry Callebaut had delivered the chocolate tablets in cooperation with Hug.
Swiss introduced the possibility to place the logo two and a half years ago with the start of the collaboration with Chocolat Frey.
The airline works with various Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-haul flights, First Class customers will be pampered with treats from Confiserie Sprüngli, Business Class passengers will enjoy Lindt Schoggi and Economy Class Schoggi from Chocolat Frey.
Swiss Schoggi by Chocolat Frey is also distributed on short-haul routes, both in business and economy class.
Athletics - Discus Olympian Robert Harting reaches World Cup final
The three-time World Champion will fight for a medal in the final on Saturday.
His brother Christoph, Olympic champion of 2016, had failed in the national World Cup elimination and could only watch the Diskus competition from the stands.
Also with the first attempt, the Polish defending champion Piotr Malachowski, who threw 65.13 meters far, qualified for the final fight.
"Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
This replay of the story is simultaneously nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80s, for the 90s grunge era (when the forerunners David Wain and Michael Showalter shot the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Paul Ruehler went to
As a cultural artifact, it is a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like time is running out.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not just because of its absurd humor (it contained an original story for a talking can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By stiffening themselves to the core of the gag — middle-aged actors playing horny kids growing up — they nevertheless managed to win back the last part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later", with its adults now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and its parody goes more on the watering can principle, including a reef on the stalker movies of the 90s like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle".
At one point, a character browses through an Apple powerbook, some inline skates, and "a number of other things from 1991."
Many of the central stories are the same.
The lovable Coop (Mr. Showalter), now novelist, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has still not lost his virginity.
And there’s another mad-malign plot involving Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) now supported by George H. W. Bush (a good impression of Michael Ian Black).
As always, excursions are the best part of the franchise.
It's especially fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillon's lower lip beard of "Singles", whose former big-man-on-camp Andy now feels like an old cracker.
It’s the moments of random madness that could fuel this franchise like some kind of repetitive “Seven Up!” series until it reaches what I take as its logical conclusion: “Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later,” whose final scene will show the gang as they attend the film premiere of “Wet Hot American Summer.”
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon is now reminiscent of a different kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War by "The Americans", the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its East-to-West wrestling iconography.
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as director claims to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.
The lead roles – a hard-boiled Gregor and an idealist Iosef – are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues are synchronized in English by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some nice gags to watch (the police spend the time watching chess on TV, like Americans might do with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chlo<0xC3><0xAB> Sevigny - ensures a decent game 'Find out the voice'.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like one.
With six long episodes, it drags on, and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough.
"Comrade Detective," edited to a shorter length, could better deliver his agitprop satire as Gregor and Iosef keep visiting the American embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two fat men devouring a bunch of hamburgers.
The message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make everything a feed for success.
The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: we even do it with our own recent history and theirs.
Drug mafia attacks in the country
The police have succeeded in a blow against the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Schwarzwald-Baar-Kreis, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the public prosecutor’s office in Konstanz announced on Friday.
Fifteen defendants between the ages of 25 and 77 have been arrested and have already issued warrants against them.
In addition, the officials secured larger quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms, and several hundred thousand euros.
Two people were arrested in simultaneous raids in Italy.
There were German arrest warrants against the two suspected Italians.
The two will probably be shipped to Germany.
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action.
In total, more than 300 police officers were deployed.
Members of the mafia are accused of organized drug crime, serious acts of violence, attempted murder, robbery and extortion.
Since the summer of 2016, the public prosecutor’s office has been investigating Constance against the organized drug trafficking in the southern German region.
There was a lively exchange between the prosecutors in Constance and Palermo and the investigators of Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
Therefore, the large-scale operation on Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo.
The investigations targeted mainly Italian nationals with close links to the Italian mafia.
Also an incident on May 27 in Hüfingen, in which several shots were fired into a restaurant early in the morning, is likely to be on the account of the gang.
Wise complains of large gaps in the foreigners register
"Data from citizens who should not appear there": According to a report, the Ausländer-Register in Germany has significant shortcomings.
This leads to some serious wrong decisions in asylum procedures.
According to a media report, Frank-Jürgen Weise, the Federal Government’s commissioner for refugee management, has drawn attention to large gaps in the central register of foreigners.
Deficiencies in the data recorded there could lead to "some serious wrong decisions" in asylum procedures and deportations, warned the Süddeutsche Zeitung in an analysis.
According to the registry, 10 million people of foreign nationality are recorded, including about 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data is therefore managed by about 600 foreigners authorities in Germany.
Because the data was not sufficiently maintained, the data quality in some parts was not good so far.
In individual cases, data from 1921 were found, "of people who are no longer alive, or of citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register."
“Error data entry can significantly slow down return processes,” the report said.
In addition, the statistics on people obliged to leave include EU citizens who do not have to leave at all.
However, such misallocations "lead to a distorted debate about how to deal with those who are required to leave the country," according to the analysis.
Meanwhile, the German government has apparently begun to send refugee families with children under the age of 16 back to Italy once they have arrived from there.
This is according to an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung".
According to the paper, the BAMF has been implementing such procedures "in relation to families with children - with the exception of infants and toddlers - to Italy since 1 June 2017".
Since the end of 2014, this was practically impossible, according to the newspaper, referring to the difficult situation on the ground.
Under the Dublin Agreement, refugees are the responsibility of the EU state, which they reach first.
If a migrant continues to travel to another EU country, that state can send him back to the country of entry.
The office now writes: "In the meantime, the capacity for families with underage children in Italy has increased considerably."
Italy has given guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) considers these commitments sufficient.
Other EU countries would also send refugees back there under the Dublin Agreement.
Ulla Jelpke, spokeswoman for the Left Group in the Bundestag, criticized this decision: "Families with children threaten to accept asylum in violation of human rights and endanger the well-being of children because of the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system."
Second best result achieved
A total of 220 liters of blood from people living in Oberreichenbach was already made available to other people by the blood donation service.
At least by the 12 citizens who were awarded on Friday.
Above all, Jürgen Greule, who now shared 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations.
Traditionally, in the meeting of the municipal council, the municipality recognizes the multiple willingness to donate blood.
“It’s awesome how our bodies are designed for this and we respect the donors, who make their blood available to strangers, even more disinterestedly,” Mayor Karlheinz Kistner underlined.
"A single blood donation helps several people," explained the head of the German Red Cross (DRK), Holger Maisenbacher, because the cans are decomposed into their components.
Three people could benefit from a blood donation.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported on the actions that will be carried out in the spring in Oberreichenbach.
"This year, we achieved the second best result with 114 donors," said the DRK circuit readiness manager.
Obviously, the change to the theatre house a few years ago led to higher numbers of participants.
Even before that, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and were awarded for 50 blood donations each.
Half as many booked Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter gave out 500 milliliters of their life juice ten times each.
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to later announce that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and inflation slowdowns have dampened speculation about a rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain “slow” as it maintains interest rates on family income amid increasing pressure.
The bank’s Monetary Committee (MPC) policymakers voted 6 to 2 to keep interest rates at 0.25%, with fewer members striving for an increase this month as weak economic growth weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 to 1.6%, warning that pressure on household income would continue, with inflation expected to rise to just under 3% in the fall.
But she signaled that interest rate hikes would become necessary in the coming years to curb Brexit-fueled inflation, and she said that loan costs might need to rise more than expected in the financial markets.
Members also voted to withdraw part of the Mammut stimulus package issued a year after Brexit.
It will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding to banks from next February, although it has been said that it is now expected to provide <0xC2><0xA3>15 billion more under this system - with <0xC2><0xA3>115 billion.
Minutes after the decision on the interest rate, the bank said: "In the central forecast of the MPC, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term, as the pressure on households' real income continues to burden consumption."
Regarding interest rates, she reiterated that “a certain tightening of monetary policy” would be necessary to cool inflation and a “slightly larger” scale than markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that increases would be “gradual” and “limited”.
The Bank’s down-adjusted growth forecasts for this and next year are compared to the 1.9% and 1.7% forecasts in May.
It maintained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell against the dollar and the euro after these news.
The pound fell by 0.5% to $1.31 and fell by 0.4% to $1.11.
The decision to make no change comes after the recent disappointing growth figures have dampened the rising expectations of an interest rate hike and GDP has risen from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3% in the second quarter.
Growth is expected to reach 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will recover slightly towards the end of the year, according to the bank.
The recent inflation report provided little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and slight wage increases, as the tightening gets worse at first before it will improve.
She added that monetary policy over the next few years cannot “prevent” income decline, but she added that wages will “significantly” recover by the end of her three-year forecast.
The economy is also strengthened by rising demand for British goods, which is due to the weak pound, which will offset some of the lower consumer spending.
The decision comes one year after the rate cut to 0.25% last August following the shocking EU vote that caused the pound to sink.
The bank estimates that it will probably take four years for this to fully reach prices and the economy.
Prior to the Bank’s final ruling on interest rates, the call for a rise in interest rates had risen as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers calling for a rise to 0.5% in July.
Inflation fell from 2.9% in June to 2.6% last month, although the bank said it was expected to do so and will rebound in the coming months.
The bank said the excess in relation to its target of 2% was “wholly” attributable to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: “Given the recent decline in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive once again as lenders look loudly for deals and want to end the year in a positive way.
The market looks particularly good for those where the existing deals expire and the new mortgages close, and many with toll-free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular."
NHS (National Health Service) to prescribe controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people
Patients will have access to “transformative” HIV prevention treatment from September following a fight before the High Court against funding the drug in the NHS.
NHS England announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent, is now being delivered by the health service through an initial three-year study of an estimated 10,000 people.
He agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeals confirmed a Supreme Court ruling last year that the NHS had the power to pay for PrEP despite the claim that local authorities should fund it.
The move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England chief Simon Stevens as an "important new intervention," while the National Aids Trust (NAT) called it a "decisive moment."
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to register, and more clinics will follow in October before it will be launched across England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a result of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in those at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sexual intercourse means that just enough medication is present in a person’s body to prevent HIV infection.
Such drugs can be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals, and people with HIV-positive partners who have not been treated successfully.
Clinics identify suitable participants who agree to the study, including men, women, transgender people, and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and are registered with a general practitioner can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.
The program will cost <0xC2><0xA3>10 million and NHS England signed a contract to deliver the drugs this week following an international competitive procurement.
The study aims to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence on how it is targeted, captured and implemented on a large scale.
Stevens said, “This major new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in more than three decades of ongoing progress in tackling one of humanity’s greatest health challenges.”
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: “This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, when targeted to people in need and at risk, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September, people at high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded trial in England to develop a new tool that is truly individually controlled and not subject to a negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement."
Ian Green, chairman of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: “The priority must now be to ensure that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that no one at risk for HIV is left behind.
Now that the PrEP test medicine has been procured, we are on track to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people.”
Sharon Hodgson, shadow health minister, said: “The start of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and delayed implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This experiment brings us one step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
"Now it is important that this study be conducted across the country as soon as possible to protect people who are HIV-infected, and that it will help us move one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society."
Living the Big Life: Mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this tiny Earls Court apartment into a generous home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, narrowed down in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment.
It’s located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace – and it’s proof of the new design that Joanne didn’t pack and sell her bags.
“Before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room,” says Joanne.
"I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and made an offer that day.”
Since the first visit, the 1,000-square-foot apartment has been completely overhauled.
Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine floor to make the most of the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.
That was my requirement,” she says.
To this end, she commissioned Erfan Azadi’s Notting Hill-based architecture and design studio Duck & Shed to use the 12.5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms one above the other, so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine where one could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the problem.
"The steel mill is quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms to be stacked on top of each other without having to bend.
It wasn’t just about building a simple platform, but putting the steel up so that it had the right height for the function up or down.”
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms in full height one above the other - with a lot of extra drama.
For the mezzanine, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space, and light.
A short corridor is mirrored at both ends to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the reflection feels like a window into another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units can accommodate all cutlery and glasses from Joanne.
By perceiving a more glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when not in use.
Collapsible kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.
"A bit of engineering went into it," explains Erfan from the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door.
"It's counterweight, so when you push the door up, it slides very easily."
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to gain an additional 16 m2, an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day, you're going to sell the floor space - or how your property is valued," Erfan says.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the floor size."
Here, they have managed to increase the floor area while using high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.
"The materials are the things that you touch and therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.
“You don’t fall in love with the electrical outlets in the walls.
These are important, but they don’t play with your heart.”
It shows that with good design and increased square meters, an apartment can turn from something standard into something quite amazing.
In fact, like Joanne, you might decide not to leave this.
Brothers Fight for a $500 Million Real Estate Empire
Two brothers, four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, are in a dispute over one of Victoria’s largest real estate empires worth over $500 million.
Former director of the Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors away from his younger brother Paul, who has taken him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets should be divided.
Paul wanted to retire from the family business since 2014, but a sharp dispute about the separation is taking place in the Supreme Court.
Together with their mother Anna, the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, accumulated since the family bought a shop in Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.
There, the Westco family founded jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.
It sold for $85 million in 1999.
This money has been invested in real estate, and De Lutis’ portfolio now includes downtown offices, Brunswick and Sorrento development areas, Gold Coast and Mt Buller apartments, and suburban shopping malls.
After an agreement with her late father, Colin - described by Paul as "the main operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one-third.
A court record states that this means Colin owns $316 million worth of property and Paul owns $176 million worth of property.
The distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.
“The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought were the best objects,” he wrote in a first affidavit in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed mediations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place.
The brothers are now also struggling to take control of the existing business – of which Colin, as Paul claims, excluded him.
Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul of managing some possessions incompetently.
In an early affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.
“My Italian heritage dictates that family is the most important priority,” he wrote.
Costs are rising in the case, with hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails, and reports from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners, and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading attorneys including Allan Myers, QC, and law firms held by both sides.
Ms. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran milk bars and delicacies shops from the late 1950s and bought a store in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They took advantage of the security to buy the Collingwood property, where Colin opened the family's first jeans store.
Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was a little kid (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass their property amicably on to their sons.
"Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to go to court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies, with Colin claiming that Mark was paid $10 million when he left the company and Luke $26 million.
Both Luke and Mark, Paul says, "have become bitter about the conditions of their financial separation."
Colin has been very reluctant, even though he was a former AFL board member and, according to a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire, the TV star's best friend.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin responded by texting to say "I really can't say much" because the case was before the courts.
"It's very, very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and pull our family name through the courts," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to meet his brother’s demands.
"Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current dispute," he said, adding that he "always hoped for a solution."
On Friday, that hope seemed to be over.
"Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to limit the president's media abstinence.
Others tried and failed.
Perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump — including news media reports — in the hope of keeping the boss on a more even course.
Here is a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:
“When John F. Kelly, the new White House chief of staff, met with senior executives on his first working day, he presented a major problem in President Donald Trump’s White House that he wanted to fix: bad information that fell into the president’s hands.
Kelly told employees that information should flow about him — whether on paper or in briefings — because the president would make better decisions if he got good information."
Kelly’s diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump’s relationship with television goes back decades — and now that he’s in the White House, his television ads are still strong.
“If candidate Trump was upset about unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he was getting fair reporting from places that were too convincing,” former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise."
Okay, okay.
But the idea that Trump’s Twitter habit has ever been “under control” is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don’t know others – that Trump’s tweets would have contained even more ignition without their interventions.
We’re probably never going to know anything about the tweets that Trump didn’t send.
If his employees have managed several times to keep him away from trouble, then their efforts have been worth it.
But no one has consistently prevented Trump from causing controversy.
Part of the problem is that people in a White House composed of competing parties keep trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views of the world.
Politico - wholly occupied with this story - reported in May on the preference of the advisers to provide the president with dubious information for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
“Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press cutouts, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he is stiffened to find out where they come from.
This is exactly what happened in late February when someone maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, accusing Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being “the source behind a bunch of leaks” in the White House.
Although Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter for harassment or that he has not offered concrete evidence or that he has made false accusations in the past and revoked them.
Trump read the article and began questioning employees about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Secretary General Rob Porter “tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork that Trump receives.”
How did it work?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers are still striving for influence.
These unchanging factors make Kelly’s mission very difficult.
Most Wanted Criminals Receive Post from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the assistance of the population is requested and hoped.
This summer, police across Europe are sending (virtual) postcards to dangerous criminals on the run.
Since the addresses of the sought-after criminals are not known by nature, information from the population is hoped for and requested.
Europol reported on Friday of the action following the "EU Most Wanted" Advent calendar of the winter.
Experience has shown that many refugees are hiding at holiday destinations, Europol said.
21 postcards have been compiled for searched criminals from 21 EU countries.
Since 2016, the website www.eumostwanted has been viewed more than 2.5 million times.
So far, 36 of the online searches have been detained, at least eleven of them on the basis of information posted on the website.
Travelers negotiate a trench and return to 'Millionaire's Series'
Some of the West Midlands’ wealthiest homeowners are once again on war foot with some determined travelers who have negotiated a community-drawn trench to reclaim a field in front of their mansions.
The travelers have parked their 20 caravans on a field outside a prosperous street of Solihull called the “Millionaires series.”
They brought horses, babies and an army of vans after they were thrown out only in May, but without being deterred by a trench dug by the council to prevent their invasions.
The tactful group found a gap in the defenses and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way.
Angry residents harassed the council of Solihull, who said it was "useless to deal with the problem."
An anonymous resident said: “They moved there Monday night after being sent on from Bentley Heath where they threw stones at the passers-by.
The Council must be forced into action by shame because it was useless in dealing with the problem.
The travellers were there in May, were moved on and are now back.
More arrived last night, probably more today."
She added: “The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by holding long lessons to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I'm not happy to continue paying my community tax if the council can't even stop that."
A local resident who didn’t want to be named said, “It’s ridiculous, we just saw the last round of these travelers just to be looted by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the park area."
A spokeswoman for the Solihull Council said: "We are aware of an unauthorized camp in the countryside beyond Streetsbrook Road and we are working with the Solihulls Police Department to take the necessary legal steps to ensure that they move on as soon as possible.
To support our evidence collection, it is very important that as many local residents as possible report anti-social or criminal behavior to the police by calling 101.
This helps to create an image of the situation in which the court has to examine when we are submitting our case."
From Birkenhof to Waldhotel Luise
The former Hotel Birkenhof becomes the Waldhotel Luise.
The house at the gates of Freudenstadt is currently undergoing renovation and is scheduled to reopen on March 1st next year.
This is good news for the city.
With the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014, around 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost at the time, as well as revenues from the tourist tax.
In the autumn of 2014, in the face of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees arriving in the county, the hotel building was offered to the county office as a collective accommodation, which caused controversial discussions.
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by drawing up a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not undisputed in the city council at the time.
But above all Freudenstadt’s mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious prospects at the house.
He should be right.
The Luisenhotels group with its managing director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to turn it back into a three-star plus hotel under the name Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
They are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
At the former Hotel Birkenhof, building waste containers have been in front of the entrance for a long time, and when you enter the house, it becomes clear how extensive renovations are being carried out.
The floors were torn out, ceilings partially dismantled, old bathtubs removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single construction site.
There is still a lot to do by March.
"It's actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.
Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed.
Everything should later be "beautifully close to the citizens", as Thomas Scherer expresses.
“We want to make a piece of jewelry out of it.”
Facilities include a swimming pool, spa area and a meeting room.
One does not want to position oneself at the high level of hotels in Lauterbad, but already at an upscale downtown level, emphasizes Scherer.
The Waldhotel Luise with its about 60 rooms wants to spread out broadly, Scherer explains further.
Both individual holidaymakers, groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel.
He has already had discussions with OB Julian Osswald and Tourism Director Michael Krause, according to Scherer.
The ideas of the city are congruent with those of the hotel group.
“We are on the same line.”
Asked about the amount of investments, Thomas Scherer does not want to make a precise determination.
Just under a million dollars, he said.
The outdoor facilities are also brought to the forefront, which is already clearly visible.
In a courtyard, a large terrace will be created, which will be accessible from the restaurant, which is public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudestadt is a good market".
Russia Affair: US Special Investigator Uses Grand Jury
In the Russia affair around US President Donald Trump, special investigator Robert Mueller is said to have appointed a so-called grand jury according to a report.
The panel has started work in the past few weeks, wrote the “Wall Street Journal” citing people familiar with the matter.
The newspaper considered the move a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigation.
CNN reported that there were already initial subpoenas by the panel in connection with a meeting between Trump’s eldest son and a Russian lawyer.
U.S. intelligence agencies have long accused the Kremlin of deliberately intervening in the 2016 presidential campaign.
Mueller is investigating whether there was any agreement between Trump’s campaign team and Moscow.
The investigation will focus on several men who acted as advisers to the Republican during the election campaign.
Mueller also reportedly scrutinized more and more Trump’s private and business environment.
The Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that the special prosecutor had personally moved Trump into the center and was investigating the accusation of whether the president may have hampered the judiciary in the course of the affair.
The main task of Grand Juries is to examine available evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether to bring charges.
Grand jurys are also called prosecution chambers.
Usually they are switched on when it comes to larger and controversial cases.
The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors.
The panel can also be called in by the public prosecutor’s office to summon persons for interrogation under oath.
According to CNN, subpoenas have already been issued, which revolve around the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
Persons involved in the meeting were asked to testify, the report said.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump’s advisor and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his then-election campaign chief Paul Manafort also attended the conversation.
Legal experts said Thursday evening on U.S. television that the deployment shows that Mueller will not be intimidated in his work and that he wants to act quickly if necessary.
However, it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be called in at the end to decide on the indictment.
Nevertheless, the establishment of the panel is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause of concern for President Trump.
In the midst of the new revelations, the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents.
“Russia’s history is a total invention,” Trump said.
The issue gives Democrats a way to “feel good because they have nothing else to talk about.”
His special adviser, Ty Cobb, said in a statement that he knew nothing about the establishment of a grand jury.
They usually work in secret, he said.
The White House endorses any action that has accelerated the Special Prosecutor’s work in a “fair” way.
Former FBI chief James Comey said three times that the president was not being investigated.
There is no reason to believe that this has changed, the statement said.
However, Mueller was only deployed after Trump fired Comey.
Because of this expulsion, accusations against Trump had become loud, he wanted to obstruct the judiciary.
Comey testified in June before a Senate committee that Trump had asked him to end the investigation into then-National Security Adviser Michael Flynn.
The President is under great pressure because of the investigation.
According to U.S. media, the White House collected material against the special prosecutor and his employees.
This sparked speculation about whether Trump wanted to fire Mueller.
Unlike an independent special prosecutor in Congress, such as in the Watergate affair around later resigned President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired by the Justice Department at the President’s urging.
However, several senators of both parties want to prevent such a move.
Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators presented bills on Thursday, according to which the special prosecutor could no longer be dismissed so easily.
Antarctica: Giant iceberg floats in Antarctica
In the West Antarctica, a giant iceberg of Berlin’s size is almost seven times loosened from the shelf ice.
This was announced by the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Bremerhaven on Wednesday.
The colossus, weighing more than a trillion tons and 5,800 square kilometers, is now heading north and will probably take two or three years to melt.
With a length of 175 kilometers and a width of up to 50 kilometers, it is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered in the past three decades.
There is no danger to humans from him.
The extent to which climate change played a role in the demolition of the iceberg is unclear, according to researchers.
Overall, however, there has been a series of unusual collapses of ice shells in the region for about 30 years, writes the U.S. Research Center for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a factual background.
According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.
The now broken-down colossus was so far a part of the Larsen-C shell ice.
Shelf ice floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.
It therefore grows further and further into the sea and breaks down regularly.
The Larsen-C shell ice is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.
North of this shelf ice, the balance of growth and breakdown was disturbed a few years ago.
A complete shelf ice has disintegrated there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
There is a lot of evidence that the Larsen C shell ice is also in danger, because the front edge has never retreated as far as it is currently.
In addition, the ice sheet is under tension and can break down if a piece breaks down at a key point.
The melting of shelf ice and iceberg does not raise the sea level, as they swim on the water and displace ice as much water as it results after the melting itself.
However, the loss of the shelf ice causes the glaciers to flow directly into the sea and drain much faster than before.
This could possibly raise sea levels, but only to a small extent, writes the British Antarctic Observation Research Project (Midas).
The Larsen-C shelf ice is, according to AWI data, the fourth largest shelf ice in Antarctica with almost 50,000 square kilometers.
At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.
There it breaks down regularly.
"Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change, the ice sheet is now in a more vulnerable position," said Martin O'Leary of Swansea University.
"This is the longest withdrawal since the beginning of the records," he also confirmed.
Among scientists, it is controversial whether the Larsen-C shell ice will grow again or decline in the long term and possibly collapse, his colleague Adrian Luckman said, adding: “Our models say it will be less stable.”
But this development will take decades.
Although these researchers do not attribute the demolition of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, in recent decades many ice shells of the Antarctic Peninsula have decayed.
This long tip of Antarctica extends towards South America.
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey research program, the Antarctic Peninsula's ice surface has declined by 28.000 square kilometers since the 1950s.
The temperature increase contributed to the decrease.
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed by around three degrees in the past 50 years, making it one of the areas where the temperature rises fastest.
CDU wants house rate with staff
Because it is becoming increasingly difficult to fill vacant positions, the CDU is demanding to quit the employers’ association in order to become more attractive.
Just shortly before the summer break, the district congress waved through 41 new offices in the administration.
More than 1,100 employees and officials work for the county administration in Mettmann.
Now another 17 trainees have their first working day behind them.
The apprenticeships in the circle are apparently very sought after.
Approximately 620 applications were submitted for the places to be awarded this year.
Nevertheless, the circle continues to lack personnel in order to be able to cope with the increased requirements and tasks.
There are currently 50 vacancies in the Mettmann district.
Among other things, doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration are sought.
The CDU, together with the FDP and the UWG, wants to take the initiative in the district parliament and address the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.
At the request of the parties, the administration will "develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development".
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs for skilled workers, but also to counteract the shortage of applicants in a future-oriented manner.
The overall concept should be oriented internally and externally, show concrete measures for newcomers and include a training offensive, demand CDU, FDP and UWG.
That sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you did not know before.
Other cities recruit good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
We are talking about a real "competition of public employers".
In addition, there is a high number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age.
It is high time to take action so that no more jobs remain vacant.
But Klaus-Dieter Völker, leader of the CDU group, and his party go beyond the joint motion.
Recently, he caused a big surprise in the county council, when he publicly questioned the personnel cost cap and stunned the other parties.
Peoples wants all possibilities that allow a withdrawal from the municipal employers' association to be reviewed.
"If we do not come to a satisfactory solution in the short term, the district administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the towns of the district - should aim for a house tariff," said Völker.
In doing so, the CDU is trying to pay employees and officials better than it actually provides for in the collective bargaining system for the public service.
The salaries are currently strictly prescribed, there are increases or more money only if you move to a higher level, which is oriented towards professional years.
But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.
Just a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up, in which employees take care of the provisions of the new prostitute protection law.
Not least due to the increasing number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and District Director Martin Richter have a problem: they have too little staff.
Italy tightens the tone to NGO migrant rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs that use lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they cannot continue to do so unless they adhere to new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue working," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized a boat of the German aid organization 'Jugend Rettet' because their crew had effectively worked with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organization, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to comment on detailed accusations made by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"Saving human life is and remains our top priority for us, so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," the organization said in a statement on social media.
"We can't judge any allegations currently being made until we have gathered all the information and can assess the situation."
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the boat of 'Jugend Rettet', the Iuventa, since October.
It is suspected that his crew will take on board inflatable migrants who will be delivered to them directly by human traffickers, and that the smugglers will be able to leave so that the ships can be reused.
At least such a meeting allegedly took place just 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the file of the prosecutor whose content was published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected of ignoring the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, which monitors rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other reasons.
Under the Code of Conduct, boats like the Iuventa must above all have an Italian police officer on board, who monitors their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be deemed unnecessary but acceptable as they would not entail “substantial changes or hindrances” to their rescue operations.
Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti said in the meantime that the number of migrants arriving in Italy after the rescue measures has declined sharply in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen the Libyan Coast Guard and work with local mayors have been fruitful.
"Over the last few days, we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hopes of reaching Europe.
Climbs and Trials
Nine Weiler bikers, the "Berlin outpost" and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the North Palatinate to enjoy trials and sights for four days.
There were three friendly guides available.
The accommodation in the Wachenheim Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour took place in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.
This was followed by viewpoints, partly on towers, from which one could see far beyond the Palatinate Forest and the upstream plains.
In between, there were repeatedly longer climbs, for which long trials rewarded.
On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim for the saline and the Volksfest Wurstmarkt.
Again, lookout lined up to lookout line, connected by "flowery" trials and moderate climbs.
Over the last two days, a lot of altitude meters were called for.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and retreat huts brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers breathed healing brine in the outdoor inhalatorium.
Neustadt was also approached.
After 173 kilometres and almost 4500 metres of altitude, the group had got to know the Palatinate Forest at its best – sporting and culturally.
Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga prepares for e-sports
Will the sports stars sit in front of computer consoles in the future, instead of fighting sweaty in wind and weather over the stadium lawn?
The fact is: eSports has long since become a serious industry, a lucrative business - including big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high pay.
This has also been recognized by the first Bundesliga clubs, which are increasingly engaged in this area.
The VfL Wolfsburg started in 2015, later followed FC Schalke 04 and most recently VfB Stuttgart, which founded an e-sports department in mid-July and signed two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17.
"We hope to inspire completely new young target groups for the VfB," says CEO Jochen Röttgermann.
He is sure that "there are still a lot of clubs on this train."
Next weekend, the FIFA World Football Federation will host the first Interactive Club World Cup in London, where players from different clubs will compete against each other.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven have qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sports.
The former coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players.
"Real football has to deal with the 14 to 30-year-olds in particular, that the young people will still go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.
And: The clubs tried to conquer all kinds of markets, especially the Asian ones.
With prominent e-sports players under contract, one could be online much more often in these markets than sending the Bundesliga team to Asia only once a year.
What exactly is it about?
In e-sports, computer games such as "League Of Legends", "Dota 2", "Counterstrike" or just the football simulation FIFA are fought at the competition level.
For a long time, as in normal sports, leagues have established themselves in which the professionals compete against each other.
And at the 2022 Asian Games, e-sports is already part of the official program.
Is it a real sport at all?
For many, the idea is certainly accustomed.
Ingo Froböse has also dealt with the question for a long time.
For the professor at the German Sports University in Cologne, e-sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classical sports - for example, increased heart rates, stress responses, hormonal changes.
It also requires cognitive skills, technical and tactical understanding, and rapid responsiveness.
Professional gamers should not only train at the console, but also their body and pay attention to the diet.
"The fit player is a good player."
But Froböse also sees problems: "Doping is becoming more and more an issue".
Controls are difficult to carry out in online games, and the scene lacked the structures of classical sport.
Positively, the scientist emphasizes the high integrative effect of e-sports.
Players travel internationally, this is like a big global family, there are no intercultural barriers.
A study by the consulting firm Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth in e-sports.
In 2016, 50 million euros were generated in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsorship and major tournaments.
In three years, the turnover is expected to be 130 million.
This is not much compared to the almost 2.4 billion euros of the football league.
However, the e-sports are “no longer far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey,” the Deloitte advisors write.
Internationally, many countries are already farther away.
Major markets are Asia and the US, where ex-basketball player Shaquille O’Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez join US Team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in eSports betting provider Unikrn.
There is also a lot going on in Europe.
In a Norwegian school, e-sports has been introduced as a subject of instruction, says Froböse.
In the Netherlands and in France, the football league clubs are now obliged to set up an e-sports department.
"In the European comparison, Germany is lagging behind," explains VfB board member Röttgermann.
Only falling into nostalgia and transfiguring the old days is no longer enough today.
It is about preserving the tradition of the association, but at the same time orienting the company to the modern market.
"We live in a digitalized world," says Dutt.
"You can't hold on to the fact that only in football everything remains as it always has been."
Gift Eggs ade - The egg alternatives for cooking and baking
The scandal of poisonous eggs has now affected almost all federal states.
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord have reacted and removed all eggs from the sale throughout Germany.
Only eggs that have been proven to contain no fipronil are to be placed on the shelves.
Michelle Carter convicted of lyrics urging Conrad Roy to commit suicide
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through texts and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her sentence behind bars and five years on probation.
Carter was convicted of negligently killing Conrad Roy on July 13, 2014.
Roy’s father said at the hearing on Thursday: “My family is inconsolable.
My son was my best friend.”
Carter was allowed to remain free until appeal.
She had faced a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr. Roy suffered from a mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and a cream blouse, Carter stood there with tears in her eyes, with folded hands and downward eyes when she was convicted.
"Their actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"She ended her life to make her own better.
She did not take responsibility," she said.
"She showed no remorse."
But Carter's lawyer said it was a "terrible circumstance she regrets completely."
However, judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not find that her "age or maturity, or even her mental illness, have a significant impact on her actions."
A prosecutor read a statement from Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, stating that "there is no day that I do not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I handle everything, and I try to be there for his sisters, despite all the pain we will carry with us for eternity.”
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was "pursueed" by the realization that she would never attend her brother's wedding or be an aunt to his children.
“No longer having that single person I’ve been with every day since I was born is a pain I’ll always keep with me for the rest of my life,” she said.
The case seems to set a legal precedent as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask someone else to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead from carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case attracted national attention after Carter's text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Hang up, jump from a building, stab yourself, I don't know, there are many ways," she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote, “You have to do it, Conrad” and “All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy.”
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention through Roy’s death and ordered that she benefit from the case through some press.
The case shared the legal opinion.
Among the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007 before being acquitted two years ago.
Ms. Knox, 30, posted a comment in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison."
Joshua Kimmich: Learning from FC Bayern’s new mini-lame
That Joshua Kimmich was allowed to appear as captain at the Audi Cup is no coincidence.
FC Bayern trusts the Confed Cup winner a big season - extra motivation does not hurt.
Something was different in his place in the cabin, which Joshua Kimmich saw immediately, even though the additional garment was very, very small.
But as Philipp Lahm and Manuel Neuer were not to be seen on the second day of the Audi Cup, he took hold of the tie that was assigned to him.
"The coach didn't announce it," said the Confed Cup winner after his first use as Bayern captain.
Good, the score could have been better than in the 0-2 against the SSC Naples.
But the sign from the coach could also interpret Kimmich in this way.
It was not Arturo Vidal, eight years older, who had been selected as the leader of the C-Elf, consisting of youth players, debutants and newly retired professionals, but he himself.
You prefer to distribute sugar to those you trust a lot, who you want to keep in mood.
So those who have been chosen to take on the legacy of Lahm can only use a little extra motivation.
Kimmich confirmed: “That’s what you want as a player: to take responsibility.”
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old flew as a mini-lame over the field.
Right back, that's his position now, the white tie on the arm did the rest.
And in general, in this starting formation, Kimmich seemed like the one who can also best take the rudder in his hand.
He gave instructions, tried to steer the unplayed force.
He had an eye for the whole while many others were busy with himself.
Vidal to overplay his lack of fitness (hardly worked out); Renato Sanches to tie in with the performances of the Asia trip (also worked out only to a certain extent); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle to not stand out negatively in their first appearance in the Bayern jersey.
At least it worked quite well.
Süle ran alongside Kimmich, Rudy in front of the defense, both acting sovereignly.
The famously occupied Napoli storm was often difficult, in addition, Süle also tried successfully in the game construction a few times.
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result "was not as we had hoped."
But he also showed a decent performance at the debut.
Game relocation, pace change: "For this style I was also picked up".
How unusual this Bayern world is still for the new entrants, you saw after the game.
Rudy, for example, did not give one or two interviews in the catacombs, but determined six or seven interviews.
Kimmich said goodbye to his new teammates after a few crisp statements.
There he heard an interesting phrase from Süle: "What is going on here, I have already noticed.
At Bayern, you just have to win every game.”
After all, he no longer has to teach the new.
Alaba motivates <0xC3><0x96>FB ladies
David Alaba believes in the success of our <0xC3><0x96>FB ladies
Austria’s best-known footballer has reported on Twitter shortly before the match and wished the <0xC3><0x96>FB ladies all the best.
The Bayern legionary is almost a club colleague of <0xC3><0x96>FB captain Schnaderbeck and is feverish with our ladies.
The tweet of the Austrian Footballer of the Year and Champions League winner should be a special motivational injection.
Our ladies might also need the famous Bayern-Dusel.
Company satisfied with Rhineland-Palatinate Minister: Economy praises Wissing’s pace
It often turned out to be irreconcilable, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still Minister of Economics of Rhineland-Palatinate.
This is evident after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economics Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.
Chambers and companies from the region speak on T V request of a change in economic policy - and at the same time blame the old minister.
Frank Natus, chairman of the Association of Trier Companies (VTU), says: "Wissing takes up the desires of the economy, which Lemke has blocked all of them".
Natus sees the biggest turning point in infrastructure policy: the gap between the highway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country’s priority list.
This year, the Ministry is hoping for a plan determination procedure, the construction law is to stand by 2021.
The west bypass of Trier also plays a role in the country's plans, which is of the utmost importance in the Federal Transport Route Plan.
The goal is to commission the route in December 2020, says Ministry spokeswoman Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees it as a way to support regional but internationally competing companies.
As suggested by Wissing, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry (IHK) Trier aims to create a Rhineland-Palatinate label for wine in order to increase sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of German wine exports that have been sagging for ten years.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to start their own company, praises the IHK.
The Chamber of Crafts Trier sees the new Master Bonus as an additional incentive for young apprentices, says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach.
A premium of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1000 is provided for the master's examination and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2500 if graduates become independent within ten years of the master's training.
However, the homework list for the country remains long.
In the planned road construction, facts can be created quickly, at the same time the country lacks the necessary personnel, says Jan Glockauer, chief executive officer of the IHK Trier.
Of the 56 new engineers that Wissing wants to hire at the state-owned company Mobility, only 29 jobs have been filled so far.
The IHK calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices.
CDU Group Vice-President Christian Baldauf refers to calculations by the Court of Auditors that the country is investing more than 20 million euros less in 2017 and 2018 in the preservation of state roads than proposed.
Frank Natus also expects a concept from the country as it wants to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region.
The broadband expansion in the country so far is also sobering.
In 2016, regional companies only rated the grid supply at 3.4 in an IHK survey.
They complained about internet connections stalling and breakdowns.
Ex-economic minister Eveline Lemke, on the other hand, is currently out of politics and still sits on the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind.
The Greens left Lemke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where after four months due to disagreements, she already cleared the field again.
Audi to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter-reaction
A day before Audi’s announcement, BMW said it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said the company believes “there are smarter options than driving restrictions,” referring to European cities — including Munich, where BMW is based — banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the undertakings as a recall.
European automotive manufacturers have strongly promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions rules.
But the nitrogen oxides emitted by diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost for automobile manufacturers to install systems to neutralize the exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of neglecting the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, which is using so-called shutdown devices that could regulate emissions to comply with regulations when a car was tested but drive back under normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several Volkswagen employees have been indicted, while others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics in the engine development of Audi in Germany was arrested.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be tried in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of installing a system to circumvent emissions regulations in Europe, and an inquiry focused on the United States was expanded.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could put Volkswagen under heavy strain: The luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to Volkswagen’s profit.
This message was sent to the raft on Saturday on the Isar.
The city wants to protect the Isar.
To ensure that the visitors to the Isar also participate, a raft will pass through Munich on Saturday, which has a special message.
If you return to the Isar on Saturday, you will see a large raft between Flaucher and Reichenbachbrücke.
And this is not a common raft, with Isar tourists.
But the construction department wants to clarify.
On the raft you can see a large infotransparent.
It shows a garbage mountain.
The start of a public campaign to appeal to the Isar visitors.
The motto "True love is ..." is to sharpen the understanding of the Isar as a wild river worthy of protection.
Last summer the raft sailed over the Isar and this year there are also other actions and measures to achieve a considerate and environmentally conscious behavior.
Mordillo's tuber nose and laughter against suffering
Mordillo was at times one of the most widely published cartoonists, the tuber noses of his characters are his trademark.
Even at 85, the Argentine still draws and works on a film.
His message: Laugh, "for there is too much suffering in the world."
Guillermo Mordillo was born on August 4, 1932, the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.
In his first years as an artist, he worked as a drawing artist for congratulations cards - which frustrated him.
“The happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost to my job,” he once said.
After working in Lima, New York and Paris, he made a breakthrough in the late 1960s: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then in "Star" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
Again and again, the artist was inspired by cities.
Large, rounded Mordillo figures litter with drawings of the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.
In the early morning, he still sits at the drawing table, according to his own statements, working almost ten hours a day.
Through calendars, puzzles, books for young and old, t-shirts, plush toys and watches, his funny figures continue to find a lot of popularity worldwide.
For six years he has also been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters.
The main character in the movie "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillo's most popular animal in his drawings - who has a thousand-footed as an opponent.
For the first time, his characters speak in the 3D film, which is to come on the screen in 2019.
"I don't know exactly what they're going to say, it's strange for me," Mordillo says.
The script is not written by him.
That is why he prefers the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is produced wordlessly.
Lavender from Provence threatened by climate change
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender is declining due to drought-reminiscent conditions and disease-transmitting insects, which is causing great headaches to scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, expert at the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: “The lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years, which brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the fall.
This has an impact on the life of lavender.
There is also a small cicada, a microbacteria that transmits dwarf cicadas, and in very dry weather there are very many of them."
And there is a lot at stake.
Lavender oil not only attracts holidaymakers, it is also in high demand for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said, "Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have fewer parts with essential oil."
The solutions that are considered include better water distribution and slowing evaporation from the soil, but also spraying the plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and developing varieties that are more resistant to dryness.
This year, the town of Geisa in Thuringia’s Rhön celebrates its 1200th anniversary.
The highlight of the festival is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival.
Merchants, guilds, merchants, vagangers or a Landsknecht camp are to be experienced in the city centre on these days.
The murder of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico
Employees of the weekly Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa through organized crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.
But that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about safety.
They were told that it was important to change their routines.
Two senior journalists are discussing what feels safer: to take their children to the office, who were the target of a grenade attack in 2009, or to leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room: enemies, neutrals, allies.
They ask reporters to suggest names for each column - no proof is needed, perceptions and gut feelings are sufficient.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being on the payroll of the government or the cartels, a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.
There is no rest from the violence, and as the corpses pile up across the country, there are more and more journalists: at least 25 since President Enrique Peña Nieto took office in December 2012, 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats, and so far this year there have been at least seven deaths in seven states.
Among the latter is their editor and inspiration of Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
“The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist,” Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on drug-related violence.
His absence is felt deeply, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word "Justice" hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building. Two reporters in the 1930s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts that typically show his smiling face with glasses or his Panama hat.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor’s office was set up in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, it has only opened two criminal proceedings, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists.
As with most of the thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organized crime each year, the killers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
At Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are inconsolable and although the terrain is now even more treacherous.
Without information about the killers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little benefit, says Ibarra.
"It's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
"Unless we know the why, we distrust everyone."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. He was forced out of his car and shot at him 12 times, presumably because of the newspaper's name - which translates as "Twelfth River".
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left a wife and two adult children.
Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.
But on the subject of Valdez, there is practically nothing but silence.
Since Guzman’s arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country as rival factions fight here to fill the vacuum.
It doesn’t matter that in Sinaloa someone or more people are shot on the street every day or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-story mausoleums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living.
Forget for a minute that there is a state of “rest” when only one cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trafficking routes into the United States.
Nevertheless, and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is broken with the guilt of not being able to protect his friend.
He believes that two misunderstandings contributed to the murder.
First, in February, there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel factions at war with Guzman’s sons.
This publication may have upset the sons, suspected gang members bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after confiscating another newspaper that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there.
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003, when he joined forces with five colleagues to form Riodoce and sold $50 stakes.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to engage in journalism without encountering the drug problem," Bojorquez said.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved being able to publish hard-hitting research without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.
Eight years after Riodoce was founded, she received the prestigious "Maria Moors Cabot Prize" for her coverage in Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in pursuing Mexican drug history wherever it led.
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV.
“You have to take on the task that falls to you as a journalist – either that or you play the fool.
I don't want to be asked, "What have you done in the face of so many dead ... why didn't you tell me what was going on?"
The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the joker who could curse like a harbour worker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love of routine his ruin?
His death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their job and stay alive.
"They don't like it when you're dealing with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret runways" to move drugs.
"These things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.
The result is, even in the best of times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trust your own instincts.
If it smells bad, stay away from it.
The trouble is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said, that "smell is a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happened to Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa – just as they do in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
Days earlier, it was announced that spyware sold exclusively to governments was being used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two policemen sought shelter from the heat of 104 degrees (40°C) in the shade of a tree.
They were commissioned by the state government to protect Riodoce's offices in a four-storey building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Half in a joke, some of the reporters wondered if these officers were among the 50 percent of the police officers the governor himself described as untrustworthy.
It has been months since the reporters went to the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs are de facto under control.
For this week’s edition, Riodoce looked at three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of the former well-known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposé on state spending that focused on the governor's hometown.
And there was a group that carried out a kidnapping at one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the prosecutor’s office.
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was required when it came time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite place of drug dealers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belongs to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated all political levels for almost the entire century.
Recently, several PRI governors have been accused of high-profile cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents at that venue, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military raid.
Just a few months earlier, readers had seen Valdez’s column as the best-informed source of the kidnapping.
"In the past, we would have known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" because of his slender body shape.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."
Valdez’s office has been transformed into a storage room for signs and stickers protesting the murders of journalists, because the employees have become something they would never have expected: activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went to the prosecutor’s office the next morning for a demonstration over another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.
A burned body has been discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests, that it is his.
Across the country, journalists have become louder by writing down "SOS Press" on sidewalks and buildings in organized protests.
On that day, director Bojorquez is away in Washington, trying to gather international support for the judiciary in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and having them killed for telling the truth.
She has since asked to be reclassified by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.
Valdez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are “surrounded” by organized crime, government officials involved and an indifferent society.
In his last book, Narco-Journalism, he wrote that reporters are killed not only by drug gangs, but also by orders from politicians and security forces, who were under cover with organized crime.
The media watchdog group "Articulo 19" assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists to the police and officials last year.
"In Mexico, you die because they want you to shut up," Ramirez said.
Obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas Cartel: “Here I am because of my reports.”
A computer keyboard and headphones were next to her cut off head.
Some branches have chosen to close, such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue to do as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of their director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the front page titled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their home countries or even the country.
It is a painful decision.
It’s hard to find work in exile, and they’re still watching the streets and looking for danger.
And sometimes they are chased, as seems to be the case with photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who stay behind and continue the work, it is a daily dance with risky choices.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that the drug trade scares him.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight last Friday, when the last issue was already finished, Riodoce’s editors sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and drank beer when all their phones suddenly began to buzz.
A series of shootings with gang rivals and security forces near the seaside resort of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war continued to escalate, as promised by a number of cartel embassies in the region.
From the curb, they have posted the news on the Riodoce website via mobile.
The front page had to be changed the next day.
Sirens roared nearby - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez took a look at the police officers who were keeping watch to see if they were ready.
If they were scared at all, they didn’t show it.
Under the enormous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible to all of Sinaloa, the employees of Riodoce followed his footsteps.
"How can you even think of closing," said Bojorquez, "if on the same day Javier was murdered, the intern asked me to send her to the streets for reporting."
Dinosaurs used camouflage to evade their enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, albeit a terrifying one.
Now, researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible rhino of a Canadian miner have been so well preserved that experts have described it as “the Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs.”
It was so well-preserved that they could even find that his scaly skin was of reddish brown — and they said she had had something of a “unrestful past.”
The report in the journal Current Biology described him as "the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever found and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world."
The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaurian that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
Its incredibly well-preserved condition has amazed researchers who describe it as "really remarkable"
According to reports in National Geographic, the armored herbivore is the best preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk when he dug at the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He encountered something that seemed out of place from the surrounding rock, and decided to take a closer look.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years exposing the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) earth lump.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
"If you just blink a little with your eyes, you could almost believe it slept," said lead author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature can be seen.
"It will enter science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs."
Researchers have found that this herbivore, although covered in armor and resembling a walking tank, was likely threatened by meat-eating dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counter shading, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed it to blend better into its environment and evade its enemies, experts say, suggesting it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old creature from the Nodosaurian family made headlines for the first time in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours carefully exploring it.
The astonishing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armor across his body.
They discovered the countershadow, a common defense method in the animal kingdom, meaning that the creature's tip was darker than its underside.
Although the counter shading is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta is far above that of the animals living today.
It suggests that the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure from meat-eating dinosaurs, that evolution favored the disguise of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most contemporary animals that use countershadowing—think deer, zebras, or turtles—are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, signaling that this nodosaurian was exposed to a real battle for survival.
“Strong predatory behavior on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur shows how dangerous the Cretaceous dinosaur predators must have been,” Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the dinosaur's skin was reddish-brown.
Scientists continue to investigate the animal for clues about its life, including its preserved gut content, to find out what it ate as its last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, fell into a river and was driven out into the sea, where he sank on his back to the bottom of the sea.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as southern Florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much farther inland than they are today.
“This nodosaur is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, but is also preserved in three dimensions, maintaining the original shape of the animal,” Brown said.
"The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as it did in the early Cretaceous period.
You don't need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. If you just squint a little with your eyes, you could almost believe he's sleeping."
The Cretaceous era was a time when giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs, roamed the earth.
Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of its terrifying ancestors.
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot (11.5 m) long, six-ton monster.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was sunk in the sea after death and mummified in the mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he dug at the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011.
According to the museum, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is complete from the snout to the hip.
The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch-long lace that protruded from his shoulders.
The researchers believe the armored herbivore was floated through western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.
But the dinosaur’s underwater burial preserved his armor in exquisite detail.
The fossilized remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still cover bumpy armor plates along the dinosaur
As Michael Greshko has written for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is as rare as a win in the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more confusing it becomes.
Petrified remains of the skin still cover the bumpy armor plates that carry the animal's skull.
His right forefoot is on his side, his five fingers are spread upwards.
I can count the scales on his sole.'
In thunderstorm: Mass carambolage on A8: Many injured
Severe accident on Thursday evening on the A8: Almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass car crash.
There are numerous injured, miles of traffic jams - and gaffers.
Around 20 people were injured on the Stuttgart-Munich motorway (A8) late Thursday afternoon in a mass caravan crash.
According to the police, around 5:00 p.m. between the junctions Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (Aichach-Friedberg district) nearly 30 vehicles, including probably trucks, collided during a thunderstorm.
At first, there was no information on the exact number of injured.
These were mild to moderate injuries, a police spokesman said.
A large number of rescue vehicles were at the accident site.
The A8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich.
In the direction of Munich, an approximately ten-kilometre-long back jam formed.
As an AZ reporter reports, there were massive disabilities on the opposite lane - by numerous gaffers.
The fire brigade noted the license plates of the vehicle drivers, who now have to face sensitive penalties.
Shortly after 18:45 a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There was a collision between a car transporter and a passenger car.
A rescue helicopter was on its way to the accident site.
Deutsche Bahn: Group tests "comfort check-in"
It’s a moment that almost everyone has experienced before: you’re sitting on the train and sleeping.
Or you are immersed in your work and just have a brilliant thought.
And then: Puff.
Comes the driver and wakes up an unsannt or pulls the passenger out of the middle of the workflow.
Ticket control.
But the times of interruptions are soon over.
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the schaffnerlos ticket control.
You simply confirm via mobile phone that you are taking your place and thus invalidate the ticket.
Currently, a test operation is running on two routes.
"When the offer arrives, let's expand it.
It is then expected to be available on many other long-distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year," a railway spokesman said.
"Comfort check-in" the train calls the devaluation of tickets without driver.
To be able to use them, however, a few prerequisites have to be met: You need a smartphone or a tablet.
And you must have booked an online ticket - which most passengers already do anyway.
You also have to buy it via the app of the train, the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient way of booking tickets anyway.
Finally, you need a seat reservation.
Because the "Comfort Check-in" works like this: You get on the train, call up your ticket under "My Tickets".
A button for electronic devaluation will then appear for the test customers.
The train attendants will receive a message on their mobile devices that Passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y.
When the train attendant arrives at place Y at the ticket control, he knows that there is a passenger sitting there with an online ticket that has already been devalued.
So you can continue to sleep, continue to work, continue to be silent.
The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should benefit the passengers.
"If you want to travel relaxed without ticket control by our train accompanying staff, simply check in the DB Navigator yourself.
This allows passengers to make their travel time on the train more personal," says Michael Peterson, Marketing Board Member of DB Fernverkehr.
Second plus: "And our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs."
Those who often drive trains know that in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket controls are among the biggest annoyances.
Because often you yourself, but in any case one of the fellow travellers does not have all the documents you need to devalue online tickets.
Either the credit card or ID card is missing or a document that you must present.
The result is endless discussions between train attendant and passenger, which leads to a bad mood in the compartment or room and delays in checking your own ticket and the creator takes the time to take care of other concerns.
Only a small number of test customers can still use the new service.
And that only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.
Further train numbers on the same route are not yet unlocked.
How one activist came to learn the answer to the question, "Whose Streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to the core.
Just a day after arriving in New York City, the St. Louis-born girl was sitting on the bed of an Airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled upon a post from someone in high school.
“Police just killed an 18-year-old child, and it’s still on the street,” it said.
Confused because no one else had posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle <0x40>TheePharoah was constantly retweeted on their timeline.
The rapper from the St. Louis area was about to tweet live the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, MO.
He posted a picture of Brown’s lifeless body stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.
"That's wild," Ferrell thought to himself.
But death was nothing new for them and their community.
She dropped her phone to return later in the evening to tweets about people on the Canfield drive.
There were photos of the police tape and people screaming, and of a man claiming to be Brown's father wearing a sign saying, "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live feed where a policeman stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, she said, another police officer unsecured his rifle and shouted, "I'm going to kill you... animals all."
"This is not common," Ferrell recalled her statement.
“This is not the kind of murder we’ve become accustomed to and we can call it typical.”
At that moment, I felt chills.
I was angry and crying.”
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years is the theme of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?", released in cinemas from the 11th century onwards.
It is a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and resilience, made up from the perspective of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell and her daughter, who was wearing a flower dress and a matching crown, went to Ferguson, the two discussed a conversation they had countless times before this morning about “the black experience and the black state.”
“You remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in?” she recalled.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right.
I couldn't take them with me," Ferrell said later.
“What happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past.
She needs to know and see it and be raised in it.
It must be well-developed, not only activism and organization, but also know the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to become free, to free ourselves.
Even though I’m lucky enough to give her an experience where she personally doesn’t experience blatant racism, she’s no different than the next black woman child.
I feel like I would do her a bad service to keep her away from it."
The first stop when they arrived in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police station that became a campground as activists waited for the possible non-prosecution of Officer Darren Wilson.
There, Ferrell and her daughter joined up with a local business owner who was making lunch.
They prepared bags and helped pass them on to protesters.
Slowly, a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.
"My activism has totally changed after August 9," she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on eating justice and health inequalities in black communities.
“I had no experience in organizing.
It's all come."
Weeks later, during an evening demonstration, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to "document" what was happening.
One question came to Ferrell’s mind: “Do you want to document or are you trying to find a story that you can exploit?”
This skepticism has been fueled by countless cases of people, often whites – in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience.
As Folayan recently explained in an interview, "We had heard that people born and raised in Ferguson did not center their voices and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already worked with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the field known for his activism around death row inmates.
His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years following Brown's shooting.
"This documentary isn't someone who speaks for us or speaks to us. We're talking," Davis said.
"That was the main thing for me, how these people are portrayed, because that is how I will be portrayed."
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell’s experience – to show that the movement “is not a Messiah leader, but a community coming together,” Folayan said – she proved to be the most open participant in the film.
As a result, documents from "Whose Streets?" surprisingly show personal aspects of Ferrell's life as she falls in love and marries her wife.
“I felt like naked,” Ferrell said, laughing when she saw the finished product for the first time.
"But I understood that there must be some vulnerability to this work and to the humanization of black people."
In addition, Ferrell’s story repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement who coined the film "BlacklivesMatter" on social media after the killing of black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 identify themselves as gay.
"Black, gay women in leadership positions have supported the movement as a whole," Ferrell said, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts.
Black, gay women have to bear the main burden of everything.”
Folayan agreed to note that “the movement is really being upheld by black women and many black women.”
However, she insists that "this is not an affirmative type of action" in which Ferrell was selected for her identity as the heart of the film.
"She was the person who shook that energy," she said.
"It's no coincidence, even though she was at the forefront, because there's so much at stake in a life at these intersections as a black, gay woman.
You can feel her energy through the screen."
Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist.
Ferrell is on probation for 21<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 years for blocking a highway at a demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "A Chaos".
Still, she clings to a song and feels committed to this memory since she took to the streets in Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains.”
From "dream" to "madness": TV readers discuss bit gallery
The Bit Gallery moves people, even though it is far from being built.
But the idea of a shopping centre at the southern end of the pedestrian zone has divided the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.
Coldly, the subject leaves hardly anyone.
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg".
While some say to the bit gallery: "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really great" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "Don't need a person" (Siggi Betzen) or quite simply: "Great madness!" (Lars Scholz).
While advocates rely on a gallery to attract more customers to the city, which benefits the rest of the shops, opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will bleed out.
In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the grounds where the Bauernmarkthalle stands, where 13 direct marketers offer their products.
This will end with the start of construction work.
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Beda-Platz with the possibility to sit outside.
Simone Zimmer: "We have been shopping in the Bauernmarkthalle almost weekly for many years.
Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the rural women always very much like.
We also discovered the butchery for ourselves.
We wish that there would be a chance to maintain this offer even during and especially after the construction of the gallery.
This is also the case in other cities.
Especially the Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is interesting."
Gerd Densing: "Whether direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of the rent.
However, it may not be very low in the new project.”
Eva Kilic: "Why shopping palaces in Bitburg?
Whether clothing, shoes, drug stores or supermarkets: I find this superfluous.
There is enough of that in our city.
You can see how many stores are empty here - some for months and years.
But since there is not even a regular weekly market here, it is all the more important that at least the market hall is preserved.
After all, the goods offered there are fresh, are mostly offered directly by the producer and are also inexpensive.
As you can see, retail stores in a shopping center are only rented by larger companies, because the rents there are often not bearable for a retailer.
Too bad, there are almost no special stores anymore and what is left of them will probably disappear."
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping mall with a market hall does not fit together for me.
And the gallery doesn't fit in with Bitburg.
Above all: Where should the farmer’s market hall go during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run, if the bit gallery actually comes at some point.
Or does the ghost Bit-Galerie manage to drive out all the shops from Bitburg beforehand?"
George Marquet: “It just won’t work.
And a shopping center that is empty doesn’t need anyone either.
In my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farmer’s market instead of this gallery.
But there is no room for a farmer's market hall thanks to the insanely many - I think - meaningless construction projects in Bitburg.
If the farmer's market hall is destroyed, a piece of culture will disappear again."
A fitting similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the middle of the room at Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces – white, black, and brown, almost imperceptibly similar – are seen hanging from the ceiling on cables.
The 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheek tufts and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where the former intelligence analyst served a 35-year prison sentence after making secret diplomatic reports public via the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition, which opened on August 2, is called A Becoming Resemblance.
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combined her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a trans woman and pioneering dissident, whose condemnation was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days left in office.
Dewey-Hagborg, through the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted by Manning and from which 30 portraits were created, how someone might look with these genomic data, has made a sharp, albeit somewhat intellectual comment not only on the formability of DNA data – the many ways in which they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations – but also on identity.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward but has spoken openly about identification as a woman since her puberty, was convicted of 20 charges in 2013, including six spying act violations, computer fraud and theft.
Her image was suppressed by the prison, so much so that there was only one photo—a grainy, black and white selfie in which Manning is visibly uncomfortable sitting on a driver's seat wearing a platinum-blonde wig—with which she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came just out of the big success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette butts and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to create an image of what these people might look like.
That was when she received an email from a newspaper magazine.
"They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted some kind of portrait to accompany this article," Dewey-Hagborg said in a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't visit at that time and she couldn't be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became unequal pen pals, who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic "Suppressed Images" illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which foresaw a future in which President Chelsea would transform judgment and she would be able to see the exhibition in person.
The fact that Obama would actually demand Manning’s release after seven brutal years in a Kansas military prison just a few days after the book was published was a welcome kind of happy coincidence.
There is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition now as Donald Trump wages a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops in order to find new, tweetable ways to further inflame the rigid divisions that he should actually fix.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for some reason."
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning, with her oversized signature underneath (the "i" in her family name is marked with a heart), called for an end to "automatic fragmentation, the basis of which has been gender, race, sexuality and culture."
On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a millipede of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by incorporating the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the artist’s sophisticated scientific lexicon) how amazingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all.
“What people hopefully will take away from this is that our genome doesn’t care who we are and how openly genetic data is for interpretation and how subjective they are,” said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, Spurious Memories.
“DNA data can tell so many different stories, so that’s 30 of those stories.”
The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in its own room, is a page from the above-mentioned comic novel.
She shows Manning appearing with a hands-free phone in her hand from the disciplinary barracks of the United States like King-Kong.
"If they're cold-blooded, they've won," he said.
"So never shut your mouth."
"It came straight from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist, greeting from Philadelphia.
"I still get goosebumps when I talk about it."
Manning has not yet personally seen the exhibition – as anticipated in the comic book – but if she should do so, then she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, by her own genomic simulacres, gathering like hordes of protesters.
This was also targeted, like everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5" 2, Manning's stature), where their genetic haplogroups were written with a pencil.
"In the past, I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits.
"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind their liberation."
Professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University wanted for killing
A nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University, who are being searched for as suspects after a man was stabbed with fatal injuries in a luxurious Chicago apartment.
On Monday, Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) were issued arrest warrants for murder for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as evidenced by the Cook County District Court files.
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several engravings.
A community warning system published by the Chicago Police Department says the body was discovered on July 27.
Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead at the scene, and detectives are investigating the stings as murder, while police are actively looking for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the vice president of university relations, said in an email statement that Lathem has now been on leave and excluded from entering Northwestern University campus.
"This is now a criminal matter being investigated by the relevant authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating in this investigation," Cubbage said.
Warren is a senior treasury assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesperson for the University and Somerville College said in an email statement that “we are in contact with the police in the UK and ready to help the U.S. investigative authorities in every way imaginable.”
The statement added that Warren’s colleagues were shocked and wanted him to stand up.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said he urged the suspects to confront the authorities.
"The police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them are intensifying," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious tip stating that something had happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.
Grand Plaza's management team released a statement to residents: "The police are currently working on the victim's timeline and background, exploring a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
"We will complete the WADA roadmap in the near future" - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it would not be long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) were implemented.
“At a certain stage of meeting the roadmap criteria, RUSADA has been granted the right to plan and test in collaboration with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this regard," Mutko said on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of WADA’s Roadmap to Compliance with the Code, which describes the criteria for the re-establishment of RUSADA and was recently published on the organization’s website.
According to Mutko, it contains nothing that could cause concern for Russia.
"Everything has been announced, everything is being implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added.
However, one of the criteria set out in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the WADA-approved investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren into alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sports.
Mutko said: “We are conducting the investigation because our anti-doping system has admitted an error.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no state programs, and we will not admit anything that does not exist."
Mutko’s words were in line with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the Russian Independent Anti-Doping Commission.
Speaking to the Russian sales outlet RSport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov admitted problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but then added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one intends to accept this report unconditionally," Smirnov added.
In November 2015, in the wake of the doping scandal, RUSADA was excluded from carrying out doping controls in Russia by WADA.
However, she was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
After a visit to the organization’s headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli said that RUSADA is “moving in the right direction” to be reinstated.
Aldi will no longer sell eggs
This was communicated by the group of companies.
It was a purely precautionary measure that no further health impairment could be assumed, the statement said.
As of now, only eggs that have been tested negative for fipronil-containing anti-loosing agents are likely to be delivered to Aldi.
Aldi wants to bring clarity and transparency to its customers.
The Startups That Will Help Your Business Not Become the Next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure luck with your e-commerce startup, but the surveys didn’t work.
Answers were often vague, unhelpful or, worse, fraudulent.
And even if she promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.
“There just never was consistency and objectivity,” said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce hair care company Madison Reed.
She called for help from outsiders.
A new breed of Human Resources start-ups is growing to help companies figure out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it enables companies to conduct surveys, address Special Groups and Demographic Groups, provide employees with anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass the C-suite executives and directly contact the Board of Directors.
“You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health, but where is Fitbit for your business?” said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City startup Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said they gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel over the three years with Glint.
In addition to the snap surveys and surveys of certain teams, it provides a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which executives have low approval scores – so you can re-drill why.
Companies are coming to realize that you need to stay at the forefront of workplace culture so you don’t become the next Uber to get involved in scandals since a former employee posted a blog post describing an environment of harassment where those who spoke were punished.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to the financial technology website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, startup Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw a rising interest and activity early this year amid the Uber trap in discredit.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently signed up as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send customized “pulse” surveys, collect confidential answers in real time, and view the heat maps of your problem areas.
It also provides an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And when the CEO is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.
“The court of public opinion has captured the regulators,” said Patrick Quinlan, Convercent’s founder and managing director.
If a company is found treating its employees badly or behaving unethically, it can experience costly consequences from consumer boycott, employee fluctuation, and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has deployed Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.
Previously, when an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters, file a formal complaint and hope that he or she was taken seriously.
It was often an intimidating and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good way to track employee complaints.
Now that the company is deploying Convercent, issues previously hidden by executives sitting in offices in cities or states—such as discrimination, harassment, or unfair practices—can be identified and addressed more quickly.
“I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view of employment experience,” said Vitrano, who heads Ruby Tuesday’s Risk Management Group.
"And we protect our shareholders from employment litigation."
Companies began taking ethics, values, and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations caused by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it took the “social media to get to their right” that companies realized they couldn’t stop their dirty laundry from going online.
“Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy,” he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service and charge companies with recurring fees for using their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity that finds the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million in funding in February from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the total capital to $47 million.
Glitter secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing its entire funding to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising, given the connected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today’s employees expect more from their jobs than before.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only stakes.
Employees want to feel that you are accepted and valued and that you are giving your time to a company with a positive mission.
“If people are happy to be in a company, feel that their voices are heard, and that the work you do is worthwhile, then they feel more committed to making this company successful,” said Nina McQueen, vice president of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, who uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies run well. Companies run well when employees are committed and engaged.
When third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee engagement and engagement, it’s no wonder you’ll find support.
The data on employee engagement according to the experts of the workplace culture is important.
But the data is useless if the managers of a company do not take action.
In fact, when a company asks employees for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.
And if the change is not coming fast enough, or not at all, it can breed disappointment and demotivate employees.
“If you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you need to be ready to have 4,000 conversations,” said Russell Raath, president of consulting at the business management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies relying too much on data collection.
"Because if you don't follow, employees will ask, 'Did you really hear me?
Do you take care of that?
And if you don’t care about it, why should I?”
Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employee surveys, was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint, Erret said.
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, due to the speed of decision-making and quality of communication, she was able to reorganize multiple teams within the company and add communication training to address the issues.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company is constantly gaining new insights about employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this will lead to better retention of employees in an industry known for high revenue.
"If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," Vitrano said.
“And when you lose people, you lose customers too.
And if you lose customers, you will lose companies.
The NCAA eliminates the two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins
It’s about 11 p.m. when a lot of UCLA football players are chatting on one side of the team’s new practice fields on campus.
Some have taken off their jersey tops and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.
For a good part of the team, these inactive minutes are a lunch break.
Players enrolled in the summer classes will return to their final exams after the three-hour exercise before returning to the Wasserman Football Center the next morning at 6:30 a.m.
"This is a real treadmill for the boys for the next three days," Bruins coach Jim Mora said shortly before Monday turned into Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the burden on players, and it has actually extended its days – at least until the final on Friday.
Therefore, the first three UCLA training sessions should start at 7:15 p.m. in order to meet the already packed schedules of the players.
The compromise away from the two days is more than one day when the Bruins postponed the start of the camp almost a week after last season and performed practical exercises for the first time during the summer school during Mora’s six seasons in Westwood.
They are scheduled to hold 18 exercises over the course of August, 20 before the start of the formal game preparations for their kickoff against Texas A&M in September.
Mora said he supports the NCAA’s rule change, even if it adds another point to players’ busy routes.
"We put this enormous burden on them for three or four days, and it's very challenging," Mora said.
"And they just pushed it through, they're sticking around, they're great people.
I think as soon as we get to Saturday and we have more time, it will be really great.”
UCLA will end its practices once the camp is finished, which will not be an easy task given the clear lines of sight of its fields from a adjacent parking lot and the adjoining Luskin Center, an upscale hotel that has already been tossed with soccer balls clearing a safety net behind a goal post.
Bruins players are expected to occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora admitted there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season.
"We will use our security," Mora said.
“This is a real problem, and it’s not far-fetched to think that people rent a room there and then prepare to record an exercise there.
If you have the video tape of an exercise, it’s a pretty good deal.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces at parking lot 8.
We will do the best with what we have.
I'm not too worried about that.
We have a plan."
Facebook wants to intensify fact-checking in the fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with fake news to third-party fact checkers and then show their results under the original post, the world’s largest online social network said on Thursday. It is one of its efforts to fight so-called fake news.
The company said in a statement on its website that it will begin using updated machine learning methods to detect potential misinformation and send it to fact-checkers who may display results of fact-checking from the original article.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, many of which believe have also influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with French voters flooded with false stories ahead of the May presidential election, and Germany supports a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to quickly eliminate hateful postings like those before the September elections.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new fact-checking will be launched in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“In addition to recognizing what stories are being challenged by third-party fact checkers, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share,” said Sara Su, product manager for Facebook news.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the “related article” and work on other changes to its news feed to reduce fake news.
Creating a Comic Novel: A Castle in the History of England
In its recent past, the little Scotney Castle was featured in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cosy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent, and has now become the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaarish Yorkshireman with a penchant for historical documents.
"I find it so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says melancholy.
"What a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand."
A Castle in England spans the period from the Middle Ages to the Edwardian era and documents the families who lived in Scotney. Each story was illustrated by a different, emerging British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It’s not Rhodes’ first book based on an archive: he wrote ‘Dead Men’s Teeth and Other Stories’ in 2014, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library — a project he found unexpectedly emotional.
"I only responded to the thumbprint on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jacobins," he says.
"That's his thumbprint!
And letters always smell of smoke, because then they kindled a fire because of the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if he were there too.
I love the archives!”
For someone so smitten with old papers that he is backed by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ("To be honest, I overestimated my welcome"), all this seems too beautiful to be true.
Rhodes spent its days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, looking through the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the hyena heads mounted on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch.
He wandered through the site and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscapers, gardeners and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night, he drank "Whiskey and began to write."
Scotney’s intimate history is relatively unknown, as the National Trust was not given full access until 2006 when the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, employees were just beginning to take care of the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said, 'Oh, throw it on the attic.'"
Diary, letters from the time of the English Empire, maps depicting who owned what: "You might think land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch for which two families fought.
Guys, let it all go its own way!"
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into English history on a broader basis, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man leaving the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.
"There is a record of a riot that occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book titled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," says Rhodes.
"The peasant uprising started in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start.
Maybe they’re both connected?”
Other stories are firmly rooted in the castle's history - such as 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit Father, whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or ‘The Smuggler’, depicting the 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery that was made only years later when his coffin was excavated).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family of Scotney: "The gentlemen seemed quite crooks, repeatedly making debts and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women — I imagine them as a bunch of handsome boys, with a talent to recruit heirs."
After the end of his deployment at the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences
He completed a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic book about Elaemämäki, the site of an early 20th century sanatorium that has since been demanded back by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to go again," he says.
It was like, "Oh, now I have to deal with that damn life again."
Campaign launched: More than 300-year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf veiled
With the concealment of the 301-year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf, the city of Bad Honnef started its campaign on Friday for the introduction of a new umbrella brand.
Until Thursday, Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and slogan secret.
At the end of August there will be a celebration on the island of Grafenwerth as the highlight of the campaign.
"Too good for us.
Or?”, the organizers of the campaign have been asking since yesterday on the posters at the Rhöndorfer Chapel.
“We don’t really think that (of course!),” they write on their unlocked website yesterday.
"But we are using this measure to gain your attention.
And to make it clear that some things are better than they seem.
Basically, we are firmly convinced that we as Bad Honnefer citizens are well aware of the beauty and attractiveness of our city."
The campaign is about more than "just" a logo and a slogan, it continues.
"It is necessary to formulate a single promise, one that gives the city a distinctive unique selling point".
Finally, it is in competition with other municipalities.
The city of Bad Honnef can afford a medium-sized five-digit sum for its new umbrella brand and campaign.
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's fear of the army
Every year at the beginning of August in Ankara, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises on retirements and promotions in the officer corps.
This week as well.
At first glance, it is a normal process.
But nothing is routine in the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt.
The meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff, as it used to be, but in the office of the Prime Minister.
The five deputy prime ministers and the Ministers for Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs took part in the discussions under the chairmanship of the Head of Government.
Thus, the civilians in the YAS were in the overnumber.
The government puts the reins on the military.
Chief of Staff Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commanders of the army, the air forces and the navy have been deposed.
Since the failed coup, President Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.
Over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the army – mostly because of alleged links to the movement of the exiled preacher Fethullah Gülen, whom Erdogan sees as the driving force behind the coup attempt.
486 people allegedly directly involved in the coup attempt are being negotiated in Ankara since this week.
Already the day after the coup, Erdogan had described the attempted coup as a "gift of God" as giving him the opportunity to "fully cleanse" the armed forces.
But is Erdogan really in control of the army?
At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article titled "Uncomfort in the military headquarters".
There are concerns in the general staff about an increasing "Islamization" of the army, which manifests itself, among other things, in the lifting of the headscarf ban on soldiers, the newspaper wrote.
In any case, the military and security forces are continuing to clean up.
In mid-July, Erdogan had another 7,395 civil servants fired by decree, including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers.
It seemed as if Erdogan had tamed the military.
The generals used to be regarded as the real lords of the country.
Three times they put up with a coup, citing their role as guardians of the secular order of the state.
After his election victory in 2002, Erdogan pushed back the power of the military step by step, not least citing the reform requirements of the European Union.
Former officers say Erdogan is targeting the Islamization of the armed forces.
In the magazine "Vocal Europe", an unnamed officer who sought asylum after the coup for fear of persecution abroad warned that the Turkish army will be "full of extremists and Salafists" in a few years.
If this is true, such a development could not leave NATO cold.
In any case, there are doubts in the alliance about the readiness of the Turkish army after the purges.
The leadership structures and operational capabilities are “weaken,” NATO diplomats say.
Washington Changes Green Card Rules
There will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the rules of the green card, President Donald Trump said, quoted by the media.
It plans to reduce legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, tighter regulations for obtaining temporary work permit visas, and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and endorsed by the President.
The bill will be discussed in the two chambers of Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, increase wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers and will do so by changing the way in which citizens from other countries are issued green cards.”
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
This new application procedure will benefit candidates who speak English, who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy,” Trump said.
Ministry wants to renovate track for raceway shuttle
Over the past few months, there has been a lot of controversy about the future of the race platform shuttle - now it should be done very quickly.
Before the end of the year, construction is planned on the ruined line on which the tourist railway runs.
In order to secure the future of the race platform shuttle in the long term, construction work on the track should begin later this year, according to the Ministry of Transport.
"With the decision to continue ordering and renovating the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route, the country is committed to this connection, which is especially important for tourism," Transport State Secretary Klaus Sühl said on Friday in Erfurt.
The cost of repairing the route amounted to about 2.5 million euros.
Of this sum, the country takes over 75 percent.
The contract, on the basis of which the shuttle will also be ordered by the country in the future, is currently finally agreed, explained Sühl.
The Ministry and the South Thuringian Railway as operators have already agreed on the technical details.
"This means that the timetable, the vehicles used and the quality standards have been negotiated," said Sühl.
The proposed contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be concluded for a period of eleven years.
The race platform shuttle will be ordered on a regular basis in December 2017.
The Rennsteig-Shuttle is a popular train service between the Ilmenau and Rennsteig stations, especially among tourists.
In recent months, a pilot operation had tested whether the route was being used by enough people to order it regularly again in the future.
The route is also highly degraded in parts.
The Rise of Sex Robots Is Real, and We Should Worry
Just as you thought it couldn’t get even crazyer in 2017, a new report comes out on the technological developments in the field of sex robots.
Yeah, actually.
Sex robots are a big deal right now.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we need to start taking its rise seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple, and the type of fingernail.
“People are laughing at them, but the companies are delivering a lot of them, and we’re going to see them much more often,” Mr. Sharkey said in his new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm – with conscious human reactions achieved through artificial intelligence.
The user can also "adapt" his robot according to his beliefs, choosing anything from the robot's eye color to the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it gets even more disturbing as many robots have the “personalities” that would make a Stepford woman look progressive.
Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicone skin.
The RealBotix robot, for example, allows its users to adapt their robots to the characteristics they find appealing, such as shyness.
And then there are the Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah", which gives the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.
"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as personal as possible," the True Companion website enthuses.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn’t like what you don’t like, etc.
She also has her moods throughout the day - just like real people!
She can be tired, fixated on conversation, or she can be "in mood"!"
There are many disturbing aspects to this rise of sex robots—not least because they replace real human relationships—but the submissive feminine traits, the allusions to rape, when you step on Frigid Farrah, most worry you.
On his website, True Companion compared Roxxxy to a vibrator, but for men.
“If women can have a vibrator, why can’t men have a Roxxxy?”
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.
Their emergence and increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.
Of course, most men will not hold sex robots, and while the FRR notes their increasing popularity, they still remain on the edge of consumer culture for the time being.
But what leaks from the periphery can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time we live in.
And many people are not strange or offensive until the free market gives them permission to do so.
There is some overlap in the fact that these sophisticated sex robots are emerging at a time when women’s rights are threatened worldwide, when there is a president in the White House who boasts of sexually assaulting women.
The most daunting aspect of the TV series 'The Handmaid's Tale' is not the graphic images, the entangled bodies and the stabbed eyes, but how realistic this vision looks.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it doesn’t feel like a big leap.
The goal behind these sex robots is to create a physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as technically possible (although with pornstar proportions).
Their builders want them to feel human, that they imitate the movement of a real body.
But, put in a nutshell, when it comes to their "personalities," the robots do not represent real women.
You can't separate from your companion or just walk away.
They have no mediation or background story, nothing that suggests independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total submission.
In other words, they are pleasing slaves.
Or to put it in the speech of 2017: Maids
Trump’s great achievement?
He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense
It has become a Trump era cunning that the political divisions that have polarized the U.S. electorate have also divided small-sized families.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were newspapers in the U.S. with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump’s choosing relatives.
We're all pursuing to burst our filter bubbles.
The power of Trump to bring families together has been less noticeable.
I’m mentioning this because my cousin, a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has been busy with the Republicans in our family for a long time, visited me in New York this week.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican kin she’d been struggling with for decades because of politics, is suddenly and strangely on the same side.
This is certainly a good thing about the dining table, but I notice in a further context that this also entails considerable risks.
The Left has been strengthened by Trump, but the disfiguring effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
When we talk about “normalization” and Trump, we are referring to the creepy possibility that one day his gossip won’t repel us.
However, there is an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump “normalizes” right-wing Republicans who suddenly appear as the epitome of reasonableness compared to his standards.
I find myself infested with an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney’s hilarious version of the madman – the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like) – both of which, compared to Trump, in fact, appear to be a very mild offense.
If Trump leaves, the next Republican candidate only needs to be mentally healthy to qualify as an immense improvement.
When my cousin was in town, we took our kids to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the New York Park Department’s carousels, and the best three dollars you can spend in town when you don’t need caffeine.
The horses are enormously large, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are grubby and the animals twist to look over their own shoulders with fear - extremely dark and the clattering music conveys this in strange ways.
So many stereotypes of a city disappoint: the views of tall buildings get old, the skylines become too familiar to provide a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city does not live up to the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I’m still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage – the themed pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage doesn’t count – but a big roundabout in northern London.
However, the Central Park carousel is still a strangely magical experience, as here two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women can walk on it in the 40s and all have a great time.
If I could have rated the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one asked for it.
On the other hand, this week at a department store, I was forced to rate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card.
At the coffee house on the corner of my street, it's the same, plus the option of matching the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something over the counter.
This not only slows down what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also puts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required.
The poor woman in the department store stood smiling apologetic as I tired of the experience of handing her my five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital with chest pain
Pistorius has left prison for a second time for a hospital visit.
Last year, he was taken to the hospital for the treatment of incisions on his wrists, which, according to the prison authorities, he suffered after a case in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after an appeal by the prosecutors against a first homicide sentence.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013 by shooting her several times through a door of the toilet cabin at his house in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a nighttime intruder hiding in the cabin.
Prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against Pistorius' six-year prison sentence, which they say is too indulgent.
The National Law Enforcement Agency said it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the appeal could be heard this year.
Pistorius risks his sentence being increased to 15 years if the prosecutors succeed.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
When Farmer Arnold Finds a Strange Egg
As the last of the Blumberger schools, the fourth graders from Fützen and Epfenhofen were dismissed for the holidays and secondary schools.
Three of the discharge students will go to high school in the future, four to secondary school.
On Tuesday evening, headmaster Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürgerhaus Biesental in Epfenhofen.
As a symbol of school discharge, the 29 students of the four classes, led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder, chose a young eagle, who grows up in the chicken farm, but is then released.
The band performed a musical titled "Der Adler im Hühnerhof auf".
Farmer Arnold found a strange egg, and had it hatched by his chickens.
Instead of a chicken, a small eagle came out.
But the hope of making him a chicken was shattered, and the eagle spread out its wings on a high mountain and disappeared.
Afterwards, classes three and four showed a chicken dance in Yvonne Frank's introduction.
The hens danced with the young goblins who wore cylinders to bet.
The eagle stands for integration, said headmaster Angelika Sitte.
The young animal is different from the other young animals (chicks), but it is one of them.
He will never be like a chicken.
His destiny is to be free.
She wished every fourth grader that he felt accepted into his new school.
This was followed by a thank-you speech to the female colleagues, the former headmaster Michael Müller, who repeatedly intervenes in school shortages, and the parents’ representatives.
The chick time is now over, explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher.
She reluctantly dismissed her students after two years of lessons, because it was a really great time.
Finally, she could rely on the fourth graders.
At the end, all students sang a song of summer time and holiday time.
There was great joy among the children.
Eight first graders are already registered for the new school year.
Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were detained for illegal camping in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said, quoted by TV.
On the morning of August 1, police arrested a group of illegally camping people in Sithonia, including the two Bulgarians.
They were released the same day, while an investigation is currently underway.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported to bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened control over free camping and impose significant fines on anyone who is found to stay in a place not intended for that purpose.
Controls will continue throughout the season.
The ministry said the court may impose a fine.
Software Update for Diesel Vehicles: What Those Affected Need to Know Now
How exactly does the software update take place?
Do diesel drivers have to take part in the campaign?
The most important questions and answers at a glance.
At the Diesel Summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars.
They are intended to improve the exhaust gas behavior of cars of the emission classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6.
Euro 4 diesel or worse are excluded.
Anja Smetanin from ACE Auto Club Europa gives estimates:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the negotiated software updates are voluntary.
"The mandatory updates previously only apply to the vehicles that have cheating software," says Anja Smetanin.
The Federal Motor Transport Office (KBA) has ordered their retrofitting.
How and from when are customers informed about updates?
The manufacturers have announced a swift implementation in the coming months, but have not yet given a precise date.
Daimler has announced that it will write to each affected person.
If an inspection is due anyway, it will be done within their framework.
How long should the conversions take overall?
"It's hard to say," says Smetanin.
This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as political pressure.
"We have seen that car manufacturers have not yet voluntarily acted on the issue of the environment."
How long should the update take?
The conversion itself could only take three to four hours in the workshop.
It could be more time consuming to get an appointment.
What do drivers who do not drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group do?
The ACE advises to wait.
Probably foreign producers would follow suit, according to Smetanin.
Is there a threat of a massive price drop in Euro 4 cars?
The ACE fears that.
But in the areas where driving bans threaten.
In rural areas, there are no losses of value for older diesel.
The ACE advises to wait for a sale.
LL Cool J Receives Kennedy Center Award
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first award ceremony under President Trump promises to become political.
One of the winners does not want to come - out of protest.
LL Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the coveted awards from the prestigious Kennedy Center.
This year, singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68), choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and TV producer Norman Lear (95) are among the honoured.
The awards will be handed over at the beginning of December.
Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will host a reception and attend the ceremony together with his wife Melania.
Lear, who became famous with progressive TV series, has already announced that he will not participate in the gala.
“This presidency has chosen to completely neglect the arts and human rights—even to deprive them of funds—and that burdens me,” he said.
The 59-year-old Estefan stressed that she will use the conversation with Trump to clarify her point of view.
The Kennedy Center, named after former President John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital.
Former winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city worth living
Roland Wacker, Haslach’s city builder, will retire next year.
The job is already advertised - however, suitable applicants are rare.
Wacker has been a city builder for 31 years.
And he still enjoys the work, as he conveys in the press conference.
He reports on varied but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor.
At the same time, he is surprised that so far no application meets the requirements profile.
The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer as soon as possible.
Thus, there should be enough time for training - in compliance with the regular notice periods.
Since Haslach acts as the Lower Building Law Authority for the administrative community, the applicant must show appropriate qualifications.
In any case, the city wants to keep this function.
If they could no longer fill in these, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice.
But proximity to citizens is important to the city and to himself, says Wacker, who reports on a good working climate and a good mood between the authorities and citizens.
In more than 30 years in office, several important projects have accumulated, to which Wacker looks back with pride.
"We make the city worth living," he is sure about the construction office and its employees.
But in the future, varied projects will also be on the agenda: the redesign of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofen parking lot, for example, have been initiated.
The Kinzig bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renewed, and the stadium renovation is still a topic.
The latter alone will be worth around 1.5 million euros, "if we do it right," Wacker estimates.
“All in all, great tasks are waiting for my successor.
The work here is fun.”
There is a great deal of room for a city builder.
With Haslach’s own yard and nursery, many things can be reacted quite flexibly.
"You can move a lot," says Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors.
Since the old town as an ensemble is listed as a monument, it is important to "have an eye for what fits in" when new buildings are approved, the outgoing city builder emphasizes.
In any case, the city builder has a high responsibility.
He's a builder, "in the end, everything here runs over my table."
In terms of supervision and coordination, he can count on long-standing employees: Markus Neumaier (high-rise building) has been involved for ten years, Manfred Schöner (lower-rise building) for 15 years.
Wacker also hopes that his successor will remain for a long time: "We are looking for someone who really identifies with the position and wants to stay."
Continuity is not only important for a good working climate, but also for the further design of the city.
If you want to inherit Roland Wacker, the city of Haslach should be able to have completed a degree as a graduate engineer or bachelor with a specialization in architecture and have good knowledge in the areas of building code and construction planning law.
The Stadtbauamt is responsible for building and civil engineering, building planning, land acquisition affairs, administration of the municipal properties, municipal farm with building yard and urban gardening, and the Lower Building Law Authority, including the protection of monuments.
Bicycle tossed on cables: Southern track blocked
According to police, the hitherto unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway crossing in the area of Leobener Straße (B116) on the lines.
These were damaged so badly that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.
The investigators assume two male perpetrators and have been looking for them since the night hours.
Near the scene, a pink scooter and a bicycle driver had been observed by witnesses.
“This goes far beyond a prank,” <0xC3><0x96>BB spokesman Christoph Posch told APA.
The perpetrator or the perpetrator would have put themselves in great danger and also endangered the train traffic.
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant, as well as the delay minutes and the costs for rail replacement transport, the perpetrators could also face penalties from the rail customers.
Overall, a "significant" sum was expected, the spokesman said.
The damage was repaired on Friday afternoon, the rail traffic on the southern line could be operated without disabilities.
Nearly ten passenger trains had failed on Friday morning, two of which were related to long-distance transport.
Freight trains did not fail, but they were delayed.
According to <0xC3><0x96>BB spokesman Christoph Posch, about 200 meters of overhead lines had to be replaced.
Insulators and masts were also damaged.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help alleviate IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare to your digestive system.
But a new study claims exactly the opposite: A diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable condition, which affects around 1.3 million in the U.S. and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurring or bloody diarrhea, weight loss, and extreme fatigue.
While those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan from proteins helps develop immune cells that promote a tolerant gut.
Lead researcher Dr. Marco Colonna explained that immune cells in the gut patrol to ensure harmful microbes hiding in food do not penetrate the body.
Cells capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance tends too far towards inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease.
In experiments, it was found that a type of tolerance-promoting immune cell occurs in mice that carry a particular bacterium in their guts.
And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna said: “We have established a link between a bacterial species – Lactobacillus reuteri – which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had of these immune cells.”
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promotes more tolerant, less inflammatory gut environments when the same system also works in humans.
Postdoctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan studied a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same strain that was housed separately did not.
She suspected that the difference had to do with the mice’s gut microbiomes—the community of bacteria, viruses, and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The intestines of the mice were DNA sequenced and six bacterial species were found that were present in the mice with the immune cells, but without them were missing in the mice.
Mice were raised in a sterile environment, so that they lacked a gut microbiome and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells formed.
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers allowed L. reuteri to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated by the mice.
The immune cells evolved into the tolerance-promoting cells.
When the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as indole-3-lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice’s feed, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop cells in humans as they do in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
She said, “The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine.
Potentially, high tryptophan levels in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population."
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United has committed a "genius" with Nemanja Matic
Manchester United has signed a "genius" with Nemanja Matic, Jose Mourinho believes, after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
Chelsea’s <0xC2><0xA3>40 million signature began with a 2-1 win in Dublin, the last pre-season match before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday, and impressed in the holder role as people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched forward at will.
However, Matic had been excluded from the Blues' Asia Preparatory Tour and managed only 45 minutes, which Mourinho admitted he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," Mourinho said.
"We will help him to be ready sooner than later."
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started at Aviva Stadium, when Mourinho formed his Start-XI for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three more re-engagements, but he insisted that the club had already done a "fantastic job" of meeting three of its four priority re-engagements.
"I'm going to get three out of four, so I thank the club for that," he added.
"I'll be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they've put a lot of effort into it."
Boeing "paints" Dreamliner into the sky
The American aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a dreamliner in the sky.
The pilots flew from Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington, but the drawing began in Marquette in the U.S. state of Michigan and pulled over the U.S. in the form of a dreamliner, which is several thousand kilometers.
The action lasted 18 hours and a minute.
On the radar screens was to be the shape of a dreamliner.
The whole thing was a endurance test for new engines.
Boeing had previously advertised this kind of thing.
For example, the number "787" and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky.
New low blow for Martin Schulz - Hannover, we have a problem
When Sigmar Gabriel was still the SPD leader, Social Democrat Prime Ministers always looked to Berlin with a certain concern before elections.
Only no fires from the party headquarters, only no headwinds from the federal government - that was the most important wish of the campaigners.
Since Martin Schulz led the party, this has changed fundamentally.
Since then, the employees of the Willy Brandt House have been watching with growing horror the events in the SPD-governed state capitals.
What Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described with headwinds.
They were low-pitched.
One after the other.
After the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the Federal CDU sees a general signal against coalitions between the SPD and the Greens.
"This shows once again: Red-Green simply cannot govern reliably," CDU Secretary-General Peter Tauber told the editorial network Germany (RND).
The surprising departure of a Green MEP has plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the state elections, his red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
The Greens-Bundesgeschäftsführer Michael Kellner has asked the renegade Lower Saxony Green MEP Elke Twesten to return her mandate.
The transition to the CDU means a clear distortion of voter will.
Elke Twesten must immediately return her mandate," said the Federal Managing Director and campaign leader of the Greens to the RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).
"That must not be true at all," sighs an SPD campaigner when the new Job message reaches the party headquarters on Friday morning.
Stephan Weil, SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, stands after the transition of the Green MP Elke Twesten to the CDU without own government majority.
It is the temporary culmination of a whole series of major and minor crises in SPD national associations.
And no one knows what comes next.
The misery began with the unexpectedly significant defeat in the Saarland election in March.
A blue eye, nothing more, the comrades calmed down at the time.
After the state elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different.
And then it became - and everything got much worse.
The defeat in Kiel caused the SPD to stagger, the Düsseldorf plunge smashed the party smoothly.
The comrades came back in the weeks that followed.
Then, when they had just gained new courage, the G20 summit came from Hamburg.
And with him came the next low blow.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD head of state, lost his nimbus that weekend because he was sitting in the Elbphilharmonie while his city was burning.
And because after that, in crisis communication, he did pretty much everything wrong that you can do wrong.
Since then, Scholz has been struggling for his political survival.
And then there is Stephan Weil.
Due to the VW exhaust affair and his role on the Supervisory Board, the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been criticized for a long time.
Poor survey scores were added.
Nevertheless, or perhaps precisely because of this, Weil has been trying increasingly to put accents in the federal government in recent weeks.
The efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin did not remain hidden from comrades around Martin Schulz.
They let him, because they promised themselves of Weil a stabilization of the party.
Now the exact opposite could happen.
There is basically no fault of Weil in the internal discord of the Lower Saxony Greens.
Schulz certainly does not.
For the time being, the comrades strive to keep their own ranks closed.
Their anger is directed at the Greens, and here especially at the renegade parliamentarian Twesten.
"It is unbearable and democracy-damaging how Ms. Twesten puts her own career interests above the interests of everyone else," says Matthias Miersch, head of the party's left in the SPD parliamentary group, the Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland (RND).
Ms Twesten has been elected to Parliament not because of her person as a direct candidate, but via the country list of the Lower Saxony Greens, the Lower Saxony MP continues.
The logical consequence would be that she would return her mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD-Bundestagsfraktion, complains of an "undemocratic maneuver".
"The voters' will was clear four years ago: the people made Stephan Weil Prime Minister," says Oppermann, who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as a top candidate in the Bundestag elections, the RND.
"Now the personal career thinking of a future CDU MP distorts the election result," Oppermann said.
He asked to clarify the background.
I want to know if there has been more or if there have been further commitments from the CDU Lower Saxony.
Subsidies for the city centre III
If you want to renovate your old house, you can get support from the country soon.
Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG Stadtentwicklung informed about this on Wednesday in Empfangen.
At the beginning of the information event, Schindler gave a review of what had happened so far.
Since 1991 there have been renovation areas in Empfingen.
At that time, in the renovation area I from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-Württemberg still took over two-thirds of the funding amount.
In the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy was still 60 percent.
For Schindler, the previous renovations are a "successful project" - after all, it is important to also promote interior development, and not only to open up new building areas.
On April 4th, the Karlsruhe Government Bureau informed them that there would be a refurbishment area III.
The funding amounted to 833 333 euros, of which 500,000 euros would come from the country, the rest of the municipality received.
How is a renovation area created?
According to Schindler, we will examine where the “really old” houses are.
However, it also plays a role in whether there is any interest in the planned area at all to renovate.
If necessary, the area boundaries could then also be shifted again.
STEG represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening.
Keller presented the contents of the federal-country program "Social City", within which the renovations would then be carried out.
At the core of the programme are the revitalisation of inner cities, the improvement of housing and working conditions and the maintenance and expansion of infrastructure.
The measures would be carried out on an object-related basis, i.e. per plot of land.
The renovation area would then eventually be established as a statute.
The grant period for the grants runs from 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.
Until September this year, however, the inventory would be carried out first, within the framework of which the parties involved in the renovation area will be given a questionnaire to fill out.
In November or December, if possible, the decision on the statutes should be taken so that the renovations can begin next year.
Pietzschmann subsequently explained that each municipality had to carry out the said preliminary investigations.
It is about evaluating the urban malfunctions and deciding when and to what extent they will be refurbished.
A refurbishment note will then also be entered in the land register for the respective property.
Pietzschmann himself would come to receptions again and get a picture of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel stressed that a key success factor for the project was the involvement of the stakeholders.
Therefore, there will be questionnaires that will be sent to the citizens by post in the coming weeks and can be filled out until after the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "building and land sheet", which deals, among other things, with the building condition and the renovation intentions.
In the grey questionnaire, the "Household and Housing Sheet", information can be given about the size, distribution and inhabitants of a living space.
The blue "operation sheet" is only to be filled in if business premises are operated in the building.
However, Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding.
In addition, new construction measures are not eligible.
Schindler also emphasized that the distribution of funding works according to the "wind dog principle" - who comes first, grinds first.
You can't "reserve" funding for later.
Finally, photos of the project "Ortskern II" were shown to make a renovation "tasty" for the attendees.
British inventor sets himself a microchip to get into home and car with one hand movement
A British inventor is the first in the country to be equipped with a microchip so that he can open his front door, enter his office, and even start his car with a hand movement.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company BioTeq.
He has teamed up with Dr. Geoff Watson, a consultative anaesthetist at Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implant procedure is performed to the medical standard.
The technology is similar to a cat and dog implanted microchip and lasts only 30 seconds.
Mr. Northam’s company also wants to change the locks on homes and cars to be compatible with the chip, all for a surcharge of <0xC2><0xA3>300 per lock.
The married father of one has now installed both at home and on his BMW Z4 technology, which starts when his hand is at the wheel.
White House Advertising Costs Cost Taxpayers Thousands
The White House’s decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights U.S. manufacturing last month will cost taxpayers up to $24,000, according to the military, which was left to TIME magazine.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One when the president is on board, was at the heart of the July 17 event at the White House with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials toured products from all 50 states.
The Connecticut-made helicopter was exhibited alongside a yacht from Maine, a Wisconsin fire truck and a Mississippi forklift truck.
The White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operating the helicopter.
“I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility,” the commander of the HMX-1 wrote to his superior, the deputy naval commander for aviation, on the eve of the event.
The news indicated that the helicopter arrived on the South Lawn for the event at 3 p.m. on July 17 at about 7 a.m., and remained until the lawn was cleared between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. that evening.
The note adds that if departure from the White House was delayed, a second crew would be needed for the return flight due to the limitation of service hours.
The original flight crew was with the helicopter during the event, while the unit's security personnel stayed with the aircraft during the time on the ground.
It was not clear from the records made available to TIME whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Records indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the determination.
"A question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case," the commander wrote.
"Sounds like you're locked up," the deputy commander replied.
The "Made in America" event was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But official events also have political overtones.
At the event, the president gave an impetus to the reform of health care reform underway in the Senate, and he promoted efforts to curb government regulations.
The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically beneficial purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are obliged to use them for the trip.
But requesting their use only for a photo operation is unusual.
Trump conducted an investigation in February when the presidential plane provided taxi services against the backdrop of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is full of reports complaining about the use of the presidential plane by his predecessor.
"The White House is thrilled with the show 'Made In America' - showing products from all 50 states made by American workers using American materials," said White House Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews frequently conduct training flights around Washington and South Lawn to depose the U.S. President in the White House with precise centimeter sets.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 carried out 58 exercise landings in the White House.
The flight for the “Made in America” event counted among the flight crew’s training needs for the month, an official said.
Helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours that day for "non-presidential support missions".
The White House said the taxpayers took over the burden for none of the other props presented at the event.
A Sikorsky spokesman said the company was not involved in exhibiting the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not maintain budget records for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to U.S. Department of Defense hourly rates for fiscal year 2017, the DoD refund rate for the VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
Records of the unit record the aircraft's flight time as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico, Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate.
“Determining the cost to taxpayers based on estimates for refund rates is highly misleading,” Walters said.
"These estimates include personnel, maintenance, and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds."
According to a 2015 RAND study, the DoD reimbursement rates do not include personnel costs, but take into account the costs of fuel, maintenance and contract conclusion.
At that time, former White House press spokesman Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
“The idea is to showcase things made in America this week,” Spicer said.
And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of their contribution to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not thousands of people are dependent on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.
Of course, it is appropriate to highlight that."
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter as he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver’s seat of a fire truck.
In the White House, Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the president, "I have three of them."
TC BW Neuss faces a tricky task
Leading player of the Second Tennis-Bundesliga competes at the third-placed Suchsdorfer SV.
The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss will compete tomorrow from 11 a.m. in Kiel at the third-placed Suchsdorfer SV.
Despite a flawless record after five matches, the leader of the Second Tennis Bundesliga has retained the sense of reality.
Team leader Marius Zay has respect for the opponent.
"This is a compact team that always plays in a very similar formation.
Especially in the back positions, I think the team is very good."
Imports from the far north provide class and stability for the Suchsdorfer SV.
"Their Danes and Finns can even point to Davis Cup stakes.
And they are also strong in doubles," says Zay with a view to Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
“It’s going to be hard for us, as always.
You also need a good portion of luck.”
The Neusser team for the trip in the far north is practical.
His debut for Blue-White could be Maxime Janvier.
Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic), who plays in the tournament in Liberec, Czech Republic, will make his first appearance this season if the French player who is currently still active in the Challenger tournament in Biella, Italy, does not make it to the Bundesliga game.
The previously undefeated Chilean Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was on the ball yesterday with Belarusian Andrei Vasilevski at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel.
But he should be in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both Netherlands) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two wins last Sunday against the club at the Alster, Máté Valkusz could also move into the team again.
If it is not enough for the 18-year-old Hungary, who was still the number one in the junior world rankings in January 2016, someone from the coaching staff around Marius Zay fills the squad.
How America Can Harm the OMV
Really happy, Donald Trump didn’t seem to be when he put his signature under the tightening of sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening.
"In his hurry to pass the law, Congress has packaged in a few "unconstitutional regulations," he etched.
The reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected, and even Brussels foamed against the US push.
After all, the draft envisages punishing European companies that help the Russians build gas pipelines into the EU.
Accordingly, since then investors of the domestic OMV, which together with other European companies co-finance the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea line Nord Stream 2 are worried.
The threat is huge.
Nevertheless, it is too early for an estimation of the consequences, according to the official statement of the oil company.
In fact, Donald Trump himself would still have to bring the sanctions to life by executive order.
There are 12 weapons to choose from.
"The press" has looked at which ones the company could defend and which ones could really hurt him.
Narco’s Season 3 Trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel will be the focus of Netflix’s hit series
Despite the second season of Narcos, which reveals Pablo Escobar’s killer, Netflix’s series is far from over.
Seasons three and four have already been confirmed by the streaming service, the first received its first trailer and showed the latest villains of the show.
With the third season, the DEA has focused its attention on the world’s richest organization of drug trafficking: the Cali Cartel.
Led by four powerful godparents, they operate "like a Fortune 500 company" only with more government bribes and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela is her head, Pacho Herrera commands the Mexican compound, and Chepe Santacruz Londono is located in New York.
In the newly released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, the guy who invites American and Colombian law enforcement to support the War on Drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will begin on September 1.
Roll Backwards: The City Recruits 46 Kitchen Helpers
The city organizes the daycare lunch table itself again.
With fixed contacts for the children and an assignment to the team.
In the urban daycare centers, the clock is turned back.
On 1 September, the city of Krefeld will take over the food supply in the municipal day care facilities (Kitas) again under its own control.
For Sonja Pommeranz, Deputy Head of the Department of Youth Aid, this is good news: "We were all very pleased".
Cooking is continued outside the house: a caterer takes over this task and delivers freshly cooked food cooled.
The city operates 46 day care centers in the Krefeld area, in 44 children get a warm meal at lunchtime.
In the last year of kindergarten, there were 2,800 children sitting at the tables, and the need is growing steadily.
"Not only children who are cared for for 45 hours a week eat lunch in the daycare center," explains Pomeranian.
"The offer is also valid in 35-hour care if children stay until 2 pm."
46 part-time employees have kitchen service from 1 September: they heat the delivered food, supplement it with salad, raw food and fruit, portion the meal individually, give out the food, clean out, rinse and clean the kitchen.
"The employees are permanently assigned to a daycare center," says Pommeranz.
The size - there are two-group as well as seven-group facilities - decides on the scope of the hour.
"The kitchen assistants are now part of the daycare team," says Pommeranz satisfied.
"So they are much more involved and it is easier for the daycare management to implement educational concepts".
Because that’s also what it’s all about: healthy food and cooking lessons.
"Kids should help prepare the food".
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team makes sense.
Also for the children.
"They have a known force in the kindergarten, a person who is familiar to them, and not constantly changing people".
This continuity is important for the children.
The cleaning of the daycare rooms - previously also the task of the kitchen workers - will be done by special cleaning personnel in the future.
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has not only the quality improvement of kitchen performance but also the charm that it has proven to be the most economical in the cost comparison between self-management and external allocation for the city, according to the press office.
And that despite the fact that 46 part-time employees are being recruited.
"But these hours are not as important for around 750 people in the education sector," says Sonja Pommeranz.
Afghan Democracy Depends on Women’s Political Role, UN Says
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, acting head of the United Nations mission, said that hundreds of women will run for council elections in the provinces. Three women are running for the role of vice president and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate fully and are involved in all parts of the election process.
Afghan elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections will take place on 5 April.
The Taliban have issued threats against an election process that coincides with the transition from international combat to an advisory role.
This year, for the first time, the elections will peacefully transfer power from one democratically elected government to the next.
Haysom said a strong role for women will reinforce Afghanistan’s democratic success.
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered out of a total of 3.6 million registered voters.
Hike to the TV Jubilee

Men try to rob a 13-year-old girl
Two young men aged 19 and 23 tried to rob a 13-year-old girl on Thursday.
According to police information, the men spoke to the 13-year-old, who was staying with friends on Kolping Street, around 2.55 p.m. because they wanted to call the girl's cell phone.
The 13-year-old refused the request and went on with her friends.
Then one of the perpetrators tried to grab the girl’s cell phone and necklace, but failed.
The duo fled without prey.
The two men were later arrested by the police.
The investigation is ongoing.
GMB concerns about investments in the McVitie factory in Glasgow
A union would like to check with managers of biscuit maker McVitie about the long-term commitment to production at their Glasgow plant.
GMB Scotland said the company had remained silent about the future of investments at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 employees work in the factory, which produces hobnobs and rich tea biscuits, among other products.
McVity’s owner, Pladis, said he has invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in recent years.
He added that employees and trade union representatives would "be the first to know" if their activities were to change.
In a letter to the company's branch manager, GMB Scotland urged McVitie's to "express concerns that funding for the modernization of production lines is not being pushed forward."
GMB Senior Organizer Drew Duffy said: “The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the General Site Manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross deeply affects our members.
Generations of families have worked here and the workforce focuses heavily on the local community and the Greater Glasgow area, an important pillar for decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage.
Therefore, under the perspective of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, rising living costs and chronic production decline, the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a thriving production presence at McVitie.”
A spokeswoman for Pladis said: “The Tollcross branch manager received a letter from GMB Scotland just yesterday, and the company will respond directly to it as we appreciate the continued engagement with employees and trade union representatives.
We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross two months ago, where some questions were discussed openly.
We discussed with the employees that, like all companies operating in a highly competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are continually reviewing our business - and this applies to all our business units and locations - in order to remain competitive.
She added: “In recent years, we have invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in our tollcross site, particularly in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognize Tollcross’s heritage as a manufacturing facility, and should our operations on the site change, employees and their union representatives will be the first to know.”
Did the PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar three years ago?
The side of La Liga may regret their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not slow down in its pursuit of Neymar after making an offer of <0xC2><0xA3>189 million to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona of the world record robbery three years ago?
The sensational approach has fueled the transfer window this summer as the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United last season for <0xC2><0xA3>89 million.
Upon completion, Neymar becomes the world’s most expensive player and the highest-paid professional athlete in the world. PSG offers wages of more than <0xC2><0xA3>500,000 per week.
Barcelona is angry about the way Neymar forced his way out, although a source close to the Catalan board insists that the club has always done its best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned about this prospect by the PSG president three years ago?
When Manchester City expressed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strong warning for any club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we'll be in opposition to them, we'll contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to have one of our players sign with them, it will have consequences."
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line, with the Spanish club expressing interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the International to leave Italy under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of that interest by losing one of their prize offers to Neymar.
Scooter overturned and damaged
On the night of Friday to Saturday, an unknown perpetrator deliberately overturned a scooter parked in Königsfelder Straße in front of the property number 30, causing damage to the vehicle's car.
The Schramberg police, phone 07422/27 01-0, asks for clues.
The police are looking for witnesses to an accident on the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese.
Because a car came to meet him on his lane, the driver of a VW Touran had to dodge and touched the guardrail.
On Thursday evening, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum was on his way to Leese with his VW on the B 215 from Stolzenau around 19:55.
In the area around Stolzenau, a car came to meet him on his lane, so he had to dodge to the right.
The Touran driver touched the guardrail.
The car was damaged.
The driver of the oncoming car, a Mercedes Benz, had overtaken a truck and continued his journey without worrying about the traffic accident.
According to the accident victim, it may be good that the Mercedes driver had not noticed the accident at all.
The police now ask witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the polluter vehicle to contact the commissariat in Stolzenau on tel. 05761 / 92060.
Interview: "Domspatzen report exonerates Pope-Brother Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburg Domspatzen report on the abuse cases relieves Pope-Brother Georg Ratzinger.
This is what author and historian Michael Hesemann says.
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen continues to sustain discussions.
Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement "We are Church", said after publication to the German Press Agency, he expects an apology from the former Regensburg bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller and from the cathedral chaplain Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emeritus Pope Benedict XVI.
It would be of great benefit to the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret over their own omissions or their then erroneous assessment of the events.
The Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano", on the other hand, criticized the fact that when reporting on violence at the Domspatzen with "two measures" are measured.
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubts that these are "disgraceful and shameful acts" that should be punished and prevented in the future; however, the "grade of media manipulation" is striking, according to the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian bioethics committee.
“The habit of calling the Catholic Church the source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and is preparing public opinion to consider it normal,” Scaraffia writes.
Also Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis said in an interview with the Bavarian Radio: "You like to go to the church and that is a found food".
She also pointed out that in her youth "beatings were a very normal pedagogical means to cope with naughty children like I was one."
It would be unfair to apply today’s standards to previous decades, because the world has changed.
In connection with the reports of the abuse cases, Pope-Brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.
Totally wrong, says author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote with Ratzinger the memory book "My brother the Pope" (translated into 12 languages).
“I have to protect Georg Ratzinger,” says Hesemann, “because all of this had nothing to do with him,” he evaluates the results of the final report.
What exactly does the 440-page report presented by Ulrich Weber, a lawyer commissioned by the Diocese of Regensburg with the enlightenment, say?
A total of 547 Regensburg cathedrals were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s "with high plausibility" victims of assaults, 67 cathedrals.
The final report states about Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "In summary, it can therefore be stated that in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence were used by Domkapellmeister R..
Especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be more severe.
Nevertheless, unlike many other accused, it is striking that many victims appreciated R.’s general humanity and, therefore, in many cases, despite violence, even associate positive memories with him.”
In the interview, Hesemann explains why he believes that the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Domspatzen relieves Georg Ratzinger.
Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents of violence against persons under protection at the Regensburg Domspatzen" gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.
On the one hand, many students emphasize his “humanity.”
On the other hand, he also appears as a cholera and perfectionist, who often became tangible when a cathedral squad did not achieve top performance musically.
How do you, as his biographer, value this final report?
Michael Hesemann: If you make the effort and read the whole 440-page report from front to back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger even appears in it.
There are only eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or co-confidence in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.
The excesses of violence in preschool also occurred outside of its sphere of action.
One can at best accuse him of having learned of it too late or of not having taken first hints seriously enough.
The Domspatzengymnasium, where he worked, was felt by virtually all respondents as - so literally - "redemption", "heaven" and "better world".
For example, the vast majority of his pupils Georg Ratzinger presents a very excellent testimony, describing him as "warm-hearted", "popular", "sincere", "competent" and "understanding", as an extremely good-hearted teacher, who regularly provided the boys with cakes, cookies and candies and was "always surrounded by grapes from children".
Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which has already led to outbursts of anger.
That he not only banged chairs and threw the keychain on the floor, but also spread slaps and pulled all too naughty guys on the hair or ears, he himself admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.
However, it must be said that such methods of education were widespread in the period in question, the 1960s and 1970s, among parents and teachers.
Do you know any of these methods of chastisement?
Of course, I think every one of us who was born before 1968.
I, too, have experienced this in a secular school, a state high school.
Compared to what this report is actually about, namely the appalling sexual abuse and violence in preschool, these are, of course, trivialities.
One wonders if it has nothing to do with his fame and his role as Benedict XVI’s brother, that many media have just rushed on him.
Many of the Bavarian Pope who have never understood him are still working hard.
But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every way!
In connection with the report, the media reported a lot about abuse at the Regensburg Domspatzen.
Is Georg Ratzinger also accused in the final report of any involvement or co-consciousness with regard to sexual abuse?
Michael Hesemann: Quite clearly no.
None of the 67 victims of sexual assault claim to have entrusted themselves to the cathedral chaplain.
Not even the parents were initiated.
"I never dared to talk to my father or my mother about it," one of the victims told the others, "it was very embarrassing to me."
The real problem with educating about sexual abuse was, and still is, that most victims remain silent out of shame.
If they did not even entrust themselves to parents and siblings, then certainly not to a choir director, who would have been, in a professional sense, a colleague of the perpetrators.
How do the Domspatzen students assess Ratzinger’s role in relation to the abuse cases?
Michael Hesemann: A questioned student put it this way: "As regards sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely findings and could have stopped the respective perpetrator.
I think it is ... also really absurd to assume that it is precisely him ... boys have opened up more intrusively or clearly or rather than to their parents, boarding school managers, trust teachers, etc.
That you talk to him about sex ... - unthinkable."
The report concludes: "The fact that students and/or their environment were entrusted to him in advance could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation".
As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is therefore to be acquitted of any knowledge.
Thus, he cannot be accused of not having prevented him or brought to trial.
Therefore, there is no reason to associate his good name with these disgusting crimes, as unfortunately happened in some cases.
In the media a lot of "violence excesses" was read at the Regensburg Domspatzen.
The former cathedral master Georg Ratzinger is accused in the report "Wegschauen".
Does he have to live with this accusation?
Michael Hesemann: That is the big problem, that in the reporting everything was mixed and mixed into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence excesses and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.
This is, in turn, an abuse of the report.
There is a clean separation: between preschool and high school of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violence excesses and, let’s say, other accusations.
In addition, the report covers incidents from the period since 1945, i.e. also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choir leader of the Domspatzen.
The whole horrific pedagogy of beatings, the cases in which boys were harassed and maltreated by sadistic teachers and suffered horribly, all happened at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where truly scandalous conditions must have prevailed.
But they had nothing to do with Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, because he did not see the boys until they were already at the Domspatzengymnasium.
On it, as the vast majority of witnesses emphasize, the subject of "preschool" was taboo.
They were only happy to have escaped her and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even "paradise" conditions.
What was different at the Domspatzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: There was discipline, but there was no sadistic violence.
And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in whom the report concludes that "many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases, despite violence, even associate positive memories with him".
At the very least, there is the accusation of having looked away.
However, in spite of all efforts, the report could only define two periods of time in which it was reported about preschool conditions.
The first time in 1970/71, when he just started to establish himself, and from the events at a school where he just didn’t work and was responsible, he didn’t want to hear anything, and then again in 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger consistently close his ears to the conditions?
Michael Hesemann: No, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduces.
He said: “We continue to practise beatings in preschool.”
Even in the face of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent action.
This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, when beatings had long been forbidden in Bavaria.
Before that, they happened in a legal gray zone, as we all know.
It was also difficult for him to estimate where the victims might have been exaggerated or dramatized and where the permissible limit had actually been exceeded.
You can’t say he always looked away.
That's just not true.
It was not until 1980 that the beatings in schools were officially abolished in Bavaria.
Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today’s pedagogical standards to the time.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We historians are talking about the "trick of anachronism", that is, the danger of evaluating the past according to today's moral standards.
The princess is right.
But, of course, this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abominable at all times, nor to what was committed in preschool in repulsiveness and violence against innocent children's souls, which goes far beyond the usual at the time.
It's all terrible and I'm glad it's finally being reworked.
But at the same time I have to protect Georg Ratzinger, because all of this had nothing to do with him.
His means of discipline and punishment, i.e. slapping and pulling on the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.
When physical punishment was banned, he adhered strictly to it.
What picture of his time in Regensburg did Georg Ratzinger reproduce in the talks with you for the book "My Brother the Pope"?
Was the subject of beatings also discussed?
Michael Hesemann: Well, this book is about the life of his brother Joseph, Pope Benedict XVI, and tells from his perspective that the cathedral patrons played only a secondary role.
Nevertheless, I do not deny that he led a strict regiment there.
But this also has to be said: without this perfectionism, without the demand for unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world class from the Regensburg Domspatzen previously known nationally, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and its musical tradition, who went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With biscuits and candies alone, one does not make rebellious boys great singers and stand before every success, no matter what field, but always discipline, passion and self-overcome.
What kind of person did you see Georg Ratzinger in the conversations about her book?
Michael Hesemann: By working on the book and beyond, I really got to know Georg Ratzinger very well and have experienced him again and again as wonderful, humorous, basically kind, deeply believing and heart-good people, who you can’t imagine that he could even hurt a fly.
I regularly get to know how many former cathedral bishops still today, 23 years after his retirement, regularly keep in touch with him, visit him, read to him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family.
Those who have not forgiven him for once being strict with them to this day are thus clearly in the minority.
Most cathedrals today are grateful to him for enriching their lives and bringing them closer to the world of music.
And that he was always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, of course, that may be - but also a lovable respectful person, to whom they still look up today and who they venerate.
And please, once again quite clearly: all that is reproached are methods of education that were on the agenda at the time.
We can be happy that we have overcome this time long ago.
But it is highly unfair to make a man a media scapegoat just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother.
The evil intention behind it is all too obvious.
Because the report that has just been published relieves him of his burden.
Now the decency would order a 93-year-old man, who has earned great merits and without whom outside Bavaria and perhaps even Germany probably no one would know the Regensburg Domspatzen, to finally leave in peace.
