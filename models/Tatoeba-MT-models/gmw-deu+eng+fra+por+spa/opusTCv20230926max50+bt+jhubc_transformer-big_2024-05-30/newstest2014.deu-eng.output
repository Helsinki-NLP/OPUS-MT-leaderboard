Gutach: Even more safety for pedestrians
They are not 100 meters apart: On Tuesday in Gutach the new B 33 pedestrian traffic light at the village parking lot was put into operation - in sight of the older city hall traffic lights.
Two plants so close together: intention or shield burglary?
This question was answered by the mayor yesterday.
"The city hall traffic light was installed at the time because it secures the school path," Eckert explained yesterday.
The Kluser traffic lights secure both cyclists and bus passengers as well as the Bergle residents.
The plant officially commissioned yesterday is important for the intersection Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße.
We have the museum, two churches, a spa park, a bus stop, a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area <0xE2><0x80><0xBA>Grub<0xE2><0x80><0xB9>.
"With the high traffic and pedestrian traffic, there had to be another traffic light for their safety," says Eckert.
This is also confirmed by Peter Arnold of the Offenburg Landratsamt.
"According to current measurements, about 12,000 vehicles pass through the municipality of Gutach every day on the B 33, of which about ten percent are heavy-duty traffic," Arnold emphasizes.
Therefore, the construction of another traffic light is more than necessary: "Security is simply here first," says Arnold.
A total of four traffic shows were carried out, a roundabout was also envisaged, but because of the narrowness in the intersection Sulzbachweg / Kirchstraße again discarded.
According to Arnold, everything was previously tested during the location selection of the traffic lights: "With the help of a van loaded with particularly long wooden logs, we tested whether these vehicles can leave the Sulzbachweg on the B 33 without bending the traffic lights".
The traffic light system itself, which costs around 15,000 euros, is the "most modern thing currently available on the market," Arnold explained.
The system is equipped with colored LEDs, which shine so powerfully that the lights are easily recognizable by the drivers, for example, even in the low sun.
And it is also economical: the older lighting systems consume about 100 watts, the new only eight watts.
There are three lighting systems per direction of travel.
Arnold explained the technology of the new system: This is equipped with two radar sensors.
If the pedestrian presses the traffic light button, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation.
If the road is free, immediately comes green for the pedestrian, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase can be ended for the pedestrian.
“If a group or people with disabilities cross the road, the green phase will be extended, so everyone will safely cross the road,” Arnold said.
Of course, the driver has to think along as a partner and observe the road.
This was not the case yesterday: the traffic lights for pedestrians barely showed green, an upper class vehicle rushed through - in bright red.
For more than 30 years, Josef Winkler has been writing about the hardships of his childhood and youth.
The catastrophes of his Catholic village childhood - the speechlessness, the propensity to raw violence and dull sexuality, the narrowness and joylessness - has been described many times by the Carinthian poet.
The Büchner Prize winner is mainly known as a prose author, theatre texts are rare in his work.
Collage from prose texts Gerhard Fresacher puts together a collage of prose texts for his performance "Weather lights on the tip of the tongue", which can now be seen in the Garage X at Petersplatz.
The theatre maker combines elements from the autobiographical novel "Der Knechte" (1987) with prose miniatures from "Leichnam, seine Familie bewachenden" (2003).
On the largely empty stage - an important requirement: a crumpled sofa on which the eight-headed ensemble is suggestively copulated and masturbated - the textual material hangs through it.
Director Fresacher seems to have little confidence in the text.
The 70-minute performance overwhelms the original with a wealth of directorial ideas, known from the repertoire of post-dramatic forms of play.
Especially the actresses get involved in the sometimes somewhat questionable scenic implementations.
They are touched hard, dipped under water with their heads, tapped to the wall with their evening robes.
Encased in cellophane or bodice, they stab at dangerously tall legs through the staging, either monologize loudly or lie completely silent on the stage floor.
The text, however, hardly conveys itself in this hard-working way.
The evening has the best moments when singing - the bandwidth ranges from Deep Purple to folk songs.
Only towards the end does the overwhelming performance come a bit to rest, and Winkler’s absurd humor flashes.
A black box in the car?
U.S. road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the decaying highway system, and believe they have found the solution in a small black box that can be found in the dashboard of any car.
The devices that record every kilometre driven and report the information to the authorities are at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and the state’s planning offices to revise the outdated system of financing U.S. roads.
The usually rather boring area of road planning has suddenly sparked an intense debate with colorful alliances.
Libertarians have allied with environmental groups and advocate that the government can use the small boxes to record the kilometres travelled – and possibly where they were driven – and then use the information to calculate tax receipts.
The tea party is horrified.
The American Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of privacy concerns.
But while Congress cannot agree on a move, several states are no longer waiting.
They are currently looking at how to switch over the next ten years to a system where drivers pay per mile driven.
Thousands of drivers have already tested the tachographs, some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring.
This is truly a must for our country.
“It’s nothing we’re just potentially going to use,” said Hasan Ikhrata, managing director of the Southern California Assn. of Governments, which plans to record miles driven among all California drivers in the state from 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
The technology for this is there.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is funded from the taxes that Americans pay at the pump, is bankrupt.
In America, however, fuel is not as much as it used to be.
Cars consume less gasoline.
The state mineral oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 cents per litre) has not risen in 20 years.
Politicians do not dare to raise the tax even by a penny at high fuel prices.
“The gasoline tax is simply not sustainable,” said Lee Munnich, a traffic legislation expert at the University of Minnesota.
His state has recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs to test a mile-based payment system.
“This is the most meaningful alternative in the long term,” he said.
Bureaucrats call it a mile-based user fee.
Not surprisingly, the idea is appealing to urban liberals, as the tax could be used, for example, to influence driving behaviour in such a way as to reduce congestion and climate-damaging exhaust gases.
The Californian planners are relying on the system to develop strategies to achieve the state’s ambitious, legally enshrined goals on climate change.
But Pennsylvania Republican Bill Shuster, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also stated that he sees it as the most viable long-term alternative.
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also inspired by the idea of having drivers pay for the distance covered.
“This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole,” explains Adrian Moore, vice president of guidelines at Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former U.S. transport ministers who, in a 2011 report, had urged Congress to move toward mile-based settlement.
Last year, the U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project that would have included 10,000 cars.
But the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the move, responding to the concerns of MEPs from rural areas who represent people who often have to travel many miles on their way to work or to the city in everyday life.
Nevertheless, several states and major cities are moving in this direction on their own.
The most committed is Oregon, which currently recruits 5,000 drivers for the country’s largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay the mileage fees instead of the petroleum tax to the state.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is also considering this.
Illinois is testing it with trucks to a limited extent.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transport ministries of 17 states on the east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida), is currently investigating how to introduce the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with the devices, drivers were skeptical about the idea that the government could track any of their movements.
“Concerns about Big Brother and things like that were a big problem,” said Alauddin Khan, head of strategy and earnings management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
People didn't want it.
When the test started, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: “It would be relatively easy to turn the tachographs into adult surveillance devices.”
There is no need to build a gigantic, bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is one of a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology that allows the state to track the miles driven, but not exactly when and where.
So, according to Khan, the public would be more reassured.
The hunt for this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California.
The company originally did not start to help states tax drivers.
Rather, their goal was to gain a foothold in an emerging automotive insurance market, where drivers should pay based on the miles travelled.
But the devices she tested are also interesting for the road planners, because they do not work with GPS and only provide limited information, which is regularly uploaded by modem.
“People are more willing to get involved if their speed and locations are not recorded,” said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
Major mistakes have been made in some of these public pilot programs.
There are significantly cheaper and less intrusive ways to do this.
In Oregon, planners are experimenting with giving drivers a range of choices.
You can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they choose no device at all and instead pay a flat fee based on the average miles driven by all residents of the state.
Others hope to be able to sell the concept of a suspicious public by equipping the devices with more features than with fewer.
In New York City, traffic officials want to develop a taxation device that can also be used to pay parking fees, pay insurance only for kilometers driven, and collect speed data from other vehicles in real time, which allows drivers to avoid traffic jams.
“Automobilists would be motivated to participate by the added value of the benefits the system offers,” the city’s planning document says.
However, some traffic planners wonder whether the whole talk about paying per mile is not just a huge distraction.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay area, officials said Congress could solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund simply by raising the fuel tax.
An additional one-time fee or an annual fee could be imposed on drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little gasoline, so that they also pay a fair share.
"There is no reason for surgery if an aspirin is enough," said Randy Rentschler, the Commission's head of legislation and public affairs.
When we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers worry about their privacy and many other things.
Kingsfield: Small team beats itself wacker
The voluntary fire brigade managed their autumn main rehearsal with braveness despite staff shortages.
Only 11 people participated in the exercise.
In his practice assumption, Division Commander Hans Kammerer had chosen the Feder estate in Burgberger Straße.
A short circuit is supposed to have been created there during the sawing.
As a result of the fire and smoke, two people were injured, but one of them was able to send an emergency call.
After the first inspection by Hans Kammerer, two respirators of the Wehr prepared to enter the building.
After a short time, it was possible to find the first person and lead them out into the open.
The second person had to be worn.
This was not so easy, as a narrow staircase was also to be overcome.
The building, a workshop with integrated stables for two horses, was not easy to secure.
There was a lot of wood and straw bales in it.
There were also electric machines for woodworking.
The first extinguishing attack took place via the tank in the vehicle.
Another line was carried out via an overfloor hydrant at a distance of about 100 meters.
Three extinguishing attacks could now be designed.
A hollow jet tube was also used in the building.
Hans Kammerer was also involved in the exercise to show what can be accomplished with little staff available.
In the event of an emergency, support will be provided by the Königsfeld day-to-day operation group.
The commander was pleased with the course of the exercise.
Networking of universities and companies is important
During his visit to the district of Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald, President of the Landtag Guido Wolf was also informed in Titisee-Neustadt about where the workforce of tomorrow came from.
At the Förderzentrum Hochschwarzwald he worked together with the managers of the vocational schools as well as the district gymnasium and the parents’ board chairs on this important question.
"Education is an important location factor," underlined Claudia Stehle, director of the Hans-Thoma-Schule, who presented the networked school project Bildungszentrum Hochschwarzwald.
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for training.
Since 2011, there has been a successful cooperation between the Förderzentrum, the Kreisgymnasium and the vocational school centre in the forest city.
He also praised the family-friendliness in the county.
"It is important not only to keep an eye on the family phase, but also the phase around the care of relatives due to demographic change," explained Wolf.
He also stated that more and more employees were taking care of the care and care of their loved ones.
"Without the support of employers, the resulting burden on employees can lead to termination of the employment relationship," said Wolf.
But no one can afford to lose skilled workers, he said.
Another, particularly important factor is the networking of universities and companies.
"Those who have already learned the advantages of the region during their studies, with their acquired knowledge and skills, are often preserved by the regional economy, which contributes to the strengthening of the region," the president of the state parliament was convinced.
Because only if sufficient training places were offered, the professional needs could also be covered.
In his opinion, the location advantage of the district is its advantageous location in the southwest of Germany, in close proximity to France and Switzerland.
On his train journey from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg, he also witnessed the efforts already undertaken to expand public transport.
"Continue stubborn and make sure that public transport gets better," he explained to the local politicians present.
Enjoy a fun afternoon with music
For the past 15 years, the Kaul family has been inviting Dietinger seniors to coffee, cake and then to a vesper.
In the past, the older fellow citizens were hosted in the resting place.
In the meantime, this afternoon will take place in the nursing home St. Josef.
The residents were looking forward to the delicious cakes and cakes.
Later there was sausage salad.
Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich entertained with popular melodies.
The more than 100-year-old natural stone wall as the front demarcation of the old school yard to Kirchstraße before the renovation is to be put on the renovation cost plan of the city of Bräunlingen.
In the days before the Kilbig, during the first work of renovation of the front schoolyard, a small angular wall was installed to stabilize and static relieve the more than a hundred-year-old natural stone wall with balustrade.
According to Alexander Misok of the Bräunlinger Stadtbauamt, the further steps are planned to involve the Landesdenkmalamt in the planning and to create a renovation concept for the old wall.
Afterwards, a cost calculation will be carried out by experts, which will then be put on the table of the municipal council for the decision and determination of the further procedure.
A decision on this is expected to be taken as early as next year.
After the renovation, paving and tree planting of the old school courtyard within the two side wings of the school built in 1912, the boundary wall in need of renovation must be refurbished from the ground up and placed on new substructure as a follow-up measure in the foreseeable future.
The historic, one hundred years old delimitation wall of the old schoolyard to Kirchstraße, is mainly due to water and frost damage, as there is no drainage, in need of renovation and has a bow inclination to the front.
Deep cracks in individual stones testify to weather damage, but the wall is currently not at risk of collapse.
A stable wall is a prerequisite for a schoolyard used by students, which has been done by the current fortification work.
The schoolyard renovation was originally planned in 2008/2009, but high unscheduled expenses caused a postponement.
An important word for the historic school wall renovation, which has even been used for filming, will be spoken by the Landesdenkmalamt.
If specifications come from this site, then the city of Bräunlingen hopes for grants from the monument conservationists.
The students of Bräunlinger Grundschule, who are now being taught in a well-renovated old school building with a new auditorium, will soon be able to use the old school courtyard.
<0xC3><0x96>zdemir wants to receive jazz training in Stuttgart
Cem <0xC3><0x96>zdemir, the Federal Chairman of the Greens, has now taken part in the ongoing discussions about the future of music academies in Baden-Württemberg.
"I think it is wrong to give up the holistic education at the Musikhochschule Stuttgart," <0xC3><0x96>zdemir told the "Stuttgarter Nachrichten".
Jazz and classical music belong together at the jazz location Stuttgart.
Thus, <0xC3><0x96>zdemir, who is considered a favorite in Stuttgart for a direct mandate in the German parliamentary elections on 22 September, contradicts the Green-Red state government.
On the basis of an expert study, this is pushing for a reorganization of the five music academies in Baden-Württemberg.
Among other things, the study programme Jazz and Pop will be relocated from the Musikhochschule Stuttgart to the Musikhochschule Mannheim.
U.S. border: "Super-Tunnel" to drug smuggling discovered
At the border between Mexico and the United States, investigators have discovered and shut down a “super tunnel” for drug smuggling.
According to the U.S. customs authorities, the more than 500 meters long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, rail tracks and a ventilation system.
Three suspects were arrested, eight tons of marijuana and nearly 150 kilograms of cocaine confiscated.
The tunnel had not yet been used.
"These cartels are stupid when they think they could dig under the radar," Southern California District Attorney General Laura Duffy said at a press conference outside a San Diego warehouse where the one end of the tunnel had been discovered.
Turning to the drug gangs, Duffy assured: "If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them, we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money."
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a permanent fight against the drug cartels.
Since 2006, more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with the drug crime.
Designed by experts
Due to the complex equipment of the tunnel, the investigators assume that it was designed by architects and engineers and that the construction took about a year.
The track system was equipped in such a way that electric carriages could be used there.
On the Mexican side, the access is in a building that is 80 meters from the border.
According to the authorities, a ladder leads 20 meters deep to the actual tunnel entrance.
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 meters in height and 90 centimeters in width.
It would also have been suitable for promoting illegal immigration to the United States.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine discovery.
The third, a Mexican, was arrested for seizing marijuana.
All three of them face life imprisonment as a maximum sentence, officials said.
Eight such tunnels have been discovered since 2006, according to the press conference in San Diego.
This is the first time cocaine has been found in such a tunnel.
Usually cocaine is smuggled in smaller amounts and not through tunnels.
This shows the “despair” of the drug gangs, whose traditional routes have now been cut off, said Bill Sherman of the DEA drug search in San Diego.
They would do anything to get to the United States.
No details were disclosed about the detainees, at least one was Mexican, it said.
You will have to face imprisonment for up to 10 years.
2014 will be Geisinger Festival Year
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250.
The return of the first documentary mention is getting closer and closer.
When the year comes to an end in just over eight weeks, the anniversary year is about to come.
Geisingen and church houses were first mentioned together in 794 documents.
In churches, a document was produced in which both places are mentioned.
On March 15, there will be an official start to the anniversary year, and since Geisingen currently has no hall, this kick-off event takes place in the place where both were first mentioned 1250 years ago, in Kirchen-Hausen.
As part of the anniversary, a number of events are planned both in Geisingen and in church houses.
Kirchen-Hausen will be held in July on a festive weekend from 18 to 20 July the 1250.
Celebrate your return.
On Friday with a celebration, on Saturday and Sunday with a celebration around the Kirchthalhalle.
On this festival weekend is also the Kirchen-Hausener Kirchenfest.
City Music Director Rudolf Barth has written a commissioned composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary, which will be performed on three dates.
On 21 June together with the Solstice of the Black Forest Association, on 12 July in the arena with fireworks and on 13 December as the first concert of city music in the new Festhalle.
This will be completed and inaugurated in the jubilee year, the official date is on the last weekend of September, on 27 and 28 September.
On the occasion of the Geisinger Stadtjubiläum, a new chronicle will also be published.
"But it should not only be a chronicle of Geisingen themselves, but a printed work about Geisingen today, which consists of Geisingen, Kirchen-Hausen, Leipferdingen, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen," said Mayor Walter Hengstler.
And today’s Geisingen also celebrates 2014’s birthday, in 1974 the present space was completed with the incorporations.
The new chronicle will be presented on November 21 or 22 in the new Festhalle in Geisingen.
2014 is also a year of many anniversaries.
The Strohglonki Fool’s Guild begins on 8 February with a traditional evening on the occasion of its 60th anniversary, the Harmonie Gutmadingen turns 90 years old and has the festive banquet on 29 March and then celebrates the district music festival from 1 to 4 May.
The Altenwerk Leipferdingen turns 40 years old, the Geisinger School has been at the new location for 50 years and celebrates this on 10 May, the music association Polyhymnia Leipferdingen turns 150 years old and celebrates this as part of the fountain festival from 4 to 7 July.
The city of Geisingen was first mentioned in documents in a gift certificate, which is owned by the monastery of St. Gallen, in 764.
The document was produced in churches (houses) that were courtyards at the time.
Both communities are mentioned in the same document.
Reason to celebrate this 1250-year-old in 2014 accordingly, in addition, the municipal reform is also 40 years ago.
Council targets track systems
Should the railway crossing "Am Hirschen" be extensively rebuilt in order to increase road safety?
Yes, the city councils have decided.
Schiltach has to take in 220,000 euros for this.
Deutsche Bahn plans to improve the Kinzigtal railway line next year.
In particular, the safety at railway crossings is to be increased - there are regular collisions of trains with other vehicles across the country.
If the municipalities agree to the restructuring measures, they must participate in the costs with a third, the rest is shared by railways and the federal government.
Schiltach's city builder Roland Griesshaber explained to the municipal council the peculiarities of the Bah crossing "Am Hirschen".
There, the city plans to build a bulge at the level of the tunnel mouth west of the railway tracks.
There, even larger vehicles, such as those that transport long logs, could stand in counter-traffic without having to block the tracks.
Grießhaber therefore proposed to construct a necessary retaining wall in such a way that the city could, in due course, widen the adjacent road in order to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.
This was discussed controversially in the municipal council, as some councils questioned the need for a road widening: Thomas Kipp summed up the mood of the critics with his statement: "Should we take so much money into our hands because of so few vehicles?"
Mayor Thomas Haas disagreed: The railway crossing "Hirschen" is regularly used for long wood transports.
Even wood from the "Kuhbach" area is partly transported over this route, because the up to 20-meter-long vehicles could not use the route at the Häberlesbrücke, because they could not turn into the main road there.
In addition, the route serves as a diversion for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is closed, Haas argued.
Since it is to be expected that Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnels would have to be rebuilt and refurbished, as is currently the case in Wolfach, the railway crossing "Am "Hirschen" could also have an important traffic significance for a longer period.
The councils agreed to investigate the cost of the proposed widening of the road.
Notwithstanding this, the majority agreed to the conversion of the railway crossing with the proviso that the required retaining wall would be constructed in such a way that the city could extend the following road towards "Bahnhofstraße" to around 5.5 meters, if necessary, for meeting traffic.
The conversion of the railway crossing at the tannery Trautwein, on the other hand, could lead to a completely different problem, which concerns the access to the strongly rising "Geroltzhäuser Weg".
The administration had had the railway's conversion plans examined by the engineering office Breinlinger, since it had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser Weg would then be possible without further ado.
The investigation concluded that it could not be ruled out that the slopes of the road could cause longer vehicles to sit.
The responsibility for this, in turn, is borne by the city as a road load carrier.
The restructuring could therefore result in liability disputes.
Since both the wood removal and the bending worked in the current state of expansion, one should not agree to the conversion of the railway crossing, Haas argued.
At this point, too, the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle standing on the transition is significantly lower than at the other railway crossings, because the stop point in the middle, to which there is a good visual connection, is located directly next to it.
Even trains from the main station would have to be slowed down at this point so that no collision was imminent.
Majority of the authorities refused the approval of the conversion of this crossing, as the city of Schiltach would have to "bathe out" the problem with sitting vehicles, according to the councils, as the railway could withdraw from responsibility after completion of the construction work.
The board considers that the conversions at the railway crossings "Vor Heubach" and "Vor Kuhbach", for which intersection agreements with the railway have already been made, are unproblematic.
Esa decides on large space missions: missions for billions
Faraway planets, gravitational waves or black holes – experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects that they intend to launch in the coming years.
Thirty proposals were available, five are still in the race.
Far Worlds.
More than 1,000 planets at other stars have already been found by astronomers.
Whether there is life on at least some of them, no one knows.
The choice is difficult: Should one search for gravitational waves?
Or would you rather explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or searching for Earth-like planets and perhaps discovering extraterrestrial life?
These are the questions that are being asked by the European Space Agency (ESA).
For their "Cosmic Vision" program, they are looking for ideas for two major space projects that are intended to advance research decisively.
The budget for such "L-missions" is about one billion euros each.
The launch is expected to be in 2028 and 2034.
At the beginning of September, the elite of European space exploration met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
Thirty ideas were discussed, five of which have now been shortlisted.
Numerous committees review the proposals, hook up with the researchers.
In the next few days, a final decision is to be made by the Scientific Program Committee.
In total, the ESA has selected four major questions to be answered by the missions of the Cosmic Vision program initiated in 2007.
What are the conditions for the formation of planets and life?
The exact processes in the formation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus also the formation of planets orbiting these stars - are still in the proverbial dark.
A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this darkness.
And if a star has planets, under what circumstances can life be created there?
In order to investigate this question, the Cheops Space Telescope will be launched in 2017, with which 500 already known planetary systems in our immediate vicinity will be studied in more detail.
But the possibilities are limited, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
With larger instruments, astronomers could map Earth-like planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres, searching for "biomarkers": gases that are considered to be an indication of biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
This question, too, is ultimately intended to shed light on the preconditions for the emergence of life.
An important role is played by the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field and the particle radiation it emits with the planetary system.
In our solar system, these processes can be studied exemplarily.
With the "Solar Orbiter", the Esa has already approved a mission of the M-Class (there the budget is about half a billion euros) for this question.
The probe is set to launch in 2017 and monitor the surface and activity of the Sun closely.
Jupiter and its moons are also of great interest to the researchers.
They want to find out what role the giant planet played in the development of the solar system.
For this purpose, the ESA envisages the first of the three L-missions of the Cosmic Vision program.
The Juice (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) probe is expected to begin its journey in 2022.
Eight years later, it reaches Jupiter and is expected to study the planet's atmosphere as well as the icy moons Europe, Callisto and Ganymede.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
The universe offers many opportunities to study matter under extreme conditions and thus to investigate whether the laws of nature known to us are still valid there.
Perhaps there are also deviations that could show the physicists the way to a new theory, under the umbrella of which all known laws of nature can be combined.
How did the universe come into being and what does it consist of?
13.7 billion years ago, our cosmos was created by the Big Bang.
In addition to the matter we are familiar with, which consists of stars, planets and living beings like us, there is dark matter, whose gravity holds galaxies and galaxy clusters together, and dark energy, whose action accelerates the expansion of the universe.
So far, the researchers do not know which physical laws were valid in the first fractions of a second of the Big Bang, nor what dark matter and dark energy are.
With "Euclid", the ESA has already approved an M-mission, whose launch is scheduled for 2020.
Using a special telescope, the probe will investigate the distribution of matter in the universe throughout the sky for the first time, enabling conclusions about the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could make the race
Of the 30 proposals, only two will remain at the end of the selection process.
According to many experts, the best chance of obtaining an L-mission is "E-Lisa", a sophisticated concept for the detection of gravitational waves.
Physicists understand changes in the structure of space-time that Albert Einstein predicted almost 100 years ago.
They have not been proven to date.
Elisa could do this, the scientists behind the project hope.
The mission provides a two- or three-probe detector that is stationed in space.
In contrast to systems on Earth, it could also detect gravitational waves that were created during the Big Bang, thus providing new insights into the formation of the cosmos.
Four more proposals are competing for the second L-mission: a large X-ray telescope called "Athena", which will explore black holes, "Icy Planets", another mission to the outer planets of the Solar System, "Prism", a mission to survey the cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder", which will investigate and track Earth-like planets.
Proposals for the return of samples from Mars, for the exploration of the Moon, Venus and asteroids as well as for solar physics have already been eliminated.
Snowden ready to "cooperate" with Germany on U.S. surveillance
Edward Snowden, the U.S. intelligence whistleblower, has declared he is ready to travel to Berlin and testify before the German Bundestag if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander do not provide answers about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where he received asylum to discuss the statement in Germany.
In a letter from Snowden presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, Ströbele wrote: “Even though the outcome of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat a dissenting opinion as a breach of allegiance and attempts to criminalize political expression with a threat of punishment, in which no defense is possible.”
To tell the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Snowden wrote that he was convinced that the support of the international community could convince the American government to drop the charges against him.
The indictment brought by the U.S. Department of Justice includes espionage and theft of state property.
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich told Zeit Online: “If Mr Snowden is willing to speak with German representatives, then we will find ways to make that possible.”
Relations between the United States and Germany are burdened by claims that the NSA has intercepted the cell phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the MP who heads the parliamentary committee responsible for intelligence, said that the opportunity should be seized to hear Snowden as a witness if possible, “without endangering him and completely ruining relations with the United States.”
Ströbele, a Green MP, posted a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Ströbele explained that according to the lawyer of former NSA employee Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Snowden testifies in Germany, then he needs an assurance that he is “safe” there, the MP said.
Snowden said in his letter that he faced a “serious and ongoing” persecution campaign that drove him out of his homeland.
However, he was touched by the worldwide reaction to “my act of political expression.”
Citizens around the world, as well as high-ranking politicians – including in the United States – have described the revelations about an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance as a merit to the general public.
In his letter, Snowden makes an offer to the German authorities to cooperate “when the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been resolved.”
Frontier Airlines charges for carry-on baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to demand up to $100 from passengers who want to store hand luggage on their flight.
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to $100 for a piece of hand luggage and $2 for coffee or lemonade, even though it was stated in the announcement on Wednesday that passengers would be allowed to keep the whole can.
The new fee applies to hand luggage in the luggage compartment above the seat, small bags below the seat are still free.
Frontier said it would charge $25 if the fee is paid in advance, and $100 for travelers who only paid at the gateway.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee was aimed at moving travelers to take care of the payment in advance.
"We don't want to calculate this sum," she explained.
Airlines began charging for the first and second checked baggage in 2008.
Passengers who tried to circumvent this have therefore stuffed as much as possible into hand luggage, resulting in the luggage compartments above the seat being often overcrowded.
Fees are a way of encouraging passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said the new fee isn't really about making money.
It concerns Frontier’s most loyal customers, who have clearly stated that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find space in the compartment above the seat.
Passengers who buy your tickets on the airline’s website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger may be allowed to carry a piece of luggage free of charge at Frontier’s gateway, but the next person will have to pay $100 for a comparable piece of luggage.
O’Malley said Frontier’s website and check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers would be informed of the fee before arriving at the gate.
Frontier’s new carry-on baggage fee will only come into effect in the summer, with no exact date yet.
Passengers often gossip about baggage surcharges and other charges, but airlines like to rely on them.
They argue that carrying the baggage costs money and passengers should pay for this service if they wished it.
Many on Wall Street see the new baggage charges as a sign that airlines are raising enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
However, most people have so far avoided hand luggage fees.
Three years ago, Spirit Airlines Inc. was the first to charge for hand luggage, and later followed Allegiant Air, another low-cost airline.
The only other airline with such a fee is the Hungarian Wizz Air, said airline advisor Jay Sorensen, who is closely monitoring the additional fees.
He estimated in a December 2011 report that the hand luggage fee raised Spirit $50 million annually.
Sorensen, who previously held a leadership position at Midwest Airlines, recently flew with Spirit and was curious about what would expect him at the gateway if passengers were faced with the company’s unusual carry-on baggage fee.
“The boarding process was one of the smoothest I’ve experienced in my aviation career,” he said.
I expected to see teeth grinding and hand-to-hand discussions at the gateway.
“The plane was full,” he explained, “and the boarding was running like lubricated.”
Frontier also follows Spirit with the $2, which are required for coffee, tea, lemonade or juice.
The company stated that passengers who bought lemonade or juice would be allowed to keep the whole can and coffee would be refilled free of charge.
Water is still free.
US Airways had briefly tried to demand money for soft drinks in 2008, but reversed it seven months later after passengers complained and no other large company had followed.
Frontiers’ step to charge hand luggage fees if passengers do not buy directly from the airline is the most recent initiative aimed at directing customers to its own website.
Airlines pay online travel agencies such as Orbitz $10 to $25 per ticket sold.
This provides all companies with an incentive to move passengers to buy directly from them instead of through an online travel agency.
Frontier, however, has gone the farthest in this area.
In September, the company began to award half as many frequent flyer miles when booking through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, the miles were reduced again to 25 percent of the flight route.
An air trip booked with a third-party provider with Frontier over 1000 miles therefore only earns customers 250 miles.
Passengers can also reserve seats exclusively for direct purchases on Frontier’s website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its Denver headquarters, but the business is shrinking and the company is losing money.
Revenue declined by 9 percent and flight capacity shrunk by just under 13 percent in the first quarter, according to the financial report released Wednesday by the parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic has tried to control Frontier’s finances as part of the company’s sale.
Proverbs come from the Bible
About 40 women attended the last women’s breakfast this year in the Protestant parish of Bisingen.
The theme of the day in the parish hall was "Proverbs from the Bible" and "Reports from the Middle Ages".
After breakfast, Zita Köhler, the chairwoman of the church council, gave a talk on the Bible proverbs.
"Proverbs contain life wisdom, regulations or warnings," she explained.
She compared several proverbs with the corresponding Bible passages and explained the meaning.
She used sayings like, “Be watchful, wooden eye, like scales falling from your eyes, keep an eye on someone whom the Lord gives in his sleep, wash his hands in innocence.”
Several times the speaker had her listeners advised which proverb it was.
The church councilwoman Christel Dehner took up the Middle Ages phrases: All good things are three, blue, bite something.
She explained the meaning and origin of the phrases she called "bridges into the past".
Finally, a raffle was drawn.
The prizes were laid out on a table and were humorously outlined before being handed over to the winners.
Among the visitors of the breakfast round was also Mayor candidate Roman Waizenegger mixed.
Learning instead of unemployment: pilot project for unskilled people in tourism
Today, a pilot project for the tourism industry is starting at the Mecklenburg Lake District.
Under the leadership of the Federal Employment Agency, 49 women and men who already work as unskilled in the industry will qualify for specialists for hotels and restaurants over three winters.
"New is that the six-month courses end with degrees," said Carmen Wiechert of the employment agency Neubrandenburg.
The benefits are many: the participants would not be unemployed, the companies would get trained professionals, who were increasingly lacking in hotels and restaurants, and the agency would not have to finance unemployment.
The Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Neubrandenburg and the German Hotel and Restaurant Association (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern are also involved in the project.
NSA says it was an “internal mistake” and not hackers to blame for website crash
The shadowy National Security Agency said late Friday that an error had crippled their public website for several hours and not hackers, as claimed online.
"NSA.gov was unavailable for a few hours tonight because an internal error occurred during a scheduled update," the spy agency said in an email.
The problem will be resolved this evening.
The allegation that the failure was caused by a distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack was not true.
In the early evening hours, online server trackers had noticed that the NSA website was unavailable for at least six hours and for some users it still isn’t.
A spokesman for the NSA told ABC News that the agency’s sensitive internal network was “in no way” compromised.
Secret information is not in danger, the spokesman said.
At least one group of hacktivists claimed to have paralyzed the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
In such attacks, the target website is flooded with page views until the servers are overloaded and the website collapses.
The cyber tactics are relatively simple and the attacks do not serve to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The former super-secret NSA, once nicknamed No Search Agency, is now in the light of the public eye and faces harsh criticism after revelations made in recent months about its extensive surveillance program at home and abroad – a result of secret NSA data released by disillusioned former NSA employee Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy surrounding the intelligence service fueled initial speculation that the incident today was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
Slightly decreased the number of people without a job in October by 22 to 1,307.
Although the quota is at 3.1 percent better than last year and also better than in September, "we would have hoped for more," says Monika Felder-Bauer, deputy head of the agency for work in Sonthofen.
So far, many companies have reacted with attitudes.
According to Felder-Bauer, one reason for this is: "We hardly have specialists in the crafts, health care and elderly care."
Due to the seasons, vacancies for staff in the hotel and catering industry have been coming in since September.
In mid-December, the winter season begins there.

Bombardier losses after decrease in delivery numbers and orders
Canadian aircraft and rail manufacturer Bombardier Inc. reported a 15 percent drop in net profit on Thursday, after it was under pressure from declining orders and deliveries on aircraft in the third quarter, as well as contract problems in the rail business.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, also did not release flight test data for its brand new CSeries aircraft and did not provide any new information on whether the aircraft could go into commercial use next September, according to the ambitious schedule.
Up to now, only three more launches have followed the test aircraft’s maiden flight one and a half months ago, which makes it questionable whether the test phase is going as planned.
Results lagged behind forecasts, leading to a price drop of over eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, lowered his valuation on Thursday from “outperform” to “sector perform” in view of the stock’s limited price potential over the next one to two quarters.
"While weaker delivery figures were largely expected for aircraft, we are clearly disappointed by the development of the margin in the transport sector," Doerksen said in a customer letter.
We believe Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries as the aircraft test program progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical of the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft series will catapult the company into the lower market segment, which is currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled to the public in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delays.
But so far, binding orders for the CSeries with 177 are moderate as potential buyers want to wait for the results of the flight tests and see if the company’s claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost savings potential of the new jet airliner are true.
Currently, there are a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
CEO Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will achieve its target of 300 binding orders at the start of commercial use of the jet.
The management also assured analysts and media on Thursday that the program was on schedule.
"The test aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected," Beaudoin said at a conference call, adding that during the aircraft's service life, ground tests and software updates were scheduled.
Every manufacturer plans differently.
We decided to take a first flight and then add a review period, which we did.
This happens throughout the flight program.
The second of five test aircraft is expected to launch in the coming weeks, the remaining shortly afterwards, the company said.
Nevertheless, analysts remain skeptical about whether the first customer can commission a CSeries aircraft twelve months after the maiden flight.
Bombardier said it is reviewing commissioning planning (EIS) and will update it in the coming months.
“The slow progress of the flight test – although obviously in line with Bombardier’s internal planning – reinforces our view that commissioning is delayed to the first quarter of 2015,” Doerksen said.
In the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, the previous year.
Adjusted earnings per share remain unchanged at 9 cents.
Sales declined slightly, falling from 4.2 to 4.1 billion dollars.
Analysts expected a profit of 10 cents per share and revenue of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world’s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer says it delivered 45 aircraft this quarter, down from 57 last year.
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
The order backlog in the aerospace division was $32.9 billion on September 30, unchanged from December 31.
"In the aerospace sector, the results were in line with our targets, but the low order intake and overall market conditions were disappointing," said Beaudoin.
Sales in the aerospace sector fell 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world’s largest railway manufacturer, announced that revenue in this segment has increased by just under 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
The order backlog in the transport division was $32.6 billion on September 30, slightly up from December 31.
The profit margin in the transport sector was affected by settlement problems in some major contracts.
According to management, there will be new targets for the fourth quarter.
In the afternoon trading on Thursday, Bombardier shares declined by 8.5 percent and stood at 4.83 Canadian dollars, after it was also announced that Google’s Chief Financial Officer Patrick Pichette will join the board.
Brazilian Embraer SA, the world’s third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier’s closest rival, reported a 10 percent drop in quarterly earnings on Thursday.

Cocaine-dependent lawyer who warned drug boss about police investigation must go to jail
Basharat Ditta, 42, shared information to underworld size Neil Scarborough
The lawyer feared his secret drug addiction could come to light
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Crown Court.
A well-known criminal defense attorney who warned a drug lord about a major police investigation because he was afraid his secret drug addiction could be revealed, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided underworld giant Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about investigations into his drug trafficking activities after he was compromised by his own cocaine addiction.
The lawyer, nicknamed "Bash" by criminals, was arrested at his home in 2011 after police monitored Scarborough, whom he had represented in a previous drug trial.
Officials watched Scarborough, 32, deliver three bags of cocaine to the attorney’s home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was with colleagues at a bar dinner.
Investigations revealed that Ditta regularly consumed Class A drugs after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair, wallet, and credit cards.
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he attempted to obtain unauthorized information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were then monitored by police as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 other people, they were later arrested after police secured <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million worth of heroin and cocaine and <0xC2><0xA3>200,000 worth of cash in a series of house searches.
Ditta, 42, shared information with the criminals because he feared his drug addiction could become public.
Today, Ditta, who works for the Forbes Solicitors firm in Blackburn, was found guilty and convicted at the Liverpool Crown Court after a three-week trial in two counts of obstruction of justice.
He admitted to cocaine possession in an earlier interview.
The lawyer was convicted after police found out in their investigation of Scarborough that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw him go to Ditta’s house and put the 60 percent purity drugs in a black golf glove under the lawyer’s trash can.
Shortly after delivering the drugs, Scarborough regularly phoned Ditta, who was at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park at dinner.
The lawyer returned home, fetched the drugs and then nine messages were exchanged between the two.
In court, it was reported that Ditta was a “regular consumer” of cocaine after tests had discovered class A drugs in his hair, wallet, and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied taking cocaine, saying he had spoken to the alleged dealer because he was his client, claiming that their discussion was subject to “attorney secrecy.”
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were seized and a hair sample was taken from him.
During the police interrogation, he stated that he was running an office both at his home address and at the workplace and clients would call him at home for legal matters.
In court, it was reported that he had called key drug traffickers, some of whom he had previously represented, after significant arrests and informed them about what the investigators knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said, “A criminal attorney should know better than anyone else that you don’t break the law.”
Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal defense attorney because he has been too involved with certain clients.
The relationship in question is not simply that of a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who supplies his lawyer with drugs.
Some of his communications were undoubtedly legitimate, for he was the lawyer of these persons.
But that went far beyond the boundaries of a normal relationship between lawyer and client.
He countered the police investigation as much as possible so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta thus discredited his profession.
He was too close to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta denied any wrongdoing, claiming, “If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and wanted to pass information to Scarborough, I would not wait 15 hours but would do so immediately.”
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of Lancashire Police said: “Mr. Ditta took the step from a criminal lawyer to a criminal at the moment he began to acquire drugs from organized criminals.”
His addiction to cocaine led to a hopeless compromise and made him receptive to the motives of leading members of organized crime, who commissioned him to obtain valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure public trust and confidence.
Ditta has betrayed this trust and tried to hide behind the facade of his profession.
Lancashire’s Serious and Organised Crime Unit led the investigation into Ditta, which also led to a conviction in three cases for possession of cocaine and obstruction of justice, underlining our determination to bring criminals to justice.
This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one can escape the arm of the law.
We'll find you and take you to court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after he declared himself guilty of conspiracy to trade heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other persons involved in the drug trade were sentenced to a total of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website, Ditta published an area of questions and answers about himself, stating that his dream job was to represent clients in the death row in America as a lawyer, that his ultimate guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali and that inequality was the motivation for his work.
Revolutionary work of church music
To conclude the celebrations on the occasion of its 160th anniversary, the Dunningen Liederkranz will frame two services with the "German Mass" by Franz Schubert.
After the great success of the musical "Rock my Life", which thrilled the audience in the spring of this year, the Liederkranz will enrich two services at the end of the anniversary year with the performance of the German Mass by Franz Schubert.
On Saturday, October 26, this extraordinary Mass will be heard from 19 during the evening Mass in St. Martin's Church Dunningen and on Sunday, October 27, from 10.15 a.m. at the Mass in the St. John Baptist Church in Lackendorf.
The so-called German Mass with the original title "Songs to Celebrate the Sacrifice of the Mass", D 872, is a spiritual music work by composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was almost considered revolutionary at the time of its creation.
The Mass is presented as part of the services, as the client Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind.
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider, the choir is accompanied by the brass band of the music club Frohsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi at the organ.
Haslach: Skepticism gives way to confidence
With the 2015 elections to the parish council, for example, there will be fundamental changes in the Haslach (SE) pastoral care unit.
There is then only one common parish council for all six parishes.
In a joint meeting on Saturday, the committees from Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared for the changes.
For nothing can be changed in the diocese’s basic decisions, and it is up to the parish councils to implement them as satisfactorily as possible.
In the course of the day it became particularly clear: the skepticism towards the new is declining but increasing in confidence.
From the ideas and expectations of the 2015 innovations to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish council, the highly constructive discussions of the six bodies with the main officials of the pastoral team ranged.
Regional Dean Georg Schmitt explained the new guidelines for pastoral care units in the Archdiocese of Freiburg through a presentation.
After that, the Haslach SE as a church community will form a body of public law, which enters into the rights and obligations of the so far six individual church communities.
There will only be a joint parish council and a foundation council in which the parish priest Kraft is represented.
At least two elected members from each parish should be represented, in the six parishes so-called community teams are formed locally.
It will be your task in the future to promote ecclesial life in the village.
When the question of the finances of the individual parish was asked, there was a considerable need for discussion.
The innovations provide that accumulated funds in the parishes are retained for purpose.
The liabilities, on the other hand, are transferred to the entire community.
Particularly with regard to the large planned investments, whose commitment will then meet all the parishes, there were great concerns.
"Even in the past, only projects were invested that could be managed by the individual parishes alone," Haslachs parish council chairman Bruno Prinzbach relativized.
Practical experience with a joint body for five parishes described Barbar Ritter, the chairman of the body in the pastoral care unit Schutterwald-Neuried.
In 2006, they had set themselves the goal of “becoming one, staying five” and had to realize that it wasn’t that easy.
The bodies of the Haslacher Pastoral Unit then set out to answer the questions about the future composition and size of the joint parish council as well as the practical work of the community teams.
The drafting will be concretized in further meetings and will be decided at a further joint meeting of all six bodies next spring.
At the end, parish councillor Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the pastoral care unit, which was approved by a clear majority.
In Pfullendorf, electricity is getting more expensive
The citizens of Pfullendorf must be prepared for higher electricity costs.
As the managing director of the Stadtwerke, Jörg-Arne Bias, confirmed to the SÜDKURIER, a four-person Pfullendorf family has 70 to 90 euros of additional costs per year.
The main reason for the upcoming price increase is the increase in the so-called EEG surcharge from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt hour.
This levy is re-established each year in October by the four operators of the major electricity routes.
These measure the additional costs incurred by them as a result of the energy transition, which they can charge by a levy over the electricity price.
The municipal utilities Pfullendorf form the last link in this chain.
The Supervisory Board of the energy company even assumed a higher levy in its forecasts, as reported by Jörg-Arne Bias.
Now the concrete numbers would have to be calculated before the municipal utilities could inform their customers next week about the exact price increase.
"We expect a 1 cent plus x increase," says Bias, with the number more likely to be close to the 2 cents.
Traffic lights on permanent red: Watch for waiting time
Sometimes a traffic light just doesn’t turn green.
The contact loop in the street does not respond, or the light sign is defective.
What to do then - to drive in red?
If a person has waited long enough at a red traffic light and the intersection is free, he can continue, explains the Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine "Motorrad".
However, the waiting period must be “appropriate”, which can be interpreted differently from case to case.
Becker advises to stand for at least five minutes before the traffic lights are expected to be dysfunctional.
Anyone who continues the journey despite red lights, however, must be aware that he is fully responsible for an accident caused by this.
Those who tolerate themselves for less than five minutes may not wait long enough, Becker warns and refers to a decision of the Hamm Higher Regional Court.
In the negotiated case, a driver had ignored the traffic light after about three minutes of continuous red and had to answer for a negligent red light violation.
The traffic light was not defective, but jumped to green a little later.
A driving ban was spared him because of the special situation - but the fine was not.
City Council welcomes solid budget
Whenever municipal council meetings are about the budget, Mayor Ralph Gerster laughs well.
The municipal sack in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and the administration has not known debt since 2005.
In this sense, the financial year 2012 can also be recorded as a full success.
This was evident in the presentation of the annual accounts for 2012.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget of around 7.6 million euros was more than one million euros higher than planned.
The surplus of the administrative budget is also around one million euros, at around 1.8 million euros.
The surplus is mainly due to higher business tax revenues and the municipal share of income tax.
The asset budget was again well above the planned values.
Instead of the planned 1.5 million euros last year, it amounted to 2.5 million euros.
"This is mainly due to the higher feed from the administrative budget," says Rothmund.
As there were fewer investments than planned in the financial year 2012, reserves were also increased.
Overall, the overall reserve was increased by around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.1 million to a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4.9 million.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for the good work.
"You don't just shake a work like this out of your sleeve," praised Gerster with a view to the annual accounts.
He and the council members were delighted with the good numbers.
It may sound paradoxical, but these very good figures could soon cost the citizens.
Due to the good financial situation, the municipality was able to dispense with high lifting rates in the past.
As a result, however, according to Gerster, subsidies from the country have often been reduced.
There are prerequisites for these grants from various balancing pillars.
Among other things, the cities and municipalities that apply for grants must show certain lifting rates.
"We have to look at the issue of lifting rates, as investments are pending in the coming years, for which we would like to have subsidies," Gerster announced in this context.
Nagold: Hugo Wermter in the choir for 60 years
At the age of 60 as a singer, Hubert Wermter’s history at the men’s singing association Cäcilia is almost twice as long as that of the Herbstfest, in which he was solemnly honored.
Hubert Wermter stood on stage as usual in the colours of his men’s singing club.
Even after 60 years, he still enjoys singing with the choir, which is now more than beloved.
Wermter was also active in the club, including for 28 years as a member of the committee.
For his dedication and loyalty to the association, he received several awards: Jörg Kohr, Pastoral Referent on behalf of the Cäcilienverband Rottenburg-Stuttgart, handed him - since the choir is also a church choir - a certificate of the association and a letter of honor signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst.
His fellow singers handed him the certificate of the German choir association as well as an engraved tin plate.
In addition to the honour, the 31st Autumn Festival took place in the usual ways: with the MGV Betra, the Liederkranz Salzstetten, the singer department Baisingen and the local music club, the Vollmaringers had loaded a colorful mixture of different choirs and singing styles, which entertained the around 400 visitors.
The MGV Vollmaringen opened with atmospheric songs such as "Im Weinparadies" and "Lustig, ihr Brüder".
To honor their singer of honor Hubert Wermter, they prepared a small stand - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Bundeslied".
The men's singing club Betra also sang classical choral songs such as "Jägerwerben" by Julius Wengert, "Weit, weit weg" by Hubert Goisern as well as the folk song "Wenn du durchs durchs Tal".
The Liederkranz Salzstetten provided the women's quota of the festival with its mixed choir and its women's group - the "impulse choir".
The mixed choir with the Neapolitan folklore "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" by Antos Gus kidnapped foreign countries, while the "impulse choir" also resorted to foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" were part of their program.
The singer's section of the Baisinger Sportverein came back with "Was ist der Schwob?" by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Pappert's "Bierlied" back to homelands, where the Vollmaringer Musikverein offered the crowning musical conclusion.
For the children there was a small side program - "Grandma Hanne" alias Hannelore Stollsteimer performed a casper theatre and read a few stories, which the children occupied the lunch well.
Children's dreams come true
The kindergartens and daycare centers in the Zollernalbkreis are receiving mail these days.
The Schwarzwälder Bote, in cooperation with the Bauhaus and the Sparkasse Zollernalb, wants to support the facilities in the realization of their construction and embellishment wishes.
Does kindergarten need a new sandbox?
All kindergartens, kindergartens and nurseries from the entire Zollernalbkreis can participate in the action.
If you have a wish to build or beautify your interior, you can apply for it at the Black Forest Messenger.
Be creative with your children and surprise the jury of the Aktion Kindergarten-Baustelle.
A jury consisting of representatives of Schwarzwälder Bote, Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb selects three wishes from all entries.
What are the prerequisites for participation?
The wish should be realized with building materials worth a maximum of 2000 euros and on a (action) day.
In addition, the winner himself must provide for many hardworking construction workers.
What about the day of action and the helpers?
Bauhaus provides the material with the support of Sparkasse Zollernalb.
It will be delivered to the kindergarten on the agreed day and will then be processed directly by the helpers.
Helpers can be parents, grandparents, friends, associations and of course the educators and children themselves.
Kenyan press outraged by controversial media law
“We are in a frightening situation and one can ask: what prevents Parliament from simply abolishing judicial independence tomorrow?”, read the newspaper, which considers the bill unconstitutional.
“The law is draconian and very punitive and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of Capital Group, which also includes CapitalFM, one of Kenya’s most respected independent radio stations and news websites.
He said the new media tribunal “will always be biased because it is an extended arm of the government,” and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya’s position in the global economy.
"I hope the president listens to us and we appeal to him to reject this bill and send it back to Parliament," he said.
According to The Star newspaper, the new law effectively strangles the media, while The Standard writes that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya have suffered a “severe blow” and labels the draft as “draconian.”
The enactment of the law is part of a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security following the September attacks by armed Islamists on the Westgate mall.
The Kenyan media attracted the anger of the authorities for publishing footage of security cameras showing the units dispatched to the scene allegedly robbing the luxurious mall.
Police chief David Kimaiyo responded by summoning two journalists and a leading media representative to interrogate, even though the subpoena was withdrawn after a media outcry.
Under the new law, media houses can be punished with a penalty of up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists with up to one million as well as the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation.
The Tribunal also has the right to confiscate the property of those affected if a penalty is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “a single penalty can put most radio stations in bankruptcy.”
In addition, the newspaper believes that these measures could have a devastating impact on Kenya’s “living blogosphere.”
If they silence the media, politicians could do whatever they want with impunity.
"No one will ever know," wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist at the nation who describes the Kenyan media as a decisive control factor in public life.
“If you leave politicians to themselves, they will lead the country to bankruptcy and bring us back to the time of hunters and collectors,” he said.
Kenyan lawmakers have had public anger in the past.
In May, they voted to reverse the cuts ordered by the National Compensation Commission and reinstated their solid salaries of about 532,000 shillings per month, which are among the highest in the world.
Bad-Dürrheim: A dream come true for FC
Despite the cold weather and the rain, the official inauguration ceremony for the artificial turf sports field did not lose anything in its significance for the city and the football club.
Everyone had wished for a more pleasant celebration last Saturday, but Peter did not want to participate.
So all those who came without an umbrella or could not hold one for any reason had the look.
This was the case for the musicians who framed the ceremony, as was the case for many speakers.
This is why FC Chairman Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke of the fulfillment of a dream, became Nass.
His thanks went to Mayor Walter Klumpp, who was strongly committed to the implementation of the project, the municipal council, the participating companies and association members who contributed.
Lothar Held, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The well-equipped pensioners laid 400 square meters of paving stones for the new paths.
Karl Rombach, Member of the Landtag, also paid tribute to this remarkable voluntary commitment.
Further greetings were given to the municipal sports committee Hubert Baier, the district chairman of the South Baden Football Association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr from the planning office, who announced a donation for the youth department of the club.
Mayor Klumpp recalled that recurring weather-related influences in the spring and autumn added to the original lawn so that it could not be played.
Already 15 years ago there were the first considerations to solve the problem, when the construction of a third place at the grounds of the football club or at the real school on Lake Salinen was considered.
Both were rejected again.
Six years ago, thoughts arose about the creation of an artificial turf sports field, which was generally regarded as the ultimate solution.
Concrete planning was started two years ago, when the FC took over the schabelstube in leasehold, pledged a cost contribution of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> 100,000 for the construction of the square and approved funding of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> 104,000.
In October 2012, the municipal council decided to take over the remaining 356 000 euros in the total cost of 560 000 euros, Klumpp summarised.
The construction of the 68 by 108 meter artificial turf field began on 4 June.
During the three-month construction phase, 3000 cubic meters of soil were removed, half of which was used for the construction of a dirt bike route.
The Union and the SPD have continued their coalition negotiations on the topics of home affairs and justice.
The responsible working group met in Berlin in the morning.
Among other things, it concerns direct democracy, the bribery of deputies and the federal police.
In the morning, the Migration and Integration Working Group also wanted to continue its discussions.
Among other things, the issue of dual citizenship is likely to be concerned, where both sides have opposing ideas.
The SPD wants to end the compulsion for immigrant children born in Germany to choose one - the Union rejects a double passport.
On the subject of traffic, which is not on the conference order this Friday, the SPD supported its no to a car toll demanded by the CSU.
A vignette is a “flat rate for frequent driving and thus ecologically counterproductive,” said the SPD negotiator for the subject of transport, Florian Pronold, in a letter to his group.
There were threats of evasive traffic on rural roads, which are already accident focuses.
The introduction of a toll for all cars would also be a first step from Pronold’s point of view.
"There is a risk that compensation for Germans will be cancelled at a later date," he said.
Dieter Thomas Kuhn in Stuttgart: The singing blow dryer wave on the open-air stage
Stuttgart - "When will it be summer again?" was not the question on Friday evening on the open-air stage Killesberg.
It was truly a tropical night in Stuttgart.
The best conditions for Schlagerstar Dieter Thomas Kuhn and his band.

Driver seriously injured in accident
In an accident on Thursday evening, a 37-year-old car driver from Aachen was seriously injured.
According to the police, a 41-year-old from Müsch was driving her car on the Kempener Außenring towards Grefrath around 21:15.
When she wanted to turn left onto St. Töniser Straße, she overlooked the advancing car of the 37-year-old.
The driving eye collided.
The Aachener suffered serious injuries and had to be taken to the hospital for treatment.
Constance: blocking after an accident at the Schänzlekreisel
The accident occurred when a 51-year-old driver of a Swiss Seat Ibiza drove out of town on the left lane of the two-lane Reichenaustraße on Thursday evening, around 8 p.m.
Shortly before the roundabout at Schänzle he noticed that he was on the left-hand lane in the direction of Stromeyersdorfstraße and switched to the right lane.
This resulted in a collision with the BMW of a 23-year-old Constance driving there.
The VW Passat of a 19-year-old was also damaged behind the BMW.
A total of about 15,000 property damage was incurred, the police said.
The roadway had to be closed during the accident recording, it continued.
Vienna Airport Cancels Passenger Calls
Mr. Max Maier, please come to Gate 24.
Announcements like this will no longer be made at Vienna-Schwechat Airport in the future.
Much of the loudspeaker predictions are eliminated - the noise level should be significantly reduced.
Creating a more relaxed atmosphere is the goal of this innovation.
As Airport spokesman Peter Kleemann told Radio Wien, Vienna airport follows an international trend with the hiring of announcements that affect individual people.
The airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai, among others, are already dispensing with the noisy calls.
The elimination of these announcements – an average of around 200 personal calls through the loudspeakers in one day – is expected to make things easier at the airport in the future.
"It has also been shown in experience that these individual announcements were relatively little perceived, but at the same time all other information about changed flight compartments or departure times are a bit lost here," said Kleemann in a conversation with the radio station.
Highlander Games at the Kaltenhof
In addition to the brake car pulling with tractors, there will be a second competition at the agricultural autumn festival at the Kaltenhof from 6 to 8 September.
On Saturday, September 7th, the Highlander Games will start at 1.30 p.m.
Although they have a Scottish tradition, they are swabish in the Kaltenhof.
Teams and single fighters compete in the disciplines of tree trunk throwing, horseshoe throwing and water bucket carrying.
The tree trunk is four and a half meters long and weighs 25 to 30 kilograms.
"It doesn't matter how far we go," explains organizer Peter Saile.
The trunk must be dropped vertically, should one time overturn and then come straight to lie down.
This is rated with the most points.
When it comes to horseshoe throwing, it depends on the target accuracy.
From a distance of eight meters is thrown on a stake.
Skill and strength must be demonstrated by the participants when carrying water buckets over 50 meters.
Time and amount of water in a tank are measured at the end.
From each "clan" or team, two can then participate in the individual competition.
The winners of the team and individual competition will receive prizes.
You can train from 10am.
Matching clothing is desirable, for example, the competitors can compete in a Scots skirt.
Swabian dress is also allowed.
For the "outfit", the jury awards a few bonus points.
You can register up to one hour before the start of the competition.
With the Scottish-Swabian Highlander games and the tractor pulling, which starts half an hour earlier, there is already a lot of action on the festival grounds on Saturday.
In the evening, the wind music lovers get their money’s worth.
At 7:00 p.m., the Bavarian brass band from Schömberg organizes the big entertainment evening.
The chapel plays fast polkas and marches.
But their repertoire also includes emotional waltzes and a rich big band sound.
Heinz Koch, known as a singing host and black sausage baron, will be there for a while under the gutters.
In Dornhan he has already performed at the Christmas market and at the Fool's Guild.
On Sundays, the music club Leinstetten entertains for breakfast, from 2 pm the Bauernkapelle Böffingen is a guest, and the "Oldies" then end the festival.
The start of the stop patching party with DJ Ralf is already on Friday.
On Saturday and Sunday, the exhibitions of companies on the topic of agriculture and forestry will be held, among others, at the Oldtimer and Tug Meeting.
Other attractions on Sunday are the corn labyrinth, the craft market and the shearing of sheep.
Especially for children there is a petting zoo, straw bouncy castle, tractor riding (under instructions) and tractor surfing.
The organizers are the Förderverein Mehrzweckhalle, the ski club and the tractor friends "Zündkäpsele".
Dairy and egg alternatives at a glance
Vegan diet requires plant-based alternatives to eggs, milk and dairy products.
Purified tofu with plant cream is, for example, a quark substitute.
The Vegetarian Federation also announces World Vegan Day on November 1.
On the occasion of World Vegan Day on 1 November, the Vegetarian Federation of Germany proposes a number of vegan alternatives:
Pure plant margarine is a good alternative to butter, yogurt should be replaced by soy yogurt.
Instead of milk, soy, oat, almond or rice milk could be used.
Plant cream replaces conventional whipped cream.
There are also plant-based alternatives to eggs.
A half crushed, ripe banana, for example, can replace an egg as a binder in a cake.
Also 50 grams of apple paste or a tablespoon of ground flaxseed plus three tablespoons of water are suitable for this.
Loose dough instead of using egg, for example, with a mixture of a teaspoon of baking soda, a tablespoon of starch and three tablespoons of mineral water.
But also 50 grams of soy yogurt or silk tofu can serve this purpose.
According to the Vebu, around 800,000 people in Germany currently eat vegan, i.e. purely vegetable.
Sleepless in New York
On their way to their host families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, Black Forest High School students got to know the American city of New York.
After eight hours of flight, we went straight to the Brooklyn Bridge, which was reached on foot to the heart of the city, Manhattan.
Here a fascinating view of the world-famous skyline, which is a special charm in the evening light, was already offered.
Due to the time shift, the students were on their feet for almost 24 hours, but true to the motto "The city does not sleep," the day on Times Square was decided.
Despite the shutdown, on the second day the Statue of Liberty could be reached by ferry and climbed on foot.
Then it was over the financial center around Wall Street to the memorial of 9/11.
On the third day, students were able to gain an overview of the fascinatingly large city from the 373-metre-high observation deck of the Empire State Building while enjoying the view.
Afterwards, we walked through the hectic bustle of New York streets via Rockefeller Center to Central Park, which offered an ideal opportunity to linger briefly in the autumn sun.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, the students have now arrived in their host families and experience the everyday school life at Weymouth High School.
Also this year, a Hubertus Mass will be celebrated on St. Hubertus’s name day in the parish church of St. Mary on Hülsbergstraße.
According to legend, St. Hubertus was a rather ruthless hunter who was converted by a vision and later appointed bishop of Liège.
The Jagdhorn wind band of the Hunting Riders Westphalia under the direction of Brigitte Kluth plays on parforce horns (natural horns in the mood Es) to old, originally French melodies.
The wind blowers wear riding clothes because they mainly accompany riders, horses and dogs on tow hunts musically.
The solemn Mass will take place on Sunday, November 3, at 11.30 a.m.
The newly designed lift shines with a new cafe.
One that invites you to linger and come back.
One that wants to make the name the program.
According to the dictionary, déjà vu is a psychological phenomenon that is expressed in the feeling of having experienced or seen a new situation before.
In the case of the visit of the café of the same name at Opschlag in the district town of Kleve within sight of the Rhein-Waal University of Applied Sciences, it does not have to be the pure déjà vu feeling.
After all, the café with the beautiful name has just that goal: to make an actual stay not only mentally, but also tangible repeatedly experienceable.
Because it's fun and just beautiful.
A look into the interior at Opschlag 8 gives the viewer a good feeling at once.
The state-of-the-art but not cool café ambiance looks like a place to feel good.
Here, the team with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the forefront pampers the guest with a variety of coffee or cocktail variants.
There are delicious cakes or individually topped fresh baguettes.
The owners, both 33 years old, already made a name for themselves as restaurateurs before the opening of the elegant café at Opschlag: In Kranenburg, they ran the "Art Lounge".
From moving to Kleve at Opschlag, the sympathetic cafe lovers are hoping for more audiences.
Last but not least, the university.
"But we don't have a specific target group," emphasises Daniel Büttner.
Rather, the two young students here want to address as well as seniors and all age groups in between.
Speaking of coffee lovers.
The sympathetic owner couple stands behind the enjoyment of coffee.
Enjoy the fragrant hot brew in a variety of variations.
Expressofan
Daniel Büttner is more of the Expresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt the cappuccino drinker.
"That's a baguette - that's my thing," she tells the NRZ.
There were also two events in the bright café.
Better to say one.
After all, the harbour festival took place outside - the Café Déjà Vu did not benefit from it.
But there was also the ring wet evening.
"Beautiful, successful and funny," the two 33-year-olds said.
But not everyone's business.
Maybe that's why Daniel Büttner is not a huge fan of event nights: "You can't do it all right".
And with an event I always address only those who are interested in the special event.
Therefore, events will be the exception with us.
"We want to disrupt the very normal operation as little as possible".
In other words, déjà vu also stands for reliability.
In terms of the quality of the products offered here, as well as the team and the beautiful surroundings at Opschlag in Kleve.
The street that is becoming more and more a gastronomy mile.
To the delight of many people, the guests from near and far and the students who discover the guest streets and thus also the Café Déjà Vu for themselves.

A day of thanks at the MGV in Dinker
It was the 165th Foundation Festival to which the MGV "Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker" had invited this year and 52 guests, active singers and their wives, were happy to come.
In the club room of the restaurant "Witteborg" in Dinker, everyone enjoyed the harmonious togetherness entirely under the sign of music.
Traditionally, the Foundation Festival is always the right celebration to make honors.
This time writer Rolf Wagener was delighted with the special award "Singer of the Year".
"You not only wrote a lot for us, but also shot so many rounds for us, for this our heartfelt thanks," said the chairman of the choir Erich Schlotmann.
The awards for participation in the performances and choir rehearsals by means of activity bouquets went to the choir director Dieter Schulze with 44 participations this year, followed by honorary chairman Horst Pier-Ribbert, the chairman himself, and last year's "singer of the year" Friedrich Winkler with 42 participations each.
Fifth-placed scorer Artur Brückner.
The board of directors thanked the team of club owner Ange Pier-Ribbert, who once again conjured up a menu of the extra class and Gerda Pier-Ribbert for the table decoration.
The MGV "Friedrich-Wilhelm" meets for its regular choir rehearsals always on Tuesdays at 7.45 pm in the club venue.
"New singing voices are welcome at all times," said Schlotmann.
UN Announces New Poverty Reduction Goals
The United Nations is now starting to develop a series of new goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals for poverty reduction announced twelve years ago.
In the run-up to the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began in the evening in Rio de Janeiro, Australian diplomats played a key role in pushing for “sustainable development goals” to replace the 2015 Millennium Goals.
They were included in the final draft of the document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the summit that the time had come to “think beyond national interests.”
“I am delighted that member states have agreed to start a process to agree on universal, sustainable development goals,” he said.
“These goals will build on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the post-2015 framework for development.
I will spare no effort to implement this mandate given to me by Member States in order to realize our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals, which builds on the success of the Millennium Goals."
Even though the SG Achim/Baden has been without a win for four matchdays, the handball-oberligist still has a good mood.
Coach Tomasz Malmon has no doubts.
Everyone is fully motivated in the matter.
Nevertheless, I hope that we finally win again.
"Because I don't even know what such a victory tastes like," Malmon expects a success experience from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even though the third league reserve from Fredenbeck has not yet plucked any trees, Malmon is warning in advance to raise the index finger.
I have trained a lot of players myself in the A-Jugend.
Therefore, they will certainly be particularly motivated against their ex-coach.
"Also, it remains to be seen whether there are any reinforcements from the first," the SG-Coach explains.
In order to finally return to the track of success, the Malmon team must definitely increase compared to previous appearances.
Above all in the coverage work and the switching game, it finally failed tremendously.
Opportunity exploitation must definitely improve as well.
So I hope that my players finally got their heads free during the short break.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing in the face of clashes between influential personalities
Thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo under the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel, the founder of the state and first president of Mozambique, to voice peace calls at a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace again, we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, CEO of an investment company.
For fear of the future of the country, she exchanged her business clothes for a T-shirt with the inscription “We demand security” in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Thursday at the capital’s Independence Square.
For two weeks, there have been reports almost daily of clashes between government forces and Renamo, which are among the worst clashes since the peace agreement over 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement initially supported by White-ruled Rhodesia and later South Africa’s apartheid government in an effort to destabilize the country’s independent government.
After the 1992 peace treaty, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe the country is unlikely to fall back into a full-blown conflict, but recent events have worried foreign investors and locals.
Much is at stake for the fast-growing economy, as the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal storage in the northwest could bring investments of over $50 billion from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the US into the country in the coming years.
The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the tensions.
Renamo claims the government provoked the recent clashes by attacking its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional stronghold of Renamos, on 17 October.
The attacks on the former rebels escalated as government troops attacked Renamo bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group’s leader, Renamos spokesman told the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to minimize concerns about instability.
He told AFP on Wednesday that Dhlakama sees himself as a “loser” who “will use all his remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government.”
Both Frelimo and Renamo emphasize that they want to avoid a war.
However, concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted as saying that Renamo would abandon the 1992 peace agreement.
He told FT that he meant that Frelimo would no longer respect the agreement.
“Our vision is to resume negotiations, seriously,” Mazanga said.
Previous talks between the parties have contributed little to resolving the tensions fueled by a series of clashes this year.
“We have two adult men here (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who are clashing their heads,” says Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and Mozambique expert.
None of them is good at negotiating and none is willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, which is pushing for election reforms, has already declared that it will boycott the municipal elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an attempt by a sickening movement to obtain concessions and financial benefits from the government.
Renamo's election successes have been shrinking since 1992, while a newer party, the Movimento Democrático de Moçambique (MDM), founded by a former Renamo member, is likely to improve in the elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza — whose resignation is pending when his second term ends next year — wants to destroy the country’s democracy.
“He doesn’t want multi-party democracy, he doesn’t want transparent elections, he doesn’t want peace because he doesn’t want to give up the presidential office,” Mazanga said.
It is unclear what capacity Renamo has, but it has undertaken unrest-inspiring attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important north-south connection.
Most of the battles took place in the province of Sofala, which is a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but in which Beira is located, the port that mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale use to export coal.
In June, Rio interrupted use of the railway for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the line.
Mazanga responded reluctantly to the question of whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to “warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique,” Mazanga said.
The instability has increased the frustration about the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, because many people were already worried about corruption, slow progress in development and a recent wave of abductions.
“People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country and he should be the one to find solutions to the problems,” he explains.
Omar Sultane, a demonstrator, said people just wanted stability.
"Nobody cares about Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace and usable roads again," he said.
Children should be taught myths and legends as “models for life,” according to one author.
Thor’s stories showed that “brutal power has no chance against clever tricks,” and the Artus legend demonstrates how important it is to have a dream.
However, many of the myths are “by far too wild, too offensive, and in some cases too dirty to be taught in schools,” which is why Crossley-Holland advocated a “careful selection” of age-appropriate works.
“I find it wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education,” he said.
I have been proposing this as a plan for twenty years.
He added that in the case of authors and teachers who are “excessively didactic,” children would “completely shut off,” because in entertaining stories, the messages would be “subtle.”
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from the Anglo-Saxon and is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales, stated: “One can pursue certain intentions, but one should keep them in the background as much as possible.”
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author who writes for adults and an author who writes for children is in the need to convey hope.
Not everything needs to be simplified or lead to the happy ending, but there is an immanent sense of good and evil.
This must be subliminally portrayed, revealed through history and not explained.
This is the old story of showing rather than telling.
Hansjakob moves to Freihof again
100 years ago Heinrich Hansjakob moved to his retirement residence in Haslach, on Sunday his last years came to life in the "Freihof".
The many spectators were enthusiastic about the extremely entertaining scene game.
From the arrival to the award of honorary citizenship to his death, screenwriter and Hansjakob actor Alois Kraftzcyk had designed an entertaining piece, which received much applause under the direction of Cornelia Volk.
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as a speaker through the ten different scenes, explained contexts and bridged time jumps from youth to the approaching retirement.
On October 22, 1913, Hansjakob returns to his children's heaven, to his courtyard.
And then the scene game began, in which Alois Krafczyk once again shined in his parade role as the big son of the city.
In style, he performed with the two-piece and "Black Forest Foxes" by Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach.
Not only was he welcomed by the audience with a lot of applause, but his sister Philippine also welcomed him.
Billy Sum-Hermann understood it incredibly well to put himself into the role of the sister and gave her tremendous life in facial expressions and gestures.
Between the individual scenes, the Mühlenbach Bauernkapelle played appropriately selected pieces of music and thus completed the performance.
Haslach's mayor Heinz Winkler then gave himself the honor of honoring him, who, in the representation of the then incumbent Hättich, together with a part of the city council, made his appearance.
The Dreikönig singers, who prompted Hansjakob to the exclamation: "Ah, how beautiful, then youth memories of my own Three Kings time come alive again".
With their song "O Jesulein" they delighted the audience in the Freihof as well as the Storchentagskinder with their loud "Out, Out".
Hansjakob had expressed his criticism of the official church at the time, as well as his concerns about the excesses in agriculture, the consequences of industrialization or the effects of the war.
In the home earth, behind his burial chapel on the fire near Hofstetten, he found his resting place.
"A restless spirit had finally found his rest and had gone home forever," it was said at the end of the scene game.
There was a lot of applause and a lot of praise from the audience for the performance.
Basketball: The hope of the Neckar giants is growing
The chances of the athletic retired Ludwigsburg Bundesliga basketballers remaining in the league have increased.
Because if there is a wildcard procedure, there is now one less competitor for the Neckar giants.
The basketball project Hamburg Towers refrains from applying for a possible rear seat.
"We will not participate in the wildcard process," said former national player Pascal Roller, who has been setting up the concept for a professional club in the Hanseatic city since 2012.
A first breath was nevertheless not heard from Ludwigsburg.
"We did not deal with the wildcard procedure until it is clear that Düsseldorf will not receive a license," Neckar-Riesen-Boss Alexander Reil told our newspaper.
Until 23 May, up-and-coming Düsseldorf Baskets can still submit documents to the arbitral tribunal and prove its economic Bundesliga suitability.
So far, the license has been denied to the Rhinelands twice.
The arbitral tribunal is the last instance.
Haigerloch: Church of the Lord's Supper
As a contribution of the city to the 150th anniversary of the Evangelical Church in Haigerloch, the city’s Cultural and Tourism Office will dedicate the last of its public themed tours on Sunday, October 27, to the Church of the Lord’s Supper.
After visiting the Atomkeller Museum, the Haigerloch period is to be considered after 1850, when Haigerloch came under Prussian rule.
The crowning final point is a visit to the Church of the Lord’s Supper.
There, the leaders will tell the story of the construction of the church and gain insights into the development of the Protestant community in a thoroughly Catholic area.
Last but not least, the church also has a view of the evening meal painting created by Friedrich Schüz with the support of Walter Kröll and Georg Halbritter.
It is an original reproduction of the famous Milan model of Leonardo da Vinci.
The meeting point for the other half-hour tour is at 3 p.m. at the Atomkeller Museum.
Tickets are available at the ticket office of the Atomkellermuseum.
For questions and information the tourist office of the city of Haigerloch is available.
Snowden could testify in Russia
Former US intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in the US spying affair in his Russian asylum.
Representatives of the Federal Attorney General could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old in person in Russia.
This was reported by the agency Interfax, citing unspecified circles familiar with the situation.
Such a question could be resolved inter-governmentally, it said.
A departure of Snowden from Russia is practically excluded.
"In this case, he will lose his refugee status," the agency quoted its source.
Because Germany is an ally of the United States, Snowden threatens to be extradited there, it said.
Long breathing pays off
Six men's teams competed in the clubs' tennis tournament for the winning title.
In the end, the endurance of Team Maier/Bronner decided the last match.
A dream weather had been received by the tennis department of Sportfreunde Rohrdorf for the tournament of local clubs and friends.
The fun of playing tennis was in the foreground of the tournament.
There were five games per team on the schedule, with each playing against each other.
Played in double mode with a long set up to nine points or a maximum duration of 45 minutes.
Anja Schlichter leads the tournament
The tournament management was in the trusted hands of Anja Schlichter, supported by Carmen Müller and Inga Kronemeyer.
After the first three games and a lunch break with pasta, the tournament entered the decisive phase.
The favourites Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner scored points with Michael Klippel and Sadmin Osmicic (both teams of the SG Rohrweiler), so the last two matches had to make the decision.
At the award ceremony, Carmen Müller was finally able to hand over the hiking cup to Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner, who had the longest breath on the finish line.
The second place was taken by doubles Michael Klippel/Sadmin Osmicic.
Rainer and Bernd Maier of the team Asphaltriecher reached the bronze staircase.
In the late afternoon sun and coffee and cake, the successful conclusion of the tournament took place.
On the last weekend of August, the Black Forest Open-Air Museum Vogtsbauernhof in Gutach bei Hornberg is once again in the hands of children.
Traditionally, the museum welcomes visitors on Saturday and Sunday, August 24 and 25, as part of the summer holiday program to a colorful children's and family festival with numerous activities and events.
"Big and small can learn different old crafts on both days," the press release said.
Whether making soap, turning candles, felting or making ropes, there is something for every age.
The children are assisted by regional craftsmen from 11 am to 5 pm.
The museum workshop also works.
When building cuckoo pipes, water wheels or gyroscopes, the young guests can prove their craftsmanship.
The many old games, such as wheelbarrow racing or stilt running, also promise a lot of fun.
Speed and coordination are required here.
For all small detectives, the open-air museum offers a riddle tour of the museum on Saturday and Sunday, at 12 and 14 o’clock.
On a railing tour, the children have to guess which stories are true or are lying.
In addition, visitors have the special opportunity to get to know the open-air museum during a carriage ride with black forest foxes.
Not only horses, but also many other animals such as sheep, goats, cows and chickens can be found and admired on the site.
In addition, all children can look forward to the Clown Otsch on Sunday, who drives his raffle with the museum guests from 11 am.
In the meantime, it is cozy and fairytale-like with Hermann Büttner.
The storyteller takes the little guests into the wonderful world of fairy tales at 11, 13 and 3 p.m.
In addition, the children’s costume dance group from Gutach performs traditional dances at 11.30 a.m.
Furthermore, on both days of the event from 11 am to 5 pm, numerous craftsmen such as the broom binder, the seamstress, the spinner, the weaver and the baker can be seen over their shoulders in their traditional work.
Until the end of the summer holidays in Baden-Württemberg, visitors to the open-air museum can expect a varied holiday program.
In a New Zealand small town, Burt Muro is considered an adorable cheeky guy because he has set out to take part in a race in America with his motorcycle, built in 1920.
Burt cannot be distracted from his dream despite a heart defect.
With his savings, a few donations and a mortgage on his old workshop shed, he transfers by ship to Los Angeles.
After the movie, there is coffee, tea and cake.
Striking beeping disturbs residents
Rhenus Midgard has also invested heavily in land.
They distribute the coal coming from the ships to the hamlet.
The company has several irons in the fire at the same time.
In addition to coal imports, Rhenus Midgard relies, among other things, on wind turbine logistics.
Black shimmers the coal in the storage area in front of the dike.
Two huge blue pile-filling and reloading machines distribute or load the coal here as needed.
With each movement of the handling equipment, a shrill warning sound sounds across the terrain.
"The signals are for safety purposes and are prescribed by law," says Matthias Schrell, Managing Director of Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
With unfavourable winds, this is unfortunately widely heard - and so there have already been some complaints from people from the north of the city.
He takes the complaints very seriously and has therefore contacted those affected, says the 40-year-old.
In close consultation with the authorities, we are now in the process of keeping the warning signals quieter with technical measures.
In the future, he will continue to focus on open dialogue with the neighbours.
Because Matthias Schrell still has a lot to do at the location.
With the expansion of the Lower Saxony Bridge, Rhenus Midgard continues to focus on coal imports for power plants and is one of the largest in Europe in this sector.
Thanks to the reclining tub in front of the terminal, which is recessed at 18.5 meters, Capesize bulk carriers can also be handled here.
“This year, we want to break the 3-million-ton mark in handling,” Schrell said.
In addition to the Eon power plant on site, import coal goes to power plants inland.
If the GDF-Suez power plant is connected to the grid, then 5 million tons of coal imports per year are realistic.
The three ship unloaders on the bridge and the second conveyor belt could create up to 10 million.
Basketball player optimistic despite first defeat
Even the first defeat in the Euroleague could not weaken the huge optimism of the basketball players of FC Bayern Munich.
"No one can forbid us from believing in winning against the best team in Europe in the last two years," said Bayern coach Svetislav Pesic after the unlucky 83:88 (39:47) on Thursday evening at defending champion Olympiakos Piraeus.
We have sent the message: There is also basketball in Munich!
At their first third appearance in the European royal class, the Munichers sold very well for a long time, but were simply not clear enough in the decisive phases.
The guests initially managed to turn a 15-point delay into a lead 13 minutes before the end, before Piraeus gave the game a turn again.
"We fought back incredibly against the two-time Euroleague champion, but then again made reckless mistakes," said Bayern professional Yassin Idbihi.
We are proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful throwers of the Munich, who had celebrated clear victories in the first two games against the Italian series champion Montepaschi Siena and the Polish title holder Zielona Góra.
Ben Greenman: Ten Years of New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
One might say that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: nearly a hundred years ago, the varietal artist Frank Fay, who worked as a conference assistant at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began telling jokes directly to the crowd in the form of a conversation.
Over the years, Fay’s innovation has expanded, as has recently been the case at the New York Comedy Festival.
Launched and led by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the stand-up institution Carolines, this year the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theatres.
"Most of these headliners started with Carolines and then became more and more successful until they were too famous to perform in a club at some point," Hirsch said.
We designed this festival so we can continue to work with them.
This year’s event features performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as “Stand Up for Heroes”, an annual music and comedy charity event for Army veterans at Madison Square Garden, featuring Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby, among others.
With the festival, the world of comedy has also grown.
A number of comedians attending the festival this year have become known through rather unconventional ways, such as shows on smaller television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll became familiar with a sitcom on cable television (the ironically slippery fantasy football series “The League” on FXX) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was part of the cast on both Saturday Night Live and Parks and Recreation, although she is best known for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices (the surreal pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic, race-focused W. Kaumau Bell) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the biggest visitor magnets of the festival is an interview: David Steinberg talks to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but has developed into a respected television and film director as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007 he hosted a TV show entitled "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" on TV Land.
The meeting will take place in the Town Hall in the middle of Manhattan.
“The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry’s entire work,” Steinberg said.
He told me that when he's here, he sometimes walks through the alley between two buildings and thinks, "Hey, if I lose all my money, maybe I live here."
Iran satisfied with the process of nuclear negotiations
A week before the next nuclear meeting with the five UN veto powers, Iran is pleased with the negotiation process.
"After years, we now have an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency to resolve the differences of the last few years," Foreign Minister Mohammed Jawad Sarif wrote on his Facebook page.
It would be a long way to go, but the chief nuclear negotiator is satisfied with the negotiation process and also optimistic that both sides will eventually find a solution.
Drama in Uruguay: Boys kill game camcorders with machete
Two children admitted to the murder of an 11-year-old in Uruguay.
The two 14- and 12-year-old boys had invited their victims to go bird hunting with them.
Armed with machetes and knives, they stabbed the 11-year-old on Tuesday and threw the body into a well, the newspaper "El País" reported on Thursday.
Afterwards, they would have played football in front of their homes in a working-class neighborhood.
The body was found the following night in the village of Cerro Pelado, 15 kilometers north of the exclusive beach town of Punta del Este.
As an alibi, a five-year-old half-sister of the younger one, whom they had taken with them, was supposed to testify that she had been sexually assaulted by the boy.
But when the girl described to the police without mentioning an attack against her, the two boys admitted the intentional killing of the 11-year-old.
Among other things, the elderly cited a rivalry in the football game as the reason.
He was temporarily admitted to a psychiatric youth institution.
Pirates have to go to jail
For exploitative human trafficking, pimping, threats, insults and dangerous assault, the District Court of Constance has sentenced a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen to three and a half years in prison.
The former Bundeswehr soldier, who worked as a doorman after two missions in Afghanistan, made a confession as part of a process agreement.
According to this, he met women in five cases via internet or telephone contacts, which he sent to the finish after a few weeks against their will.
He used to break resistance with violence and threats.
He retained the income of the women who bought for him for some years.
By confiscating cell phones and SIM cards, he prevented women’s contacts with the outside world.
Together with a colleague who mediated the women, he took them to various brothels in the southwest.
There, he had them partly monitored to control their revenues.
In court, the defendant initially claimed that he was suffering from severe trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan alongside him died in an explosion.
After a psychiatric expert suggested great doubts about the psychological limitation and thus a limited capacity for guilt, the 33-year-old made a comprehensive confession.
The court no longer had to hear any of the injured women.
As reported by a Kripo official, at least four more cases of exploitative human trafficking could be detected after a first report by telephone surveillance measures.
The interviews were marked by high aggression.
In later interrogations, the victims had confirmed their martyrdom.
Another witness, in which one of the women had discovered bruises on the whole body, has so far made no statement.
It is a "completely broken personality" who regards violence and exploitation in this profession as normal.
The defendant regretted his conduct yesterday.
"He had separated himself from these circles and wanted to live a normal life after detention," he said.
Oil price continues to drop to $96 per barrel
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday after concerns over high supply overshadowed a report that China’s energy-hungry manufacturing sector is growing.
The reference crude oil grade for deliveries in December fell by 14 cents to USD 96.24 per barrel late in the morning in electronic commerce in Europe at the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The contract fell 39 cents on Thursday, representing a 5.8 percent price drop in October.
The large supply of crude oil has weighed on prices in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy said on Wednesday that the supply had increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over the course of five weeks, the supply had increased by 25 million barrels.
But on Friday, there was evidence of stronger demand from two reports of an activity increase in Chinese manufacturing.
This indicates a continued recovery in China’s economy, which grew to 7.8 percent in the third quarter after reaching its lowest level in two decades in the previous quarter.
Brent crude, a benchmark for international crude oil also used by U.S. refineries, fell 26 cents to USD 108.58 per barrel on the ICE Exchange in London.
Court Blocks Decision on NYPD’s Stop-and-Frisk Policy
A federal court of appeals in the United States blocked a judge's order on Thursday demanding changes to the New York Police Department's stop-and-frisk program, and dismissed the judge from the case.
The 2nd U.S. Court of Appeals said Judge Shira Scheindlin’s decisions would be suspended until the city’s appeal was decided.
The judge had ruled in August that the city was in violation of the Constitution with the way in which the program for stopping and interviewing people was implemented.
The city appealed against its assessment and ordered remedial measures, including the decision to set up a surveillance body to assist the police in amending its policy and training program.
On Tuesday, the Court of Appeal heard the arguments on the demand for suspension.
The appeals report stated that the judge had to be released from the case because she violated the Code of Conduct for U.S. judges by determining that a judge should avoid the appearance of partiality; this was partly justified by a series of media interviews and public statements in which she had publicly responded to the court’s criticism.
The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people for targeting inappropriately targeted black and Latin American men with the stop-and-frisk program.
It appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of major changes, including policy reforms, training and service supervision, and ordered a pilot program of body-worn cameras in neighborhoods where most controls were carried out.
In August, the City of New York agreed to end the practice of storing the names and addresses of people who were released after a police check.
An oral hearing on the appeal of the city is scheduled after 14 March 2014.
The stop-and-frisk tactic has been criticized by a number of civil rights advocates.
Controls of this kind have been around for decades in various forms, but the number of recorded controls during the tenure of partisan mayor Michael Bloomberg rose to an all-time high of 684,330 in 2011, most of them black and Latin American men.
In 2004, four men, all of whom belonged to minorities, filed a lawsuit that developed into a class action lawsuit.
Proponents of changes to the NYPD’s stop-and-frisk program say the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and effective police force, as well as affect the way other police departments use the scheme.
Opponents believe that the changes will dampen the morals of the police, but not crime; also, money will be wasted and the broader problem of a police that is under pressure after the loss of thousands of jobs in the last decade will not be solved.
The judge pointed out that she was not ending the stop-and-frisk practice, which was constitutional, but only reforming the way the NYPD implemented controls.
The Happiness of the Dreaming Camels
Happiness is an oasis that only dreaming camels succeed in achieving
With this Bedouin wisdom, the first Chairman Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination of the association "Helping Hands".
On Saturday afternoon the tenth birthday of the club was celebrated, which can already have considerable successes.
The first Chairman Henne reported in detail on the work of the association.
He himself was in Mauritania for the first time in 2004 at the Cheijk Zajed Hospital in Nouakchott.
As a result, a further cooperation developed, and the gynecologist Henne performed numerous operations on site on several trips.
During the speeches, pictures of the deployments were shown on a large screen, so that the guests of the anniversary event could get an idea of the mentioned actions.
The club's desert vehicle was also shown.
It is a former Federal Border Protection Vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, the former OB of Nagold, had made the proposal to equip this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and now plans, according to Henne, to act in the association in a consultative function.
In 2008, the carpentry company Schleeh from Baiersbronn created the nursery in Socogim, a wretched neighborhood on the outskirts of the capital – voluntarily – in the record time of just under a week.
Henne also mentioned a new mother-child hospital in Nouakchott
Particularly interesting in times when the maternity clinic in Nagold is to be rationalized away.
One learns a lot in Africa as a physician, so Henne, for example, deceleration against burn-out.
Due to the political unrest in the country you could not make as many trips as planned, but for this many physicians came to Germany to hospitalize here in different areas.
In addition, containers with material are regularly sent to Africa, such as medical equipment, medicines, bandages, hospital beds and glasses in March this year.
Co-initiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself provided abundant local colour by telling about Mercedes vehicles converted from Mauritania to mobile goat stables and by describing the experiences of the Stammheim musicians, who traditionally support the club, on their Mauritania trip.
As his personal motives, he mentioned his work in the field of auditing as a young deputy.
When he realized how much money was lost along the way, he decided to help Africans control a budget by the people.
In addition, Fuchtel stressed that global economy also demands global human love.
It should also not be forgotten that Africa is closer than some think.
From Gran Canaria it is not far to Africa.
Coulson used phone hacking to check a tip
Former News of the Word editor Andy Coulson allegedly used “telephone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation” in an attempt to confirm a false tip about an affair by then Interior Minister Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edi’s QC told the Old Bailey court that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with his “attractive special adviser” Hannah Pawlby.
The paper instructed private detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlby's voicemails and tracked them, but Coulson also called them and left messages, the court learned.
"In the prosecutor's opinion, Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not one who stands in front of people's homes and hopes to catch them up on fresh deeds, but one who likes to confront people with a story to see their reaction," Edis said.
He said NotW uses three methods to investigate stories investigatively: phone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously he knows about the second, the surveillance, otherwise it cannot be.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He denies this, but we say, "And whether he knew about it."
Rumors about Clarke's affair were first picked up by NotW's feature editors when a source sexually interested in Pawlby was told, "Don't waste your time, she's with Charles."
A tape containing voicemails from her phone from at least three occasions was seized in Mulcaire's apartment in August 2006.
The investigators also found entries on the detective's computer, on which Pawlby and her sister were stored as "projects."
During the time the research went on, Pawlby’s grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about them, Edis explained.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup supervised Pawlby’s movements.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voicemail with the following content: "I have a story we want to release tomorrow that I would like to talk to Charles about."
Edis explained that Coulson’s activities in this story followed the same pattern as other important personalities, such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunkett faced a married woman because of an affair when he himself was dating fellow defendant Rebekah Brooks, who had been married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks deny having conspired with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup admitted the phone hacking.
In protest against the planned tax on the rich, French football will actually go through the first strike since 1972.
A conciliation meeting ends unsuccessfully.
In the conflict over the rich tax, the government and professional football in France have maneuvered into a dead end after a failed conciliation meeting.
President François Hollande received representatives of the associations and associations in the Élysée Palace in Paris on Thursday and also listened to their complaints.
However, he refused to spare football from the planned 75 percent levy on incomes of more than one million euros per year, which all companies in the country will pay for two years from 2014.
The other side was also tough.
The strike, which was announced at the end of November, will now be carried out, said the head of the Association of Professional Clubs (UCPF), Jean-Pierre Louvel.
Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 matches scheduled between 29 November and 2 December will be cancelled.
Gechingen: No absolute protection possible
"We want to involve the residents in planning at an early stage," Mayor Jens Häußler opened the citizen information event on the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
Around 80 participants had come to the community hall to explain the planned measures, ask questions, express concerns and contribute ideas.
Häußler made it clear: "The final decisions are made by the members of the municipal council."
The flood, which hit Gechingen on May 15, 2009, unprepared, had been a drastic event, which raised the question of protective measures for the future, Häußler said.
A river basin survey had been commissioned with the neighbouring municipality of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
"Protection of as many built-up plots as possible is the goal," Häußler said.
The basis is the planning of the protection against a flood expected statistically every 100 years, according to the German Weather Service.
Climate change is accounted for by a 15 percent surcharge.
In specialist circles, this is referred to as "HQ 100aKlima".
The water masses, which had caused considerable damage in Gechingen in 2009, corresponded to a 1000-year flood.
"There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement," Häußler said.
In order to achieve the protection of HQ 100aClimate, around four million euros must be invested in Gechingen, whereby the municipality can expect state subsidies in the amount of around 70 percent.
Häussler pointed out, however, that the funding exists only if an overall concept is implemented.
For this, the community needs the participation of the citizens.
An elaborate planning and approval process must be completed.
In the best case, implementation could begin in 2016.
Among other things, the protection concept, which was already presented last week in the municipal council (we reported), provides for local measures in the influx of the Irm river from the Stammheim valley.
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept, the participants took the opportunity to present their concerns.
Among other things, it was questioned why no more dams and containment pools were planned to protect the place.
Gregor Kühn, specialist planner of the commissioned engineering office Wald and Corbe from Hügelsheim, who presented the concept, emphasized that it needed the interplay of all the measures presented to achieve the desired goal in total.
In addition, it is important to find the most economical solution, according to Joachim Wald von Wald and Corbe.
There was displeasure among the neighbours of the old town, who often suffer from an overload of the canal network, even under normal thunderstorms.
The problem is known in the administration and initial measures have already been taken.
Häussler pointed out, however, that the guidelines for sewer systems are different from those for flood protection and should not be mixed.
The municipality is obliged to design the canal network in such a way that two to three-year rain events could be coped with.
Dimensioning the sewers larger would swallow millions.
Severely injured after collision
In the early Friday afternoon, two drivers were seriously injured on state road 44 near Revensdorf in a frontal collision.
The police immediately closed the road completely, but could not say much about the accident at first.
However, there are several testimonies that should first be evaluated.
What is certain is that the 19-year-old driver of a VW Golf drove towards Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf came to meet her with his Hyundai.
Both vehicles collided, with the woman so heavily pinched that it took the fire department almost half an hour to get her out of the vehicle wreckage.
The actual cause of the accident was initially unclear.
Both of the victims arrived in nearby hospitals.
The route remained closed for about two hours.
It could be called the Dostoevsky of the United States.
Philip K. Dick was a seeker of gods, a metaphysician, his novels and narratives also have something serial.
Amazing the kinship on the outside: the stinging eyes, the beard, the high forehead.
And just as Fyodor M. Dostoevsky, with his massive oeuvre, is to be understood as the inventor and apologist of the Russian soul, one reads Philip K. Dick as an American prophet, who is well regarded in his own country.
Some titles have been published by Heyne Verlag, the Haffmans-Cassette with the 118 stories distributes Zweitausendeins.
Dick explains America - the realm of breathtaking technical progress coupled with paranoia, security craze and the belief in being chosen.
Dick had experiences of God, his late books read like a mixture of the Revelation of John and a computer manual.
Maybe he was crazy, had drugs added to his brain.
He realized, early on, that the computers are divinities.
He wrote a theology of computer and asked what distinguishes a man from a machine, the Creator from his creature.
This is the Blade Runner problem.
The killing.
A master of science fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories have inspired film directors such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is especially significant now.
The "Minorities Report" dates back to 1956, it exudes the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy Tribunal.
The principle of "pre-crime" is being developed here, "pre-crime", that is, what is now more or less official doctrine of the White House.
In Dick's world, which is frighteningly similar to ours, mutants look to the future - and the police approach.
“We’re capturing individuals who have not violated any law,” says the head of the agency.
"We're going to grab them even before they can commit a violent crime."
And: "In our society there are no serious criminals, for this we have a prison camp full of pesud criminals."
They assume that bad things are happening and prevent the criminal thought from being put into action.
Dick’s story acts as the blueprint for the NSA’s anti-terrorism laws and eavesdropping.
Anticipation of the attack: This is how Obama’s drone philosophy and practice works.
But Dick's story is not over.
The police chief complains that there is no more separation of powers, the military controls everyday life – and what is left of the state.
Then the supervisor himself is monitored and convicted of a future crime.
The system is freaking out.
It's perfect, but it's lying.
It invents its own prerequisites.
Not only accepts mistakes and sacrifices, but builds on them.
The system creates the danger it fights.
Reading Philip K. Dick means getting closer to the truth over and over again.
Angela Merkel's case in Russia
Former U.S. intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in the U.S. spying affair around Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel in his Russian asylum.
Representatives of the German Federal Prosecutor’s Office could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old in person in Russia, the agency Interfax reported.
Previously, the Greens MEP Hans-Christian Ströbele was the first German politician to meet Snowden in Moscow yesterday to talk to him about the affair.
NSA revelations intensify corporate paranoia over state surveillance
On a mild day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew deep over the US consulate in Frankfurt am Main, the financial capital of Germany.
On instructions from the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution and Counter-Terrorism (Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz und Terrorismusbekämpfung, BVT), the German secret service, he should photograph the roof of the U.S. outpost, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
According to the German media, the BAT wanted to prove the presence of surveillance antennas and the action led to an exchange of words between the US and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, Director of National Intelligence, again insisted in September that the U.S. did not use foreign espionage to “steal the business secrets of foreign companies on behalf of U.S. companies so that they could increase their international competitiveness or profits.”
But since Edward Snowden, the former whistleblower, began publishing his horn to U.S. surveillance secrets, European governments and corporate leaders are not sure whether they can take the director to the word.
Reports that the US National Security Agency has spyed on Brazilian oil company Petrobas and acquired data from American cloud providers including Google and Yahoo have brought the company’s paranoia to a new high due to state surveillance.
The barrel overflowing brought the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone had been whizzed, possibly for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then management are certainly potential targets.
Snowden has made the intensive cooperation between U.S. intelligence services and companies transparent.
I think it is conceivable that this data will be used for mutual benefit.
“Germany must wake up,” explains Oliver Grün, President of BITMi, which represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe that the U.S. poses almost as much risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by consulting firm EY.
However, in the documents leaked by Snowden, there has so far been no evidence that the U.S. has passed on the business secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed their concern that the EU lacks certain IT and internet opportunities and should reduce its dependence on the US.
Companies are skeptical about this.
In the Bundestag, it was proposed that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
“This is not how it works,” says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If you wanted a strong European IT industry, you shouldn’t have let it die out 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal to cars and agriculture.
Everything except the IT industry.
Nevertheless, the reach and technical sophistication of the US espionage authorities exposed by the Snowden revelations have shocked companies that had previously seen the biggest espionage risk in China.
A major change is taking place in cloud computing because European business leaders are now more aware that data stored in the US is subject to local jurisdiction and therefore potentially at risk.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trading institution, about ten percent of non-U.S. members rejected plans to use an American provider after the revelations about US data mining activities with Prism.
Jim Snabe, SAP’s Deputy Managing Director, said: “We’re seeing a new question from customers that didn’t exist a year ago – where are my data stored and can you guarantee that they will remain physically in that jurisdiction?”
Many German business leaders hold the view that recent reports simply confirm what they already knew anyway, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and therefore need to be guarded at all costs.
Economic espionage is no surprise.
That's always been the case.
“It has been a topic for many years and has not changed fundamentally due to the current discussion,” says Kurt Bock, Chairman of the chemical company BASF.
The Americans are spying on us at the commercial and industrial level, just as we do, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.
The management usually does not brag about the countermeasures they have taken, because that gives attackers advantages.
In large companies, employees have long been told that it is not advisable to take a free USB flash drive at a trade fair or to leave a laptop unattended in the hotel room, to say the least.
Ulrich Hackenberk, board member at car manufacturer Audi, says that it has been a standard practice for years to collect the phones before a board meeting so that they cannot be used as interception devices.
The German BVT advises executives to use simple prepaid phones when traveling abroad because smartphones may be compromised.
The prepaid phones are thrown away afterwards.
However, there is a concern that small and medium-sized enterprises will remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in their respective niche.
“Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets from unauthorised access,” BAT warns in a report.
The U.S. warns its own companies against economic espionage by other countries.
According to the Washington Post, in the U.S. National Intelligence Estimate in February, France, Russia and Israel were ranked second behind China among the countries that used the hacking to obtain economic data.
A board member of a German blue-chip company agreed that when it comes to economic espionage, “the French are the worst.”
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French Homeland Security Service (DCRL), was quoted as saying in an interview this month: “The intelligence services know very well that all countries, even if they work together in the fight against terror, are spying on their allies.”
Hechingen: Mass gives answers to wedding questions
“Marriage is the most important journey of discovery that man can undertake,” said philosopher Sören Kierkegaard.
Tips on how at least the wedding party succeeded, was now given a special trade fair in the domain in Hechingen.
There were important providers around a wedding.
A trend: The retro look has reappeared.
It starts with wedding dresses.
White is must, best covered or in cream.
At the front, the dresses are closed with embroidery, often with a veil, but at the back they go down the back and often end in a drag.
However, the ghosts separate, as Stefanie Koch of the fashion house Kleidermüller emphasizes.
For men, the suit with vest and plastron dominates, but you can also choose cream or brown combinations.
The choice of the location is important, he said.
Jewelless adjacent rooms are not optimal, the ambience should be special.
Here the domain made attention to its own offer in the race.
If you want to drive the carriage forward, Uwe Link has an offer for you.
"But carriages are also popular for young women's farewells," he says.
Romance is also in demand for invitation cards, flower arrangements and also for wedding pictures.
The "after-wedding photo" - i.e. shooting series in special places, preferably waterfalls, a few days after the party, but in wedding clothes - is becoming increasingly fashionable, Elisabeth Keidel explained.
Many more details of a successful wedding were presented in the domain on Sunday.
Flower arrangement, rings, wedding board, cake and also a magician, such as Marko Ripperger, who can entertain guests in style.
Not to forget the right cosmetics and nail care.
Everything for an unforgettable celebration.
Dog Friends Successfully
For the second time, the athletes of dog friends Bitz were successful at a rally obedience tournament.
Achim Scherrenbacher started in Kandel with two dogs; with his bitch Sandy he scored 94 points in the beginner class and secured fifth place, and with the 15-month-old Marley he took it to twelveth place with 87 points.
Susi Höpp with her Woody in class 1 faced the critical gaze of the performance judge.
Parents of a Georgian teenager who died in a tragic accident believe in murder
The teenager's parents, whose body was found in a coiled wrestler mat in his high school gym, are convinced that her son was murdered, the family's attorney said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta, Georgia, was found on January 11 in an upright mat standing behind the grandstand in the school gymnasium.
The Lowndes County Sheriff's Officers concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but doubted the 17-year-old's family.
"They are convinced that their son was murdered," Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson's lawyer Benjamin Crump told FoxNews.com.
They never believed he had died as the sheriff had concluded.
"They believe that there is no logic to violate the laws of physics or common sense," Crump said.
Rather, they are convinced that the truth is being concealed to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
"Your son went to school to study and came back in the body bag," he comments.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday that there will be a formal investigation into Johnson's death, as a number of important issues remain unresolved.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death due to a crime?
Moore said at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts, no matter in which direction they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I believe that there is a sufficient basis for a formal investigation," he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy suggested that Johnson had died as a result of “positional suffocation.”
However, a second autopsy revealed another cause of death, Moore said.
“There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed,” he said.
Moore added that if there is sufficient evidence to support a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson’s death, he would instruct the FBI to conduct the investigation.
A representative of the County Sheriff’s Office was not immediately ready to comment on our request on Thursday.
A court in southern Georgia ordered on Wednesday that the authorities release all surveillance videos that the investigators have reviewed.
The teen's parents said they hoped the video footage contained clues about how he died.
CDC publishes allergy guidelines for schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released a series of guidelines for dealing with food allergies from children at schools.
These are the first such guidelines issued by the U.S. government as the number of school-aged children with food allergies increases.
One in 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy.
According to the CDC, the prevalence of food allergies among children increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines provide information for schools to raise awareness of food allergies among the faculty and staff and how to deal with children who show allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have epinephrine in stock – the auto-injection of the brand EpiPen is most commonly used – to counter a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction.
Legislators in the states have recently changed regulations to make it easier for schools to keep epinephrine in stock.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms mentioned by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say, “It feels like something is pushing on my tongue,” “My tongue feels like a hair is lying on it,” or “My tongue is tingling.”
Parents of intersex children may choose “sex indefinitely”
Germany is the first European nation to recognize a third gender for children born with unspecified genitals.
Newborns are no longer rigidly assigned male or female.
Under the new law, parents are no longer required to declare gender for such children, but can specify "undetermined" or "undetermined" on the birth certificate.
The aim of the law is to relieve pressure from parents so that they do not have to make hasty decisions regarding surgery for gender assignment in newborns, and to combat discrimination against intersex people.
An intersex person said years later, according to the BBC, “I am neither a man nor a woman.”
I remain the patchwork created by doctors, mutilated and full of scars.
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children is born each year neither as a boy nor as a girl.
They belong to the intersex group, a group that falls under the diagnosis of "sexual differentiation disorder" (DSD), a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, germ glands (ovaries or testicles) or unusually developed genitals.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersexual.
The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed, but most U.S. experts recommend using the best available sex assignment information if a determination is not possible, and not waiting for the child’s psychological and physical development before deciding, if at all, for surgery.
New York-based psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender identification, said the new German law “sounds like a good thing.”
Intersex children are an ethical dilemma.
"Some people have life-threatening illnesses that require surgical intervention, but most children don't," he said.
You can do a gender assignment without surgery and then wait to see how the identity develops.
The scientific data on how a child develops his/her gender identity at all is not very accurate.
No one knows why it happens.
It's like the secret why people are gay.
A 2011 report to the European Commission states that intersex people are to be distinguished from transsexual or transgender people, because their status is not gender-related, but conditioned by their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively male nor female, but typically defines both simultaneously or not clearly as one of them.
These characteristics were shown in subordinate sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and stature, primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals or in chromosome structures and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in their working lives, as well as the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice.
Not matching the gender image boys now have a special camp.
In Australia and Nepal it is now possible for adults to indicate male, female or “third sex” on official documents.
In June, Australian Norrie May-Welby, 52, was recognized as the world’s first “sexless” person after a court granted lifelong retention of an “undetermined” gender status.
In addition to M and W, German identity cards will have a third assignment, X for intersex, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighboring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news report on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French members of the strictly Catholic country signed a petition that the “gender theory” should be removed from school books.
The American website Catholic Online has also spoken out against German law on the grounds that “if the world is dragged into a new state where gender is a decision, but sexual activity is not, then we are twisting two more pillars of civilization.”
The mother of a newborn from Maryland told Baby Zone she would like it better if babies were assigned a gender at birth.
"Parenting is stressful enough without any further restrictions, especially if you don't know your child's gender," she told the parent's website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children born with both male and female genitals have been referred to as hermaphrodites, after the attractive Greek god who had both sexes.
Even ten years ago, medicine considered gender to be something that could be erased and then rebuilt.
But in the meantime, the ethical foundations of an operation are being questioned after it is now known how complex the gender identity is, and that doctors can also be wrong because they do not know how the child feels as they grow up with the gender they have assigned.
"In the middle of the 20th century, this was called a 'psychiatric emergency'," Drescher said.
When such a child was born, they did not call the psychiatrist, but the surgeon.
The prevailing theory of treating children with unambiguous genitals goes back to Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who believed that gender was malleable.
He coined the term “gender identity” and argued that social and environmental stimuli – how parents raise a child – interacted with a child’s genes and hormones, thus determining whether a person considers himself to be male or female.
But in a 1966 case known as John/Joan, his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been cut off in a missed circumcision to castrate the child completely and also to remove his testicles and then raise him as a girl.
"Money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation, but it was not," Drescher said.
When the boy was about 15, he switched back to male sex and married a woman.
At 38, he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
But in the 1990s, with the arrival of the Internet, survivors of these sex operations have come to the public who are “unhappy with the outcome.”
For example, Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old author from Montana who was born with XY male chromosomes, but ambiguous genitals.
The doctors were not clear about whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never live a “satisfactory life” as a man.
So his external organ and testicles were surgically removed shortly after birth in 1976 and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12, he received female hormones.
“I knew I wasn’t a girl,” he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he should be given a vaginal plastic.
But because he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he demanded his medical records.
What he found out was shocking.
I was sterilized at birth – and no one ever told me that.
Bruce was born with a DSD that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone to develop the genitals.
After learning the truth, he switched back to male identity, received testosterone injections, and had his breasts removed.
The operation made him infertile.
Today, he is fighting for others in an organization called Interface Project for intersex people to be perceived as normal.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, executive director of the California-based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that the German law could “encourage stamping and stigmatizing.”
"Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and assign the child an 'unset'," she said.
We fear that this favors interventions.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female gender and then wait.
However, we do not yet know how the law will affect, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supports Australian law, because “it allows adults to be recognized as a third sex.”
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex," she said.
The German law is about the assignment at birth.
This is not a struggle to force small children at this time.
When they grow up, they can decide for themselves about their body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a breast radiologist from Pittsburg who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and supports hundreds of others in a support group, says the German law “authorizes” both parents and children.
Katie, Baratz’s daughter, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete androgen resistance.
Due to the receptor defect of the target cells for testosterone, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina but no uterus and no ovaries.
Today, Katie is 29 and married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as a child psychiatrist.
Although she is infertile, she hopes to be able to have a child through adoption or a surrogate mother.
“The law gives parents space, so they don’t have to make decisions in a hurry,” Baratz said.
It gives them time to do different tests and clarify things, giving them time before they write “male” or “female”.
In this way, everything is fine – you raise the child and love it.
You have a wonderful baby and you enjoy the happiness of your parents.
And you don’t have to hasten an operation that can’t be reversed.
"This involves the children in the decision and eliminates the fear that drives parents because they feel they are not doing the right thing," she explained.
Ultimately, the child decides on the gender that suits him better – and that’s wonderful.
This enables children to make their own decisions.
Unknown Injured Girl by Shot From Car
Unknown people have injured a 12-year-old in a car shot in Saxony-Anhalt.
The perpetrators had fired on a group of children on Thursday evening in Genthin, presumably with an air force.
This was reported by the police in Burg.
The girl was easily injured in the left calf.
Rescue workers took the girl to the hospital.
The shot came from a small car that had passed a group of six children and had suddenly stopped.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The perpetrators also shot at a bus stop.
A slice broke.
Then they drove away.
The police investigated, it said on Friday.
Until now, the Kempten Police Inspectorate can look back on a quiet Halloween night.
The officials were only called twice to egg-throwing children, who threw them against house facades.
Since the homeowners recognized this in time and removed the egg residues immediately, no property damage was likely to have occurred.
Furthermore, some Sylvester bulls were probably also ignited in the urban area, but no property damage has been caused here too.
A local resident in the Bischof-Freundorfer-Weg reported that his car had been wrapped in toilet paper and his wheeled diaphragms had been stolen.
Until the police arrived, however, the man found his wheeled blinds in the immediate vicinity, which is why the police did not have to take further action.
Living with a future perspective
Actually, Waltraud Ries lives dreamily.
Your house is in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with lots of greenery, an old tree, nice neighbors and also not too much traffic.
The city is only a few minutes away by public transport.
"Hopefully you're not afraid of spiders?" asks Waltraud Ries, pointing to a fat spider at the door frame.
I’ve been looking for a new home for my husband and me for a while now.
But you know how difficult it is in Stuttgart.
The reason, however, is not spider phobia, but the worry of being unable to cope with the many steps to the house and in the apartment in old age, she explains.
In addition, since a meniscus operation, the mid-fifties have had to experience on their own, what it means to move from floor to floor with a disability.
Recently, she published a book entitled ‘Happy Living in Old Age – Which Form of Living Is Best for Me?’.
‘Our apartment is the best example of what doesn’t work in old age,’ she begins to tell.
When she moved into the duplex apartment with her husband more than 20 years ago, it was just a beautiful apartment in the middle of the countryside.
Today, in his mid-fifties, Waltraud Ries thinks differently about it.
But she also knows that she is one of the few people who even deals with the topic of 'living in old age'.
Most people push it off as long as they can.
Only the others grow old," she says smiling.
Only when the pressure of suffering is really great, do you think about it.
"It may be too late," Ries said.
In her book, the interior designer introduces 17 residential models for self-determined living in old age.
'But which form of living you choose is always an individual decision,' she explains.
There is no solution for age.
Even those who can afford retirement in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider that they can also get sick.
And: 'Without good knowledge of the national language, you can also be lonely in the Dolce Vita,' says the specialist author.
Among their models are classic care models, alternative forms of housing or the often cited pensioner-WG.
In old age, everyone has their ticks and jokes
'For me, such a shared apartment would be nothing,' she says with a twinkling of an eye.
Certainly not like in a student apartment with a shared bathroom and a kitchen.
'In old age, you just need your retreat rooms,' says Ries.
The author does not want to rule out the fact that a senior housing community can still work.
But that should be different than in the classic student-WG.
And sometimes you just want your peace," she believes.
This is not the case, at least in the state capital.
'Most elderly people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own apartment as long as they can', is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, the head of the citizen service life in the old state capital.
Your department advises people on the topic of 'becoming older'.
Therefore, especially older people would often accept inconveniences and restrictions, only to be able to stay in their usual environment, that is also the experience of the Stiftung Warentest.
Today, there are many ways to make the house or apartment barrier-free.
Ries recommends to all those who are concerned with the age-appropriate renovation of their home or apartment, first of all, to inform themselves thoroughly and not to hire the first craftsman.
Today, there are also specialists for age-appropriate remodeling.
Even in the rental apartment, one or the other can be realized, and if it is only the toilet seat elevation, the interior designer clarifies.
But the existing apartment can not always be redesigned according to age and thus barrier-free, even if it is so beautiful.
Waltraud Ries had to make that experience.
Although you could install a stair lift inside the apartment, the path also paved with stairs to the apartment door would be the far greater obstacle.
She will continue to search until she finds the ideal object for herself and her husband.
Before the move, she is more afraid than the spider at her apartment door.
U.S. wants to prosecute Snowden
The U.S. has not changed its stance on former U.S. intelligence officer Edward Snowden.
He was accused of unauthorized disclosure of secret information.
That is why he has to face criminal proceedings in the United States, said the US State Department spokeswoman, Jennifer Psaki, in Washington.
Even Snowden’s recent comments would not change that.
Previously, the German Greens politician Hans-Christian Ströbele had appealed to the US after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow not to further threaten him with punishment.
Psaki stressed that Ströbeles’ statements were those of a parliamentarian and not those of a German government member.
Intelligence enthusiast Edward Snowden is basically ready for a conversation with German authorities.
First, however, he wants to clarify his situation.
This was made clear by the former NSA employee sought by the US in an un addressed letter, which Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele published on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded to the federal government, Bundestag and attorney general.
According to a translation published by Ströbele, the letter has the following text:
To those responsible
I was asked to write you about your investigation into mass surveillance.
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden, and I was previously employed by contract or through direct employment as a technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) of the United States.
In the course of my employment in these institutions, I witnessed systematic violations of the law by my government, which prompted me to act out of moral duty.
As a result of the release of these concerns, I faced a serious and persistent incitement that forced me to leave my family and my homeland.
I am currently living in exile and enjoying temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation under international law.
I am encouraged by the response to my political action, both in the United States and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world and also senior officials—including the United States—have judged the revelations to a system of all-encompassing surveillance that no one is accountable to as a service to the public.
These espionage revelations resulted in many proposals for new laws and policies aimed at the previously disguised abuse of public trust.
The benefits for society from these findings are becoming increasingly clear; at the same time, the risks assumed have been visibly reduced.
Although the outcome of my efforts has been shown to be positive, my government continues to treat dissent as a breach of allegiance and seeks to criminalize and prosecute political expression.
Yet, telling the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the United States government, with the support of the international community, will take this detrimental stance.
I hope that, once the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved, I will be able to participate appropriately and lawfully in the responsible clarification of the facts concerning the statements made in the media, in particular with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports.
I look forward to talking to you in your country as soon as the situation is clarified and thank you for your efforts to uphold international law, which protects us all.

Nursery found a private buyer
"The building is in good hands," says Winterlingen's mayor Michael Maier.
The former kindergarten in Gartenstraße has been sold by the municipality to a private person.
The municipal council agreed to the sale in its most recent meeting in the non-public part.
The building changed ownership at a "reasonable" price.
"The community is satisfied," stresses Maier.
The budget was set at <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100,000.
It is not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the former kindergarten.
The mayor is right that Winterlingen has handed over the responsibility for the building to someone else before the winter and thus no longer has to pay for the maintenance of the house, such as heating, looking after the garden and clearing the walkway.
"This effort is now gone," Maier is pleased.
Place concert at high summer temperatures
The music club Hammereisenbach gives a square concert on the terrace of the inn Hammer.
When conductor Bianca Willmann raises the clock pole at 7.30 p.m., the thermometer still shows 25 degrees.
Approximately 50 listeners enjoy the sounds of Hammrich musicians.
The chairman Manuela Honeck explains the pieces of music.
In this context, Honeck thanked everyone who had helped to successfully cope with the first musician hock.
Report: Obama Campaign Considered Replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton
The closest advisers to President Barack Obama have been secretly considering replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton in the 2012 election campaign, according to the New York Times.
The unveiling is the most remarkable surprise of the long-awaited work by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann about the 2012 election campaign, "Double Down: Game Change 2012".
The Times has a copy of the forthcoming book, and it reported on Thursday evening that the president's top advisors had conducted "extensive group meetings and polls at the end of 2011" to find out whether it would be better for Obama's diminishing hope of re-election to drop Biden.
According to Jonathan Martin, National Political Correspondent of the Times, the book thoroughly traces the history of the efforts of leading campaign and White House staff, including former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure the effect it has on poll scores of exchanging former Secretary of State Clinton for Vice President.
The potential change was a strictly guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the president’s closest advisers – including Daley, former Obama campaign leader Jim Messina, and former White House senior advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe – were aware of the proposed change.
In “Double Down,” Daley is claimed to have been at the forefront of efforts to exchange Biden despite her “tight, personal relationship” before eventually deciding against such a move after the data showed that Clinton’s candidacy “would not significantly improve Obama’s chances.”
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government had actually considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
"I said a whole bunch of things to consider, and that was one of them," Daley told the magazine.
You have to remember that the president had awful survey scores back then, so we thought, "For God's sake, what are we doing?"
While Daley described the investigations as “due diligence,” Martin told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that significant effort had been made during the campaign for re-election to find out if such a move would pay off in terms of the ballot boxes.
“Campaigns don’t spend as much money on surveys and focus groups if you don’t think seriously about something,” Martin said.
It is not clear, however, whether Obama knew that his team was considering an exchange.
Martin told CNN that he had asked Daley if his then boss knew about the potential change.
Although Daley stated that he did not believe the president was “aware” of the possible change, the former chief of staff admitted that it was “possible” that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that “Double Down” does not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether the political probe had reached Obama’s desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thinks Obama knew nothing about the investigation into whether to drop Biden in the elections.
“Maybe,” Martin replied.
What happens to my email on the way?
E-mail is actually an electronic letter.
Was the drafting of the Internet service e-mail technically implemented as in the case of the conventional postal service?
In the conception of the early Internet services, the focus was on making communication possible.
Therefore, in the basic technical protocols, attention has not been paid to creating a stable foundation for a sound exchange of letters.
Therefore, a traditional email corresponds more to an open postcard than to a sealed letter.
When user "Anna" sends an email to "Benni", are the computers of the two directly connected?
In the first step, Anna’s e-mail program or browser sends the e-mail to the mail server of its service provider.
For example, if she has a GMail account, that would be Google.
This mail server sends the content to the provider that Benni uses.
On the way, the mail can run over a number of other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call the content to his provider.
Are traditional e-mails read along their way through the network?
Most emails are read several times by software robots on the way.
The sender's provider usually checks whether the mail contains a malicious program as an attachment.
A virus check is also carried out on the receiver systems.
In addition, the providers check whether it is an annoying and unwanted spam email that is immediately deleted or at least sorted away in a spam folder.
Do robots have another task?
In systems like GMail, the robot also determines the information Google needs to place context advertising.
When Anna and Benni communicate via GMail about their upcoming holiday trip, Google can display corresponding links to holiday offers.
Do unknown people also read emails?
The likelihood of unauthorized people reading an email is extremely low.
In theory, however, this is possible.
In companies, administrators often have the opportunity to read electronic mail.
Law enforcement agencies and intelligence agencies also have legal options to intercept or take note of emails.
In addition, there are possible illegal spying actions.
Is it possible to protect e-mails from reading along?
With an encryption according to the OpenPGP standard, an e-mail can be encrypted effectively against co-reading.
With high technical effort, it is also possible to conceal the metadata of an e-mail communication, so that it is not even easy to recognize who has communicated with whom.
How important are Yahoo and Google in the email market in Germany?
According to a survey conducted by Convios Consulting in August 2013, Yahoo and Google play only a minor role in the main privately used mailboxes.
While Yahoo Mail’s shares had fallen recently, Google’s GMail was able to grow significantly.
Mother locked up in the woods and retired
When his elderly mother died, a man from Wolfsburg made a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest - and continued to collect their pension and care allowance.
In order to continue collecting pensions and care allowances, a 67-year-old Wolfsburger buried his dead mother in the forest after police investigations.
At first, he covered up the death of the 89-year-old, then he took the money in for more than a year and a half.
Now, the 67-year-old has to answer for fraud, a spokesman said on Friday.
The man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was suspected already in May: At that time, it was noticed that no more medicines were needed for the mother in need of care.
The retiree told the investigators that his mother had travelled to Spain.
Because this seemed strange to the officers, they continued to investigate.
It turned out that the two had lived in a shared apartment for more than 15 years and he had cared for them for the last time.
The 67-year-old admitted the death of his mother.
According to police, an autopsy did not provide any evidence of a capital crime.
Fancy ice cream that shines in the dark?
A British entrepreneur developed the first glowing ice in the dark using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of marine animals and created a glowing treat from them.
The idea came to him after reading a research paper on jellyfish and convincing Chinese scientists to make the glowing protein artificially.
The ice cream reacts with the tongue when consumed, which raises the pH in the protein and triggers the glow.
Chris explains that the ice cream reacts to the warmth in the mouth and shines – so the more you lick, the brighter it gets.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company “Lick Me I’m Delicious,” says: “The product is incredible, but still in a very early stage of production, and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds.”
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH.
When the mouth warms the protein, the pH rises and the ice glows.
We have been testing it over the last few months and it seemed ideal to us to bring it to the market on Halloween because it has this wonderful lighting effect.
It’s probably the most expensive ice cream I’ve ever made, because the jellyfish phosphor is four times more expensive than gold.
Each bullet costs me about 140 pounds.
But it tastes delicious.
Charlie’s Bristol-based experimental company is famous for its unusual flavors, including beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But his latest creation is to be even more ambitious.
He says, “I would like to develop an invisible ice cream.”
This is in itself impossible due to the refraction of light caused by the ice crystals that make up ice cream; but I suspect we are finding a way to make it.
The ice cream takes advantage of the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish artificially produced by Chinese scientists
The TSV Morsum is still without any points in the Handball-Verbandsliga after six matchdays.
For the team of Ingo Ehlers, the derby against TSV Daverden, who celebrated his first victory last weekend, is coming tomorrow.
With this game, the season starts again for us.
"I hope that we finally have our heads free," Ehlers behaves optimistically.
With the exception of permanently injured Hendrik Blohme, he finally has his entire squad at his disposal.
Daverden, like us, is on pace.
Therefore, we need to keep our error rate low.
First and foremost, however, it is important to increase the coverage that has left nothing but a sure impression in the past.
Daverden's coach Thomas Panitz is much more relaxed after his first win of the season against Nordhorn.
The game was, of course, a house number.
But that’s why we’re far from being the favorites, because anything can happen in the derby.
However, Panitz now wants to relegate to Morsum to start a series.
Jan-Malte Jodat is missing.
For this, the A-Jugendliche Joost Winduß, who is active with doubles playing right at the A-Jugend-Bundesligist HC Bremen, celebrates his season debut.
Anyone who is not hot in such a game should stay at home.
Halloween 2013: In numbers
When I was little, Halloween had something magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, stay up late and dress up for the neighborhood.
Today I have become more of a Halloween muffin.
In the last two years, I have not agreed to distribute sweets from my apartment, and I will probably not do it this year.
But according to statistics, I am a black sheep when it comes to Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million, to be exact – celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and decorations, according to the U.S. Association of Retailers (NRF).
One thing I look forward to every Halloween is the trend values.
The costumes will make up about 1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, invigorating inanimate objects are the last cry.
Women no longer have to wrap themselves in sexy clothes, they can now also embody seductive food such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As for men, I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet the Daft Punk spacemen will make it to the Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the most popular costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
There is nothing wrong with tradition.
We disguised our dogs last year and weren’t alone to my amazement.
In fact, Americans are spending $330 million this year on costumes of their pets, according to the NRF.
That’s a lot of “hot dogs.”
When it comes to sweets, we're not shy.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year, according to The Nielsen Company.
That’s about 270 million kilograms of chocolate bars, lollipops, candies and gummy bears.
So good news for the 41 million people, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, who are pulling through the neighborhoods with the slogan "sweet or sarcastic".
In fact, we’re going to buy over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – don’t worry – eat it.
The only thing we don’t want to consume is sugary candy corn; yet 15 million kilograms of it are sold around Halloween, according to the National Association of Confectionery Manufacturers.
That's about nine billion corn grains.
It's a mystery I haven't solved yet.
Nothing belongs more to Halloween than houses where it haunts.
They have great names like "Terror Behind the Walls" (which, by the way, is in a real prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
There are actually 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in the United States that make $500 million in revenue, according to America Haunts, and that includes the wonderful photos you just pee in your pants and then put your friends on Facebook where you don’t get rid of them again, and then leave a comment on you the guy you’re standing on like “nice facial expression.”
But let's finally get to the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Big Pumpkin when we were kids, and carving a pumpkin lantern is like decorating the Christmas tree—something we made from an early age.
Fortunately, the “baby in the pumpkin” trend only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up carving the pumpkin and not sitting in it.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The pumpkin lantern, which is slowly rotting in the front yard, is believed to be from Illinois, where 245 million kilograms of pumpkins were harvested this year.
If you want to score right, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and carve something pretty out of their 921 kilos of pumpkin.
Condominium fire in Helmbrechts: Rescue workers recover charred corpse
The fire brigade had to leave Helmbrechts late Thursday evening.
A three-family house in the district of Hof catches fire at night on Friday.
Rescue workers retrieve a charred body from the house.
Rescue workers have found a charred body in a three-family house in a fire in Helmbrechts.
Whether it was a resident is still unclear, as a spokesman for the police in Bayreuth said.
Late Thursday evening it had burned down the ground floor of the house.
When the fire brigade arrived, the flames were already striking out of a window.
The police went into the apartment and found the body in a room.
This and another room burned out.
The entire ground floor was damaged.
All other residents were not at home during the fire, the police spokesman said.
The building is no longer inhabitable for now.
The exact cause of the fire was not clear at first.
Germany’s largest state church has launched an offensive to promote the profession of pastor.
The background is a possible shortage of pastors: The Evangelical Lutheran State Church of Hanover expects that the number of its currently around 1,800 pastors will halve by 2030.
The profession is very attractive to young people today and offers good prospects for the future, Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) said in an interview with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the work and daily routine yourself.
With Burfien, the Landeskirche has for the first time commissioned a full-time pastor to inspire young people to study theology.
At present, fewer and fewer young people choose to study theology after graduation from high school.
Burfien attributes this to the process of de-churchization: "God's voice is quiet, the world is loud".
The profession is characterized by great freedom and diversity.
I am the master of my schedule and can put my focus where it is important to me.
Pastors could be very close to people as pastors.
They earned as much as teachers and could live well from it.
Certainly more is paid in the free economy, but theologians have a safe employer for this.
This is for the young people of today, who are not just about careers, but about meaningful work.
According to the state church, which comprises three quarters of Lower Saxony, about 60 pastors retire each year.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of a theology degree start their vicariat.
In sparsely populated peripheral areas such as the Harz, the Emsland or the Wendland, it may be difficult to fill jobs in the future.
Burfien wants to organize, among other things, study days for young people and to invite celebrities who have studied theology.
The study of theology offers a broad training.
You can even become a federal president.
Land Rover Rally Series Announced
The interior features racing seats and six-point belts as well as a hands-free system.
The options range from reinforced brakes, a service package with support for Bowler Works mechanics and logistical support to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, CEO of Bowler Motorsport, said: “The rally customers who come to Bowler have changed.”
They are not all experienced racers, but people who are looking for excitement and adventure, as well as an achievable path to world-class events.
We are delighted to open this path in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format opens up new opportunities to experience the various rally disciplines in the UK and abroad and prepare newcomers for the rigors and reality of Rally Raid.
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge car – it’s going to be a fun championship.
In addition, the Defender Challenge offers a training and testing day in February, as well as the option to participate in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Fire brigade called to rescue a puppy stuck 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rocky promontory in a quarry
Cockerspaniel dog Ruby had run away after a minor traffic accident
Three days later, she was discovered by a walker in the quarry in her troubled position.
Firefighters roped off the rock wall and saved the dog from safe death
The fire brigade managed to bring a puppy to safety, which was stuck on a 15-metre-high ledge in a rock wall.
Nine-month-old Cockerspaniel dog Ruby ran away after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before being rescued from a quarry on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, who owns the dog, came to the Flappit quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire to welcome Ruby back and thank the firefighters of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately searched for their missing bitch and posted calls for help on social networks when she escaped into the quarry after the small traffic accident.
Around 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a stroller carrying his dog saw the stranded Ruby on the 15-metre-high heel in the quarry.
The technical rescue team from the Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the spot and sailed off to rescue Rubys, who was then transported up in a dog box.
Andy Clayton, a technical rescue team specialist, said: “She was in a dangerous situation.
It was located in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and the ground.
She didn’t move any muscle during her rescue – she was like frozen.
But now she's fine.
She then ate a few dog cakes.
It was a rather unusual mission.
The fact that the dog was discovered is unbelievable.
Peter Lau, a technical rescue team specialist, said: “Ruby was very lucky.”
There was a possibility that she was seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinarian for examination, but found nothing except exhaustion and dehydration.
Becky Hall of Halifax, West Yorkshire, said, “Watching the rescue was frightening.”
I couldn't believe she was really up there.
It was wonderful to hold her back in her arms.
The veterinarian explained that if the exhaustion had become too great and it had collapsed, it would probably have crashed.
Firefighters have done great things.
It was really brave what they did.
We are so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson of Keighley added: “We were afraid she would fall down, but she stayed up.”
The firefighters were great.
I can't believe where she was.
Mick Jagger says he never turned on Katy Perry when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week, the pop star said she worked as a background vocalist on Jagger's 2004 song "Old Habits Die Hard."
Perry explained that she had dinner with the old rocker, and that “he dragged me when I was 18.”
She added: “It’s been a long time and he was very kind to me.”
In a statement, a representative of Jaggers, 70, said on Thursday that he “categorically denies that he has ever made any attempts to approach Katy Perry.”
The representative added: "Maybe she confused him with someone else."
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest appearance on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Their new album "Prism" ended up at No. 1 this week.
George Kerevan: European unbundling gives Scots a choice
A new day, a new horror story about independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is required to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
This provides the keyword for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a barbed wire-secured border along the Hadrian's Wall.
Indeed, the Strathclyde proposal pointed out the potential economic benefits that more freedom of movement would entail in the rest of Europe, but as expected, this did not matter in the headlines.
Nor has anyone mentioned that EU member states often bend their strict rules when it is more favorable for them.
Since Scotland is currently not part of the Schengen area, continued non-compliance for Brussels would be only a small concession in return for what one really wants from the Scots.
Actually not a story.
And one that has come so far that it already resembles a fossil: the first time I heard the "independence means passport controls" duck at least 40 years ago.
An interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this ancient story.
Why should you expect an independent Scotland to dance after the European pipe?
Why exchange the London yoke for that of Brussels, especially now?
These are the real European news: the great plan for the unification of Europe, conceived after the war, has stalled.
With the euro crisis, the project Europe has officially died.
Everywhere in the EU, parties that are hostile to the EU or want to throw the euro as a common currency overboard are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party – founded only this year – was able to win almost five million votes in the September federal election, effectively driving the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) out of the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federalist Europe.
However, the current economic crisis turns out to be a turning point.
Because of the strict austerity policies imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in conjunction with the coercive jacket, into which the respective national economies are forced by sticking to the common currency, many people believe that the project Europe has gone too far.
The crisis of the euro has little to do with national governments causing excessive budget deficits – this was only the case in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has nailed its members to exchange rates that are beneficial to German exporters – and German politicians would like to keep that way.
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the local currency, Southern Europe will find itself with a built-in productivity disadvantage over Germany.
The only way is to cut wages and public spending – spurred by Berlin.
Behind the current budget and monetary problems lies a deeper European productivity problem.
As a result of Brussels’ ‘green’ energy directives – a code for subsidising French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas compared to the United States.
This is a crippling cost disadvantage, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All the world’s payroll regulations do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, a revolt is emerging, especially in France, the former cheerleader of the EU.
After the war, the political elite of France saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany at bay and to raise Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy and has imposed on Europe its own economic policy, with which the struggling French economy is struggling.
The result: Marine Le Pen’s right-wing, EU-hostile Front National has just won a decisive by-election and thus put the ruling socialists in third place.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote – a timely warning to the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a split in the right spectrum would automatically mean benefits for the left.
What does Le Pen do with her newly gained popularity among the white French of the working class?
She wants to use the EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU, anti-Community currency bloc in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties perform well in these elections – and this is very possible – then such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament for the first time.
This is the point to which I want to go: in the not too distant future, the growing resentment against the EU and the common currency will come together to abolish the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will rather become something like the “Europe of (sovereign) nations” that General de Gaulle favored.
Germany and some of its satellite economies may hold onto the euro, but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect Britain to distance itself from this project in the hope of flattering the US.
However, Washington’s growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where is Scotland in all of this?
We can decide to be a region of (in the final analysis) Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – including telling Berlin and Brussels what they can put themselves where.
I suspect Scotland could do quite well in a looser European network, as long as we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other similarly thinking countries is easier in a non-federated Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider doing the same to Norway and maintaining our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is – remarkably – the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe and won a spectacular majority in 2011 due to the rejection of the proposed (and made) cuts that Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coalition were responsible for.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to opt for independence now, only to get an austerity policy imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: growing up faster
African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white peers, research shows.
Physical changes do not immediately mean puberty
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible.
Experts believe epidemic obesity is a trigger of early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is less pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in child health and family issues.
Should a mother be worried if her daughter grows breasts and pubic hair at the age of seven or eight?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics Association this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and constituted a new norm.
“I spend a lot of time calming my parents – usually this is not a sign that puberty is coming fast,” Kaplowitz said.
Obvious indications of development, such as growing breasts, pubic and armpit hair, as well as body odor, appear earlier in girls.
Nevertheless, there has only been a slight shift in the age of the menarche over the past 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.
“When breast development begins, it still takes at least two to three years to menarche,” said Kaplowitz, also author of the book “Early puberty in girls: the essential guide to dealing with this common problem”.
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty progresses.
It is controversial what is actually the beginning of puberty, but it is "early ripe" if breast augmentation is accompanied by a growth spurt before the age of eight.
In most cases, the process slows down or stagnates – something that a pediatrician can closely monitor.
With faster progress, tests by an endicronologist may be recommended so that serious problems such as tumors or cysts can be ruled out.
There are treatments for delaying early menstruation and defending against another consequence: premature aging of the bones, which can ultimately lead to inhibition of growth and thus small body growth in adults.
The recommendations for drug or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, the rate of development, the rate of growth and the emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is cautious about drugs, but he admits: “Suppressing puberty can mitigate behavioral problems and girls’ feelings, unlike being their peers.”
The other big problem is understandable: parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have the period.
“They worry about the risk of pregnancy or how they handle the hygienic side,” Kaplowitz said.
"It was a shock," recalls a woman whose daughter got her days at ten.
Even though there were first signs and we had talked about menstruation, she was emotionally unprepared.
She came home frightened and excited from school because she was the first in her circle of friends.
There are many widely published theories about the causes of early puberty.
But there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foodstuffs, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media would be the cause.
Boys get into puberty much earlier than girls.
Kaplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity.
He supported the conduct of a 2001 study on girls aged six to nine, which establishes a link between body fat and puberty.
Other research supports this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white peers.
There are different explanations for this.
Globally, early puberty seems to have been affected by all sorts of things, from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another mystery: although boys grow facial and pubic hair earlier, the trend to a full-blown earlier puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference underlined the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common even in babies and young children.
“We need to be careful how we identify the true onset of puberty,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to get advice from their pediatrician on how to talk to their child.
"This may mean that you have to have a conversation earlier than expected," Kaplowitz advised.
If you stay calm, the child usually responds well.
Girls who bloom early need assurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it occurs earlier than expected.
Jumbo manufacturers argue over seat width in the face of large orders
A dispute has arisen between leading aircraft manufacturers over the breadth of tourist class seats on long-haul flights, setting the tone for a bitter clash at this month’s Dubai Airshow.
The dispute revolves around the seat width offered to passengers on long tourist-class flights – not always the ones that airlines are most concerned with, but this designated space is the key to the efficiency claims on the latest Airbus SAS and Boeing Co. aircraft.
Airbus this week called for an industry standard that prescribes a seat width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in the tourist class, but U.S. archrival Boeing says airlines should decide that.
The dispute comes at a time when the aircraft manufacturers are competing to sell even larger versions of their two-engine long-haul aircraft, and expect record orders at the event from 17 to 21 November.
How the rear part of the aircraft is designed – especially whether there are rows with nine or ten seats – is crucial for the stated economic results that the new “mini-jumbo” design is intended to deliver.
Boeing claims its modernized “777X” can hold 406 people in tourist class seats that are over 17 inches wide, allowing ten per row.
Airbus explains that the competing version of the A350 will carry 350 passengers in 18-inch-wide tourist-class seats, with nine per row.
Aviation giants often give blows about technical details by means of advertising in the trade press.
Airbus is now appealing directly to the public before the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to make the race with over 100 orders.
Recently, the company introduced an ad that could be the start of a new ad war and showed funders a picture of three people sitting squeezed together in a restaurant, with the title: “Would you accept that?”
"Boeing is proposing long-haul flights in seats that are tighter than regional turboprops," said Airbus sales chief John Leahy.
As food habits change, people get fatter, but aircraft seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 defined the modern long-distance journey, and the end of the century, the weight of the average male American between 40 and 49 years of age increased by ten percent, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health.
The waist circumference of the average male American in the 21st century is 100.8 cm according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus says its rival sticks to a 1950s seating concept when the average body size of the newly-baptized “Jet Set” was narrower.
According to Airbus, studies have shown that an additional inch (2.54 cm) per seat increases sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing denies Airbus’ seat measurements figures and says it is not up to manufacturers to decide how airlines balance airfare and facility.
The company also explains that according to research, the experience on the plane depends on more than the seat width.
“It’s really all about giving airlines flexibility to do what they think they need to do to succeed,” said Boeing cabin expert Kent Craver.
They don’t want us to dictate what makes them profitable.
You know your business better than anyone else.
For passengers, it is about more elbow freedom, but for manufacturers, it is increasingly becoming an issue that can have an impact on sales.
Behind the dispute is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least $700 billion at list prices in the coming decades, which could have a lasting impact on the export balance of the US or Europe.
As Reuters first reported in July, the seat layout is the driving force behind the dispute over the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest two-engine long-distance designs than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 77-300ER.
Boeing’s statements on the results depend in part on comparing the 777X, with its ten seats per row, to the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increased cost per unit is still less than that of currently used machines with ten seats per row.
“This is why Boeing is squeezing more seats into its aircraft to make it more competitive to our products,” said Kevin Keniston, Head of Passenger Comfort at European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say full cabins with ten seats per row with existing 777s suggested that many passengers opted for tighter arrangement, which could come with cheaper airfares.
“Eighteen inches of seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is: from an economic point of view, Airbus’ offering is controlled by the threat posed by the 777,” says Mary Kirby, expert on cabin decoration, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats, but a catalogue of suppliers from which the airlines can choose.
The world-traveling jet sellers even carry with them tape measure to measure the facility in the competition.
Even if they praise the comfort, all manufacturers also offer high-density jets for low-cost airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with ten-seater rows, but has not yet sold one, according to its own statement.
Until recently, Airbus has emphasized the importance of greater cabin adaptability and offered wide seats on the aisles for some jets.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say the call for a new industry standard is likely to fade, but could distract from the wave of 777X sales.
New anti-nicotine vaccine could put an end to smoking pleasure
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime.
Further tests are needed before human testing, which may take a few more years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results are good.
“We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can once help millions of smokers who have tried and tested all the methods available on the market, but have experienced that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches,” Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to contain the genetic information needed to produce nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then produce a constant stream of antibodies.
The antibodies hunt down the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, preventing a smoker from experiencing nicotine high.
In experiments, vaccinated mice given nicotine maintained their normal levels of activity.
Mice without vaccination, on the other hand, would have taken a “time off,” the researchers explained, a sign that the nicotine had reached their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
Vaccinations had to be given so often to maintain antibody levels that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be significantly lower, as it turns liver cells into antibody factories.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine for humans, if it is completely safe, could be given to children before they are tempted to try a cigarette, thus preventing nicotine addiction.
More likely, however, is that smokers would use it to quit.
“They know then that when they start smoking again, they don’t enjoy it because of the nicotine vaccine, and that helps them quit the habit,” he explains.
British scientists said the findings were interesting, but at the same time warned that further research was needed.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
Former Labor Party minister Joe Tripodi from New South Wales is being investigated by the state corruption regulator.
The former NSW minister denies having amended the maritime lease regulations at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who owned covert holdings in three land plots on state-controlled land.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation into whether Obeid influenced several ministers of state to extend lease agreements at Circular Quay, where the Obeids operated two restaurants and a café, without tendering after their expiry in August 2005.
Tripodi is now being investigated for the allegation that Tripodi knew of Obeid's hidden interest in the property, after Tripodi's former deputy chief of staff Lynne Ashpole testified on Thursday.
In years of talks that began in 2005, the government had pushed for public tenders for the lease agreements.
The tenants were against it and also wanted longer durations.
In 2009, the lease agreements for the companies at Circular Quay, which raised the Obeids $2.5 million annually, were renewed without a public tender.
Tripodi, who was port minister from February 2006 to November 2009, had originally voted for public tenders.
But he denied having made the changes at the request of Obeid, who, as Tripodi confirmed, had pushed for a revision of the government’s lease arrangements.
A telephone record submitted to the ICAC showed talks from August and September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had moved to the Port Department after working under Obeid in the Fisheries Authority.
"Was the issue discussed in these telephone conversations the drafting of commercial lease arrangements?" asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi.
“No,” Tripodi replied.
I don't remember what was discussed, but it definitely wasn't.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli fighter planes attack target in Syria, official sources say
Israeli fighter jets attacked a target in the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday night, a senior government official confirmed to Fox News.
The officer did not explain what the target was, but said it was at least one.
According to the Associated Press, the target was Russian SA-125 missiles.
At least twice this year, Israel has carried out air strikes on missile deliveries in Syria.
Foreign workers with 457 visas could be subjected to “authenticity test”
The government is considering a "authenticity test" for foreign workers with a 457 visa as part of expanded measures.
Should the test be introduced, it would be based on a criterion to prevent the 457 from being used to fill unqualified jobs or as a back door for family and friends to move to Australia.
Today, a government discussion proposal was released after former Labor Party MP Maxine McKew denounced the government’s comments regarding foreign workers because they could be taken as an insult by Australia’s neighbors.
“Strong statements such as ‘foreigners should stand behind’ and ‘Australians hire first’ are a very unpleasant relapse in times when trade unions demanded a protected labour market,” she told the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that white workers should be protected – and if some in the region echoed this historic artifact, I wouldn’t be surprised.
The proposal for discussion outlines twelve measures that were once envisaged by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was yesterday on talks about human smuggling in Sri Lanka, has implemented five of the recommended changes, the others are still being considered.
If the "authenticity criterion" is adopted, someone applying for a visa could be checked to see if "the application is genuine in cases where the applicant is related to the holder or a relevant person of the supporting undertaking or is personally connected."
Companies could also be required to account for the number of 457 visa holders after companies that initially wanted to support only a small number of workers eventually hired hundreds in the past.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum-seeker is believed to have died of a heart attack after arriving on Christmas Island on a refugee boat this week.
The disturbed nine-year-old son of the man who came to Australia with him has been cared for since the death of his father on Wednesday by an adult cousin who was also on the boat.
Australian authorities took the man to Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
A study has been announced by the UK government to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
The work of HS2 Ltd suggests that high-speed connections between Scotland and the north of England will be established as early as the beginning of Phase 1 in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project “will bring Britain closer together”.
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was delighted to work with the UK government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail link between London and the West Midlands.
Upon completion of Phase 2, there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government corrected the estimated cost of building the high-speed highway between London and northern England from <0xC2><0xA3>32.7 billion to <0xC2><0xA3>42.6 billion.
The UK government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 Ltd to look for further route capacity and travel time improvements for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a travel time of ultimately three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network of routes that brings the UK and its cities closer together.”
We are moving forward with HS2 because it brings enormous benefits.
Without it, we are facing a capacity crisis in our rail network.
But it is also about the connection between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which will be improved thanks to HS2.
Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael commented: “Today’s announcement is good news for Scotland.”
On behalf of the Scottish government, Keith Brown urged Carmichael to “unmistakably” advocate Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Brown said: “The high-speed rail connection has the potential of enormous economic benefits for Scotland, but at the same time Scotland’s economic strength also provides an argument for fast rail connections across the UK.”
That is why we are delighted to work as a partner of the UK government and to explore the options for a high-speed rail link in Scotland that creates benefits for all and complements the Glasgow-Edinburgh link that the Scottish government is already planning.
I look forward to examining the inquiry report with the British ministers next year and deciding on the next steps together.
Regulations on electronic devices in aircraft remain in force in Australia for the time being
Australian air passengers must continue to shut down tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing, despite efforts in the US to loosen regulations on such devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows U.S. airlines to change their specifications so that passengers on their devices can read, watch or play e-books during critical flight phases, provided they are in “flight mode.”
During most of the flight, passengers are already allowed to do so, but many people find it annoying that they are not allowed to read their e-books at take-off and landing.
Australian companies are watching the decision, which requires U.S. airlines to do a lot of work to implement, but do not have any immediate plans to change their regulations.
CASA also said it would look at the announcement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical flight phases still apply in Australia.
"The CASA currently has no specific regulations regarding the use of electronic devices in the aircraft," it said.
The issue is subject to regulations that require airlines to maintain safety at all times and passengers to follow the safety instructions given by cabin crew.
Virgin has already held talks with CASA about expanding the use of its Wi-Fi entertainment system on flights, explaining that they are open to changes, but that these must be initiated by the legislature.
“We would welcome a review of CASA’s approval of electronic devices, as we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience after we now offer (wireless entertainment) during the flight,” a spokesperson said.
Qantas said it will stick to the current regulations until further notice.
“Our current guidelines state that electronic devices may not be used during take-off and landing, and we currently have no plans to change that,” the company said in a statement.
The FAA rules apply to U.S. airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations that can benefit passengers, and we will certainly take a closer look at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it.
The decision affects U.S. companies differently depending on the age of the fleet.
They must demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate wireless interference from mobile devices, and modify manuals, training materials, carry-on luggage programs, and customer instruction.
“After an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, lighter electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at any height,” the FAA said in a statement.
In rare cases of poor visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off the equipment during landing.
The group also recommended storing heavier equipment safely under the seat or in the compartments above the seats during take-off and landing.
Before the district derby against Schalke, BVB supporters with light rockets had provided ugly scenes in the Veltins Arena.
Borussia Dortmund announced harsh consequences.
Before the Friday match of the Bundesliga against VfB Stuttgart, the Ultras reacted with a silence - initially.
It was an unfamiliar, almost ghostly acoustics that offered the viewer until just before the start of the Bundesliga game between the German vice champion Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in Signal Iduna Park.
Most of the guest fans were heard with their songs.
The South Tribune, on the other hand, where the most faithful of the most loyal - and loudest - BVB fans stand, initially presented itself exceptionally quietly: no chants, no battle cry.
The podium of the Capo, which otherwise coordinates the joint stimulation, remained unoccupied.
And in the front of the stand was a large flag with the inscription "Sektion Stadionverbot".
Only when goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller was, as always, the first BVB player to enter the pitch, was a short-lived cheer.
As his teammates followed, there was loud singing and waving scarves - but not everywhere.
There was no movement in the central blocks 12 and 13 of the South Tribune.
The fact that stadium spokesman Norbert Dickel once again listed the positive experiences of the last days - derby victory, victory over Arsenal, contract extension of coach Jürgen Klopp - did not create a celebratory mood.
Only five minutes before the start, the Capo climbed his podium - and the tension, which had hitherto been tangible with his hands, was discharged in a loud scream, when Dickel, as usual, questioned the mood on the ranks in the stadium.
As always, it was the turn of the South Tribune – and finally, as usual, the loudest place in the stadium was here again.
And at the latest, when the call "Derbysieger steht auf" came with a start from the South Tribune, everything was as always.
The previous silence was probably a reaction to the events of the past few days.
Immediately before the district derby at FC Schalke 04, some of the BVB supporters had fired light rockets into the spectator ranks and onto the square - and almost hit goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller.
The game was late due to the chaotic scenes.
BVB boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had then received the tops of the Dortmund Ultras in his office - and it is believed Watzke's words, this was a rather uncomfortable appointment for the fan representatives.
"There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra movement," the BVB boss announced on Thursday evening at a panel discussion in Frankfurt.
As an immediate measure, Watzke forbade the Ultras a choreography for the home game against the VfB Stuttgart.
"I forbid that," he said.
We cannot give up the zero-tolerance policy in the field of pyrotechnics.
In addition, the Ultras have been shown various possibilities of punishment - until Tuesday, they now have time to decide on one.
Otherwise, according to Watzke, the BVB will impose a sanction by the end of next week.
"This will be drastic," Watzke assured.
We must be curious to see how the reactions on the South Tribune will turn out.
Pawning houses boom in Singapore as the crisis has arrived in the middle class
In a pawnshop at the Bendemeer shopping mall in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga exchanges a gold bangle, a ring and a pair of earrings to pay the school fees of her daughters.
“My husband and I just bought a house, and all my money is in it,” says Amirthalinga.
Although she earns $3,000 each month as an administrative employee and her husband also works, the monthly family income is not sufficient, she explains.
In fact, demand in parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is on the rise – is so high that ValueMax, where it traded, became the third pawn house listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Bonding jewelry is not only a quick way to get money – 1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan.
Typically, Singapore pawn houses require an effective annual rate of 17 percent, which is just above the 15.4 percent required by United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same mall.
Pfandhäuser, however, offer the advantage that no verification of creditworthiness or income proofs are required here, which is why loans are possible faster than with banks.
That’s why millions of people in the region are turning to pawn houses after families feel pressured by rising living costs as well as increasing household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans due to loose fiscal policies in the developed economies, low- and middle-income families are looking for pawnshops to offset the difference in stuttering economies.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor’s described growing household debt, mainly due to rising mortgages, as a risk factor for Asian banks’ creditworthiness.
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest household debt in Asia in relation to gross domestic product, according to the agency.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80 percent of GDP, an increase of 60 percent in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high consumer debt in Thailand, which has just emerged from a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed a persistent export weakness and a decline in consumer demand.
“In the end, in the face of rising costs, this means that middle-to-lower segment (the income scale) people will try to supplement their income wherever possible,” says Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historical highs in gold prices over the past two years have intensified the trend to pledge personal items as people take the opportunity to turn family jewelry into cash.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the pledged items in the city state’s 200 pawnhouses are gold.
People say to themselves, “The gold price looks good, let’s pledge Grandma’s gold chain and get it back next month.”
The largest Thai pawn house operator, EasyMoney, has seen a 20 percent growth in its stores in recent months.
The growth in the pawning business is so strong that ValueMax, operator of the branch in Bendemeer and 15 more in Singapore, wants to expand not only to neighboring Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside Asia, according to Yeah Lee Ching, Managing Director of ValueMax.
The company finances this with 60 percent of the $66 million it took with the IPO in Singapore this week.
While some lenders have fallen into a crossfire due to high interest rates, Yeah explains that pawn houses not only offer cheaper interest rates than other lenders, but also do not directly increase debt.
"Customers borrow items they already own, and liquefaction of personal valuables does not increase household education," she explains.
The pawn lending business is increasingly accepted socially as short-term, secured financing.
Also, not all people who use pawn loans are in financial trouble.
Rich people from Singapore also come to ValueMax stores to pledge gold bars and Rolex watches, for which they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
We have customers from all walks of life.
“This includes wealthy people who borrow something for a business or investment in the short term, or small businesses who need to bridge cash flow bottlenecks,” says Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
NSA sucks data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
The intelligence revealer Edward Snowden has a fundamental interest in helping Germany solve the ever-explosive NSA spy affair.
According to the Greens MEP Hans-Christian Ströbele, his surprising meeting with Snowden in Russia was about the conditions under which the former intelligence employee would testify at a German public prosecutor’s office or before an investigative committee.
Snowden referred to his complicated legal situation, Ströbele told ARD magazine Panorama.
Australian $325 million bailout package for Tasmanian health care
The Australian government insists on the harsh terms associated with the $325 million Australian rescue package for Tasmanian health care to ensure that the state government can’t waste the money.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take "immediate measures" to avert a crisis caused by an aging population of the island state, a higher rate of chronic diseases and system restrictions.
Financing for a period of four years was decided after government consultations with independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has lace up an emergency rescue package that we believe addresses the unique challenges the state faces," Plibersek said in a statement today.
The $325 million package includes $31 million in emergency relief for elective benefits.
Another 2,600 surgeries, including orthopaedic procedures and treatments for cataracts, are to be eliminated.
In addition, there is money for day clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better aftercare after inpatient stays, specialist training, mental health services, and the introduction of an electronic record of health data in local hospitals.
“These investments are in line with the ideas that clinic staff concerned have told me that they are the best way to improve the Tasmanian health care system,” said Tanya Plibersek.
The minister insisted on a strict reporting and accountability of the Tasmanian government.
The state must maintain the current level of funding in order to receive funds from the Commonwealth and report monthly on where the additional funds were spent.
A three-member commission is set up to ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie explained today, the $325 million would be of little use unless “accompanied by real reforms that bring the public Tasmanian health care system to a more sustainable course.”
Nevertheless, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, which he first expressed to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.
“I am confident that federal aid will make a major contribution to removing the state’s public health system from the concern list,” Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these electoral achievements will largely offset the recent cuts.
However, the health policy spokesman of the opposition at the federal level, Peter Dutton, believes that today’s announcement is just a “paving solution.”
“We are in the situation today because the Labor State Government has withdrawn $430 million from the health care system,” he told ABC TV.
It cannot be that a state government is pulling almost half a billion dollars out of the system and putting 300 million into the Commonwealth and then pretending to be good news.
Dutton urged Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the bailout package would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux's adaptation of the novel by Denis Diderot convinces with exceptional production equipment and contemporary details, but is also heavier than necessary.
Playing in France in the 1760s, the plot tells the poignant story of Suzanne, a young noble who is sent to the monastery by her family.
As she rebels, she is confronted with the extreme cruelty of an extremely sadistic superior and becomes the object of erotic fascination of another.
The film never slips away in lustfulness or sensationalism – and that’s where its problem lies.
The solemn seriousness with which the film is told also makes it a tormenting penitential shirt for the audience.
Syria has destroyed its ability to produce chemical weapons, according to a surveillance group
Syria has destroyed important facilities for the manufacture of chemical weapons and gypsum ammunition, the global chemical weapons surveillance group said on Thursday, while there were serious clashes in the north of the country near one of the sites where alleged toxic substances are stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the beginning of the civil war three years ago.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came a day before the date on
On 1 November, the Hague-based organization set up Damascus to destroy or make “inoperable” all chemical weapons manufacturing facilities, including all chemical mixing machines to toxic gas and the filling of ammunition.
The completion of this process, which is basically the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone in an ambitious schedule aimed at the destruction of all chemical weapons in Syria by mid-2014.
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus has yet to begin destroying the existing weapons and supplies.
According to estimates, there are about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons in the country, including mustard gas and the nerve gas sarin.
The announcement came at a time when fighting took place in the city of Safira on Thursday, experts say there is a chemical weapons production facility and deposits here, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.
The activist group, which tracks the number of deaths in Syria through a network of activists, said on Thursday that 120.296 people had died.
There are 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, 29,954 of them belonged to the army of President Bashar Assad, 18,678 were pro-government fighters and 187 were Lebanese Hezbollah militias.
Also among the dead are 2,202 deserted army soldiers and 5,375 fighters of the opposition, many of them foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated the number of deaths in this conflict since March 2011 to 100,000.
This number has not yet been updated.
The conflict has forced about two million people to flee the country.
Assad’s troops have been fighting the rebels in Safira for weeks, many of whom have ties to al-Qaeda groups.
The observatory said there were losses on both sides on Thursday, but did not give details.
The fights underline the danger facing chemical weapons inspectors, as their mission to liberate Syria from its poisonous arsenal is a race against time in the midst of a raging civil war.
According to the OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, the team “is now convinced that it has seen and witnessed the destruction of all important production and mixing/filling facilities mentioned by Syria.”
Therefore, “no further inspection activities are currently planned.”
Earlier this week, inspectors said they had completed the first round of inspections and visited 21 of the 23 sites indicated by Damascus.
Due to security concerns, the visit of two facilities was not possible, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPWC stated that the two sites had been "abandoned ... and the chemical weapons program objects there had been moved to other mentioned facilities that were inspected."
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities that the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the Executive Committee of the OPWC next month.
"I take the hat off to the bravery and courage that you have all shown in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organization," said Ahmed Uzumcu, the Director-General of the surveillance organization, in a comment published by OPCW.
For three years now, the mostly Sunni Muslim rebels have been fighting in this civil war against Assad’s government and its security forces, many of which are members of the Alawites, to secede from Shiite Islam.
In view of further developments, the head of the observation group, Rami Abdurrahman, said there had been a strong explosion on Wednesday in an air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion is unknown, he said.
Anger over sentence for Bali bombers
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who died in the Bali bombing in 2002 reacted angry at the verdict for the last of the instigators, who was tried, as they believed Umar Patek should be shot.
Patek, who had been on the run for nearly ten years as one of the most wanted people in Southeast Asia, was sentenced to 20 years in prison yesterday for his role in building explosives for the bombing.
He could be released after 15 years with penalty.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder for attacking two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, killing 202 people, including 88 Australians, and many more injured.
A conviction was also found in a series of terrorism-related charges, including a wave of explosive attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecutor's office had demanded a life sentence, even though it could have applied for the death penalty for the man who is also known as the "Demolition Man" because of his reputation as a master bomb builder.
The decision has aroused painful memories of June Corteen, a mother from Perth who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the devastation caused by Patek and his co-conspirators almost ten years ago.
Struggling with tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really mean, he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
"You should put him in front of a firing squad," Corteen told AAP.
I have to live every day with the fact that I will have no more grandchildren and I will never see my daughters again.
The Sari Club was devastated when a massive bomb exploded in a small truck parked in front of the nightclub on October 12, 2002, shortly after 11 p.m.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar, where just 20 seconds earlier, a suicide bomber had exploded a pack filled with explosives.
He fell into a coma for a month after the attack and "died" three times while hanging from a life support system.
Hughes said Patek deserved the same fate as the three other members of the Jemaah Islamiah terror cell – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the massacre and executed four years ago.
Really, this guy should get the death penalty before everyone else.
To keep him alive – no, there is no reason to keep him alive.
Getting 20 years after he killed 202 people and injured many hundreds is not much.
Patek is the last Bali bomber to face trial.
He escaped almost a decade of arrest, but was eventually arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where U.S. forces killed former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden just four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent testified that intelligence reports showed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of reestablishing the link between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
"He didn't stand up," Corteen said.
Until recently, he has shown no remorse for how much suffering he has inflicted on others.
The sentence was issued before the tenth anniversary of the attack this year, which is celebrated with commemorations in Bali and Australia.
"There will be a lot of tears this year," Corteen said.
Patek can appeal his verdict.
FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices in aircraft (but don’t make cell phone calls)
From departure to landing, passengers can now use their electronic devices to read, work, play, listen to music and watch movies, but not to make phone calls, according to the new guidelines issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the U.S. on Thursday.
However, passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
How quickly they will be implemented depends on the respective airline, FAA employee Michael Huerta said at a press conference.
Airlines must prove to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated the flight crew training manuals and equipment storage regulations in accordance with the new regulations.
The FAA said it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Among these airlines were Delta and JetBlue.
“Depending on the state of the plan, we could very soon approve the extended use of electronic devices,” the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers need to turn off smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed.
You are not allowed to restart it until the aircraft reaches a height of three kilometers and the captain gives the green light.
Upon landing, passengers must turn them off again and must not take off again until the aircraft has landed.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are protected against electronic interference could allow their passengers to use the devices even on take-off, landing and on the runway, the FAA said.
Most new commercial aircraft and other aircraft that have been upgraded to use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the professional flight attendants’ professional association, welcomed the changes.
“If the new regulation is safely implemented – and we work closely with the airline in this regard – both sides will benefit from it,” Glading said.
Honestly, we are tired of having to feel like watchmen on this issue.
Internet connections for browsing, exchanging e-mails, text messages or downloading data below three kilometers were still prohibited, the authority explained.
Passengers are asked to put smartphones, tablets and other devices in flight mode.
So still not “Words With Friends,” the scrabble-like online game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when he had to leave an American Airlines jet publicly for refusing to turn off the device while the plane was parked at the gate.
And heavier devices such as laptops still need to be stowed, as there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin.
Cell phone calls during the flight will also remain prohibited.
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is responsible for regulating telephone calls, not the FAA.
FAA may lift ban on certain electronic devices on take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a safety expert on national traffic issues on CBS News, said mobile phones were still considered a risk.
"Mobile phones are really a problem, not just because they could potentially cause interference with navigation devices, but because we know from the FCC that airborne transmission can also interfere with transmitting towers," Rosenker said.
An industry advisory committee set up by the FAA to investigate this issue recommended last month that the government allow a wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, the pressure on the FAA to loosen restrictions on use has increased.
Critics such as Missouri Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill argue that there are no valid security reasons for the ban.
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of the devices has become ubiquitous.
In some studies, up to one-third of passengers forget or ignore turning off the device.
The FAA began restricting the use of electronic devices by air travellers in 1966 after reports of interference with navigation and communication devices by passenger-carrying FM radios became known, which were the latest technology trend at the time.
New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA to disturb electronic interference.
Airlines have been providing passengers with Wi-Fi for several years when the flight altitude has been reached.
The airplanes adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also more insensitive to interference.
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the stronger use of electronic devices under the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today’s electronic devices generally emit far less radio radiation than previous generations.
E-readers, for example, emit only minimal radiation when you scroll around.
However, when downloading or sending data, the transmission values are stronger.
One of the advocates of easing restrictions on the use of devices by passengers is Amazon.com.
In 2011, company employees invited a passenger plane full of Kindle e-readers and took a test flight to identify problems, but could not detect any.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using devices.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he felt the interference from the devices was real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other committee members said there were only isolated reports of pilots speaking for aircraft systems to be disrupted by the devices, and most of them were very old.
However, the FAA recommended that pilots be allowed to order the aircraft to be shut down by passengers when instrument landing in poor visibility.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described them as a reasonable adaptation for travelers who today would be extensively equipped with technology.
“We are delighted that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not in conflict with safety,” said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Bird rescued by air rescue service from North Sea drill island released again
A bird flown to the coast by air rescue service, which had been found exhausted on a North Sea drill island, was released back into nature.
The water rallies were flown to Aberdeen last month by helicopter, where they were picked up by the Scottish animal welfare organization SPCA at their rescue center in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, head of the center, said: “This water rattle was probably a winter migratory bird from northern Europe, stopped by the strong winds over the North Sea.”
Apparently, the exhausted bird sought refuge on the rig.
He added: “He couldn’t fly any more, so we were contacted with a request for help.”
When she was released, the water rallies were fit and healthy again.
Is Europe’s elite ready to do business with the UK?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy to a table and defining what those who provide prosperity and work in the UK want to change in our relations with the EU.
To this end, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey among UK business leaders and asked them what they think about the UK, the economy and the EU.
YouGov surveyed more than 1,000 business executives from around the UK’s sizes, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now exporting outside Europe and focusing on countries that are modernizing and growing, while the states in the EU are stagnating.
They want new trade ties with countries such as China, India and Brazil to be favored by the government rather than stuck with the long and strenuous process of reforming the obscure EU institutions.
Asked about their views on certain legally regulated issues – from antitrust to product legislation – the majority of business leaders believe that control over these key competencies should be taken back to Westminster.
There was widespread dissatisfaction with the single market, as companies say the cost of Brussels regulations would now outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe’s trade zone – even 40 percent of large companies agreed with the ones that are traditionally the most Europe-friendly.
Finally, and that probably says the most, our survey of business leaders revealed that a clear majority wants Britain to change the course of the deal and a relationship with the EU based on trade, not politics.
This finding, which is found in companies of all sizes and leading corporations, shows that the economy is pushing for a “significant change” that will bring the issue of action back to the UK.
It’s about a lot – a change to the agreement and better conditions for Britain would lead to a change of opinion in favour of staying in the EU in a referendum at 16 percent.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this survey shows that the UK economy is behind its plan to renegotiate UK conditions for EU membership.
It also shows that companies expect a renegotiation to significantly shift the balance of power back to the UK.
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary as the eurozone moves towards closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as the result of our survey shows, which means for businesses a greater focus on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulation.
Gazprom’s Alexei Miller describes Bulgarian pipeline as the beginning of a new gas era
The start of construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the start of one of Europe’s largest energy projects, Gazprom said.
“Today’s event is a milestone: construction work on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun,” Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller said in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element for the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream aims to increase the diversity of Russia’s export routes through Europe.
A contract dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine, where the bulk of Russian gas for Europe is stored, is causing an increased risk on conventional routes, as can be heard from the official site.
Miller said the direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are "forever" eliminated.
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream at discounted rates when the entire project goes into operation in 2015.
According to Gazprom, construction work in other subordinate countries on the planned route should begin by the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic meters of natural gas.
For national and international investors, there is no way past the real estate location of Germany.
The economic framework data is correct and the financing options are excellent.
This has been the tenor of the 9th Real Estate Day of the Börsen-Zeitung.
The German real estate markets benefit from the economic strength and good economic conditions in the country compared to Europe.
Christian Ulbrich, CEO Europe, Middle East and Africa of Jones Lang LaSalle, pointed this out on the 9th real estate day of the Börsen-Zeitung.
According to Ulbrich, the look at the transaction volume shows how sought-after German commercial properties are.
In the first three quarters of this year, it increased by 31% compared to the same period last year.
In the UK, the increase was only 6%, in France it was 19%.
“Real estate investments offer an attractive interest rate,” Ulbrich said.
The yield gap between real estate and federal bonds is at a historically high level.
The FAA loosens restrictions on the use of electronic devices in aircraft – even if phone calls with mobile phones remain prohibited.

Royal Commission Hearing: Two YMCA Employees Accused of Sexual Offences Against Jonathan Lord
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales (NSW) have been charged with child-related sexual offences before charges were brought against child care provider Jonathan Lord from Caringbah in 2011, according to the Royal Commission on Child Sexual Abuse.
However, in the opening statement before the Commission, the YMCA had stated that “the organization has never had to deal with an incident of child sexual abuse.”
Managing Director Phillip Hare was questioned about a case in which a YMCA employee had been charged with child pornography offences, and another in which a sports teacher at YMCA Caringbah Hall had been convicted of abusing children entrusted to him in 1991.
Hare told Gail Furness, an attorney assisting the Commission, that he knew about the first case but did not know about the second.
He admitted that the opening statement of the YMCA to the Commission was also inaccurate in the claim that “there were external reviews of the YMCA, in which the YMCA was recognized as being at the forefront of child safety.”
On the contrary, evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA was informed that it received the second lowest rating of four possible ones in a quality audit conducted by the Department of Education and Communities in August of the year.
Hare, who started at 21 at the YMCA, admitted that the management had failed “from me downwards” in hiring Lord and did not ensure that employees were aware of their obligations to report violations of the Child Safety Guidelines.
Earlier this year, Lord had been convicted of sexual offenses against twelve boys during his two-year YMCA service.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
Hare, however, denied that the YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented employees from reporting Lord’s violations of children’s safety.
Staff said they had observed violations, including Lord being alone with children, privately caring for them as babysitters, letting them sit on his lap, telling one that he loved it, and letting children play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose superior was Lord and who had asked for child protection training because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that child service manager Jacqui Barnat, who was Lords’ superior at the YMCA Caringbah, was “very intimidating and most of the time very distant.”
The managing director stated that he would not accept statements from employees that they would not have dared to report to their supervisors.
Instead, he said, their friendship with Lord had impaired their judgment, which is why they did not report him.
Hare explained that he had shared his view with the YMCA NSW Board of Directors that the lesson the organization had to learn from the “Jonathan Lord incident” was “not about reporting” by employees, and the Board of Directors agreed with him.
Hare said the decision to push employees to sign confidentiality commitments shortly after the allegations occurred was made by YMCA's chief executive officer, Liam Whitley.
He said that this would prevent contamination of the evidence, which had been "overzealous" and poorly implemented.
The YMCA NSW was not a child-safe organization when Jonathan Lord was employed there between 2009 and 2011, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, an expert on child sexual abuse, told the commission.
He explained that there were "serious problems" in hiring, reviewing, training, training and supervision of employees.
The hearing was postponed until December 20.
Tony Blair said he would take the opportunity to return as British Prime Minister, but admitted that a comeback was unlikely.
In an interview tonight on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his departure from office, the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic policy issues.
Since resigning in June 2007, after a decade as head of state, Blair has largely avoided commenting on British politics, and his comments are mostly limited to foreign policy and his role as an envoy to the Quartet of Peacemakers in the Middle East.
Asked if he would like to return to the Prime Minister’s office, Blair was quoted by London’s Evening Standard as saying, “Yes, sure, but it’s unlikely that this will happen, so...”
When horse show experts gathered in crowds in Cardiff to choose the horse of the year, they knew that a tough competition was imminent.
But none were prepared for three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The Knirps, who is not even in kindergarten yet and only made his first steps a few months ago, and his Shetland-Pony Toffee trotted loosely through the three rounds and won the first prize – leaving 30 adult opponents behind.
The inseparable couple, both of the same size, were praised for their appearance, behavior and style at the annual competition hosted by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
While competing against men and women with elegant melons, he had put on his plate cap in a naughty angle and led the two-year-old toffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the jurors for his natural abilities in dealing with the pony, which are far above his age.
And Toffee received top marks for his appearance and personality.
Fenton had received Toffee last March as a gift for his third birthday and has been practicing with the Shetland pony every day since then.
His mother, Donna, 30, said, “Fenton and Toffee are a great team.”
They had to compete against the entire field and went off the pitch with gold cup and rosette.
It was only the second time he had participated in a competition with Toffee, and we were all thrilled when he won.
Completely strangers in the arena thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been showing horses for over ten years.
Howells said: “The whole audience was like electrified and everyone cheered and clapped at him.”
He walked on sand the entire length of the arena and although he looked so tiny, he did fantastic work.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors, and farms, and has two chickens he takes care of.
Just as he started, it won’t be long before he’s on the “Horse of the Year” show – and I’m sure he’ll perform well.
A spokesperson for the annual horse show said: “Fenton is only three, but he knows how to handle his pony.”
Together they are a great team.
The jurors rated Fenton and Toffee according to how well they would have beaten themselves and presented themselves in the demonstration ring.
They look for good cooperation between pony and guide – and Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I’m sure Fenton’s cute clothes did their part, which was really perfect for the occasion.
Chinese newspaper to be “reformed” after appeal
A Chinese newspaper on the front page called for the release of a reporter accused of defamation to be reformed, a press regulator said.
The Guangzhou-based New Express had printed a rare public appeal for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
However, Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to falsify reports about a state-owned company.
The New Express is now undergoing a “comprehensive rectification”, the regulator said.
The "revision order" was issued by the Guangdong Press and Publications Authority, Radio, Film and Television.
Preliminary investigations revealed that the New Express, which belongs to the Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several inaccurate reports about the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
“The editorial management of the New Express was disordered,” the regulator said in a statement.
She said she had decided to impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou and revoke his reporter license.
In addition, the Yangcheng Evening News Group has been instructed to make a full rectification of the New Express and recommended to identify the relevant managers at the New Express and to immediately review the management team of the New Express.
Chen had written several articles for the New Express in which he reported alleged financial irregularities at a manufacturer of construction machinery called Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and stood behind his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared on state television and admitted that he had published false reports against payment.
“In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion as well as the entire news industry and its ability to gain public trust,” he told the state news channel CCTV.
I did it primarily because I was looking for money and fame.
I realized that I was wrong.
Following Chen's apology, the New Express published an apology on the front page, stating that they failed to verify the reports correctly.
Several well-known suspects have recently made confessions on television.
Experts say confessions are still routinely enforced, despite a law change earlier this year that prohibited authorities from forcing anyone to blame themselves.
Drug tunnel with US-Mexico railway discovered
One of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug smuggling between the U.S. and Mexico, fully equipped with lighting, ventilation and electric rail operations, has now been discovered.
The U.S. authorities described the 120-by-90-centimetre tunnel as one of the most sophisticated passages they had ever found.
The zigzag tunnel, which runs over a length of just under six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
There are countless inconspicuous warehouses in the area, making it easier to hide drug-laden trucks.
The tunnel was closed before drugs could be transported in it unrecognized, the authorities said.
According to the court's records, eight and a half tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were seized when the tunnel was discovered.
Three men who, according to authorities, worked as drivers were charged with possession and intended sale of marijuana and cocaine.
They face imprisonment between 10 years and life.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers are relying on an extensive underground network of dewatering channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the marijuana harvest in central Mexico in October, challenging the drug cartels to quickly bring their product to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a nearly 640-metre-long passage with rails running from a kitchen in a Tijuana residential building to two San Diego warehouses.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love each other
Actor Orlando Bloom and model Miranda Kerr want to go separate ways in the future.
In an interview, however, Bloom said that he and Kerr still love each other.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are the parents of two-year-old Flynn.
Actor Orlando Bloom has commented on his separation from his wife, top model Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with U.S. journalist Katie Couric, which was scheduled to air on Friday (local time), Bloom said "life sometimes doesn't go exactly as we plan or hope for."
Kerr and himself still loved each other, the 36-year-old stressed.
"We will support and love each other as parents of Flynn".
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010, and their son Flynn was born in 2011.
According to the lexicon, veganism is subject to vegetarianism, but differs from it in a very substantial way.
Because while vegetarians allow themselves to eat cream cake, ice cream or a strong Edam, these feasts are not on the menu of a vegan.
Milk, cheese, egg, in addition to the renunciation of meat and fish, the vegan abstains from all consumption of animal products - honey is also denied.
What remains, you may wonder, but on closer inspection, the vegan diet is characterized by a considerable ingenuity.
"Bread spreads are very popular," explains Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the local health food store, which offers a variety of special products for vegans.
Also Reuben Proctor likes to visit the shop in the Domgasse.
The native New Zealander has been living vegan for 13 years, in Lampertheim he finds (almost) everything he needs to live. "In 1997 I changed my diet and became a vegetarian".
At the turn of the century, the next step was taken and I became a vegan.
"The conviction came not only because of the diet, but because of the choice of shoes," says Proctor, who prefers synthetic leather to normal leather.
He realized that it is also possible to do without animal products in other everyday matters.
First and foremost, being vegan is an ethics.
"I don't want animals to die for me," Proctor says the vegans' maxim, which extends to all consumer behavior.
Instead of mourning burgers, scrambled eggs or rubber bears, the vegan quickly discovered completely new products, the enthusiasm grew.
"It's a double bonus," says Proctor today, "in fact, being vegan is not a renunciation, no asceticism, but an enrichment." The assumption that changing the diet reduces the choice of food options is more likely to attribute Proctor to the power of habit.
And precisely these conditionings made some well-intentioned attempts fail.
“The addiction factor is a very decisive factor that causes many to give up quickly, similar to smoking,” Proctor compares.
And he said, “There is no such thing as an animal.”
Often it is the spices or the type of preparation that make up the taste.
"You can also create the same effect in other ways," explains the vegan.
For example, Proctor brings eggplants, mushrooms and a few vegan sausages to a barbecue.
He pays attention to a balanced, varied diet, in which it should also taste delicious.
Of course, you want to have something between your teeth, which is legitimate.
"It's supposed to taste, but that's not just to reduce to animal food," Proctor said.
Health damage to eating disorders, another widespread assumption, he did not suffer.
For me, the change had a positive aspect.
I do not take up foreign cholesterol and have an increased vitamin content.
There are high-performance athletes who only eat vegan.
"My blood levels are excellent, I often get checked," Proctor reveals.
Especially about the lack of vitamin B12, many vegan sims critics warn.
"Since animals are fed feed instead of grazing on the pasture, it is questionable whether the meat you buy in the refrigerator has a high vitamin B12 content," says Proctor.
For vegans, there is also the possibility to take the coenzyme in the form of tablets.
"My B12 levels are fine," he explains.
Proctor does not have to go far for food procurement.
After all, staple foods are everywhere and every supermarket now has soy milk and other products.
Everything I need can be found on the spot.
Every now and then I buy something special.
"Many people overlook the fact that only the finished products are expensive, but this is how it is known to behave with 'ordinary' finished products."
In any case, the preparation of vegan dishes is far cheaper and less time-consuming than generally assumed.
"There is a lot to discover in the kitchen, with a few small tricks you can get good, if not partially better results," says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking soda and carbon dioxide instead of egg, with his vegan cheesecake, Proctor was also able to amaze his parents-in-law.
Family celebrations give the vegan a new spice.
This has dynamics, when you cook together, it has a new significance.
"The situations that can arise are as different as the people themselves," says Proctor.
Of course, he was also skeptical.
You don't like my food anymore?
"Should I feel bad now because I drink milk?" - on such questions you have to act as a vegan with tact.
"I don't reject people, I'm part of this society," Proctor said.
And more precisely, the everyday world does not seem as vegan as suspected - and the vegan is not as restricted in everyday life as commonly assumed.
Fast food is also allowed.
Pommes are everywhere!
"Many donor shops offer falafel, or just a vegetarian yufka," says Proctor.
In a pizzeria, he avoids pasta dishes, or orders a pizza without cheese, all a matter of habit.
The restaurants are slowly getting ready for it.
"When I started eating vegan 13 years ago, everything was even more difficult," the New Zealander can find a development: "You have to talk to people, make them aware of it."
"If enough inquiries come, they may be inclined to supplement the menu," he hopes.
Vegan restaurants are evolving, such as the kitchen in Mannheim or the Café Vogelfrei.
Proctor has the wish that other restaurants have at least one vegan dish on the menu.
Essentially, vegan dishes are there for everyone.
Everyone can eat them, so they are just the opposite of exclusive.
"Meat dishes, on the other hand, are exclusive, in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others," Proctor notes.
“If you want to avoid food scandals, veganism is a safe way to make most of it impossible in the first place,” says Proctor.
However, buying vegan products can be a bit difficult at first.
Especially if one learns to understand that animal additives can also be contained in peanuts as colorants, one seems to quickly leave the courage with the adherence to ethics in so many hurdles and traps.
Not only for this reason, Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen have written a book: "Veganissimo - Animal Ingredients and Their Alternatives" explains the many ingredients that food and detergents are buried.
"Sometimes it's better to take small steps than to stop or stumble," says Proctor.
Veganism, it is an important moral sign that strikes at consciousness.
He may not quite manage to get rid of his habits, but at least he can teach the consumer to question his habits critically.
The stock exchange operator Nasdaq OMX keeps its customers in the air.
Trading on the Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on Friday afternoon German time.
In a notice, the operator blamed technical problems.
The other eleven U.S. option markets, including two of the Nasdaq OMX, continued their business unhindered.
The recent incident continues a whole series of smaller and larger breakdowns at the exchange operator.
Only on Tuesday, the Nasdaq indices had not been calculated for an hour due to errors in data transport.
In August of this year, there had been two breakdowns in one week alone.
At first, the US investment bank Goldman Sachs had sent massively flawed purchase orders to the options markets due to technical problems.
As a result, the exchange operators took almost a whole day to review and cancel the orders.
Two days later, half of all U.S. stock trading came to a halt for several hours due to a computer breakdown on the Nasdaq stock exchange.
Last year, Facebook’s IPO also caused a stir.
The Nasdaq systems had not been able to cope with the flood of buy and sell orders, the SEC later noted and sentenced the company to a record $10 million fine.
Constance: Radler kills 63-year-old
The accident occurred, according to the police, when a 26-year-old man on Thursday evening, around 10 p.m., with a ladies bike was unlawfully on the left sidewalk from the station square in the direction of the market place.
Suddenly, when a 63-year-old man stepped on the sidewalk from a restaurant, the cyclist was unable to brake in time, according to police.
In the following collision, the pedestrian was pressed against the house wall, went down to the ground and contracted a 15-centimeter-long place wound on his head.
An ambulance team took the injured to the hospital for medical treatment.
British police orders Assange to be extradited
The British police today handed over a letter of extradition to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who sought refuge and asylum at the Ecuadorian embassy in London.
Scotland Yard said the 40-year-old Australian had received a "invitation to surrender" to appear at a police station, adding that if he did not comply, he would be threatened with arrest.
Assange threatens to be extradited to Sweden on charges of a sexual offence after his possibilities under British law have been exhausted since the Supreme Court rejected his appeal against extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would extradite him to the United States, he had sought refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London on June 19 and asked the South American country for political asylum.
"Scotland Yard sent a 40-year-old man a call to stand at a police station at a time we chose," a spokesman said.
He continues to violate the terms of his release on bail.
The embassy did not comment on the delivery of the police request.
Assange fears he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States and charged there with possible espionage allegations after publishing over 250,000 diplomatic messages on the WikiLeaks disclosure website.
Driver who raced at 210 km/h and hot drink between his legs receives <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 penalty
A driver was fined <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 for driving at speeds of up to 210 km/h and a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was stopped on May 27 with his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree.
After the police stopped him, they discovered the beverage cup between his legs.
Before the Colchester District Court, Howie pleaded guilty without the necessary care and attention.
He received seven points and a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also convicted of paying <0xC2><0xA3>90 and a <0xC2><0xA3>100 victim surcharge.
Tax for foreign property owners against London’s bubble of speculation
The Treasury has provisionally calculated the CGT measure, but is still waiting for the final decision of Treasury Chancellor George Osborne, who in the 2012 budget had imposed a 7% stamp tax on homes that cost over two million pounds, as well as annual fees for buyers holding homes as a company rather than as individuals.
Already, the revenue from the Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea districts exceeded <0xC2><0xA3>708 million in fiscal year 2012/13, which combined revenues for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the Northeast, Northwest, Yorkshire and the Humber region.
Cook said: “After the increases in the stamp tax on high-priced homes and the introduction of the related legislation against circumvention, it is hard to claim that high-quality real estate is taxed too low, regardless of the impact of the outdated municipal tax system.”
“However, this move could make some foreign investors more cautious when it comes to buying properties in London, or prevent owners from selling,” he added.
First-class real estate – the top five to ten percent of the housing market by price – in the prosperous London Southwest Belt, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, has increased by the record 11.8% last year.
Prices in Central London showed consistent annual growth of 5.6%, but were overshadowed by an emerging "domestic market" where the southwestern part of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) experienced an upward trend, according to a study by Savills.
Scientists were able to shed more light on the relationship between a dog’s tail wagging and his mood.
Previous research had shown that happy dogs with the tail more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while it was the left side in nervous dogs.
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive and respond to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said: “In humans, it is well known that the left and right hemispheres of the brain respond differently to stimuli that evoke positive or negative emotions.”
Here we have tried to look at this in other species.
He also noted that in dogs, just like in humans, the right brain is responsible for the movement of the left side and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the feelings.
To learn more about how dogs respond to their peers’ lateral tails, the researchers monitored the animals as they watched these films from other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the four-legged friends and analyzed the behavior.
Probably we will soon understand why the tail moves in one direction, sometimes in the other
Professor Vallortigara said: “We showed the dogs movies with dogs – either a true-to-life version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects, and we were able to control the movement of the tail more to the left or right.”
When the animals saw how an otherwise expressionless dog moved the tail to the right (seen from the perspective of the waving dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But if the tail inclination was mainly to the left (again from the perspective of the dog waving), their heart rate rose and they looked restless.
According to Professor Vallortigara, the dogs do not intentionally communicate with each other through these movements.
Rather, he is convinced that the dogs have learned from experience what movements they should be concerned about and when they should not.
He said: “If you have different encounters with other dogs and the wedging with the tail in one direction is more associated with friendly behavior and the right side produces less friendly behavior, then you react on the basis of these experiences.”
The researchers say the findings could help dog owners, veterinarians, and trainers to better understand their pet’s emotions.
John Bradshaw, an expert on dog behavior and a visiting fellow at the University of Bristol’s Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, said this was not the first study to investigate whether left and right were important for dogs.
Last year, a team at the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their heads to the left when looking at an aggressive dog, and to the right when looking at a satisfied dog.
Another research at the University of Victoria in Canada stated: “Dogs are more likely to approach a robotic dog when its ‘tail’ is waving to the left rather than to the right, rather than becoming restless – exactly the opposite of what was done in the Italian study.”
According to his statement, the differences could stem from the fact that the dogs in the various studies did not interpret the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs respond to real dogs could help, he explained.
"While there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two halves of the brain are used for different purposes, many of the details still need to be determined - and dogs are no exception," Bradshaw said.
However, since their behavior is easy to record, it will probably not be long before we understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction, sometimes in the other.
Arctic Monkeys postpone performance in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's illness
Arctic Monkeys have postponed a performance in Glasgow after their lead singer became laryngitis.
The band from Sheffield was scheduled to play at Hydro on Friday.
Due to the illness of lead singer Alex Turner, however, the concert has now to be moved.
The band’s announcement came after they had previously had to postpone a performance at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys said: "After the decision to cancel the show at the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and on medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys must also cancel the show at the Hydro in Glasgow on Friday, November 1st."
“Alex Turner was diagnosed with laryngitis, which is why he can’t appear.”
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will now take place on 20 November, which was moved to 21 November at the Hydro in Glasgow.
All tickets remain valid for these shows.
We apologize to all ticket holders for the inconvenience caused.

Pope Francis Appoints First Cardinals in February
Pope Francis will appoint new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22, the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest-ranking clergymen in the Catholic Church after the Pope and they are also electing a pope, so that Francis will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately participate in the election of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal who has reached the age of 80 can no longer participate in the papal election – this falls to a group of 120 “elective cardinals”.
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said a meeting of all cardinals would take place before the ceremony to appoint the new cardinals, which is also known as the consistory.
“Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to convene the Consistory in February in advance so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from all over the world can be planned,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of eligible cardinals is likely to have fallen by February.
He explained that a pope usually appoints as many cardinals as necessary so that the number of eligible cardinals is again 120, and as many cardinals over 80 as he wishes.
The Consistory next year is significant because it is the first since the election of Francis in March this year, Valero said.
Currently, there is a certain overhang on the part of Europe and especially Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance,” he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals.
The Cardinals will also be the first to be called since the formation of the Council of Cardinals founded by Francis, a group of eight Cardinals from all over the world who are tasked with finding ways to reform the Church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything alone.
"Now, Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He said it was "well possible" that Pope Francis would ask the Cardinals for advice.
But so far we have not been in this situation – it’s all new.
Valero said that typically the bishops from large places would be called cardinals, but Francis is “full of surprises – so we don’t know who he’s appointing.”
GM recalls new pickup trucks in the U.S. to repair seat backrest
General Motors is recalling just under 19,000 of its brand new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks to fix a problem with the manually adjustable seat backrest, according to a statement released by the U.S. Vehicle Safety Regulatory Authority on Friday.
In some of the carriages, there may be a defect in the mechanism for resetting the front seat back.
For this reason, they do not comply with the Federal Guidelines for Vehicle Safety in Headrests.
"If driven from the rear of the vehicle, it is possible that the headrest does not properly protect the occupants, so there is an increased risk of injury," the message read on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website.
The recalled models were made between August 1 and September 10.
The delivery of the GM trucks began in June and represents the most important model launch of the leading U.S. car manufacturer since the insolvency-related restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the vehicle owners of the defect in the first half of October.
The NHTSA was unable to review the notification letter due to the 16-day government shutdown, which negatively impacted car sales in October.
Sales of the Silverado and Sierra trucks, which were newly developed for the 2014 model year, increased by 20 percent in the first ten months of the year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra pickup trucks.
GM shares rose 1.4 percent on the New York Stock Exchange to $37.47 on Friday afternoon.
The Desperation of an Obama Voter
I voted for President Obama twice in the hope that change is possible.
He says Obama has made commendable efforts that have been thwarted by Republican blockade tactics
The blockade policy does not apologize for Obamacare's website problems, the drone attacks
Obama’s memoirs about the 2008 election campaign were a sad reminder of what would have been possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year student at Harvard Medical School.
I am currently reading a very sad book.
It is a book that I believed would cheer me up during the troublesome second year of my medical studies and give me hope again.
It is called "The Audacity to Win" and describes Barack Obama's 2008 presidential election memoirs.
When I finish my patient records in the evening and go to bed, the book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions and took my breath away from a speech.
The election turned out to be a landslide victory and news outlets stopped to highlight the historical significance of this hour.
My classmates cried with joy, and my parents collected all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on their way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
When Obama took office in 2008, he had a vote of 82%.
And then I close the book.
Switching back to the present is an evil awakening, as if you were ripped out of a dream.
It’s hard to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I voted for the first time, something has actually changed.
But it's just nothing I could have imagined.
I recognize the great and versatile things Obama has accomplished, from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for health insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of the forced secrecy of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden.
I also believe that the party-political blockade tactics have tilted too many aspirations to advance our nation: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance, and the closure of Guantanamo Bay, to name a few.
But after I have defended the Obama administration countless times against colleagues and acquaintances, I have reached the end of my attempts to explain.
I have reached a point of political despair.
The Republican blockade policy cannot explain why it allows for the interception of foreign heads of state or the killing of innocent children by drones overseas.
It can’t explain why the National Security Agency collects data about Americans’ privacy and why whistleblowers who disclose state wrongdoing are punished.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, was murdered without trial, nor why the public funding and spending limits were circumvented during the presidential election.
It does not justify the results of a report saying that the White House’s efforts to bring the media to a standstill were the “most aggressive... since the Nixon government.”
And most recently, it cannot apologize for the inability to design a simple website in the more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if that's what I should have expected.
Whether I should have understood at the age of 18 that government work could contradict its preceding political campaigns.
Obviously, the deputy name is not a predictable course, as an opposition party and accidental events such as the Newtown Massacre shape public debate.
But when I look at the examples above, they seem to have been largely elected by the government itself.
And that bothers me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confusing and uneven alternative, he seemed unable to define his direction and positions.
I had the impression that a second term for Obama, free from pressure from future elections, would fulfill the hope we had heard of so long.
But with Obama’s approval ratings falling to below 45% this week, returning to 2008 has become all the harder with this book.
It awakens in me the longing for the many promises that have dissolved in the air.
This week, I read a section of the book that describes how Obama had to put in a heavy loss against Clinton in the primary elections in Pennsylvania.
In a meeting with the voters after the decision, he told his employees that they had to get back on track and follow the purpose of their cause.
"I want us to find our magic," he said.
We need to remember who we are.
It's five years later, Mr. President, and I couldn't agree more with you.
The views expressed in this comment are exclusively those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in parental leave
Billionaire and MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interest in his parental leave plans because his daughters are getting pregnant and could benefit from it.
The mining magnate, who is in a court dispute over paying $6 million in CO2 tax, made the claim when he wanted to wipe questions off the table about whether he was in a conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which are important for deciding whether to remove or cut carbon and mining taxes.
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and that Abbott’s daughters would personally benefit from the laws.
“He is in a big conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because when one of his daughters gets pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether she gets leave or not,” Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Palmer Election Commission officially declared the winner of Fairfax’s Sunshine Coast seat by 53 votes after the recount.
Palmer called for a revision of the vote counting process so that it could take place faster.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the vote?
“We need a better system,” he said.
Why shouldn't we have a system where you march in, enter the data into a computer, immediately dial, and then get the result at 6:30 in the evening?
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils when marking ballots.
Do you use them because you can erase the results if you don’t like them?
Voting with pencils these days is unbelievable.
The Electoral Commission has reviewed the options for an electronic election and recently published a joint bill with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, stated that his policy includes an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he will take his new office “very seriously.”
A public office is about service to the public.
“We aspire to no reward other than that of history, namely that we can serve this community at a critical time,” he said.
RBS suspends two foreign exchange traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange department, two people familiar with the situation, another indication that the global regulatory investigation into the alleged currency market manipulation is rapidly accelerating.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they are working with the authorities on the investigation into the world’s largest financial market, where $5.3 billion changes ownership daily.
The two traders would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the expanding investigation that the scandal surrounding Libor’s interbank business ensues.
The bank, which did not comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received information requests from authorities.
“Our investigation on this issue continues and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators,” the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, people close to the situation reported that the RBS forwarded the records of emails and instant messages sent from and to a former merchant to the UK regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, had left RBS in 2010 and is said to have been on leave from his current position as European head of forex spot trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading at Citi, was on leave this week and Matt Gardiner, former senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended from Standard Chartered this week.
None of these merchants were accused of any wrongdoing.
Usher’s instant message group included bankers at Barclays and Citigroup, people close to the situation said.
UBS announced this week that it took action against some of its employees after Swiss regulator Finma declared that it was investigating a suspected manipulation of the foreign exchange market at a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities worldwide – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Competition Authority Weko, the FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently dealing with allegations that bankers have agreed on transactions in the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also initiated internal investigations or received information requests from authorities, people familiar with the situation said.
Banks comb through instant messages and emails from several years in search of cases of misconduct.
The news about these investigations has upset traders in an area that has been one of the most profitable trading units of investment banks in recent years, but was under pressure this year because low currency volatility limits opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the affair, saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the extensive and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but leading traders believe that this is not necessarily true.
A leading trader noted that despite the enormous daily volume in foreign exchange trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of banks’ own internal platforms lead to “one being able to influence the market even with very low ticket prices.”
The news came out the same day that Credit Suisse announced that it had terminated a trader of its London Exchange Traded Funds office this week after causing a loss of just under $6 million at the end of last year.
The bank promptly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with them.
“We are sure that the dealer has acted alone and that the matter is contained,” said Credit Suisse.
Painted the building fence on the Bechtle plot
A group of the citizens' initiative "Swiss Meadow" has embellished the building fence on the Bechtle estate on the spa promenade in Bad Herrenalb.
In addition, it cleaned and widened the footpath, it says in a press release.
The planned covering of the decomposing house in the rear of the property was not allowed for safety reasons, as the site threatens to slip.
Alfred Abel, who currently manages the property, had agreed the beautification campaign with his colleague Reinhard Domke from the BI.
Before the action of the BI, a banner with the message "We are for" had been attached.
However, this did not bother the approximately 20 members of the Citizens' Initiative in their action.
Their motto on the big poster was "We are against building ruins".
In doing so, she wanted to point out the danger of even larger ruins on the Swiss meadow - if the giant project fails one day.
In conversation with many passers-by in front of the "building site", it became clear that some citizens believe that the realization of the city's project will be better for many, although many have the same questions about the dimension of the project presented as the BI.
But they are starting to resign because the city is further delaying these responses, according to the BI.
The public statements of the mayor also have an impact.
May had said in the municipal council meeting that he feared the end for the thermal bath if the population should vote against the plans for a bathing and wellness complex on the Swiss meadow in the citizens' decision.
Some seem frightened because of this, others see it as a "loopy blackmail attempt" on the population, the BI's press release continues.
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all the helpers.
Rangnick shells for Schiris: Mane not a swallow king
As satisfied Ralf Rangnick with the current high form of Bundesliga table leader Red Bull Salzburg is, so disappointed was the sports director of the "bulls" from the referees.
"There is currently a dangerous tendency for Mane and Alan to be pushed into the category of swallow kings," he said at a press conference in Salzburg on Thursday.
The most recent reason for Rangnick's criticism was yellow for Mane at the 3-0 against Grödig last Sunday, in which the Senegalese became an alleged actress to his fate - which, of course, was not, as the TV images showed.
"A blatant mistake," Rangnick said, referring to the referee Harkam as "completely overwhelmed".
Harkam also contributed "his part" to the escalation between Salzburg coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig coach Adi Hütter after the game.
He defended his German compatriot decisively: "I would have behaved in every single situation the same as Roger Schmidt."
Schmidt himself wants to have had no contact with his colleague after the skirmish with Hütter.
I don't know why.
“Because I was the one who was offended,” the 46-year-old said.
Given the success of the race, however, Rangnick voiced a praise hymn.
"There are only two words for that: 'Very good,'" he stated.
There is not much to expose.
Above all, the way the team plays is impressive.
Let's keep this going.
There will hardly be any changes in the winter transfer period.
There are no great reasons to change anything.
"Unless a player approaches with the wish that he wants to leave the club," Rangnick clarified.
Supreme Court approves Obama's health law
It’s a big victory for the Obama administration: The U.S. Supreme Court today ruled that the health law closely tied to Barack Obama is constitutional.
By five to four votes, the judges ruled that the single mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – forcing U.S. citizens to take out health insurance or pay a penalty by 2014 – is constitutional under the state’s tax authority.
Supreme Judge John Roberts sided with the four more liberal members of the Chamber, while Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy ruled against it.
The court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2700-page law, and also held that the provision of the Health Act that states should either extend Medicaid access requirements or otherwise cancel all state Medicaid grants is not unconstitutional.
The lawsuit was filed by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law had been decisively rejected by all leading Republican presidential candidates, including ultimate challenger Mitt Romney, in the 2012 primary campaign.
Norway: Norwegian place lights up with giant mirrors
With huge mirrors, the inhabitants of a Norwegian village have brought light into their dark valley.
Due to the low degree of sunshine, the Rjukan in the Vestfjord Valley usually sinks from autumn to spring in the shadow of the surrounding mountains.
With three gigantic reflectors at a height of 45 meters, a century's dream came true on Wednesday.
"At last!", Mayor Steinar Bergsland swore at the launch ceremony on TV2.
Some valley dwellers made their way to sun loungers, others put on sunglasses for safety reasons.
Until now, sun-hungry people had to ride a cable car to a nearby summit in the winter.
Ten years ago, the local artist Martin Andersen presented the proposal to direct the rays with mirrors into the valley.
However, this basic idea has been in place since 1913.
After several years of debate, the city council finally approved the 5 million kroner (around 615 000 euros) project.
A similar construction has been providing winter sunshine to the Italian alpine village of Viganella for several years.
Post hardly learns on Sundays
"Many citizens will not have noticed yet, the red dots for the Sunday emptying are still on different mailboxes of the core city and the districts, but if you read the small print on the yellow containers of Post AG, you quickly find out that the emptying no longer takes place on Sundays and holidays," the FDP informs.
A request from the FDP confirmed this.
On Sundays and public holidays, only the post office building in Ernst-Ludwig-Straße 36 and Jakob-Müller-Straße 1 in Hüttenfeld are emptied.
Whether Hofheim and Rosengarten will also be emptied on Sunday will not be answered in the response to the FDP’s question.
The social and youth spokesman of the FDP, Fritz Röhrenbeck, wants to follow up here.
Sunday emptying is an important postal service especially with appointment mail.
"This thins out this undertaking despite the price increase for letters on January 2013 radically and unreasonably".
Thomas Bittner, Chairman of the Liberal Group and the City Association, supports his colleague: "What annoys me is the fact that here the emptying times are secretly changed or also cancelled".
From the proximity of the citizens, the post is miles away.
"At least the mailboxes in the Neuschloß and Rosengarten districts have to be emptied again on Sundays," said Bittner and Röhrenbeck unisonally.
Even for the core city, especially non-mobile fellow citizens should be able to reach a mailbox with Sunday emptying also on foot.
Röhrenbeck asked in the city parliament whether the city administration planned talks with the Post about this matter.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the Post had not communicated with Lampertheim.
But to his knowledge, there is also a Sunday emptying in Hofheim.
His party is in favor of privatization.
"Then decisions will be made elsewhere," Maier said.
Frankfurt parking fees are expected to rise sharply
Parking in Frankfurt could soon become more expensive.
The city’s magistrate is discussing a proposal by traffic officer Stefan Majer (Greens) this morning.
The parking fees will be increased by 50 percent.
However, the aim is not to raise the prices, but to shorten the time interval of parking meters and ticket machines from 30 to 20 minutes.
In December, the city council will have to decide.
The retail committee of the IHK Frankfurt considers this "not a good idea".
The possibility of parking directly in front of the store is "a not to be underestimated advantage for smaller specialist retailers".
The Verkehrsclub Deutschland is of the opinion that an increase after two decades "is quite appropriate and actually long overdue".
Public transport will also be more expensive.
Freudenstadt: Fast actions surprise hosts
With a narrow squad, the gentlemen of the TSV Freudenstadt had to compete against the TG Gönningen from the Swabian Alb in the Schiller school gymnasium in Reutlingen.
The Elblers were on the other side of the net with an experienced team.
It soon became apparent, however, that they could not quite keep up with the fast actions of the Freudenstädter, also due to their age.
With the hard and placed serves, the Gönninger did extremely hard.
Repeatedly they missed the passports and attacks played by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz cleanly over the net center and were not in place in the block defense.
Two high first set wins clearly expressed the superiority of the Freudenstädter in all respects.
In view of this oppressive and game-determining performance, the third set was then won a little lazy and lustless to the 3–0 finish (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).
On 2 November, a much more powerful opponent will be on the field with the TV Baiersbronn, which was clearly able to prevail in Nagold.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B-Class, the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt faced each other in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn.
They delivered a hard-fought two-hour match.
Nervousness on both sides caused mistakes and points gifts, especially when accepting ball; even in the passes, the precision was sometimes deficient and in some critical game scenes, the overzeal prevented the view for possible point wins.
In this performance-very well-balanced encounter, however, the TSV team of Marcus Blasutto consistently agreed on the great physical commitment and a pleasing commitment of both teams.
Nursing day at the small English cabin
On the fifth day of nursing in the aftermath of the Natura 2000 project Upper Hotzenwald, a group of dedicated participants met at the small English cabin in Ibach.
Due to suggestions from the population, the view into the valley should be cleared on this day in the area of the hut, Mayor Helmut Kaiser said.
According to Kaiser, many hikers described this area as the highlight of the gorge, on which the landscape offers the ideal setting for magnificent views.
He thanked those present for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the day of nursing was an appropriate instrument to strengthen the connection between man and nature.
It offers every citizen the opportunity to set accents in nature itself.
At the same time as the tourist aspect, ecological consideration can also be found.
This ecological aspect was explained by Friederike Tribukait from the Department of Nature Conservation of the Government Bureau of Freiburg after the welcome by the Landrat Tilman Bollacher, who had taken over the patronage and wished the action a good success.
According to Tribukait, the tourist destination of far-sightedness coincides with the goal of preserving the now heavily expanded old Allmendweidfeld with its specific protected habitat types by opening and connecting to the still existing pastures.
Certain species, such as rare butterflies and grasshoppers, cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest areas.
You need these free connections to the conservation of the species.
Tribukait said she did not want to fail to break a lance for the planned biosphere area at this point.
The current measure is not only seamlessly integrated into this planning.
A biosphere area also offers the opportunity for sustainable economic and ecological development on the basis of the internationally recognised Unesco status and thus a continuous addition of what has been achieved with the Life project and the previous care days for the future.
After these different explanations, district manager Christoph Wehle and Life project manager Cornelia Bischoff divided the helpers into groups.
The larger trees had already been struck in advance, the forestry tractor may be ready to be retrieved.
A group of helpers should take care of the release of juniper bushes and the care of a dry stone bar.
The goal was a clear view at the viewpoint.
Loeweningen: Köpfler still the only candidate
Information on the Internet: Although the small town of Löffingen with its 7514 inhabitants, an intact infrastructure, a forward-looking school, children, youth and seniors policy, as well as its own municipal utilities can be described as an attractive city, so far no second mayor candidate has registered.
The 46-year-old bank clerk and business economist Dieter Köpfler from Löffingen has so far been the only candidate for the succession of Mayor Norbert Brugger, who is no longer a candidate for age.
The application deadline expires on Monday, 11 November, at 6 p.m.
Google, Samsung, Huawei sued for Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of previous Nortel patents, filed an avalanche of patent infringement lawsuits against cell phone manufacturers, including Google, the company that was outbid by Nortel at the insolvency auction.
Rockstar, the consortium that purchased the Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement in the U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of patent infringement in seven cases.
The patents concern technology that matches search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising, according to the lawsuit, which thus hits the core of Google’s search engine business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately available.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC manufacture mobile phones that work with Google’s Android operating system, which is in fierce competition with Apple and Microsoft’s mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial bid of over $900 million for the Nortel patents.
Google increased its offer several times and recently offered $4.4 billion.
After it was surpassed in Rockstar’s Nortel patents, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a business that was also partly motivated by Motorola’s library of patents.
“Although Google has failed in its attempt to acquire the patents at the auction, Google has infringed the patents and continues to do so,” the lawsuit said.
Rockstar is demanding a high level of damages from Google as it claims that Google’s patent infringement is intentional, according to the accusation.
Egypt swore first freely elected president
Mohammed Morsi takes his oath of office, but his day of triumph is not likely to mean the end of the political disputes in Egypt.
Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a “new Egypt” when he was sworn in as the country’s first freely elected president, succeeding Husni Mubarak, who had been expelled from office 16 months earlier.
With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and Egypt’s fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He swore an oath before the 18 judges of the court, dressed in black robes, whose seat is on the Nile and is modeled on an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are striving for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic," Morsi said at the ceremony, which was broadcast live on state television.
"Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life - absolute freedom, a genuine democracy and stability," said Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer trained in the United States and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that had been sharply targeted by the respective government since its founding 84 years ago as a forbidden organization.
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building when Morsi arrived in a small car convoy shortly after eleven o’clock local time.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered in front of the court to cheer the new president, and unlike the Mubarak presidential pomp, traffic was briefly stopped so that the car convoy could cross the usually busy street connecting the city centre with the southern suburbs.
As an uncharismatic “replacement wheel” mocked by the Brotherhood, his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a Friday speech in which he presented himself not only as a candidate of the Islamists, but all those who wanted to target the aspirations of the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian Mubarak.
“Egypt is now a civil, national, constitutional and modern state,” Morsi, dressed in a blue suit with a red tie, explained to the judges in the wood-paneled chamber in which he took the oath of office.
Later, Morsi went to the University of Cairo, where he was to give his inaugural speech.
He was officially greeted by an army chapel that played the national anthem, which he listened to in the Habachtstellung.
The military leader Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was present.
Upon his arrival, he was greeted by hundreds of attendees in the largest lecture hall of the university with speech choirs of "The army and the people are one hand".
Established in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, the University of Cairo developed into a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahir Square, the birthplace of the uprising that led to the end of Mubarak’s authoritarian rule last year, and vowed to reclaim presidential powers that the military council had taken from the head of state chased out of office.
But by taking the official oath before the court and not before the parliament as usual, he bows to the will of the military, indicating that the power struggle will continue.
Mursi’s speech in Tahir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
Falkenberger Discothek ensures two great evenings
The new season at the Falkenberger discotheque "Blue Velvet" has begun.
This Friday evening it is called "Pump this party", tomorrow Saturday evening it will continue with a Ü 25 party.
Fat beats and cool sounds are of course promised by the organizers on both days.
Worker crashed from ladder: seriously injured
On Thursday, a 51-year-old worker in Eggelsberg crashed from a ladder and was seriously injured.
The man from Lamprechtshausen wanted to replace a defective heating probe on the exterior façade of an inn.
As he climbed the ladder leaning towards the gutter, it slipped away and the man crashed onto the concrete floor.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to the Salzburg State Hospital by the rescue helicopter "Christophorus 6".
Rapists in South Africa: twice life imprisonment
Nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the perpetrator has been sentenced to two life sentences on Friday.
This was reported by SABC.
The victim later died as a result of serious injuries.
John Cana had already been found guilty of the crime at the beginning of the week.
The act had caused horror nationwide.
The then 21-year-old had raped Anene Booysen in February at an industrial site in Bredasdorp near Cape Town.
For 14 hours, the doctors fought for the survival of the victim, but in vain.
The sight of the teenagers was so horrific that the nurses needed psychological assistance.
Kana had admitted during the trial to having been in a bar with Booysen on the night of the crime.
He also confessed to having beaten and raped her, but denied being responsible for the girl's death.
The police had initially assumed several perpetrators, but released two suspects from detention because the evidence against them was insufficient.
The prosecution also stressed during the trial that it was convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack.
Rapes are almost everyday in South Africa: There are about 64,000 reports of sexual violence per year.
This is almost ten times as much as in Germany, which with 82 million people has significantly more inhabitants than South Africa (50 million).
Police and women’s associations in South Africa estimate the dark figure in sexual violence to be 10 to 25 times.
Jumbo visits the Black Forest ham
Jumbo in search of the "best ham in the world": For the TV show "Galileo" the Pro7 star visited Bonndorf.
The speaker makes it clear right at the beginning: the most important thing for the ham are the pork legs, turbomast is not a good prerequisite.
So can ham, which you get in every supermarket, be a quality product?
Uli, as head of the large ham factory in the Black Forest, explains to Jumbo how the company "Adler" works in Bonndorf.
"Germany's favorite ham", as Jumbo announces the Black Forest ham.
Only with hair protection and coat does he get inside the factory.
Jumbo also has to disinfect his hands before he can reach for the microphone.
Jumbo spotted for strengthening at fast food in Waldshut
"I work in huge quantities here," the TV makers are astonished, black forest ham as a mass product.
16,000 crows a week speak for themselves.
Weight, fat content, color: Uli explains what matters in terms of quality.
Most pigs are slaughtered at six months of age.
TV at a level?
Details such as the pH of the meat also play a role.
The darker the meat, the higher the pH.
"I'm curious to see if you can measure Roberto Blanco, what happens next," Jumbo said cynically.
Here, the level of private television is presented in pure culture.
But watching is still worth it.
The spectator sees that the dismantling of the collars continues to be handmade.
Black Forest ham is traditionally found without bones on the shelf.
The secret of the ham is the spice mixture with the salt.
Smoke tower and smoke firing visually remind Jumbo of a "submarine".
The trick: Fir branches provide the special taste of black forest ham here in the smoke.
After 20 days in smoke, the ham is almost black.
"Now the disc disappears in the jumbo," he announces the test feed.
"It's really delicious," concludes the TV star.
All those involved will be able to live with it.
Did you think that travel agencies are a thing of the past thanks to the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to be resisting the trend.
The company has increased its earnings prospects for the full year and expects record revenue from vacationers in Australia and the UK.
The travel company now expects an adjusted annual profit before taxes between $325 and $340 million, compared to $305 to $315 million in its previous forecast.
If the current targets are reached, this represents growth of 12 to 17 percent compared to the record profit of $290.4 million in 2011/12.
As CEO Graham Turner announced, Flight Centre achieved 8% profit in the first half of the year and a strong start to the second half, particularly in the Australian and UK private business.
“Our ten countries have been profitable since the beginning of the year, and some of them are on track to record yearly earnings before interest and taxes,” he said.
These include Australia and the UK, which are typically among our strongest earnings carriers.
In Australia, the leisure industry recovered in the second half of the year, offsetting a slightly weaker business travel market.
Similarly, the recreational business of Flight Centre in the UK went well, while business customers spent less here too.
U.S. business recovered from the seasonally weaker first half of the year, so profit is expected for the third consecutive year as a whole.
Flight Centre shares rose by 3 cents yesterday to $38.20.
Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In courses of English literature, students will have to cover at least one piece of Shakespeare, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry, and contemporary British novels from 1914 onwards.
The exam also includes "unseen texts" to encourage broader reading.
The combined course of English literature and language is abolished.
Starting in 2015, students will have to take a standalone GCSE exam for language, with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Ministry of Education will publish tomorrow the new curricula for English and mathematics – the first subjects that have been radically redesigned.
Other core subjects will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the audit regulator, will announce a reorganization of the GCSE structures, including a new rating system and less coursework.
In a speech in the summer, Education Secretary Michael Gove said that there is a “wide consensus that we need to reform our audit system to restore public trust,” stressing that GCSEs would become “more challenging, ambitious, and stricter.”
Studies show that there is less time spent on mathematics in English schools – 116 hours a year or three hours a week per school year – than in most other countries.
In contrast, Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours a year and students in Singapore receive 138 hours.
While there will be no formal requirement to provide more time for mathematics in the timetable, coalition circles say that the comprehensive math exam – combined with a greater weighting of the subject in rankings – will likely encourage schools to schedule more hours.
The curriculum focuses more on "real life problems", including financial mathematics.
Beautiful animals and delicious cakes lure
The most beautiful rabbits of different breeds and colours will be presented at the Kreisverbandsleistungsschau this weekend in the Bürgerhaus.
Evaluations were made on Thursday
Once again, the local association W514 is hosting this large exhibition.
Breeders from the clubs in the district of Soest show their best animals here as well as young wicker hobby owners their rabbits.
On Thursday, six award judges evaluated the numerous rabbits and were able to distinguish outstanding animals.
Visitors to the show are well informed, as the assessment of all animals is appropriate on the cages.
The official opening of the exhibition will be held by Mayor Hermann Arndt on Saturday at 2.30 pm.
The rabbit show is open to all visitors on Saturday from 10 a.m. and on Sunday from 10 a.m. to 3.30 p.m., followed by the award ceremony.
Guests are also invited to a tombola with stately prices and to a deliciously stocked cafeteria.
Pamela Anderson separates from her legendary blonde curls and performs for the first time with a new bubi head.

Salem: Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Discussion Forum
The next Ecumenical Discussion Forum on Monday, October 21, in the New Museum of the Castle will focus on the theme "To Hell with Hell - Theological Reflections on Today's Handling of the Last Things".
The speaker is Professor Johanna Rahner.
The Ecumenical Discussion Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Protestant parishes of Salem, the Castle of Salem and the Cultural Office of Lake Constance.
Johanna Rahner wants to investigate in the forum the question of how today people classify the "last things" after death.
Had people in the past centuries known too much about it and put their trust in those images of heaven and hell, "which still shape our ideas today", the contemporary prophetic doctrine of the hopes for perfection is characterized rather by a certain embarrassment or even speechlessness.
"The greater hope has been properly driven out by the criticism of religion," says the speaker.
"She provided us with so many question marks that the exclamation marks seem to have been lost."
Johanna Rahner continues: "But the decisive challenge remains the annoyance of death".
This is connected with the question of that longing, “who dreams that in the end everything may be well.”
Johanna Rahner, born 1962 in Baden-Baden, studied Catholic Theology and Biology at the Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg from 1982 to 1989.
In 1997 she received her doctorate as Dr. theol., also in Freiburg.
The Habilitation for Fundamental Theology and Ecumenical Theology followed in 2003 at the Westphalian Wilhelms University.
Since 2010, Johanna Rahner holds a Chair of Systematic Theology at the Institute of Catholic Theology at the University of Kassel.
More than 100 young Catholics from Kleines Heuberg reaffirm their creed at the Confirmation
In two services, 101 15- and 16-year-old youths of the pastoral care unit Am Kleinen Heuberg were confirmed.
In the morning the group Laudato-Si accompanied the service, in the afternoon the youth choir The Spirit.
With the reception of the Firm Sacrament, the young people said yes to their baptism and asked for the power of the Holy Spirit.
In the past months, the Confirmants, under the direction of deacon Reiner Dehner and with the help of numerous parishioners, had prepared themselves for the big feast day.
In various projects, they got to know different tasks of the Christian community life and together experienced the Youth Day in Untermachtal.
Illmensee: Second mountain bike race inspires participants
In beautiful weather, 214 cyclists came to Illmensee to complete the circuit across the hills around the lake.
This is what Ulrich Knobel from the sporting club Illmensee tells us.
Among the participants were, especially on the short distance over 15 kilometers and 300 meters of altitude, also numerous everybody cyclists, who wanted to practice their hobby once in competitive atmosphere.
Two German top junior drivers were also at the start of this competition: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came with the recommendation of good placements in the German Championships.
These two were able to move out of the field as expected.
As in the previous year, Felix Bader was able to save a small time advantage to the finish and defended his title as the overall winner of the short distance.
In second place, Pascal Treubel was able to place himself again.
For the ladies, it was Theresa Duelli from the team Nightmare who made it to the top of the winning podium.
In second and third places came Anne Adel from Illmensee and Leonie Treiber from Owingen.
A pleasing development is the increasing number of drivers who live or work in the community.
Not only in terms of performance, the entire spectrum of athletes was represented.
The age structure also ranged from ten years for the youngest to over 70 years for the oldest starters.
In the main race this year there were even more absolute top athletes at the start.
Four drivers were able to stand out from the regional top drivers.
Among them Philipp Pangerl, a mountain bike semi-professional from the Black Tusk racing team.
Pangerl and a teammate have already been World Champions in 12-hour driving twice.
This year he became European champion in this special discipline.
Including Roland Ballerstedt, who already owns two German championship titles in duathlon.
After 45 kilometers and 900 meters of altitude, there was a final lash in the finish line in front of the Three Lakes Hall.
Pangerl was the first to rush over the finish line.
Just a second later, the Routinier Ballerstedt was able to secure second place in the overall standings.
At the same time, Hermann and Warthmann finished third in the overall standings.
In the women's classification, Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest timer in the main race.
Areane Blersch from Binzwangen secured second place ahead of Natascha Werner from Stuttgart.
Athletes and helpers were very pleased with the smooth and well-organized course of the event.
On the way through mud, rivers and jungles for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle Brings Free Medical Assistance to Remote Villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend nearly every weekend treating hundreds of patients
In the West African country there are not many doctors, only one for 5,000 people
Vote here or with your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2013.
You can vote for him or one of the other heroes in the top 10 to vote for him as “CNN Hero of the Year”.
The winner will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his sick father lose consciousness over and over again and traveled to hospitals that did not have the means to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he only had a broken arm, but then an inflammation developed, which spread to his brain and caused a hematoma that would affect him for the rest of his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” said Georges Bwelle.
We would have brought him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years accompanying his father to crowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer.
"It's not easy," Bwelle comments.
You can leave the house at five in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first, and yet you are not the first.
There are many patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has hardly changed since Bwell's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.
In contrast, in the United States, the ratio is for a doctor for 413 people.
But even if there was a doctor for them, most Cameroonians could not afford the visit.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of the country’s healthcare spending is private.
“The only problem they have is poverty,” says Bwelle.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
Seeing his father and so many of his compatriots suffer in Bwelle made the decision to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team performed 700 free operations last year.
He became a doctor himself and works as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME, which travels to rural areas on weekends and provides free medical care there.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people force themselves into minibuses and drive with the strapped medical equipment on the roof over unpaved terrain to the villages that need help.
Not always everything goes smoothly.
More than once they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they are welcomed like heroes: a feast, singing and dancing and the best accommodation the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a reason to celebrate and wave – with its wide smiles and limitless energy – is happy to attend the cheerful celebration.
The next morning, the team will start examining hundreds of patients.
"We treat 500 people per trip," says Bwelle.
They come from a radius of 60 kilometers around the village – and that on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive crutches, donated glasses or free birth certificates – a document that is required for school but many poor families simply can’t afford.
In the evening, the team performs simple operations with local anesthesia.
The operations usually take place in a school, town hall or apartment; after the procedure, the patients get up and go to the recreation area to make room for the next one.
The lighting for the operation and the disinfection equipment is powered by the group’s generator and so Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early hours of the morning on Sunday.
It’s a strenuous pensum, but the village musicians usually help keep the team motivated.
“They’re drumming all night long so we can stay awake and continue our work,” says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team then drives back to the city, tired but proud of the work done.
The group – a mixture of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – performed 700 free surgeries last year and knows that their work makes a huge difference to the people they help.
One man explained that the free operation of a groin fracture he received now allows him to work again.
“This will change the future of my family,” the man said.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital, Bwelle also works at night in private clinics in Yaoundé.
With this second job, he finances 60% of his non-profit activity, according to Bwelle; the rest comes from private donations.
"I really don't know when he's sleeping," says Katie O'Malley, who is studying medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia in her second year and volunteers in Bwell's group.
He’s always either in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so he can go on these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O'Malley who come from the U.S. and Europe and support Bwelle, this is a chance to gain practical experience that they would never get at home.
“We can be there for surgeries where we can help dodge blood or hold the instruments for Dr. Bwelle,” O’Malley explains.
That would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.
Students usually pay for their trip to Cameroon themselves and often bring donated medical supplies.
But once they are in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes over the accommodation, transport and instruction.
"He's definitely a hero," O'Malley says.
He devotes his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroonian people knows no boundaries.
For Bwelle, the almost constant work is not a burden.
Helping others to live happier lives and thus fulfilling a promise he made to his father brings him great joy.
“I am so happy when I do this work,” says Bwelle.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I do.
I do it to make people laugh again and to relieve the pain.

Excellently mastered the fight
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway's novel "The Old Man and the Sea", is Horst Janson cut to the body.
Janson himself is an old rabbit in his profession, acting.
No one can fool the old man Santiago when he is fishing.
The two complement each other very well.
It is almost thought to be able to see the wrinkles in the neck of the old man, of which the fisherman Manolo speaks.
When Santiago sits in the chair, tired of life, Janson is real.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman is through and through a character role that Janson masters excellently.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a brave man who does not give up and ultimately wins the fight against the fish through his knowledge and willpower.
Janson is on stage as a solitary actor.
He manages to focus the attention of the audience on himself, so that his monologues are not boring for a moment.
His efforts to finally pull the fish to the surface of the water are so real that the spectators forget that the sea is only made of blue-lit water bottles.
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man act in the boat in front of the fishing village.
In the course of the performance, he highlights the active scene: the Santiago hut, the bar of the singer Marie-Luise Gunst, who sings the Cuban way of life with her songs and her magnificent voice.
The four musicians play Cuban rhythm and are also guests of the bar.
Tourism: Descent to the Romans
At about 120 meters in length, a sewage canal from the Roman period is preserved below Cologne.
Anyone who visits Cologne will not pass by the cathedral.
The two towers rise to the sky at around 157 metres, making it the second tallest church building in Europe.
But few visitors who admire the two filigree church towers know that there is a lot to discover under the cathedral.
Rainer Schulze is an expert in the underworld of Cologne.
The meeting point for its guided tours is the service center of Cologne-Tourismus directly at the cathedral.
The tour starts quite unspectacularly: "We start in the underground car park," says Schulze.
In the 1970s, the city fathers wanted a car-friendly city, and therefore of the remnants of the old city walls, only that which was not too large remained.
For this reason, most users of the car park today also rush past the Roman remains and only park their cars.
But those who take a closer look will discover an archaeological site separated by metal lattice bars in the parking deck D2.
You can see about five meters high ruins of hand-plate-sized stones.
"They are remnants of the Roman city walls, which were built in the second half of the first century after Christ," says Schulze.
Before it goes back to daylight, Schulze lets the participants on the upper park level take a look into a dark, 15 meter deep shaft.
This is the fountain of the old cathedral, which is unfortunately hardly noticed.
Next stop of the tour is the pretorium, and here the participants descend again into the depths.
Here we experience the headquarters of the once most powerful man north of the Alps, the pretor of the CCAA.
What CCAA means, a visitor wants to know.
"The abbreviation stands for "Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium", which in good German means as much as "city of Roman law and city of Agrippinenser, founded under Emperor Claudius at the site of the altar for the imperial cult".
And the pretorium is the former governor’s palace, the center of power of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.
From the entrance hall of the exhibition, a tunnel leads to the Roman sewage canal, which is here preserved over a length of about 120 meters.
"You can quietly walk along the so-called Cloaca Maxima if you want," Schulze cheers the guests up.
Schulze has a surprise.
After he gets the key at the checkout, he leads the group to a 16 meter deep, walkable shaft.
"We are now in the Mikveh, a ritual Jewish bath," he explains.
The Jewish community built their bath deep into the ground to get to the groundwater, which was essential for the ritual washes.
To this day, in the lower end of the Mikveh, whose origins date back to the eighth century, different water levels can be read by changing levels of the Rhine.
The Mikveh will be part of an archaeological zone on the Town Hall Square, for which construction work will begin shortly.
However, it will take a few more years to complete.
Leg almost chopped off: new edition of rocker process
A bloody attack in the rocker environment is re-rolled after more than four years.
A trial for attempted homicide, dangerous assault and property damage against two 30-year-olds has begun before the district court of Frankfurt (Oder).
It is accompanied by strict security precautions.
The defendants were silent at the start.
They are said to have been active in the rockers scene and then belonged to the bandidos.
The prosecution accuses them of stabbing and striking three men in a car in June 2009 together with unknown accomplices in Finowfurt.
All the victims were seriously injured, one man almost lost his leg.
The victims are said to have belonged to the competing Hells Angels group.
One is said to have been a high-ranking member from Berlin.
A chase with several cars was apparently preceded.
According to the indictment, it was about district fights and a power demonstration.
The two defendants were acquitted in a first trial in early 2012.
A court spokesman at the time said it could not be proved that the men were actually involved in the bloody feud.
The perpetrators had worn masks and had not been recognized.
The Federal Court of Justice annulled the ruling after the prosecutor’s revision and referred it back to the district court for retrial.
One of the defendants is currently in open custody for another offence.
At the start, it was mainly about the reconstruction of the processes in the Tatnacht.
As a witness, the investigating commissioner was charged.
At the center were cell phone calls of the defendants and other people, which the police had intercepted.
It is difficult that rockers in court almost always adhere to an iron law for them - and do not testify.
This also applies to the victims.
In the first trial, only one of the victims had unpacked.
Prosecutor Stefan Golfier from the Frankfurt (Oder) prosecutor’s office said on request that new traces had emerged since the last trial.
Eleven more days of negotiations are scheduled for the trial.
The Disposable Society Doesn't Think
The night was long, the music loud and the mood good, but eventually it goes home.
Only: In the bellies of the people on the passenger and rear seat, the hunger is noticeable.
Of course, some cocktails or sparkling wines may be responsible for this!
What could be closer than going chilled to the next drive-in to indulge in a little bit?
I admit, I like to be there when it is late at night or early in the morning to go to the fast food cave.
A few fries, a coke, a burger - and then nothing like going home and to bed!
But on the way home, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco gangers become noticeable.
Because what do you need to miss that you throw your fast food bags out of the car window with constant regularity?!
Especially on weekends, discarded paper bags lie on roadsides and on parking lots.
"Why?" I wonder.
Are people too deaf to take the bags home or to the next trash can?
It's not just that the paper stuff is messing up the landscape.
Bags have also already covered up traffic facilities such as guardrails and thus caused accidents.
But the said "disposable society" does not think about that, probably she does not even know what this word actually means.
If you are traveling more often in the evening, especially with several people in the car, you know what a rear bench can look like after nights of celebration: clothes, bottles and other garbage pile up there.
There a few bags would more or less mean nothing - in contrast to the street, where no one wants to trample on the food leftovers of others.
I already see the day coming when the cities and municipalities will be too stupid to clean up - and the fast food chains will have to demand a deposit for their bags.
Obama's withdrawal from health policy
After heavy criticism yesterday, President Obama made a withdrawal from his often repeated, unambiguous promise: “If you like your health insurance, you can keep it.”
After hundreds of thousands of their insurers received a notice of termination, the Republicans in recent days accused the president of deceiving the American public.
Yesterday, Obama relativized his original promise.
"The vast majority of citizens who have a working health insurance can keep it," he said at a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports on the resignations, Obama urged those Americans who received such communications to look for new insurance in the free market.
Most citizens could get better, more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or cheaper than predicted.
“You come up with a better offer,” he said.
The government described it as not surprising that the five percent of the population who have taken out insurance themselves would have to look for a different tariff because their contract did not meet the new standards under the Affordable Care Act.
"I want to say to these Americans directly: they deserve better," Sebelius said at a hearing before the Energy and Trade Committee of the House of Representatives in Washington.
Sebelius, who is responsible for implementing the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online platform had been "miserable" since October.
"I'm just as frustrated and angry as everyone else," she said.
I am determined to regain your trust.
This statement from an upset Sebelius to an advisor sitting behind her at yesterday’s hearing in the House of Representatives was taken after a dispute with Missouri Republican MP Billy Long about whether she should be obliged to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long Sebelius repeatedly questioned why the “architect” of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily waived state-sponsored insurance in order to purchase a tariff with HealthCare.gov, which she now wants to sell to millions of Americans.
Government in Jerusalem does not confirm attack on Syrian air base
An American government official who wanted to remain anonymous claimed Thursday to the American news channel CNN that Israeli fighter planes had attacked an air base in Syrian Latakia a day earlier.
The target was "missiles and associated equipment" that the Israeli government feared were intended for Lebanese Hezbollah, according to CNN.
Syrian and Lebanese media, as well as Arab broadcaster Al-Arabiya, had previously reported that the base in the port city of Latakia had been bombed on the night of Wednesday to Thursday, blaming the Israelis for it.
The Israeli television channel Channel 2 showed satellite images of the base in Latakia showing Russian S-125 Neva defense missiles and a battery of SA-3 missiles that, according to Channel 2, have a range of 35 kilometers and can carry warheads up to 70 kilograms.
Uncertain The government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack.
However, the Reuters news agency quotes an also anonymous Israeli government official saying that he believes that Israel carried out the attack, but is not certain.
In any case, a spokesman for the Israeli Defense Ministry said, “We are not commenting on these reports.”
Journalist Ron Ben-Yishai stressed in the daily Yedioth Ahronoth that the Syrian regime had earlier, in part successfully, attempted to deliver ground-to-air missiles to Hezbollah.
The Israeli government has repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons would mean crossing a “red line” that would be followed by a military response.
John Kerry says in an unprecedented admission that U.S. espionage has gone “unreasonably too far”
John Kerry, with an unexpected admission, hinted at a softening of the U.S.’s defensive stance on its surveillance programs, saying that espionage had gone “unreasonably too far in certain cases.”
The Secretary of State also admitted that he, along with Barack Obama, bears the responsibility for switching to “autopilot” when the explosive disclosures by whistleblower Edward Snowden about the NSA’s espionage activities became public.
Through the leaked information, the U.S. government has fallen into a diplomatic storm of indignation on the part of its allies.
In a video-recorded speech at the Open Government conference in London, Kerry said: “Without a doubt, the President and I, as well as others in the government, have learned of some things that were almost autopiloted simply because of the ability to do so, which dates back to the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War, as well as, of course, to 9/11.”
He was the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that espionage had crossed a border, but also stressed that no rights had been abused.
He said, “In some cases, this has gone too far inappropriately.”
The President is determined to clarify and therefore conducts a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that abuse is taking place here.
I assure you that the rights of innocent people in this process will not be compromised.
Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force of good and that many lives had been saved through its surveillance operations.
He added: “We are dealing with a new world where people are ready to blow themselves up.”
There is radical extremism in the world that is obsessed with killing people, blowing up and attacking governments.
So what if you were able to intercept and stop it before it happens?
We have actually prevented plane crashes, attacks on buildings and the killing of people because we have learned of such plans in advance.
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers will travel to Europe to dispel concerns about alleged U.S. espionage and convince Europeans of the need to continue working with the U.S. on anti-terrorism efforts, the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said he spoke with European Parliament representatives and others this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terror organizations due to frustration over surveillance by the National Security Agency.
"It is very important for the national security interests of the United States that Europeans remain on board in view of our joint efforts against terrorism," Murphy, who sits in the Senate for the first time as a Democrat and serves as chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs, said in an interview in Washington.
I am also going to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their anger about the NSA programs.
Media reports that the NSA has captured millions of telephone data in Europe have burdened relations with some U.S. allies, although the head of the intelligence agency this week said the reports were inaccurate and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States.
Other revelations cited from documents passed by Snowden, according to which the NSA had monitored the cell phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide.
National intelligence chief James Clapper defended espionage among allies as necessary, declaring that it was common practice on both sides.
In all the turmoil, Murphy said his agency was preparing the Congressional trip to take place this year, hoping the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers.
The names of the other MEPs will be published in the coming days.
He said the exact itinerary is still being worked out.
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the trip was to improve relationships, he also said there would be some "serious words."
He said European governments need to be honest with their people about the kind of espionage programs they have been using for years.
"While we can change our surveillance programs and thus better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also accept the fact that we are not the only ones spying on them," Murphy said.
Meanwhile, John Kerry is on a weekend trip to the Middle East and Poland to deal with the resentment about the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as US surveillance activities.
A persistent injury to the ankle threatens to prevent the use of Nicolai Müller in the Bundesliga away game of the FSV Mainz 05 at FC Augsburg.
Mainz is struggling with a deployment by Nicolai Müller.
Tomorrow he will try to train with the team.
So far, he has only been able to do this individually.
"We will decide on his deployment in the short term," said coach Thomas Tuchel.
The 40-year-old hopes to have his best goalkeeper with six goals.
The Mainzers already have to do without the injured performers Niki Zimling, Julian Baumgartlinger and Niko Bungert.
Australian appeals for imprisonment in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, who was sentenced to 15 days in jail in Phuket for falsely claiming to have been raped by a taxi driver, appealed the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first found guilty by a provincial court in Phuket on June 15 of making a false statement after she told Thai police that a local taxi driver raped her in the morning hours on Sunday, June 10, while two other men detained her.
Later, however, the footage of a video camera showed that she had safely entered her hotel after being separated from her Australian friend.
The police in Phuket interrogated Bamford for two days until she confessed to having invented the story.
Until the trial, she was in police custody.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in a low-security detention centre on the outskirts of Phuket, instead of a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former player of the Australian Rubgy League, who has turned to the Canberra State Department for help for his daughter.
Tunks told the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was “extremely concerned” about his daughter’s well-being and wanted her back to Australia.
"Of course, we are very worried, but we hope she will be back home as soon as possible," Tunks said.
Bamford has appealed the verdict and is free against a bail of 50,000 baht.
In Australian reports it was read that she is in the meantime on vacation in the resort of Krabi in southern Thailand.
The court heard that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and had been warned that the appeal could also lead to a higher sentence of up to two years in a prison for adults.
However, it is also possible that Thailand, following the recent assassination of travel merchant Michelle Smith in Phuket, may be striving to improve its distressed tourist image, and therefore an acquittal will be given.
