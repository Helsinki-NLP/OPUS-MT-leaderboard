This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widespread, but also provides details that fossils in general cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that this animal's plumage on the top was chestnut-brown and on the bottom light or carotenoid-colored.
The finding also provides insights into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft called rachis, but have other features of feathers – barbels and barbules – the researchers concluded that the rachis was presumably a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flying, but rather for temperature regulation or heart control. The researchers suspected that the sample, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, shows the plumage of an adult and not the down of a chick.
The researchers claimed that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows the plumage of an adult and no chick downs.
A car bomb detonated yesterday morning at the Turkish Gaziantep police headquarters, killing two police officers and wounding over twenty more people.

They have found that the Sun works on the same basic principles as other stars: It has been found that the activity of all stars in the system is driven by their luminosity, rotation, and nothing else.
In order to determine the Rossby number of a star related to the plasma current, the luminosity and rotation are included together.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of polarity reversals of the magnetic field.

The work was largely theoretical in nature, but the program was written to simulate observations made by the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon attracts the Earth and causes the tides, the Milky Way also exerts attraction to the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists concluded that dark matter acts on other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
This theory states that most of the dark matter is in a kind of halo around a galaxy and is made up of many small particles.

Extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) was discovered by Dr. Tony Moll in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
In an interview, he said the new variant was “extremely disturbing and alarming due to the very high mortality rate.”
Some patients may have been infected with the pathogen in the hospital, says Dr. Moll, and at least two were medical hospital workers.
Within a year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts.
Nevertheless, the proportion of XDR-TB in the entire group of people with tuberculosis is apparently low; 6,000 of the total 330,000 people infected in South Africa at a given time.

They are colder during the day than the surrounding surface and warmer at night.
"Their thermal behavior is not as uniform as that of large caves on Earth, which often have a fairly constant temperature, but it is consistent that they are deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a cabin and put a pre-printed sheet of paper on which the candidate of their choice is registered in an envelope.
After the officials have confirmed the identity of the voter, the voter throws the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter list.
The French electoral law sets the procedure quite strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can testify that no envelopes exist at the beginning of the election and that no envelopes are thrown, except those of duly counted and authorized voters.
The candidates can send representatives who attend each part of the process as witnesses. In the evening, the votes of volunteers are counted under strict supervision and according to special procedures.

Her other race, the giant slalom, ended with 10th place in the women's group with a combined run of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-placed Austrian Claudia Lösch and 1:09.02 minutes faster than Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary, who finished ninth.
Four women skiers of crutches skiing did not reach the finish, and 45 of the total of 117 women skiers in the giant slalom could not place themselves in the race.
Madhya Pradesh police have recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya said: “We arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and secured her cell phone and laptop.”
The names of the defendants are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanja, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the defendants had appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were in the house when the car crashed in, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road on which the accident occurred was temporarily closed, while the emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
As a result, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
In the meantime, Adekoya has been charged with murdering her son before the Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She is in custody until the indictment and trial, but statements by eyewitnesses may have been falsified, as her picture has been widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish judiciary works differently, and the courts have deemed the publication of photos to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes: “Journalists seem to be crossing a dangerous line when they post photos, etc., of suspects.”
The Crown Office, which is leading the law enforcement, has indicated to journalists that no further comments will be made at least until the indictment.
According to the leak, the document refers to the border dispute in which the Palestinians are calling for a reset of the borders to the state prior to the 1967 Six-Day War.
Other issues allegedly covered include the future of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a military presence in the Jordan Valley for ten years from the signing of the agreement, while the Palestinian Authority only wants to accept such a presence for five years.
The shooters of the concomitant pest control trial should be closely monitored by rangers, since the trial was monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
As part of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited as part of the Sporting Shooters Association hunting program.
According to Mick O’Flynn, managing director of Park Conservation and Heritage at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first hunting operation received comprehensive safety and training lessons.
Martelly has sworn in a new Provisional Election Commission (CEP) with nine members.
It is Martelly’s fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of the package of measures to steer the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly’s response to the widespread regime-critical protests that began in October.
The trigger for the partly violent protests was the failure to hold elections, some of which have been pending since 2011.
Over 60 cases of overheating have been reported on broken iPods, triggering a total of six fires and four people suffering minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Commerce and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents related to the equipment.
“Last week, the METI announced that it had been notified by Apple of 34 more incidents of overheating, which the company described as ‘non-serious’.”
The ministry responded by calling Apple’s postponement of the report “really regrettable.”
The earthquake shook Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Civil Protection Office said no damage was reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no evidence of a tsunami.
A former Philippine policeman took Hong Kong tourists hostage by kidnapping their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot at tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued and there have been at least six confirmed deaths so far.
Six hostages, including the children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Philippine photographers.
The photographers took the place of an elderly lady when she had to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father’s footsteps and started a medical career.
He trained as a maternity doctor and began work at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working in the hospital, Liggins began investigating premature labor in his spare time.
His research showed that the application of a hormone accelerated the lung maturation of the fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two “black box” flight recorders on Wednesday.
Ringer colleagues also paid tribute to Luna.
"Tommy Dreamer said, ""Luna was the first queen of extremes. My first manager. Luna died on the night of the two moons. Very unique, just like her. A strong woman."""
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented: "Luna was just as crazy as I was ... maybe even more crazy ... I love her and will miss her ... hopefully she's in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal elections, the proportion of those who opposed Australia’s becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, Prime Minister Julia Gillard declared that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II’s reign.
34% of respondents share this view and want Elizabeth II to be the last Australian monarch.
29% of respondents said Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% said Australia should never become a republic.
The gold medalist at the Olympics was supposed to swim in the 100 m and 200 m freestyle and in three layer squads at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his many complaints, his fitness was questioned.
He was unable to take the medications needed to overcome his pain, as they were banned at the Commonwealth Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Numerous people confirmed the discovery using different hardware and software at the beginning of February and on Tuesday it was announced.
Comets may have been a source of Earth’s water supply, along with organic matter that can form proteins and enable life.
Since comets collided with Earth a long time ago, the scientists promise insights into how planets, especially Earth, are formed.
Cuomo, 53, joined his governorship earlier this year and signed a bill to legalize same-sex marriage last month.
He described the rumors as “political gossip and sillyness.”
It is speculated that he could apply for the office of president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would allow aircraft to fly shorter distances and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of the older ground-based radar technology to enable air traffic controllers to more accurately locate aircraft and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional means of transport will be set up and the above-ground trains will not stop in Wembley. No parking or park-and-ride facilities are available on site.
With concerns about the lack of transport options, the likelihood that the game would have to be played without the fans of the team behind closed doors grew.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the emergence of a new bird species in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species developed within just two generations, although previously it was assumed that this process took much longer due to mating between a native Darwin finch, Geospiza forte, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into a variety of shapes. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be pulled into a thin wire that can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and glued to other metals, and can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted paintings, called picture manuscripts, in books called picture manuscripts.
This is called the PH value of a chemical. You can make an indicator with red cabbage juice.
The cabbage juice changes its color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the tested chemicals.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which their electrons have been deprived (because hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then shape them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels weird and forms a kind of protective layer.
The towns of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet in almost every house connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems were found in the houses of the Minoan towns of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Also in ancient Egypt, Persia and China there were toilets. In Roman culture, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses that visited men and women in mixed society.
If you call someone who is thousands of miles away, then use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then almost immediately reflects it back down.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth’s atmosphere distorts our light and our vision.
It takes a giant rocket with a height of more than 100 feet to shoot a satellite or a telescope into space.
The bike has changed the world in an incredible way. The greatest service the bike has provided us is much easier and faster transport.
It has brought us the railway, the car and many other means of transport.
Among them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-roaming domestic cats) that eat far smaller prey animals such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of the niche, a special task that every cat has and that ensures that they do not compete with others.
Lions are the most social cats. They live in large groups called packs.
The packs consist of one to three related adult males as well as up to thirty females and young.
Women usually have a close relationship with each other when living in a large family with sisters and daughters.
Lion packs act similarly to wolf or dog packs, animals that are surprisingly similar to the lions (but not other big cats) in behavior and are equally deadly to their prey.
As a versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (though not particularly good), swim, jump large distances, and pull with the five-fold power of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger does not sound like the full-bodied roar of the lion, but rather like a set of grunting roaring words.
Ocelots eat small animals. If they can, they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all the animals the ocelot hunts are considerably smaller than himself.
Scientists think that Ozelotes track and track animals for eating (prey) with their sense of smell, sniffing out where they have been on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision and move unnoticed. Ozelots chase their prey by visually aligning themselves to their surroundings and then throw themselves on their prey.
If a small group of living creatures (a small population) is separated from the main population from which they originate (for example, if they move across a mountain range or river, or if they relocate to a new island so that they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and other competitors, so the new population needs different characteristics or adjustments to be a strong competitor than what it used to be.
The original population has not changed at all. It still needs the same adjustments as before.
Over time, the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, and then it looks less and less like the other population.
After thousands or even millions of years, two populations then look so different that they can no longer be assigned to the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the emergence of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants generate oxygen that humans inhale, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans emit (that is, exhale).
Plants produce their food through the sun through photosynthesis and also give shade.
We build our homes from plants and make clothes from plants. We feed mainly on plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the largest predator of his time, so he was afraid of nothing but other Mosasaurians.
His long jaws were equipped with more than 70 knife-sharp teeth, plus another set on the palate, which meant that there was no escape for any animal that crossed his path.
We don't know for sure, but he might have had a forked tongue, feeding on turtles, big fish, other Mosaic species, and maybe even a cannibal.
He also attacked everything that came into the water; even a great dinosaur like the T. Rex was not up to him.
While most of their food may be known to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual festive meals, including wild boar, peacock, snails and a kind of rodent called Seven Sleepers.
Another difference was that the poor people and the women ate their food sitting on chairs, while the rich men preferred to have banquets together where they would lie on their side while eating their meals.
Ancient Rome dishes could not contain foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman has ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered to be the house of God.
Sacrifices were offered to the gods, and the priests tried by ceremonies and festivals to conform to the will of the gods.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner altar room, which could only be accessed by priests.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called Zikkurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for God.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses were not given such great significance.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family took place in the open air.
The women cooked in the yard. Shops simply consisted of shop counters open to the street. Stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Old Norse legends it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder. As he traveled further west, he found Greenland and gave it the name Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes already lived there at that time.
Although all countries were “Scandinavian”, there were many differences between people, kings, customs, and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie "The Legacy of the Templars," you may think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the reverse of the Declaration of Independence were written the words "original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The text is headed upside down at the bottom of the document.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that the large parchment document (measuring 293<0xE2><0x81><0x84>4 inches x 241<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 inches) was rolled up at the beginning of his life for storage.
It is therefore possible that the note was simply added as a marking.
The landing on D-Day and the subsequent battles have liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
"He was ruled by the 'Vichy' French, who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the conquerors instead of fighting them."
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France; the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
After just two weeks, the Americans and the French liberation forces had liberated the south of France and turned towards Germany.
A civilization is an independent culture shared by a significantly large group of people living and working together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civis, which means citizens, and civitas, which means city or city-state, which also somehow defines the size of a society.
Cities-states are the forerunners of nations. A civilized culture implies the passing on of knowledge across several generations, a sustained cultural footprint and appropriate dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and failing to be recognized as real civilizations.
During the revolutionary struggles, the 13 states first formed a weak central government, consisting only of Congress, based on the federal treaty.
Congress was not authorized to levy taxes, and since there was neither a national executive nor a national judiciary, it relied on the authorities of the states, who often did not cooperate, in enforcing all of its laws.
He also had no power to override tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles required the unanimous approval of all states before they could be changed, and the states took the central government so little seriously that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful in the world and was FIFA World Champion in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1 motorsport.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions and Italians take part in international competitions and Olympic games.
Japan has approximately 7,000 islands (of which Honshu is the largest), making Japan the seventh largest island in the world.
"Due to the cluster/group of islands Japan became, Japan is often geographically referred to as "archipelago".
The beginning of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors passed by and documented the name of the island as Ilha Formosa or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a branch in southwestern Taiwan, thereby initiating a change in the cereal cultivation methods of the Native Americans and employing Chinese workers on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty forces (1644-1912) took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal regions and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the first Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the government of the Qing Dynasty signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which it surrendered sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists mainly of three structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Sun Temple and the room of the three windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex were rebuilt to give tourists a better impression of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was restored, and the restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the world’s most widely used still image format is 35 mm, which corresponds to the prevailing film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still manufactured today, but more importantly, its image format was adopted by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
In fact, the so-called 35-mm format confusingly measures 36 mm in width and 24 mm in height.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is therefore referred to as 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS format family, for example) have exactly the same or very similar aspect ratio.
The much smeared and often ridiculed third rule is a simple guideline that creates dynamics while maintaining a level of order in an image.
It states that the intersection of the lines that form a vertical and horizontal third of an image is the most effective place for the main motif (see example).
In this period of European history, the rich and powerful Catholic Church was put to the test.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion had kept the European states together despite different languages and customs.
His omnipotence ruled everyone, from the king to the simple citizen.
One of the important Christian beliefs is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the funds of the churches exist for this very reason.
The central authority of the Church has been in Rome for more than a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to doubt whether this principle was complied with.
Soon after the outbreak of combat, Britain initiated a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved to be effective as it cut off the country from vital military and civilian supplies, even though this blockade violated universally recognized international law, which had been codified by several international agreements over the last two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from penetrating into entire sections of the sea, which posed a threat even to neutral ships.
Since the response to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, pacifism and isolation were the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and countries.
After the experience of the horrors and atrocities in the First World War, the nations wanted to avoid another such situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to join the Edison Company in New York City.
He came to the United States with 4 cents in his possession, a book of poems and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his superior at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of indicating different eras. Each period of time in China and each family that was in power was a dynasty of its own.
The most famous of these periods was the period of the Three Kingdoms, which took place for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In those times fierce wars raged among many nobles who fought for the throne.
The time of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died in the battle for the highest throne in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are a lot of social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a turning away from absolutism to republicanism and nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a ruler alone.
Even after the revolution, all occupations were open to all male candidates, so that the most ambitious and best could succeed.
The same applies to the military, because instead of class membership, the army rankings were now based on the caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed workers in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mohammad was very interested in things that went beyond this everyday life and often visited a cave known as “Hira” on the mountain of “Only” (Light) to meditate.
The cave itself has survived the times and offers a vivid picture of Muhammad’s spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it’s not easy to find it, even if you know it exists. Once you’re in the cave, you’re completely isolated.
You can see nothing but the clear, beautiful sky above it and the numerous surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from the inside of the cave.
The Cheops pyramid is the only one of the seven wonders of the world still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Cheops Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built to worship deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau or "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead includes several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Cheops and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in honor of Cheops' wives and family members.
The "Scatter" symbol looks like a V and the "Scatter" symbol looks like a bracket or square where the bottom line is missing.
Up means you start at the top and push the bow, down means you start with the frog (this is where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
Painting up usually generates a softer sound, while painting down is more powerful and expressive.
You are welcome to add your own pencil markings, but keep in mind that the printed sheet markings are there for musical reasons, which is why they should normally be respected.
The panicked King Louis XIV, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two small children (Marie-Therese and Louis-Charles) and the king's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced to return to Paris on 6 October 1789 in Versailles by a mob of market women.
They travelled back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a screaming mob of people who were threatening the king and queen.
The mob forced the king and queen to open wide the windows of their carriages.
At some point, a member of the angry crowd waved the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles in front of the horrified queen.
The war expenses of the U.S. imperialists in conquering the Philippines were borne by the Philippine people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover the bulk of spending, and interest on bonds flowed through Wall Street banks on behalf of the Philippine government.
Of course, the superprofits derived from the ongoing exploitation of the Philippine people represented the fundamental gains of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the founding of the Order.
The epoch in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, an era in European history that spans the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The early Middle Ages preceded the High Middle Ages, followed by the late Middle Ages, which coincidentally ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide spectrum of ideas in practice, from technology push or technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is determined by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general notions: on the one hand, that the development of technology itself follows a path that is largely beyond cultural or political influence, and on the other hand, that technology, in turn, has "impacts" on societies that are more inherent than socially conditioned.
One can say, for example, that the passenger car inevitably involves the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for only a small number of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The widespread automobile ownership also leads to a higher number of road accidents, which in turn leads to the invention of new healthcare techniques for repairing damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a strong, culturally deterministic element, derived from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of romance, it is the geography that shaped individuals. Over time customs and cultures related to this geography emerged and these, since they were in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily octroyed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of today’s world, Constantinople was regarded as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as an epicentre of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Its status declined over the course of the twelfth century, mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders had returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were considered more valuable than the offering of the Byzantine markets.
At that time, the title of fashion capital of the world also migrated from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th-11th and the 14th centuries.
At the beginning, the clothing was strongly influenced by the culture of Byzantium in the east.
However, the styles in the West are 25 to 30 years behind due to the slow communication channels.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe slowly began to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the time was that as a result of the crusades, people began to use buttons to fix clothes.
Demand economy is agriculture, which aims to produce just so many foodstuffs that it meets the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic type of cultivation that uses stored seeds native to the ecoregion and combines with alternating field farming or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
In the past, most farmers operated subsistence farming and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected by social norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may differ from others in terms of age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as such can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual or geographical, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their affiliation through a distinctive and symbolic style, which includes fashion, habits and jargon.
One of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to rely on the few unfortunate cases of children who have not been socialized by adults due to neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse during their childhood.
"Such children are called ""wild"" or wild. Some wild children were held captive by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, the child's neglect was due to the parents' inability to accept the child's significant intellectual or physical limitations."
Wolf children may have experienced massive child abuse or traumatic experiences before being exposed or running away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wilderness.
When raised entirely by animals, the wild child exhibits behaviors (within the scope of his physical capabilities) that are almost completely in line with those of his specific caring animal, such as his fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning, but rather an aid that supports individuals in a new learning situation, such as when using a new computer program or when starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but also the little paper clip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual assistance is built into the software and is intended to question, suggest and explain work steps that the student may not be able to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster families for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and extortion.
No child should be forced to grow up in an environment that is not caring, loving and educational, but many are forced to.
For us, the system of nursing accommodation is a piece of safety for these children.
Our nursing family system is designed to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
The nursing home should cover all the needs that they did not receive in the home from which they were previously taken out.
The Internet connects elements of mass communication as well as interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of the benefit and reward approach.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are cited as important motivations for internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal engagement" and "persistent relationships" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they examined audience responses on websites.
The use of video recordings led to important insights for the interpretation of microexpressions, a few milliseconds of facial movements.
In particular, it is claimed that you can recognize if someone is lying by correctly interpreting minimal changes in facial expression.x
In his article The President’s Speech, Oliver Sacks showed how people who can no longer understand language because of brain damage can still correctly assess people’s honesty.
He even claims that the skills to interpret human behavior may be shared with animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variations: hidden and expressed.
Mutation creates new genetic variations and selection removes them from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools with each generation.
Outside in the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system such as human to meet his need for amino acid from available plant sources.
Furthermore, it has serious consequences if you do not: growth depression, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most readily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal food sources (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide large amounts of proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
Overall, it should not surprise us if our own ancestors have solved their “protein problem” in the same way as the chimpanzees in the savannah today.
Sleep interruption is the process of targeted awakening during normal sleep periods and falling asleep shortly (10-60 minutes) later.
This can be easily achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to awareness without fully awakening you.
If you are someone who introduces the alarm clock in sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room so that you are forced to leave the bed to turn it off.
Another biorhythm-based option is to drink a lot of fluid before bed (especially water or tea, which is known for its diuretic effect) so that you are forced to stand up to urinate.
The level of inner calm that a person possesses correlates in reverse with the level of tension in body and mind.
The less the tension, the more positive the life force that exists. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been extended to include the path of love of Mahayana and numerous techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, consisting of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of all-encompassing love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
Through the visualization of different deities, the energy channels are purified, the chakras are opened and the enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. After the war, the collision of the systems, the course and the culture led to the countries becoming hostile.
Two years after the end of the war, the former Allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It should last for the next 40 years and in reality be carried out by deputy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already collapsed completely and the only hope was a retreat and a rearrangement along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight when over 800,000 Red Army soldiers of the Soviet Union invaded and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient method of transporting large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The task of the Navy has traditionally been to ensure that a country remains capable of transporting people and goods, while at the same time hindering the enemy’s ability to transport people and goods.
One of the most significant recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign during World War II, when the Americans tried to bring workforce and material across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop this traffic mainly by submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain just like the rest of Europe.
Goats were apparently domesticated in the Z<0xC4><0x81>gros Mountains in Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to hold them as livestock to easily get their milk, fur, meat and skin.
House goats were usually kept in herds that wandered on hills or other pastures. The goats were cared for by goat herders, much like the more famous sheep herders; often they were children or adolescents. These pasture methods are still used today.
As early as the 16th century, conveyor tracks were built in England.
Although the conveyor tracks consisted only of parallel wooden boards, they allowed the horses that pulled the wagons to reach higher speeds and to pull larger loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of the time.
Thresholds were introduced quite early in order to secure the position of the rails, but gradually the realization that rails that carry a band of iron are more efficient prevailed.
This became common, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first fully iron rails were introduced.
The first known mode of locomotion was walking. Man began to walk upright two million years ago with the advent of Homo Erectus (meaning “upright man”).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not go up so regularly.
Bifocal species are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have been on two legs seven million years ago.
We can live more environmentally friendly lives, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to ease future suffering a little bit.
In many cases, this is just a symptomatic treatment, but if you don’t want only temporary solutions, then we should find and treat the root of the problem.
It is really obvious that the world has changed greatly due to the scientific and technological advances of humanity and that the problems have become more serious due to overpopulation and the extravagant way of life of people.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's print shop.
Over the course of the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the Independence Hall courtyard on July 8.
One was sent on July 6 to George Washington, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9, and a copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broad pages that still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript has not survived the times.
Many paleontologists nowadays believe that there is a group of dinosaurs that survived and still live today. We call them birds.
Many do not see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But many things about birds still look like a dinosaur.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and run on both hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on the processing of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary numbers - or bits to use the computer jargon.
The symptoms, such as vomiting, are so common that it is not possible to diagnose them immediately.
The best sign of intoxication by swallowing may be the presence of an open container of drugs or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for this particular poison.
The term "wanz" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term derives from the ancient familiarity with bed bugs, which are insects that are very adaptable in parasitizing humans.
Both predators and bedbugs are nidicol, i.e. adapted to live in the nest or the housing of their hosts.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in adults younger and middle-aged.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is composed of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that raising a baby is not in their own interest or in the interest of their child.
These couples can opt for an adoption plan for their baby.
In the event of an adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can take over the parental responsibility.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works with the help of the scientific method. This method is, in fact, the basis of most scientific research.
However, it is not just about experimentation, where an experiment is a test that serves to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses. Scientific research is also guided by asking questions and performing observations.
Scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all science issues, including psychology, were acknowledged.
With the loss of Greek language skills, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greece.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are often largely based on the presence of the body's own cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Cycle-specific behaviors, which are not only reactions to signs of outer cycles, are known to most living creatures, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that perform free-swinging cycles for a while, even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey Chase experiment was one of the authoritative indications that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to build their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments in which they either marked the phage's DNA with radioactive phosphorus or a protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of effects depending on what type of mutation is involved, the importance of the genetic material in question, and whether the cells in question are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
Close-up tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including wild plants and animals.
Examples of local activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and learning information about the ecosystem.
An example of this is visiting, photographing and studying orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small provincial towns by car to drive to their workplace and are passed by others whose workplace is in the place they just left.
In this dynamic commuter traffic, all are connected in some way to a transport system based on the private car and support it.
Science now points out that this massive carbon economy has brought out the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human evolution over the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about the transport systems.x
In developed countries, you will rarely hear similar complaints about the water quality or the collapse of bridges.
Why do transport systems lead to such abuses, why do they fail every day? Are traffic engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental going on here?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between the two.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flows is difficult, because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to be fairly consistent; therefore, traffic flows have some consistency and can be mathematically roughly represented.
In order to better represent the flow of traffic, the relationships between the three main properties were defined: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of facilities on the roadway.
Insects were the first animals to conquer the sky. Their ability to fly helped them avoid enemies more easily and find food and sex partners more efficiently.
Most insects can fold their wings back along their body.
As a result, they have a wider range of small shelters where they can hide from predators.
Today, dragonflies and day flies are the only insects that cannot fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the sun was at the center of the movements of the solar system.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system, including the sun (and even the other stars), is moving around the earth.
This seems reasonable, since it doesn’t seem like the earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon is the second-longest and the richest river in water in the world and runs more than eight times as much water as the second-largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, sometimes up to six miles wide.
A total of 20 percent of the water flowing into the oceans via the planet’s rivers comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon’s main stream is 6387 km (3980 miles) long and absorbs water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Empire, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and the technical perfection of their construction.
Egyptians in the Ancient New Empire admired the monuments of their ancestors, which were then well over a thousand years old.
The Vatican City has about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian for its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language of most who work in the state, while Latin is commonly used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper have been known to humans since antiquity, as they can all be found in their original form in nature and mined with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, put forward the theory that all things consist of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
This corresponded more to the four states of aggregate (in the same order): fixed, liquid, gas and plasma, but he also proposed the theory that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also other metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of nonmetallic elements such as carbon.
The universe is made up of matter in its entirety. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so tiny that trillions of them would fit into the point at the end of this sentence.
As a result, the pencil became a good friend to many people after its invention.
Unfortunately, the pencil has fallen into the background with the advent of newer writing methods, so it has been pushed back in its status and in its use.
Nowadays, people write messages on computer screens without ever having to get close to a sharpener.
You can be curious about what will become of the keyboard when something new comes along.
The atomic bomb is based on the principle that you need energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like rolling a heavy car up a hill, and if the core is split again, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they decay with little or no impact.
The surface of the moon is made up of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called a crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the nearby side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the mare and thicker under the highlands.
On the near side, there could be more Maria, as the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what moves or appeals to people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that will be internalized as they grow up.
These theories deal with what causes certain people to want exactly the things they do, and what influences in their surroundings cause them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's theory of need hierarchy and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, two behaviors can emerge as managers begin to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is trying to remain “one of the guys” (or one of the girls).
This type of manager has trouble making unpopular decisions, conducting disciplinary actions, performing performance assessments, assigning responsibilities, and taking employees into duty.
At the other end of the spectrum, you’re transformed into an unrecognizable individual who has to do everything differently than the team did and make everything their own.
Ultimately, the team leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are run to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often have the function of a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams can meet in different time zones that may not be taken into account by the local management.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p. 109) is also a unique part of a virtual team.
"The ""Invisible Team"" is the management team to which each of the members reports. The invisible team sets the benchmark for each member.x"
Why would an organization take on the time-consuming process of introducing a learning organization? One goal for the practical implementation of organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively used across all departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, the collaborative work of an organization on overcoming an obstacle can lead to a new innovative method of responding to customer needs.
Before an organization can innovate, leadership must develop a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum concept as a method to help organizations become more powerful.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to researching cognition, thus limiting the field of research and making it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, such as trauma, injuries and tumors, affect behavior and cause changes in some brain functions.
New emerging technologies allow us to see and explore certain brain structures and processes for the first time.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
While strongly associated with science fiction, AI is an important branch of computer science that deals with machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
Research in AI involves manufacturing machines for automating tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, setting up strategies and schedules, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice and face recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines that focus on finding solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now widely used in the fields of business, medicine, engineering and military and has also been built into numerous software applications for home computers and video games.
Excursions are an important part of every school class and it is not uncommon for a teacher to take her pupils to places where a bus trip is not possible.
Virtual excursions are a technical solution. Students can view museum pieces from the classroom, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art.
Sharing an excursion virtually is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website each year about their trip to the state capital. The website is rebuilt every year, but the previous versions remain online and serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students’ writing skills. While students often have sloppy grammar and spelling at the beginning of their blog experience, that usually changes when there is an audience.
Since students are often a very critical audience, the blog writer makes an effort to improve his writing style to avoid criticism.
Blogging also “forces students to learn more about the world around them”, and the need to attract the interest of the audience inspires students to write smartly and interestingly (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires cooperation and encourages students to continue learning far beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "can enable students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of others' texts and express their own perspectives on specific topics" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada’s charming, bilingual capital and features a number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada’s past and present.
Further south are the Niagara Falls, and to the north the unspoilt beauty of nature spreads in Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and more characterize Ontario as what is considered typical Canadian by outsiders.
Large areas further north are rather sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that surprises many: there are more African Americans living in the U.S. than Canada has citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and, as far as the wildlife is concerned, a continent of its own.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or belonging to France and known as luxurious seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam into the country, and it was very successful in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese sailor Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers claim to be married regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring is also helpful (only one that looks too expensive.
Women should realize that cultural differences can lead to what they would consider an assault, and that it is not uncommon to be pursued, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Stay consistent when you reject men, and don’t be afraid to defend your point of view (cultural differences either way; that doesn’t mean it’s okay!)
Today’s Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century before the beginning of the era and was used by the Phoenicians, the Romans and the Merinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Dar el Beida and it was called Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the most uninteresting places to shop in Morocco.
Around the ancient medina, it is easy to find places where traditional Moroccan goods such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and a whole spectrum of Tinnef are sold, but that’s all just for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist town of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the extreme east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, any stay outside of Goma should be carefully planned in order to know the state of the fighting that continues in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also the starting point for the ascent of the Nyiragongo volcano as well as for some of the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking tours in Africa.
You can use Bodabodas (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The usual (local) price is <0x7E>500 Congolese Francs for the short trip.x
This, combined with its relative inaccessibility, has made "Timbuktu" a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Although Timbuktu is considered a tourist attraction due to its reputation and has an airport, it is nowadays an impoverished city.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage Sites due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the most important stations of Louis Gates PBS special "Wonders of the African World".
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country’s cities because it has an Arabic rather than an African flair.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which supports a different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered to be the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, the park charges daily protection and admission fees.
It may also be worthwhile to purchase a wild card that grants access to either selected parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island is the name given to the Hong Kong Territory and is the focus of many tourists.
The buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline were compared to a dazzling bar chart, visible by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.x
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the opposite shore of Kowloon.
The bulk of Hong Kong Island’s urban development is densely crowded on newly gained land along the north coast.
If you are looking for traces of the colonial past of the area, this is a good starting point.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove belt in the world and stretch over 80 km from the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterlands to the coast.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the part of the forest that lies within the Indian state is called the Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not just mangrove marshes – they also include some of the last remaining remnants of the mighty jungle that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which a third is covered by water and marshes.
The Sundarbans have been a nature reserve since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal royal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart all day from the cross-district bus station (on the other side of the river), with most buses, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang, departing between 06:30 and 07:30.
As buses between the districts are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are driven by small Japanese coaster buses that are cozy and stable.x
Collectible taxis provide a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is an inclined rope bridge that spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Its two towers are 83 meters high, its length is 378 meters and it has two lanes with a width of 3.50 meters.
The construction work was completed in August 2011, but it was not approved for traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017 and the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group inhabiting today’s eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also ran subsistence farms.
The Chaco region was also home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived by hunting, collecting and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called the Great Province of the West Indies, originated in the 16th century as a result of the encounter of the Spanish conquerors with the indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the colonization period, which lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for its polo team and players are among the best in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on Las Cañitas polo fields.
Smaller tournaments and competitions can also be watched here at other times of the year.x
For information on competitions and points of sale for polo match tickets, visit the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), the value of which is determined in accordance with the value of the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged in the only bank on the island, which is located in Stanley opposite the FIC West Store.
The British pound is generally accepted throughout the islands and with Stanley credit cards. US dollars are also often accepted.
In the remote islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, but UK and U.S. currencies can be accepted; check with the owners in advance to find out which payment method is accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange the currency of the Falkland Islands outside of the islands themselves, so you should exchange the money before leaving the island.x
Since Montevideo lies south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics. In the summer months temperatures above +30 °C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cool: temperatures rarely go below freezing, but wind and humidity make it feel colder than what the thermometer indicates.
There are no marked rainy or dry seasons: the amount of rainfall remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the Park Authority, visitors should keep at least 100 yards/meters of bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
No matter how peaceful bisons, wapitis, moose, bears and virtually all large animals can act, it can happen that they pass to attack.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not maintain enough distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so leave them enough space.
Also, be aware that smells can attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking highly scented foods with you, and keep a clean warehouse.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Founded in the 50s of the 18th century, Apia has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of an infamous stalemate of the Navy in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships except a British cruiser were sunk, killing nearly 200 Americans and Germans.
During the Mau movement's independence struggle, a peaceful gathering in the city resulted in the killing of the supreme chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
As Auckland is spread over two ports, there are many beaches. The most popular beaches are located in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches with safe bathing facilities and most offer shade donated by Pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located at the port of Waitemata, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in Central Auckland.
There are family beaches that are sometimes overcrowded, with a beautiful shopping promenade along the coast. Swimming is safe here.
The main local beer is "Number One". It is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to drink, but the New Zealand and Australian wines may be better tolerated.
You can drink the local tap water without hesitation, but if you are worried, you will also find bottled water without any problems.
"For Australians, the idea of coffee ""Flat White"" is foreign. A little black is ""Espresso"", cappuccino is stuffed high with cream (not with foam) and tea is served without milk."
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but excellent.
Many trips to the reef take place throughout the year and injuries due to any of these causes on the reef are rare.x
Nevertheless, you should follow the advice of authorities, pay attention to all signs and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
Dice jellyfish occur near the beach and near river estuaries from October to April north of 1770, and may occasionally occur outside this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the sea, their primary habitat is in estuaries north of Rockhampton.
A booking in advance gives the traveller the assurance that he will have a place to stay after his arrival at the destination.
Travel agencies often have deals with specific hotels, although you may also be able to book other types of accommodation, such as tent pitches, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, or even a combination of flight and hotel.
You can also reserve your reservation for you if you need time to reconsider the offer or to obtain further documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, any changes or requests should first be made to the travel agency and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of festival visitors choose to camp on site, and most visitors consider this to be an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you need to go early to get a campsite close to the music.
Remember that music is played on parts of the festival until late at night, even if the music on the main stages has already stopped.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, as breaking through ice causes rather terrible noise for the most affected.
Cruises to St. Petersburg also provide time for a stay in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (see conditions).
Casinos usually work hard to keep guests on site for as long as possible and have a lot of money spent. There are usually no windows or clocks, and exits are sometimes hard to find.
They usually have a special range of food, drinks and entertainment to keep guests in the mood and make sure they stay.
Some venues offer alcoholic beverages free of charge, but drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good players understand the importance of staying sober.
Those who want to ride in high latitudes or over mountain passes should expect snow, ice and temperatures below freezing.
On icy and snowy roads the adhesion is low and you can not drive as if you are on bare asphalt.
In the case of snow storms, you can fall so much snow in a very short time that you can get stuck.
The visibility can also be impaired by falling or floating snow or by condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.x
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues mostly continuously throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term safari, in common usage, refers to a land trip to observe the overwhelming African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars, and standard equipment allows for good visibility.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are often shy and you can better watch them with binoculars.
A foot safari (also called "bush walk", "hiking safari" or "footing") consists of a hike that takes either a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics after hosting the Games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodations for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you might find yourself in a difficult situation.
The cancellation policies vary, but as of the end of March, most cancellation policies due to the coronavirus did not apply until July 2020, for which the Olympics were scheduled.
It is estimated that most tickets for the event will cost between <0xC2><0xA5> 2,500 and <0xC2><0xA5>130,000, an average ticket of about <0xC2><0xA5>7,000.
Ironing wet clothes can help with drying. Many hotels provide iron and ironing board, even if you are not present in the room.
If there is no iron available or you do not want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer if there is one.
Be careful that the fabric does not get too hot (this can shrink or cause burns in extreme cases).
There are various methods for purifying water, some of which prove to be more effective in counteracting certain hazards.
In some areas it is enough to boil water for a minute, in others it must be several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies greatly, and if you have concerns, then you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests they do not know from their home regions.
Insects can destroy food, cause irritation or, at worst, even trigger allergic reactions, administer poison or transmit disease.
Infectious diseases as such or dangerous animals that can violently injure or kill humans are usually not classified as vermin.
Duty-free shopping is the possibility to buy goods that are exempt from duties and excise duties in certain places.
Travellers whose destination country is highly taxed can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially for products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmount on the highway Buffalo-Pittsburgh is arguably the biggest driving challenge as it often leads through remote, undeveloped terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, stay alert: steep slopes, narrow roads and sharp curves predominate here.
The speed limits indicated are noticeably lower than in the previous and subsequent sections - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and their strict compliance is even more important than usual.
But interestingly, the mobile coverage here is much better than in many other areas of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German baked goods are quite delicious. In Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, as well as in southern neighbor Austria.
Fruit pastries are widespread, with apples being sold into pastries all year round and cherries and plums being used in summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts or other nuts. Popular cakes often fit particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want to make small but rich baked goods, then try what is called Berliner, pancakes or dolls depending on the region.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, along with either meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either “dry” or “wet” depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With a selection of 17,000 islands, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, if the term is used without any other attributes, it usually refers to the food originally originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The Javanese cuisine, which is now widespread throughout the archipelago, offers a variety of simple flavored dishes, with the Javanese preferring peanuts, chillies, sugar (especially coconut blossom sugar) and a range of aromatic spices.
Stirrups are aids for the riders' feet, which hang down on both sides of the saddle.
They give the rider more stability, but there are safety concerns because the rider's feet may get caught in them.
If a rider falls off the horse and catches himself with his foot on the stirrup, he can be dragged along as the horse passes through. To keep this risk as low as possible, a number of safety precautions can be taken.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, quite narrow sole.
In addition, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow a stirrup strap to fall from the saddle as soon as it is pulled back by a falling rider.
The Cochamó Valley – Chile’s main climbing destination, known as the Yosemite National Park of South America, with a variety of large granite walls and cliffs.
The summits offer breathtaking views, and climbers from all over the world continue to discover new routes along the walls, which offer endless possibilities.
Downhill sports such as skiing and snowboarding are popular sports in which you attach skis or a snowboard to your feet and run down a slope over a snow-covered surface.
Skiing is a popular travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes also known as "skiers", who plan their entire vacation around skiing in a particular place.
The idea of skiing is very old – cave paintings with depictions of skiers go back to 5000 BC!
The origins of downhill skiing as a sport go back to at least the 17th century and in 1861 the first leisure ski club in Australia was opened by Norwegians.
Ski hiking with backpack: This activity is also called ski touring or ski hiking.
It is similar to alpine touring skiing or mountaineering, but does not necessarily include it, since the latter is run in steep terrain and requires much firmer skis and boots.
Consider the ski route as a comparable hiking route.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover slightly longer distances than when hiking – very rarely will you reach the speed of cross-country skiing on well-maintained trails without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but has many independent countries. Normally, you would have to apply for visas several times and go through several passport controls if you want to travel through several countries.
The Schengen area, however, works a bit like a country in this regard.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can usually cross the borders without having to go through the passport control again.
Accordingly, with a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a visa individually for each of the Schengen member states, saving time, money and bureaucracy.
There is no general definition of which manufactured items are considered antiques. Some tax authorities define goods over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition has geographical deviations, where the age limit may be lower in areas such as North America than in Europe.
Handmade products could be referred to as “antiquities”, although they are younger than similar mass-produced products.
Reindeer breeding is an important source of Sámi livelihood, and the culture of trade is also important for many who work in other professions.
Even in the past, not all Sámi have bred large-scale reindeer, but have lived from fishing, hunting and the like. Reindeer held them mainly as traction animals.
Today, many Sámi work in modern professions, and tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi region.
"Although the term 'Gypsy' is used mainly by non-Roma, it is often perceived as offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Roma."
If a travel advice is issued for the country you are going to visit, your travel health insurance or cancellation insurance may be affected.
You can also consult the advice of other governments than yours, but their references are tailored to their own citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face situations other than Europeans or Arabs.
Discussions are merely a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The views presented are often superficial, general, and overly simplified compared to the more detailed information found elsewhere.
Severe weather is the collective term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disturbances or the loss of human lives.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world and there are different types of it that depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive precipitation and forest fires are forms and effects of storms, as well as thunderstorms, tornadoes, water trousers and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather events include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms and dust storms.
Travellers are strongly warned to pay attention to any kind of severe weather that affects their territory, as this can affect all travel plans.
Anyone planning to travel to a country that is considered a war zone should undergo professional training for it.
"An Internet search for ""Course on hostile environments"" will probably show the address of a local company."
A course usually covers all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually in combination with practical experience.
A course is usually between 2 and 5 days long and includes role-playing games, lots of first aid and sometimes weapon training.
There are numerous books and journals on survival in the wilderness, but few publications on war zones.
Travelers planning a gender reassignment operation abroad must ensure that they carry valid identification documents for the return trip.
The willingness of governments to issue passports of undeclared gender (X) or documents updated to the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to recognize these documents is also very different.
In addition, searches at security checkpoints have become much more intrusive in the period after 11 September 2001.
Transgender people before their surgery should not expect their privacy and dignity to remain intact when passing the scanners.
Rift currents are the returning stream of waves broken on the beach, often at reefs or the like.
Due to the underwater topology, the reflux concentrates in a few deeper areas and a rapid flow to deep water can form there.
Most deaths are caused by fatigue when trying to swim back against the current, which may prove impossible.
When you get out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than normal.
Try to get somewhere where you won’t be caught again, alternatively, depending on your abilities and whether you’ve been noticed, you might want to wait for rescue.
The return shock comes earlier than the culture shock (the honeymoon phase is not so pronounced), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travellers, who found it easy to adapt to the new culture, sometimes find it particularly difficult to adapt to their culture of origin.
When you come home after a stay abroad, you have adapted to a different culture and set aside some of the behaviors of your home culture.
When you first travelled abroad, people were probably patient and understanding because they knew that travelers had to adapt in a new country.
You may not expect that returning travelers will also need patience and understanding.
The sound and light show at the pyramids is one of the most interesting attractions for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and while it’s still before the show starts.
Usually you always hear the sounds of tourists and sellers. The story of the sounds and the light is just like a story book.
The Sphinx is used as a background and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are depicted on the pyramids, with the various pyramids being illuminated.
The Southern Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the most stations. In 2020, sixteen were active.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Other islands include Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded caldera of an still active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworthland is the region south of the peninsula bordered by Lake Bellingshausen.
The mountains of the peninsula cross here into the plateau and then rise again to form the 360-kilometre-long chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, which is divided by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinel Range, has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, whose highest peak is Mount Vinson at 4,892 m.
In remote areas with no cell phone coverage, a satellite phone can be the only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone, as you have to be outside and in a clear line of sight of a satellite to make a call.
The service is often used by ships, including amusement ships, as well as expeditions that require data and voice remote connections.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for people who plan to take a year off is study and course offers abroad.
This is especially popular with school graduates, as it allows them to take a year off before university without affecting their studies.
In many cases, attending a bridging year abroad program can actually improve your chances of receiving higher education in your home country.
As a rule, a tuition fee is charged for registration to these educational programs.
Finland is a great destination for boat trips, and the “Land of a Thousand Lakes” also has thousands of islands – in the lakes and coastal archipels.
For the archipelago and lakes you do not necessarily need a yacht.
Even though the coastal island groups and the largest lakes are actually large enough for each yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is the national leisure activity in Finland, one in six or eight have a boat.
This is comparable to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise quite unique (in the Netherlands, for example, the ratio is one to forty.)
Most pure Baltic Sea cruises include a longer stay in St. Petersburg in Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a few full days, while returning in the evening and spending the night on the ship.
If you only land during the on-board excursions, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises offer Berlin in Germany as a destination in their brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is far from the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and spheres of life, especially if they’ve never flown before or have a traumatic experience behind them.
There is no need to be ashamed of this: this is nothing but the personal fears and antipathies that many people have.
Finding out more about the operation of aircraft and the procedures during a flight can help some overcome the fear associated with the unknown or the feeling of being out of control.
Courier companies are well-paid for fast delivery of things, often time is a very important factor in company documents, merchandise or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, the larger companies use their own planes, but on other routes and on smaller companies, difficulties occurred.
If they shipped things by air freight, unloading and customs clearance on some routes could take several days.
The only way to get it through faster was to ship it as checked baggage. The regulations of the airlines do not allow to ship baggage without a passenger, and that is where you come into play.
The obvious way to fly in first or business class is to sweep a thick batch of money for the privilege (or, even better, to get your company to take over the costs).
However, this is not cheap: As a rough rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy rate for the business and the eleventh for the first class!
In general, it is pointless to look for discounts on direct flights from A to B even only for business or first-class seats.
The airlines know very well that there is a certain core group of airlines who are willing to pay a lot of money and charge corresponding prices for the privilege of getting to their destination quickly and conveniently.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The native language is Romanian, but many people also speak Russian.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the establishment of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member country.
Despite the failure of the political negotiations, the economic relations between these two parts of the Republic of Moldova were restored.
The most important religion in Moldova is the Christian Orthodox.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of about 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul and a very good traffic hub.
The former ancient city of Smyrna is now a modern, progressive and bustling business center located on a huge bay surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, glazed buildings and modern shopping malls are characterized by classic red brick roofs, the 18th century market, as well as ancient mosques and churches, although the city exudes an atmosphere of Mediterranean Europe rather than that of traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.

Please treat this site with the dignity, reverence and respect it deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not spoil the site by attaching or scraping graffiti.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it, and almost everyone can speak Spanish.
However, most signs are only given in Catalan, as it is legally established as the first official language.
Nevertheless, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Normal announcements are made in the metro exclusively in Catalan, but unforeseen disturbances are reported by an automated system in a variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians are said to be self-centered, rude and arrogant.
Even though this is often just an inaccurate cliché, the best way to cope in Paris is to show oneself at its best and behave like someone who is “bien élevé” (well-educated), which will make it much easier to cope.
The bare exterior of the Parisians disappears very quickly if you show basic manners.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, there are mainly beech, spruce and fir trees and it offers a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Thanks to its numerous microclimates, different soils and alternating altitudes, it has a remarkably large variety of plant societies.
The area is also home to an extremely wide variety of animal and bird species.
There is rare fauna such as European brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynxes, wildcats and eagles, as well as many more common species.
When visiting the monasteries, women must wear skirts that extend above the knees, and also cover their shoulders.
In most monasteries there are wrapping skirts for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one in bright colors, the monk or nun at the entrance will give you a smile.
Similarly, men must wear trousers that extend above their knees.
Also these can be borrowed from the stock at the entrance, but the clothes are not washed after every user, so you may not feel comfortable in these skirts. For all men there is a single size!
Majorcan cuisine, like those in similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and always uses olive oil.
A simple popular dinner, especially in summer, is the Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and any currently available ingredient such as cheese, tuna, etc.
"All nouns begin alongside the word you for ""you"" always with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence."
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
It may also make reading easier, but writing is fairly difficult because you have to determine whether a tune word or property word is used as the main word.
Pronunciation in Italian is relatively simple, since most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The most important letters to pay attention to are c and g, as their pronunciation varies depending on the subsequent vowel.
Also make sure to pronounce r and r differently: caro means "love", whereas carro means "carriage".
The Persian language has a relatively simple and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this introductory grammar would help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and understand formulations better.
Of course, if you speak a Romance language, it is easier to learn Portuguese.
However, people who speak a little Spanish may quickly come to the conclusion that Portuguese is so similar that you don’t have to learn it extra.
Pre-modern observatories are now normally no longer in operation and serve as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution during its peak was not the problem it is today, they are usually located in cities or on university grounds that are easier to reach than those built in recent times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Viewing cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept comes from China, where plum blossoms represented the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were held by the emperor only for himself and other noblemen in the vicinity of the imperial court.
"Plants look best in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to also remove ""only"" specimen."
If you visit a formally landscaped garden and collect "samples", you will also be thrown out without discussion.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place where you can find your way around and buy almost anything on arrival.
Since you are in the extreme tropics and only a few degrees north of the equator, you must expect both heat (always) and strong sun (if the sky is clear, less often).
There are also a few buses going north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.
Make sure that the bus you want to take goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good basis for holiday planning.
For example, visits to the castle in the Loire Valley, in the Rhine Valley or a cruise to interesting cities on the Danube or a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They are also popular hiking and cycling routes.
In Christianity, Christmas is one of the most important holidays and is considered the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions surrounding the festival were adopted throughout the world by non-believers in Christian and non-Christian countries.
There is the tradition of spending Easter night awake in some open place to see the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could also be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
Traditional churches often hold an Easter watch on Saturday evening, during the Easter weekend, with congregation celebrations often starting at midnight, during which the Resurrection of Christ is celebrated.
All animals that originally arrived on the islands came here either by swimming, flying or swimming.
Due to the great distance from the continent, mammals were unable to embark on the journey, making the giant turtle the main pasture in the Galapagos Islands.
Since the first humans entered the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means the sun will not rise above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see the northern lights, as the sky is more or less dark around the clock.
Because the areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is often not a problem, you can also enjoy the starry sky.
The Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners might be accustomed to.
Suits are common business clothes and colleagues speak with their family names or job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, with a focus on group performance rather than praise for individual achievements.
Employees often need to obtain the consent of their supervisors for all decisions they make, and they are expected to follow their bosses’ instructions unconditionally.
