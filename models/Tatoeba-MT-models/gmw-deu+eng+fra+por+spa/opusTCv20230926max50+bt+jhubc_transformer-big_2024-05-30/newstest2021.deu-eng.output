Biker reacts at lightning speed and prevents worse
On Friday evening, a traffic accident occurred on the country road between Machtolsheim and Merklingen, in which a motorcyclist was only slightly injured thanks to his quick reaction.
Driver overlooks biker
A 44-year-old driver wanted to turn left towards Machtolsheim with her VW from Merklingen.
In doing so, she overlooked the 24-year-old motorcyclist coming from the direction of Nellingen.
Hand and foot brake levers fly away during the collision
The biker still tried to avoid the car, but nevertheless rubbed it at the rear of the vehicle.
Due to the striking process, the Suzuki’s hand and foot brake levers were demolished and the driver was no longer able to brake.
Spiritually, he steered his motorcycle in the green stiffs next to the roadway and had it roll out there without falling down.
Biker suffers leg injury
Due to the collision with the car, the biker nevertheless suffered an injury at the beam and had to be treated in a clinic.
Mamming: Corona mass infection: 174 harvesters infected
After a corona mass infection in a large vegetable farm in Mamming in Lower Bavaria, almost 500 people are under quarantine and are no longer allowed to leave the farm.
A security guard monitors the ban.
A total of 174 harvesters were tested positive for the corona virus Sars-CoV-2 during the series examination, as the Landratsamt Dingolfing-Landau announced on Saturday evening.
"In order to avoid further spread, we unfortunately have to take this step to protect the population," state councillor Werner Bumeder (CSU) said in a statement.
Previously, seven employees had already been infected in the company - this was the reason for the row test.
The farm is a large vegetable farm that grows strawberries, cucumbers, cabbage and beetroot - the cucumbers are only for inlay glasses.
Mamming is a rural municipality with more than 3,300 inhabitants not far from Dingolfing with its large BMW plant.
Bumeder appealed to the citizens to keep calm: "According to our information, this is a closed circle of people."
Infected people were separated from uninfected employees on the farm, the site is now surrounded by a barrier fence.
The Greens and the SPD gave the state government co-responsibility.
The two opposition factions accused Prime Minister Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet of neglecting the control of the accommodations of seasonal workers.
"This can be a bitter revenge if such local infections have to be taken out and regional lockdowns have to be ordered," said Jürgen Mistol, the parliamentary managing director of the Greens.
“After the corona outbreak in the Wiesenhof slaughterhouse in mid-May, we already demanded a special control program for farms with harvesters,” said environmental expert Florian von Brunn.
"In our view, the hygiene conditions at the workplace and the living conditions in particular must be closely monitored.
That obviously didn't happen."
The outbreak came "with announcement."
Subway station Aidenbachstraße: Dangerous dispute: 19-year-old falls to the track bed after Schubser
In a dispute between two youth groups at the Aidenbachstraße subway station, a 19-year-old fell through a pusher and slipped into the track bed.
Obersendling - On Friday, a dispute between two youth groups occurred at the Aidenbachstraße subway station at 4.15 p.m.
A passerby alerted the police, who approached with several stripes.
According to the first investigation, a Munich (17) pushed a 19-year-old to the ground.
The young man slipped over the platform edge and fell into the track bed.
People from the group of the 17-year-old helped the fallen man climb out of the track.
There was no danger of an incoming train.
According to the police, there was another clash between the two people.
The 17-year-old initially fled the scene of the crime, but his personalities could be determined afterwards.
Accompanied by his father, he went to police inspection 29.
The 17-year-old is being charged with assault.
Report: Seehofer urges prolonged data retention
Data retention is currently suspended.
Federal Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, however, calls for an extension of the storage period after a media report.
He wants to strengthen the fight against child abuse.
Federal Interior Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU) is calling for a prolonged data retention after a media report - instead of the planned ten weeks a half year.
As the "Bild am Sonntag" reports, Seehofer Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht (SPD) asked in a letter for a quick change in the law.
Seehofer wants to strengthen the measures against child abuse.
He believes it makes sense to "make urgently needed adjustments to the law already now," the newspaper quotes from the letter.
Data retention is currently suspended.
A decision of the European Court of Justice is expected.
However, Seehofer wants the changes beforehand so that they can be applied immediately after a possible positive judgment, the report continues.
A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice told the newspaper that it would only be sensible to consider whether legal adjustments would be necessary if the courts had decided.
In the fight against child abuse and child pornography, Seehofer, together with the interior ministers of the countries, had already called for data retention in June.
NBA: Strip Club Annoyance for Clippers Star Lou Williams
Excitement in the NBA!
Lou Williams, 33, a Los Angeles Clippers basketball professional, is said to have left the tournament quarters at Disney World in Orlando/Florida with permission for a funeral.
According to US media reports, however, he still visited the strip club "Magic City" in Atlanta in the evening.
Williams, who is said to have admitted the visit, is back in Isloation, being tested for Covid-19 daily.
His reason for visiting: Chicken Wings.
In February last year, "Sweet Lou," as he is called in the NBA, already expressed his love for exactly these wings.
The American wrote: "Magic City and Blue Flame (another strip club in Atlanta, Anm. d. R.) have the best wings in town."
NBA insider Shams Charania announced on Twitter on Sunday that the NBA Williams has ordered a 10-day quarantine.
Thus, the Clippers star misses the first two official games after the test game phase.
In Disney World, the NBA wants to play the Corona season to the end.
Currently, the best 22 teams with training matches are preparing for the season finale that starts at night on Friday.
Söder comments on corona situation after mass infection
Munich - Health Minister Melanie Huml (CSU) has already announced on Sunday a testoffensive for large farms.
The press conference will be live on our homepage.
The case in Mamming in the district of Dingolfing-Landau has frightened authorities and politics.
The large vegetable farm currently employs almost 500 harvesters from several countries, with over a third infected with the coronavirus pathogen.
The farm is now under quarantine and is closed off with a building fence.
No one is allowed to leave the premises, food is delivered.
The authorities are now offering free corona tests to the more than 3,300 residents of the community.
Since the harvesters had little contact with the local population, the Landratsamt assumes so far that the infections have not spread beyond the farm.
"Repentance": Confession of the alleged arsonist of Nantes
"My client has shown himself cooperative," lawyer Quentin Chabert told the newspaper.
The defendant added: "He deeply regrets the deeds, the confession was a liberation for him."
His mandate was “tortured by a bite of conscience and very much taken along by the extent of the destruction.”
In the event of a conviction, the man is threatened with ten years in prison and a fine of 150,000 euros.
The Gothic St. Peter and Paul Cathedral in Nantes was severely damaged in a fire on Saturday last week.
The fire broke out in three places far apart in the church.
Laboratory investigations confirmed the suspicion of arson.
The now detained suspect had already been arrested a few hours after the fire.
He was released after a day.
The man worked as a volunteer for the diocese of Nantes and was responsible for the closure of the cathedral on the eve of the fire.
Since there was no trace of a violent intrusion into the church, he quickly caught the eye of the investigators.
Discussing the Abolition of the 50+1 Rule
Former DFB President Reinhard Grindel has recommended that we consider the abolition of the 50+1 rule.
"German football should at least discuss setting conditions and clear rules for investors before the European Commission creates completed facts," Grindel told Bild am Sonntag.
He stressed: "For the clubs that are most likely to be dangerous to Bayern and Dortmund, the 50+1 rules do not work anyway: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this respect, one cannot avoid the debate as to whether it is not appropriate to facilitate the involvement of investors by associations that want to break into this phalanx."
However, he has doubts about whether there is a willingness in the German Football League to allow majority stakes, which are prohibited in the Bundesliga by the 50+1 rule.
"It remains a legal risk to draw investment fences around the business location of the Bundesliga in a European single market," Grindel said.
The former DFB boss sees the danger that "the attempts to ensure more competitive balance in the Bundesliga will only end up weakening the competitiveness of our top clubs at the European level, but will not lead to more tension in the championship".
Even a uniform distribution of TV funds will not have a decisive effect.
FC Bayern has a turnover of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund of 500 million and RB Leipzig of 300 million.
So the differences are already immense among the first three clubs alone.
The other 15 clubs have an average budget of 130 million," the 58-year-old said.
Looking at the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
"Unfortunately, there have been people who have noticed this mistake and pierced the press instead of addressing me," Grindel said about the adoption of an expensive clock that led to his resignation in April 2019.
“It’s been very busy for me humanly.”
He had received the gift worth around 11,000 euros from a Ukrainian official.
"I committed a compliance breach, and it was right to draw the consequences from it," Grindel said.
"I handled the ominous watch gift completely transparently and suspiciously.
Many people in the DFB knew about it.”
He never made a secret out of the gift, the 58-year-old assured.
"This may be called naive, at least this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption."
"Black Lives Matter": Injured and One Dead
Protests against police violence in the United States have intensified due to Donald Trump’s use of federal police in several cities.
On Saturday, there were clashes between protesters and police in various cities.
Three people were injured in Louisville and 16 were arrested in Seattle.
In Austin, a person was killed by gunshots while a demonstration train was just crossing a crossroads.
There were clashes in Portland during protests against racism and police violence.
The security forces, including federal police officials, deployed tear gas on Saturday night and violently dispersed protesters.
Hundreds, partly armed protesters marched through Louisville in Kentucky on Saturday, demanding that those responsible for Breonna Taylor’s death be held accountable.
The 26-year-old student was shot dead in a drug raid in her Louisville apartment in March.
The target of the raid was someone else who did not live there, and no drugs were found.
When a member of a group that calls itself an armed alliance of black Americans fired on Saturday, three people were injured.
According to NBC, they were taken to the hospital.
None of them were in danger of death.
The police set up barricades because counter-manifests of a white militia had also formed.
In the end, there was no meeting between the two groups.
In Austin, Texas, a person was shot and killed in a "Black Lives Matter" demonstration.
Police said they had taken a suspect into custody.
She did not provide further information on the circumstances of the act so far.
Mayor Steve Adler said he, like many in the city, was “unconsoled and stunned” by what had happened.
In the US metropolis of Seattle, protesters also made clashes with the police on Saturday.
They set fire to a construction car in front of a youth prison, the police used glare grenades and pepper spray.
According to the Seattle Times, 16 people were arrested for resistance to police officers or assault.
In the city of Oakland, California, a courthouse was set on fire.
A small group of protesters broke into windows, shot down fireworks, and blinded police officers with lasers, Oakland police said late Saturday evening (local time).
The fire was quickly extinguished.
In Aurora, a suburb of Denver in Colorado, a car drove through a crowd demonstrating on a highway.
According to police, one of the protesters fired a gun and at least one person was taken to the hospital injured.
In addition, windows were broken in a court and a fire was set, the police said.
Investigations have been opened.
Rakoczy in Bad Kissingen: Historical costumes defy Corona
Although the big sauce was missing in the spa town, visitors and performers enjoyed the Rakoczy flair of the alternative program.
It was unusual for visitors, performers and organizers: The Rakoczy weekend without the Rakoczy festival.
But: Even if the big party mile in the city center was missing, the crowds and program highlights such as Saale are burning, Rakoczy-Ball or festival, yet many came at their expense with the Corona-compliant alternative program.
"I think we managed to spread Rakoczy-Flair," says Kurdirektorin Sylvie Thormann.
The guests would have accepted it well.
In principle, one returns to the beginnings of the Rakoczy festival, when only the historical was the focus of the festival.
Pleasant atmosphere
Vesna Konhäuser has been visiting Bad Kissingen with her husband for more than 25 years at the Rakoczy-Fest.
This time, too, in the Corona year.
The couple have made themselves comfortable at the Luitpold Casino, watch the historical while strolling and listen to Cuban live music at the casino restaurant.
"I find it very pleasant," says Konhäuser.
She does not miss the crowds that otherwise belong to Rakoczy.
But it lacks the usual program highlights, especially Saale is burning on Friday evening as well as the historic parade and the closing fireworks on Sunday evening.
"That's a pity.
The weather would have been great this year," she said.
Rakoczy riding tournament to take place again
For the performers of the historic spa guests, the alternative program meant partly more work.
For example, for Christina Gold, who participates in the procession in a normal year and can be seen on the carriage of the Kurgartencafé.
This year she was walking in costume in the city on Saturdays and Sundays.
“It’s harder, otherwise it’s easier,” she says.
The riding club had less to do, even if individual riders were traveling in the park.
"We very much hope that the riding quadrille will be able to take place again next year," says Chairman Ulrike Waldhofen.
She announced that after several years of pause, a Rakoczy riding tournament will take place again in 2021.
28 Corona cases at Spanish second league Fuenlabrada
Spanish football team CF Fuenlabrada is sliding deeper and deeper into the crisis due to a coronavirus outbreak.
Since the newcomer from close to Madrid flew to the city of A Coruña on July 20 despite the first corona cases, a low hit follows the next.
By Sunday, 28 players or team members had been tested positive, one came to the hospital, the club announced.
Fuenlabrada from the city of the same name southwest of Madrid had so far the chance to reach the climb playoffs.
Now even the descent into the B group of the second league threatens.
Last Monday’s match against Deportivo La Coruña was cancelled at the last moment, the prosecutor’s office is investigating a possible offence against public health, the top sports authority CSD is considering the club’s forced descent.
Players and other team members are in quarantine at a hotel.
"Until the sixth day of quarantine, they did not receive a fresh towel or gel," the sports newspaper wrote.
Photos show how players hung underwear and club clothes in their rooms in the hotel for drying after they apparently had to wash them themselves.
Also, the bed linen was not changed for five days.
Another problem is the food.
“It’s not good or good enough,” he wrote.
The club management, on the other hand, said they were satisfied with the hotel.
The club’s lawyer, Javier Tebas Llanas, dismissed the allegation of deliberately endangering public health.
It did not violate the Corona rules established by the football association, stressed the son of the president of the Spanish Primera Division, Javier Tebas, as reported by the news agency Europa Press and the sports newspaper "Marca".
Before the flight, there were four infected people, but they were all isolated and did not travel with them.
Just before the flight to A Coruña on Monday, all players and team members had been tested again.
When the team was already in A Coruña, the Corona test was positive for "five or six" other team members.
The game was cancelled 60 minutes before the start, Tebas Llanas said.
Police have to catch horses ripped off at Steamach
Two animals were on the road.
The police took her back to her owner.
On Sunday morning just before 6 a.m., a road user informed two free-running horses on the feeder between the Donnersdorf/Steinsfeld junction and the motorway junction Theres.
When the officers arrived, the horses were already between the feeder and the village of Dampfach.
After the officials had gained the confidence of the horses shortly before Dampfach, they were able to turn around a rope carried in the patrol car.
Cycling professional Tony Martin: career continuation imaginable
Time trial specialist Tony Martin is thinking about a continuation of his career.
Frankfurt/Main - The seven-time time trial world champion Tony Martin can well imagine continuing his cycling career.
"I'm currently working with the team on the framework conditions, how and in what form it could continue," the 35-year-old told the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung".
Martin is currently employed by the Dutch team Jumbo-Visma and had considered ending his career after this year before the Corona break.
Negotiations with his team are also about the number of race days, he said.
Or about other problems that would plague him as a family father, Martin said.
In the past, he had stood up after a fall, and the first thought was, "Quick back on the bike.
Today, as a father of a little daughter, I’m thinking, ‘What if?’
The cycling professional admitted that there are certainly aspects with which he is increasingly struggling.
"But it was good for me to remember what I have in cycling and how much fun it is for me based on the Corona period."
The time trial specialist will return to the competition at the Tour de l'Ain (5 to 9 August).
Bavaria: At least four dead on Bavaria's streets on weekend
The beautiful weather attracts bikers to the roads in many places.
For at least three people, the tour ends with the motorcycle deadly.
An 18-year-old pedestrian also died.
Schönthal - Several, mostly young people, died in accidents on Bavaria's roads during the weekend.
An 18-year-old motorcyclist was caught on Saturday at Schönthal (Cham County) by a car that came on the opposite lane.
At first, it was unclear why the car got on the opposite lane.
In Upper Bavaria on Saturday, a 22-year-old on his machine collided with a horse-drawn carriage.
According to police, he was downhill at Beilngries.
In a left turn, he hit the carriage.
His injuries were so severe that he died at the scene of the accident.
Of the twelve occupants of the carriage, one was severely injured and one was slightly injured, police said.
In another fatal accident, an 18-year-old died in Bad Kötzting in the Upper Palatinate.
He had lay down on a road on Sunday night and was overtaken by a 42-year-old driver.
The police suspected the 18-year-old wanted to sleep.
The driver could no longer brake in time.
At Schönberg (District Freyung-Grafenau) on Saturday a 57-year-old biker bounced in a right corner despite full braking frontally against a car.
He died at the scene of the accident.
The 57-year-old driver suffered a shock, the other three people in the car remained uninjured.
The safety of motorcyclists was discussed on Saturday by Bavarian Minister of Transport Kerstin Schreyer (CSU).
In a letter to the organizer of the biker protests against driving bans announced for August, Gabor Kovacs, the minister pointed to extensive investments such as underride protection on guardrails and the deactivation of dangerous curves.
"We have achieved a lot for the safety of motorcyclists in recent years," the letter said.
"The number of motorized two-wheeler drivers killed decreased by around 28 percent compared to 2011".
Kovac to test with Monaco against Frankfurt
Frankfurt/Main (dpa) - For football coach Niko Kovac there will soon be a reunion with Eintracht Frankfurt with his new club AS Monaco.
The eight-time French champion will be a guest on 1 August (18.00) at the Hesse, the former club of the Croats.
For the Bundesliga, it is the first and only hard test before the return match in the Europa League against FC Basel (6 August).
Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the meeting will be held without spectators.
“We are particularly looking forward to this game.
It's always nice to come to Frankfurt and meet friends," Kovac said.
This is an interesting test, the 48-year-old said.
Before joining FC Bayern Munich, Kovac had trained the Hesse from 2016 to 2018 and led to victory in the DFB Cup.
"A high-profile opponent like Monaco is a good test for us in terms of the match against Basel.
Like all Frankfurters, I look forward to seeing Niko Kovac again," said Eintracht coach Adi Hütter.
The 50-year-old Austrian had succeeded the Croat at the Eintracht.
In March, the Frankfurters had lost the 16th-final match against Basel in their own stadium with 0-3.
Nearly 50 new infections: Landkreis Hof close to lockdown
In the district of Hof, the number of known corona new infections on the weekend has increased further: from 39 on Friday and 43 on Saturday (one person has recovered and does not fall into this statistic) to 47 on Sunday.
There is also a case in the city court.
This approaches the space yard to the critical mark of 50 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants in one week.
700 dead from monsoon rains in Southeast Asia
More than 9 million people have been affected by the severe floods in Southeast Asia, mainly in Bangladesh, India and Nepal.
As a result of the heavy monsoon rain, a total of 700 people were killed.
In Bangladesh, the Red Crescent is trying to reach the isolated people in boats.
Entire villages are under water.
The farmers have lost their crops.
Panzer rhinos in national park die from landslides
In Kaziranga National Park, several of the 120 tank rhinos died from landslides.
They are under protection and considered endangered.
This year, the floods are particularly bad, which scientists attribute to climate change.
According to the United Nations, Bangladesh is one of the countries most affected by global warming.
New apartments are empty
In the town of Cox's Bazar in southern Bangladesh, the state has built apartments for 650 displaced by the floods.
So far, few have moved in.
It's hard to get people to Cox's Bazar.
The enthusiasm also remains in Grenezn.
Anyone who used to have a house, even though it was small and like a hut, often does not want to spend his life in a large apartment block.
Many homes are empty, but – as the government wants it – they will soon be taken in by those who have lost their homes due to the floods.

Argentina rejects counter-offer from creditors
The new demands could not be met, the Ministry of Economic Affairs announced in Buenos Aires on Saturday.
"This would not only be irresponsible, but also unfair," he said in a statement.
"While 50 percent of children in Argentina live in poverty, we cannot increase our creditors' short-term profits".
The debt of the second largest economy in South America is no longer sustainable under the current conditions.
That is why Argentina is demanding that its private creditors waive part of their claims of around US$66 billion (about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>59 billion).
If no agreement is reached, the country will once again face state bankruptcy.
It would be the ninth payment default in Argentine history.
Recently, lenders had demanded higher interest rates on government bonds and changes to some contractual clauses.
However, the Argentine government remains on its last offer and is not ready to make any further concessions.
Argentina is in a severe financial and economic crisis.
Lastly, the inflation rate was more than 50 percent.
For the current year, experts expect a decline in economic strength of around ten percent.
At the end of May, Argentina had failed to settle interest receivables of $503 million and had slipped into a limited default.
Arrived professionally - not yet privately
"It's going super well" - Dr. Stefanie Kramer draws this conclusion after her first days in the notary's office in Eggenfelden.
In the end, everything went very fast: In mid-May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she would succeed Lutz Feller in the Eggenfelden Notary Office.
Already six weeks later, at the beginning of July, the doctoral lawyer started work, the normal day-to-day business has long since been running on full tours.
"I still have to arrive privately," she explains in a conversation with the Rottaler Anzeiger and laughs.
The short lead time, of course, was not enough to completely relocate the center of attraction from Regensburg to Eggenfelden, reports the native Dingolfinger.
Currently, she is looking for a suitable apartment or house in the city with her husband, who works as a judge at the district court in Regensburg.
At least her husband could still apply for parental leave at short notice in order to ensure the care of the two daughters (31<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 and 11<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 years old).
In order not to have to commute every day from Regensburg, she now also has a place to stay with her parents in Dingolfing, the 39-year-old explains.
Growing up in the neighbouring district, the city of Eggenfelden has of course been a familiar place for her for a long time.
During visits on site with her family in the past months, she once again stated: "Eggenfelden is a really beautiful small town".
She was all the more pleased that she had made the race in the selection process for the vacancy.
In Dr. Stefanie Kramer’s professional career, her homeland of Lower Bavaria also plays a central role: After studying law in Passau, she completed her internship and the second state examination in Regensburg.
After several stops as a Notarasssorin, among others in Rehau and Hof in Oberfranken, Babenhausen in Unterallgäu and Regensburg - during this time she also shouldered her doctorate in labour law - she took up her first position as a notary in Rotthalmünster in the district of Passau in 2012.
In 2016 she went on parental leave, followed by the move to Regensburg.
Since then, she has taken over representation services in various notary offices.
When the job in Eggenfelden was advertised due to the approaching retirement of Lutz Feller, she saw the right time for the full return to work, explains the 39-year-old.
The team of its predecessor, who in future will take over the holiday representation in the notary office, has completely taken over Dr. Stefanie Kramer - and has immediately a commendation for the team of the law firm ready: "It's going super well!"
The fact that she can rely on well-established processes here makes it easier for her to take care of the upcoming relocation of the private food point.
In terms of kindergarten and nativity scenes, she has already made contact with a local institution.
And if everything works out as desired, she hopes to be able to pursue her hobby here soon - and get to know the most beautiful jogging trails of the Rottal.
BVB plans to start the league with a maximum of 15,000 spectators
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will not even be 20 percent full at the start of the season in the event of a fan return.
“Due to the distance regulation, which is mandatory to be observed, we plan according to the current status with 12,000 to 15,000 spectators,” Borussia Dortmund’s Managing Director Carsten Cramer told the “Tagesspiegel”.
Usually, the arena in the district city holds just over 81,000 spectators during Bundesliga matches.
In last season’s ghost games caused by the corona pandemic, BVB lost around four million euros per game.
Cramer, who is responsible for marketing, digitization and internationalization at BVB, hopes that in addition to the normal audience seats, some of the around 4000 seats in the hospitality area can be opened again: "It is of course a blow to the office if these revenues completely break away".
Given the ongoing corona crisis, everyone is currently well advised to take a stable side length for the first time.
"If many companies are not doing well and 6.8 million people are in short-time work in Germany alone, then the need for entertainment is limited," Cramer said.
The Dortmund marketing chief praised the BVB professionals for their salary waiver, which is supposed to help overcome the crisis: "Of course, the players know that their waiver has a different effect than if we put 100 people working in merchandising on short-time work."
Tiny wonders: early start to life with a few hundred grams
Hardly heavier than a packerl butter, just three tablespoons of blood in his entire body: that was Gabriel when he was born - he weighed exactly 273 grams.
The Bub is one of about 400 premature babies who are cared for annually at the Grazer Kinderklinik.
A quarter of them weigh less than 1,500 grams, a few – like Gabriel and his brothers Raphael and Michael – are extreme lightweights with not even a kilogram of birth weight.
They are so small and born so early that neither lungs, intestines, nor muscles are fully formed.
Their skin is sometimes so delicate that they could hurt the electrodes of an ECG.
And they are so tiny that they sometimes wear doll clothes and made especially for them mini diapers.
But not so small that they wouldn’t be in the voice – “and how,” Berndt Urlesberger smiles.
"Even if they don't scream as loud as big babies, of course."
When the whiteboard becomes the stage
Despite Corona theatre in the classroom: The whiteboard as a stage experienced the 9th grades of the St. James High School in Abtsgmünd just before the start of the holidays.
Actress Julia Sylvester from the Theater der Stadt Aalen presented the production "Das Heimatkleid" to the pupils - via video.
Afterwards, the students could chat via Skype with the actress and director Winfried Tobias about the play and the performance.
The idea for the performance format from the current corona situation was born.
Teacher Teresa Nar was delighted with the enrichment of the lesson.
Even though all participants agreed that the direct encounter in the theatre and stage space would offer additional stimuli, the theatre also sees the potential for contact in the schools.
"If we continue to improve the technical framework, it could become an interesting addition to the game operation," said director Winfried Tobias.
First round drawn: TSV 1860 would meet Eintracht Frankfurt in the DFB Cup
If the TSV 1860 qualifies for the DFB Cup, the lions will meet Eintracht Frankfurt in the first round.
This was the result of the draw on Sunday.
Munich - Sixty possible opponents in the first round of the DFB-Pokal has been confirmed.
The lions would meet Eintracht Frankfurt in a successful qualification.
This was the result of the draw on Sunday evening in the ARD Sports Show.
Because the participant field is not yet complete due to the corona pandemic, placeholders were used in the draw.
Due to the voluntary resignation of semi-final opponent FC Memmingen, the TSV 1860 is already in the final of the Bavarian Toto Cup (4th or 5th September).
There, the lions meet either the Würzburg Kickers or Viktoria Aschaffenburg.
Should second-league up-and-coming Würzburg reach the final, Sixty would already qualify for the first round in the DFB-Pokal.
Otherwise, the Giesingers would have to prevail in the final against regional league player Aschaffenburg.
The first round of the DFB Cup will take place between 11 and 14 September, one week before the third league start.
Olivia de Havilland's film legend Olivia de Havilland is dead
Oscar-winning film legend Olivia de Havilland has died.
She died on Sunday in Paris at the age of 104 of a natural death, her spokeswoman for the German press Agency confirmed.
De Havilland was known for her role as Melanie Hamilton in the South American epic "From the Wind" (1939).
Born to British parents in Tokyo, Olivia de Havilland moved to California as a toddler.
The Austrian theatreman Max Reinhardt discovered the 19-year-old in the role of Hermia of Shakespeare's "Summer Night Dream".
The Warner Brothers film studio immediately signed them for seven years and brought them out large alongside Eroll Flynn.
She made eight films with the heartbreaker.
In 1946, she won her first Oscar in the lead role of "To Each His Own."
The film ran in Germany under the title "Mutterherz".
Three years later, the award for Best Actress came in William Wyler's "The Heiress".
She was also highly regarded as a neurotic eccentric in "The Dark Mirror" and "The Snake's Pit".
Daphne du Maurier suggested her to star in the 1952 film adaptation of her novel "Meine Cousine Rachel".
The piece became a worldwide success.
With her longtime girlfriend Bette Davis, she played in "Cradle song for a corpse".
From the marriage to the writer Marcus Goodrich (1946 to 1953) the son Benjamin was born.
In Paris, de Havilland married the journalist Pierre Paul Galante and had the daughter Gisèle with him.
This marriage also broke up.
Rumors of an affair with former British Prime Minister Edward Heath have never been confirmed.
"Road to Timmendorf": Beach volleyball: Thole/Wickler misses final at comeback
World Cup second Julius Thole and Clemens Wickler missed the final at the beach volleyball tournament "Road to Timmendorf".
At the meeting of the top teams in Düsseldorf, they defeated their national team colleagues Nils Ehlers and Lars Flüggen in the semi-finals with 1:2 (17:21, 21:17, 19:21).
Last time Thole/Wickler had played at the World Tour Final in Rome in September of last year.
In the final match on the Rhine, their defeaters Ehlers/Flüggen against the surprise team Lukas Pfretschner and his interim partner Steven van de Velde scored a 0-2 (17:21, 17:21) defeat.
In addition to the show tournament, three starting places for the German championships were played in Timmendorfer Strand at the beginning of September: the tickets were secured by Armin Dollinger/Simon Kulzer, Manuel Harms/Richard Peemüller and Simon Pfretschner/Milan Sievers.
Kalbitz ejection from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of "fig leaf"
The exclusion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is from the FDP's point of view only a "fig leaf" and does not change the character of the party.
"The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the right-wing extremists in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the tip of the iceberg of the radicals in the AfD," said FDP interior politician Benjamin Strasser to the dpa news agency in Berlin.
The Federal Arbitration Court of the AfD had confirmed on Saturday in Stuttgart after several hours of trial the exclusion of Kalbitz, which the Federal Board of Directors had decided by a majority in May.
Kalbitz is the chairman of the AfD group in the Brandenburger Landtag.
"If the AfD were really about consistently removing right-wing extremists from its party, officials such as Björn Höcke and his supporters would have long since been excluded," Strasser said.
"There is no political will in the AfD, however, because right-wing extremism now belongs to the party."
CSU Secretary-General Markus Blume said: "The fact that Andreas Kalbitz is now excluded says nothing and does not change anything," he told the "Welt am Sonntag".
"It speaks rather volumes, how many frenetic supporters a right-wing extremist in the middle of the AfD still has".
Blume expects that the AfD will again end up below five percent in elections in the future.
"The days of the AfD in parliaments are numbered".
Kalbitz was one of the spokespersons of the now officially dissolved "wing" around the Thuringian AfD country and faction chairman Björn Höcke; the Constitutional Protection classifies the strangulation as "secured right-wing extremist aspiration".
In May, the AfD board of directors had thrown Kalbitz out of the party.
As a reason, he stated that Kalbitz had not stated an earlier membership in the now-forbidden right-wing extremist "Heimattreue Deutsche Jugend" (HDJ) and among the Republicans.
Kalbitz denies membership in the HDJ.
Even the chairman of the left-wing group in the Brandenburger Landtag, Sebastian Walter, stressed that the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court did not change the character of the AfD: "The wolf only ate chalk.
The AfD remains a far-right party, with or without Kalbitz".
Neither the federal party nor the right wing will be weakened by this decision.
"The maneuver of the Meuthen troop is transparent.
They want to avoid further observation by the Constitutional Protection and try to get through under the radar," said Walter.
"The AfD will not let go of the spirits she called.
An expulsion does not change anything," commented Brandenburg SPD Secretary-General Erik Stohn on the decision in the Kalbitz case.
"Here the AfD-Landesverband and the faction up to today held to their right-wing leader".
The legal dispute over the membership of Kalbitz in the AfD will continue.
He announced on Saturday that he would now take civil action against the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court.
North Sea wind farms provide 21 percent more electricity
The wind power plants on the German North Sea have fed 11.51 terawatt hours of electricity into the grid in the first six months of the year.
That is a good 21 percent more than in the same period last year, the network operator Tennet in Bayreuth announced.
Tennet is responsible for the transmission of North Sea electricity to the mainland and the transmission through the German electricity grid.
The wind turbines on the Baltic Sea, which are not part of the Tennet grid area, have fed a further 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
Overall, the wind power from the North and Baltic Sea thus reaches 13.73 TWh, compared to a good 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The wind harvest at sea thus accounts for almost 19 percent of the total wind power in Germany, which is about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind farms provide higher generation capacity
The increased contribution of offshore wind energy results from higher generation capacities in addition to the wind conditions, because new wind farms have joined the grid in the past twelve months.
If the 1270 wind power plants in the North Sea were all running at full power at the same time, they could generate 6.7 gigawatts of electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient for this; according to Tennet, it is 7.1 gigawatts.
By 2030, it is expected to increase to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea.
“In Germany and the Netherlands, we are investing <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 billion in the expansion of offshore grid connections until then,” said Tennet Managing Director Tim Meyerjürgens.
In reality, even at sea, wind farms cannot exploit their capacity, but reach around 40 percent.
The record day so far this year is January 2, when the North Sea wind farms generated more than six gigawatts of electricity.
On average, the North Sea wind turbines produce about 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatts of electricity, which corresponds to three to four nuclear power plants.
This could supply almost seven million households with electricity.
Art "Skirmish" - an exhibition by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold in the gallery of the Gmünder Kunstverein.
This was almost a small anniversary celebration for the 130th anniversary.
Birthday of the Gmünder Kunstverein: The exhibition opening "Skirmish" with works by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold exploded the usual framework after the Corona break.
Much more art lovers than usual followed the dialogue between the artist and the chairman of the Kunstverein, Professor Dr. Klaus Ripper.
The musical equivalent was provided by the band "Defenders of the Universe" on the southern Kornhausplatz.
To the north of the gallery, the association "Sandtogether" committed itself.
Freital: Windbergfest cancelled due to coronavirus
The Windbergfest will not take place this year.
The city of Freital has cancelled the three-day festival planned in September.
In other years, more than 30,000 people had attended this city festival.
"We really did not make this decision easy for ourselves and hoped until the last minute, knowing how difficult it is economically for the parties involved," said Mayor Uwe Rumberg.
"But ultimately, we are here as organizers responsible for the health of many thousands of people."
Because if tens of thousands had flocked to the festival grounds and the festival tent, minimum distances, hygiene regulations and contact tracking could not have been complied with in accordance with the current corona protection regulation.
Or the restrictions would have been so severe that not much of a popular festival would have remained.
In addition, the organisational and monitoring effort would increase disproportionately.
Rumberg comforted on next year.
Then the city of Freital celebrates its 100th anniversary with the Winterbergfest from 7 to 9 May 2021 and the Saxon Day from 10 to 12 September 2021.
Dressage Olympic Champion Werth in Achleiten not to be beaten
Achleiten - Six-time Olympic champion Isabell Werth was the outstanding rider at the dressage tournament in Achleiten, Austria.
The 51-year-old from Rheinberg came to four wins on the weekend with four starts.
After winning a Grand Prix at the start with Weihegold and Quantaz, she was unbeatable on Sunday in the Grand Prix Special and in the freeway.
On the 15-year-old mare Weihegold on Sunday, Werth clearly prevailed in the special against the Austrian Victoria Max-Theurer on Abegglen.
On Saturday, the German woman was clearly ahead of her 34-year-old student Victoria Max-Theurer on Quantaz.
Werth's winning horse Quantaz belongs to Max-Theurer.
The most successful dressage rider in the world is to establish the ten-year-old stallion in the Grand Prix.
For Quantaz, it was the first free trial ever.
At the first tournament in Achleiten three weeks ago, Werth had already won all important four tests.
The last of the three international tournaments is scheduled for August 14-16.
More air traffic controllers in Worms in the future
Worms University of Applied Sciences continues to rise: The "DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung" establishes a professorship for "Air Traffic Management".
A corresponding contract between the university and the DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The contract was initially concluded for three years and will start in 2021.
With the professorship, it is possible to enable the start of studies not only in the summer but also in the winter semester.
This means that twice as many students can be trained as before.
At the same time, the capacities at both the university and the air navigation academy of the DFS are being utilised equally.
The DFS will advise the university on the establishment and occupation of the professorship.
Represented at the university since 2019
Since the summer semester 2019, the first students in the course of their training as air traffic controllers at Worms University of Applied Sciences are in the course of study Air Traffic Management.
Nine students have already started this year.
So far, the experiences of the DFS have been very positive, the achievements of the students are excellent.
The combination of studies and pilot training contributes significantly to further increasing the attractiveness of the pilot profession.
"In these times, funding is not easy for us economically.
However, we firmly expect air traffic to recover and grow again in the long term.
In order to continue to fulfil our legal mandate in the future, we need highly qualified personnel," says Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, CEO of DFS at the time of signing the contract.
"For the DFS, the foundation professorship is a future-proof investment that will provide air traffic controllers with a broad, cross-disciplinary knowledge base in the long term.
We therefore continue the good cooperation with the university and at the same time underpin our attractiveness as an employer."
Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, President of Worms University of Applied Sciences, also underlines this: "The foundation professorship forms an important bridge between science and business.
With it, we would like to link to the already existing cooperation with DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung as a practical partner for the dual bachelor's degree program Air Traffic Management".
The trust of Deutsche Flugsicherung is both a motivation and a commitment for Worms University of Applied Sciences to further expand its teaching and research competence in the future fields of aviation.
With its first foundational professorship for a dual course of study, the university can set very special highlights and innovative priorities for its students when working for the air traffic controllers of tomorrow.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary at the Ministry of Science, Education and Culture, emphasizes: "Worms University of Applied Sciences has a unique selling point in Rhineland-Palatinate with its focus on aviation.
Today’s signing of the cooperation agreement strengthens the profile of the university.”
Rescue helicopter lands on the A 45
Around 30 minutes the A 45 motorway was fully closed on Saturday afternoon in the direction of Aschaffenburg, as after a traffic accident the rescue helicopter was in use.
A 76-year-old drove a Ford around 12.40 in the exit Alzenau-Mitte in the curve and landed on the guardrail.
The impact triggered the front airbags, the driver suffered minor injuries to the face and had to be taken to a hospital for treatment.
The injuries of the 72-year-old passenger were taken care of by the emergency doctor and the patient subsequently flown to a hospital with the rescue helicopter.
Currently, however, the police assume that there is no life threat.
The damaged vehicle, in which a damage of about 2,000 euros was incurred, had to be towed.
Heil wants to examine other sectors according to meat industry
The corona crisis brought conditions in parts of the meat industry to light again.
Legislative tightening is imminent.
But are they right – and will they remain?
Federal Labour Minister Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to review other sectors according to the now planned strict regulations against abuses in the meat industry.
"We will look at industry by industry and then take appropriate measures for the respective industry if necessary," Heil told the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Germany’s employers are already warning against restricting work contracts in general.
After the massive corona outbreak at meat giant Tönnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the Federal Cabinet wants to pass a law of salvation on Wednesday.
Large-scale slaughterhouses should no longer be allowed to employ foreign personnel in slaughter, cutting and meat processing.
For this purpose, the use of work contracts and temporary workers should be prohibited there.
Employer President Ingo Kramer told the dpa: "Finger away from a general restriction of work contracts and employee leave if you do not want to completely choke the economy."
Work contracts are, for example, the basis for their value creation at the customer for wide areas of craftsmanship, the construction industry and plant construction.
"The faults of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument".
Heil assured: "My goal is not to ban employment contracts anywhere in the German economy."
Work contracts make sense.
"If an industrial company commissions a craftsman to install a safety facility, that's a very normal work contract".
The German meat industry considers a ban on work contracts and temporary work unconstitutional in its sector alone.
It is not possible to explain why in the future different labor laws should apply to portioning and packaging cheese than to sausages, according to a statement on the bill, as reported by the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Saturday).
If banned, the consumer price would increase by 10 to 20 percent per kilo and product.
Many Eastern European employees from work contract companies worked in the industry, according to the results of an examination by the NRW Occupational Safety and Health Administration, sometimes 16 hours a day.
Often they did not have a break.
Pay was withheld for protective equipment or rent.
It was also found that the situation in the housing of workers was often miserable.
Heil said a relatively strict law came into force for the meat industry as early as 2017.
However, these "tricky constructions" have been circumvented.
"Now it needs to be fundamentally cleaned up."
"In the Occupational Health and Safety Act, which we want to adopt in the Cabinet at the end of July, there are also measures that do not only affect the meat industry - for example, higher test rates for occupational health and safety or clear criteria for community accommodation."
The draft draft of the dpa contains amendments to the Law on the Securing of Employee Rights in the Meat Industry and the Occupational Health and Safety Act.
Brandenburg’s Minister for Consumer Protection Ursula Nonnemacher (Greens) believes more intensive controls are necessary.
"I would wish that we could do even more controls in many supervisory areas: food controls, animal welfare, everything possible, for example animal transport," Nonnemacher said on Sunday in the RBB broadcast "Brandenburg aktuell".
However, more personnel is needed for more controls.
Three dead in crash of ultralight aircraft in Germany
Three people have died in the crash of an ultralight aircraft on an apartment building in Wesel in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia, according to the police.
A child was easily injured.
Two more people were rescued in the accident, a spokesman for the Wesel district control center said.
A parachute was found at the scene, police said.
The Rheinische Post reported, citing eyewitnesses, that before the crash the plane had collided with a hot air balloon.
The house is a one- or two-family house.
Further details were initially not known.
Eviction of Frankfurt Opera Square peacefully
A week after the riots in Frankfurt, the eviction of the Opera Square in the night to Sunday was peaceful.
Most recently, several dozen people stayed on the square, but left it before the curfew began at 1 a.m.
The police have been in action since the early evening with numerous officials, a larger police lineup was seen throughout the city area.
For the first time this weekend, from midnight onwards, there was a ban on attending the Opera Square, where riots had occurred a week ago.
Police officers had been attacked with bottles from the crowd of celebrants.
At least five police officers were injured after police entries, several police vehicles were damaged.
The night of Saturday was also quiet.
Car overturns: Young woman seriously injured in an accident on Bundesstraße 83 near Hofgeismar
In an accident between Schöneberg and Hümme, a 21-year-old suffered serious injuries on Sunday around 13.25.
She was taken to the Klinikum Kassel.
With thermal imaging cameras, the fire brigade was looking for possible passengers.
According to police, the woman was on the federal road 83 in the direction of her home in Hümme, when her car came off the road for previously unexplained cause and overturned several times.
In order to save the victims, the fire brigade had to cut the roof of the car.
Since it was unclear whether someone else was in the vehicle, the adjacent cornfield was scanned from the ladder with a thermal imaging camera.
The drone squadron from Warburg, which also works with thermal imaging cameras, had also been ordered for the person search.
However, the emergency forces found no one among the tall corn plants.
The seriously injured person was taken by ambulance to the Kassel hospital for further care.
Nearly 50 firefighters from Hofgeismar, Hümme and Schöneberg were on site.
The road was closed for two hours due to the accident.
Juventus Turin Champions in Italy
Turin - After a redemptive goal from Cristiano Ronaldo, record champion Juventus Turin has secured the Italian championship for the ninth time in a row.
The team around the five-time world footballer perfected the 36th overall Scudetto in the club's history with a 2-0 (1-0) on Sunday evening in the home game against Sampdoria Genoa.
Ronaldo scored 1-0 before the halftime.
With 83 points, Turin, which competed without the last long-injured ex-national player Sami Khedira, can no longer be displaced from first place two match days before the end of the season of Serie A.
The second-placed Inter Milan is seven points behind.
Juventus was harmless despite visual superiority in the first half, then Ronaldo hit with the last action after a free-kick variant.
Miralem Pjanic's 35-year-old shot directly from the penalty area with a flat shot (45.+7).
Against the more offensive guests, Ronaldo was also involved in the 2-0, after his shot dusted Federico Bernardeschi (67th).
This ensured the unbridled but decisive success.
The foul in the 89th minute, shot to the bar, was probably only Ronaldo himself with a view to the goalkeeper's score.
"It's complicated to stay mentally and physically at ball level for 90 minutes.
The games are weird and the momentum is changing very easily," coach Maurizio Sarri told Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
Above all, the mental exhaustion of his players is great, said the Juve coach.
Due to the defeat, the Turiners had not yet been able to make the championship perfect.
At the end of the day, Juve’s calming lead to the top of the table was due to the weakness of its competitors.
Because in the eleven games before the game on Sunday, the Sarri team had only five wins.
Whether Ronaldo will still be the goalkeeper’s king is questionable.
Because while the Portuguese superstar has so far scored 31 goals, the former Dortmunder Ciro Immobile after his three-pack at the 5:1 (1:1) of the table fourth Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona already 34 hits on his account - as many as Robert Lewandowski contributed to the title win of FC Bayern.
The record in Italy is held by the current Juve professional Gonzalo Higuaín.
In the 2015/2016 season, the Argentine scored 36 goals for the SSC Naples.
In August, the "Old Lady" of Italian football awaits the next title opportunity.
Juventus is in the Champions League round of 16, but will have to face Olympique Lyon on 7 August to reach the final in Lisbon.
In the next knockout round, Real Madrid or Manchester City would wait as an opponent.
Baden-Württemberg: More than 250 illegal car races captured
In spite of all the threatened penalties and court rulings, drivers continue to gas up countless illegal races on the Baden-Württemberg roads: In the past year and the first four months of this year, the police have already registered more than 250 illegal car races in the southwest.
There are no comparable values for the years before, but the speedometers are increasingly making the judicial authorities work: At the prosecutors’ offices between Konstanz and Mannheim, a total of 155 investigations were conducted in 2018 for illegal races, a year later there were already 252 and in the current year as early as June 151.
The races were less about organized events, according to the response of the Ministry of the Interior to a request from the Landtags-SPD.
In most cases, the drivers have spontaneously competed against each other or they have taken flight from the police - this is also indicated as an illegal race.
At the wheel were mainly German men between the ages of 18 and 60.
113 fines - 15 times imprisonment
In comparatively few cases, the rasers are caught and also asked to pay: According to the Ministry of the Interior, a total of 113 fine and 15 prison sentences have been imposed since 2018.
However, there is no indication that the number of illegal car races is actually increasing.
Rather, other drivers reacted more sensitively than before due to the numerous tragic accidents and processes of past years, and reported more frequently, a ministry spokesman said.
The motorway 8 is particularly popular with racers. Motorcyclists stop traffic there again and again in order to make room and use the free track for a race.
Last August, a dozen drivers were caught near Kirchheim under Teck, three months earlier there were even 18 drivers on the A8 at Merklingen.
A81 is the most popular "race track"
On the A81, the police even register more races than on any other federal highway.
A speed limit is used to slow down the racers on the particularly affected section between Engen and Geisingen.
The mostly high-priced and uplifted sports and luxury carriages often have Swiss license plates, because the drivers dodge to the lawn in Germany due to the high penalties for driving too fast and car racing in the neighboring country.
For the SPD, the speed limit must not be reduced to a few routes: "With a general speed limit of 130 kilometres per hour, we would get rid of this problem on motorways," says Martin Rivoir, the traffic experts of the SPD parliamentary group.
"The inhibition threshold for racers would be significantly higher if you weren't allowed to be here and there legally with 200 kilometers per hour and more."
Rivoir says less about enlightenment or image campaigns: "Whoever goes beyond all rules in such a way and risks not only his own life, but also the lives of other road users, can hardly be reached with reason."
ADAC calls for stronger police intervention
However, this is not enough for ADAC: "We assume that rasers will not be deterred by the speed limits," says Holger Bach, Head of the Department of Transport and Environment at ADAC Württemberg.
It calls for additional and even more stringent controls on the affected routes.
It is not uncommon for the high-speed power-test to become more painful and serious: Since January 2019 and until April 2020, three people died in the races nationwide, two of them uninvolved in a night-time crash in Stuttgart’s city centre and one in Gerlingen.
In November, two young men took part in a car race.
One of the vehicles came off the road, crashed against a garden wall and remained on the side, the 18-year-old passenger died.
Twenty-one more people were injured in the races of the past two years.
According to Interior Minister Thomas Strobl, however, stricter penalties are not necessary: "Legislative action to sanction illegal motor vehicle races harder is not seen," says the paper of the Interior Ministry.
Blue light of July 23rd: Thirsty burglar steals drinks from snacks
Rohrdorf: A man broke into a snack bar on Thursday in Rohrdorf (Calw district) and stole drinks and cash.
A witness heard sounds in the valley road around 3.40 a.m. and ran towards the snack.
There he noticed a man who used his drinks at the refrigerator and then left the snack by a previously knocked-in entrance door.
The perpetrator fled in the direction of the meadows behind the snack.
According to police, the burglar also used a cash register and stole cash in the low three-digit range.
The suspect is described as follows: he is about 1.75 to 1.80 meters tall and of strong stature.
In fact, he was wearing a black hooded sweater, black pants and light shoes.
The police are taking further testimony.
Ackermann sprints to victory at the final stage of the Sibiu Tour
Cycling professional Pascal Ackermann has won his second day victory at the final stage of the 10th Sibiu Tour.
The 26-year-old Palatinate from Team Bora-hansgrohe prevailed on the 109-kilometre-long section with start and finish in Hermannstadt in the mass sprint, after he had already won a stage on Saturday.
It was the season wins three and four for Ackermann.
In the overall standings, his Austrian teammate Gregor Mühlberger prevailed.
The 26-year-old had sovereignly decided the mountain time trial for himself in the morning and thus took the top in the classification.
Only 104 drivers had entered the final stage in the evening.
No less than 18 starters had fallen victim to the time limit in mountain time trials.
"I'm really happy to start the season with a win," Ackermann said after his success on Saturday.
"The sprint was really hectic," said the 26-year-old.
300 meters before the finish he just pulled his sprint, "and it also worked perfectly."
According to the rules of the world association UCI, a corona test was performed on all race participants and their companions six days before the start of the race.
During the entire tour, drivers and caregivers were separated from the organization team and the media in isolated hygiene bubbles.
Spectators at the start and finish were not allowed.
Control Centre gave instructions on lay reanimation
Düsseldorf - Tragic accident on Sunday afternoon in Düsseldorf-Garath.
In a multi-family house, a child (4) suddenly lay lifeless in the water while bathing.
According to the fire department, the emergency call was received just before 1 p.m.
"A control center dispatcher immediately gave instructions for lay resuscitation," a fire brigade spokesman told BILD.
The incoming rescue forces took over the revival measures a little later.
The child in danger of death was transported to the hospital under resuscitation.
Why it happened is unclear.
Police routinely investigate the accident.
The fire brigade spokesman: "We assume a tragic accident in the apartment."
Nuremberg: Unauthorized tuning meeting - police intervene, 700 vehicles and around 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and occasionally over 1,000 people participated in a "tuning meeting" on Saturday night in the parking lot of a furniture store.
The police implemented their announcement to increase control of such events.
A big tuning meeting took place on Saturday evening (25 July 2020) in Nuremberg’s Südstadt.
Several hundred vehicles were involved.
According to police Mittelfranken, around 10.30 p.m., the Nuremberg traffic police detected an increased vehicle traffic in the area of a large parking lot on Ingolstädter Straße.
The police then carried out a number of vehicle inspections.
Just recently, the police had announced that they wanted to step up their efforts against so-called autoposers.
Illegal tuning meeting in Nuremberg: Only a small part of the "scene"
The officials numbered at the top 700 vehicles and about 1100 people, the police reports.
However, only a small proportion of those present can be attributed to the "autoposer" and tuning scene.
Apparently, the majority of the relevant scene responded to the police appeal.
Based on the vehicles and people on site, it can be assumed that these were predominantly viewers.
In addition, the majority of attendees adhered to the current infection protection regulations, in particular the maintenance of the minimum distance and the wearing of a mouth-nose protection.
The on-site control measures ended around 1:00 a.m.
Overall, the officials noted such structural changes in 10 vehicles that the operating permit was expired.
Four of these vehicles had to be secured.
No car races
There were no illegal car races.
"The Central Franconian Police Bureau will continue to keep an eye on what is happening and will continue to implement increased control measures, also in connection with the emergence of spectators," it said.
The News5 agency spoke to Jürgen Schrödinger from the towing company involved: "They all have beautiful rims, we must not scratch them," Schrödinger said.
Special bands would be used for this.
Also because the cars are wider, the company must be careful not to cause damage.
After all, young people should be able to get their cars back harmlessly.”
Employment agency figures: 900 suspected cases of short-time abuse
The Federal Employment Agency (BA) is investigating some 900 suspected cases of abuse of short-time worker money.
"This is extremely little for more than 880,000 companies that have indicated short-time work," said Daniel Terzenbach, Chief Executive Officer responsible for the operational business, to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.
When very many companies suddenly applied for short-term work at the beginning of the corona crisis, the BA had to react quickly.
Usually, the exam lasts up to three weeks.
"We didn't have that much time at our disposal during this hot phase.
The more we will look at the final accounts.
I'm sure there'll be a lot more.
We are not naive and we have a long breath."
Reports of abuse often come from the employees or trade unions concerned.
In addition, the BA uses analysis software to detect abuse patterns.
According to Terzenbach, the BA is preparing for a possible insolvency threshold in the autumn.
"Will there be significantly more insolvencies than last year?
Assessments diverge, but we prepare ourselves for the case and already train our employees in the employment agencies for processing applications for insolvency money".
The numbers are still inconspicuous, Terzenbach said.
World Heritage in Potsdam: Party dissolved in the New Garden
Potsdam - On Friday evening, about 40 young people celebrated a party in the New Garden.
The collection was dissolved at 8:48 p.m. by the district drivers of the Prussian Palaces and Gardens Foundation (SPSG), the foundation announced on PNN request.
The young people then left the park.
On Saturday night, some teenagers would have played rugby in the New Garden.
The meadow was cleared by district drivers, SPSG spokesman Frank Kallensee said on Sunday.
Again and again there are illegal celebrations in the parks
In the parks of the foundation there are repeated accumulations where the distance and hygiene rules Covid-19 circumvention ordinance are not complied with.
At the end of June there was a celebration with about 300 people in the Park Babelsberg, a week later about 150 people celebrated in the New Garden.
Even without the Corona Ordinance, the parks will be closed at dusk.
The storage on the meadows is prohibited according to the parking regulations, there are only a few exceptions.
The Foundation has been complaining for a long time that visitors would leave more and more garbage and destroy protected biotopes.
In Berlin, illegal park parties have, meanwhile, reached a different dimension.
In the Hasenheide in the district of Neukölln, 5000 people celebrated an illegal techno party on Sunday night.
The event was cancelled by the police.
Austria: Mass tests after corona outbreak in tourist resort
With hundreds of tests, authorities have responded to a corona outbreak in the popular Upper Austrian tourist resort of St. Wolfgang.
The number of confirmed cases increased to 48, according to the state authorities in Linz.
More than 100 results were still pending in the evening.
According to this, many of the infected are young interns in tourism companies, but at least one holiday guest was tested positive.
Residents, guests and tourism staff were asked to stay in their accommodations on Saturday evening.
The curfew was set at 11 p.m.
"There are cancellations and cancellations" of bookings, said the head of the tourism association Wolfgangsee, Hans Wieser, the dpa.
Some of the guests also left early.
St. Wolfgang is the most important tourist resort in Upper Austria, with more than 400,000 overnight stays last year.
In a normal season, around a third of guests are Germans.
The first infections were publicly reported on Friday.
The head of the district authority, Alois Lanz, defended on Saturday the behavior of the interns, who had celebrated in several venues and could have been infected there.
"We all liked to do that in our youth," he told the radio station <0xC3><0x96>1.
However, two bars were closed on Friday to prevent further infections.
The tourism association launched an information campaign to raise awareness among young employees about the dangers of Covid-19.
Starting on Saturday, hundreds of employees, holidaymakers and locals were tested.
In addition, all guests who were in St. Wolfgang from 15 July were contacted.
The outbreak evokes memories of the Austrian ski and party resort of Ischgl in Tyrol, which was a center of corona spread throughout Europe during the initial phase of the pandemic.
In total, more than 1,500 people are infected with the virus in Austria.
The main areas of focus for new infections are Vienna and Upper Austria.
Premier League: Man United and Chelsea qualify for Champions League
London (dpa) - English football record champion Manchester United returns to the Champions League after a year of absence.
The Red Devils secured third place in the Premier League on the last matchday by a 2-0 (0-0) success against direct competitor Leicester City.
The Foxes now have to be content with the Europa League, because FC Chelsea still passed and qualified as fourth for the king class.
In the fight against the descent, Aston Villa was allowed to cheer.
Manchester United went through a penalty kick from Bruno Fernandes (71th minute) in the lead.
After a red card for Leicester City in the extra time, Jesse Lingard (90.+8) hit the final score.
Chelsea, in the Champions League quarterfinals opponent of FC Bayern, won thanks to Mason Mount (45.+1) and Olivier Giroud (45.+4) in parallel with 2:0 (2:0) against the Wolverhampton Wanderers.
"That means a lot to me," said coach Frank Lampard, who is also in the final of the FA Cup against Arsenal in his first season as Chelsea coach.
Tottenham Hotspur also benefited from Chelsea's victory against Wolverhampton, who passed the Wolves with a mere 1:1 (1-0) at Crystal Palace and finished sixth in the Europa League.
Aston Villa decided the long-distance duel with FC Watford and AFC Bournemouth for himself, but had to tremble at West Ham United for a long time to maintain the class.
The late lead of Jack Grealish (84th) immediately offset Andrej Jarmolenko (85th).
The 1:1 (0:0) was enough because Watford lost 2:3 (1:3) at Arsenal.
The club, which scored three coaches in the season, declines after five league years.
Just like Bournemouth, who could not save himself by a 3:1 (2:1) at FC Everton.
In the end, one point was missing.
Liverpool, which has been established as an English champion since the end of June, secured a club record with a 3:1 (1:1) win at Newcastle United.
99 points is the highest score the Reds have ever scored in a football season.
Coach Jürgen Klopp and his team narrowly missed the points record in English football.
Manchester City holds the record with 100 points in the 2017/18 season.
After the Newcastle lead in the first minute, Virgil van Dijk (38th), Divock Origi (59th) and Sadio Mané (89th) turned the game on Sunday for Liverpool.
"It was an extraordinary season for this wonderful club," Goalkeeper van Dijk said after the game, "that should inspire us to defend the title.
It's going to be hard."
At the end of the day, the Premier League bosses will be happy.
Due to the coronavirus crisis, football operations in England were interrupted from 13 March to 17 June.
In the meantime, it was even discussed about a premature cancellation or a holding of the remaining games on neutral ground.
Eventually, the season could be played without special events - but as in Germany without spectators in the stadiums.
Arrests and violence in demonstrations against Netanyahu
Protests in Israel against Netanyahu are becoming more and more violent.
During the night there were violent disputes.
The Israeli police took action in Jerusalem on Sunday night against participants in a demonstration against the right-wing conservative Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Twelve people were arrested for participating in riots, police spokesman Mickey Rosenfeld said.
The police used water cannons, among other things, to dissolve the rally.
In total, according to media reports on Saturday evening, around 6,000 people had gathered near Netanyahu’s office.
They protested against unemployment, corruption and Netanyahu’s handling of the corona crisis.
The protesters blew drums, blew horns, and called for Netanyahu to resign.
Participants of a counter-demonstration supporting Netanyahu were also arrested, the news site "ynet" reported.
People also demonstrated in many other places in Israel, including in front of the head of government’s private villa in the coastal city of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
A man was arrested near Tel Aviv for suspicion of spraying pepper spray on protesters on the roadside from a driving car.
Another man was arrested after a knife attack on a protester in the south of the country.
The demonstrator was slightly injured in the throat.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, there have been several demonstrations against Netanyahu.
The rallies accompany the corruption process against the head of government.
Netanyahu has also been criticized for dealing with the corona crisis.
Among other things, he is subjected to premature easing and a lack of preparation for a second corona wave.
The corona crisis has severely affected the country’s economy.
The unemployment rate last year was more than 20 percent.
The number of new coronavirus infections in Israel has recently risen to ever new record levels.
Accident near Ahlen (NRW) - Transporter hits car - nine injured - Ruhrgebiet - Bild.de
Ahlen - A drive-in accident caused nine light injuries on Saturday afternoon on the B58 near Ahlen.
A driver was with her two children (3, 5) in the direction of Beckum.
The police: “Probably she braked suddenly because she wanted to turn.”
The driver of a Mercedes van who was driving behind her must have seen it too late.
He hit the back of the car.
In the accident, three passengers in the car and six in the van were slightly injured.
Several ambulances took her to a nearby hospital.
North Korea locks down border town after Corona suspected case
So far, North Korea has seen its own measures to defend against the coronavirus as a "shining success".
The country is now reporting a suspected case for the first time.
Due to a first official Corona suspected case in the country, North Korea has completely sealed off a major city out of fear of a disaster.
Despite the strictest epidemiological defense measures in the past six months, "the malignant virus could have been introduced into the country," the state media reported.
A state of emergency has been imposed on the region around the border town of Kaesong.
The Communist leadership called out the highest level of alert.
If the suspected case is confirmed, it would be the first official case of infection with Sars-CoV-2 in the sealed country.
North Korea said it had not registered a single infection and described its defenses as a "shining success".
The data has been questioned abroad.
The disease symptoms were reportedly detected in an "outlier" who illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on July 19.
The person left for South Korea three years ago and has now returned across the border.
For crossing the border within the four-kilometre wide and mostly still mined military buffer zone, there was initially no confirmation from South Korea.
South Korea's military, however, according to reports from the national news agency Yonhap, admitted the possibility of an illegal border crossing to North Korea as high.
There have been investigations into some people.
North Korea has called an emergency meeting of the Workers’ Party Political Bureau, chaired by Kim Jong Un, on Saturday.
The "dangerous situation in Kaesong could trigger a deadly and destructive disaster".
"As a preventive measure, Kim ordered Kaesong to be completely blocked and to isolate every district and region from others," the statement said.
The person concerned, as well as all people in Kaesong who had had contact with her, had been placed under quarantine.
Accordingly, the party’s central military commission is to investigate the “outage case” as well as the conduct of the responsible military unit and, if necessary, impose harsh punishment.
It is estimated that about 300,000 people live in Kaesong.
Tension ahead of Council meeting: City-East and noise protection are yet to be discussed before a big summer break
"In addition to environmental issues, the committee members will also vote on the development plan for the large-scale project Downtown Development East," says rather casually in the middle of the city press release for the next municipal council meeting on Tuesday, 28 July, at 4.30 pm in the Grand Hall of the CongressCentrum Pforzheim.
Especially the appreciation of the eastern city is discussed controversially until the end.
The majoritys are narrow, and most recently in individual committees, depending on the attendance, they are even negative.
An appeal from the economy (building, real estate, commerce and IT) to let the project developed from citizenship and then by the administration and municipal council not fail now after almost ten years of preparation, criticized project opponent Reinhard Klein as "extra-parliamentary opposition", "sincere", "speculation", "defamation" and "conscious falsehoods".
"Everyone thinks they know better," says Klein, who has been a member of the municipal council for a year as the only representative of the Pforzheim Citizens' List.
In fact, after reading the treaties, he was in this position: “I know what I’m talking about.”
The exit comes the city cheaper, the Technical City Hall is contrary to the statements of the city administration after grants, whose existence Klein is convinced to renovate for 8.5 million euros.
The city will develop completely differently from what is predicted in the town hall and on the part of the advocates from the economy.
The FDP/FW/UB/LED group, which also rejects the project, presented an alternative concept one day after Klein.
It essentially also envisages the renovation of the Technical City Hall, the opening of the Schlossberg, the rental of the former valley for administrative areas and, ideally, a smaller-scale city centre redesign with local authorities.
Environmental issues play a central role
In addition, environmental issues will play a central role.
Among other things, the municipal council will vote on the noise action plan.
This includes various measures to protect the Pforzheim population from health noise pollution caused by road traffic, including many time reductions.
In a press release, the local transport club Germany welcomes the widespread introduction of Tempo 30. However, the political leaders in the city are not innocent of the fact that this must come because they have only contributed to the massive increase in car traffic and thus the noise by neglecting the regular bus traffic with thinner bars and by little commitment to cycling traffic, according to the VCD.
The municipal council also votes on the participation of the city of the Energy and Climate Protection Agency Pforzheim/Enzkreis.
In addition, the agenda includes the accession to the climate pact of the state of Baden-Württemberg, the re-establishment of parental allowances in the urban daycare facilities and the application for inclusion in the federal Smart City funding.
Citizens are welcome, but must take into account corona protection measures.
With a lot of delay Tim Zimmermann starts the new season
With almost half a year of delay, Tim Zimmermann will start his premiere season in the ADAC GT Masters on July 31.
Before the league of super sports cars can start regular operation, the first test drives were now pending.
For Zimmermann, it was mainly about getting to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3 better.
For a long time, the Corona crisis prevented Tim Zimmermann from starting his first service in the new Lamborghini Huracan from Grasser Racing.
Under special hygiene conditions, this was now possible.
The 23-year-old Langenargener made his first laps on the Lausitzring and got used to his debut in the GT3 car.
"There are already a few things that are different from the Porsche from the previous season," says Zimmermann.
"With the ABS, for example, you have to go into the curves differently.
But it was really a lot of fun.”
Zimmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with whom he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
The Dutchman is already experienced in GT sports despite his only 25 years and was able to help his new teammate in many things.
"I'm not a beginner in motorsport, but every new series brings new challenges," says Zimmermann.
"Steijn and I have a brilliant understanding of each other and we have made tremendous progress at the Lausitzring from session to session as well."
It is precisely there – at the Lausitzring – that the GT Masters will also hold its first race.
As of July 31, the 33 super sports cars will race through the Lusatia.
Zimmermann, who is one of 15 newcomers to the series, knows the route.
In 2015 he was last guest at the Motodrom.
"It worked quickly and I had to get used to the track little," says Zimmermann, who starts for the Friedrichshafen racing community Graf Zeppelin.
"The Lausitzring has a lot of fast passages that you have to meet optimally to be fast".
How fast Zimmermann really is then, it turns out in two weeks.
"Of course, the teams play a bit of poker in the tests," he says.
"In the end, however, we are very satisfied and look forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring".
The race in Brandenburg will be the start of a crowded calendar.
There will be seven races by the beginning of November.
Current status is that no viewers will be allowed - but there is a prominent guest.
In mid-August at the Nürburgring, ex-Formula 1 driver Niko Hülkenberg will take on the GT steering wheel.
British Transport Minister Coldly Caught by Quarantine Decision
The British government's decision to quarantine Spain holidaymakers for two weeks after their return has caught the country's transport minister cold, according to press reports.
Grant Shapps is currently on vacation in Spain, while his colleagues at home decided on the measure on Saturday.
Due to the rising numbers of coronaviruses in Spain, the cabinet in London removed the country from the list of countries from which entry without quarantine requirements is possible.
The new regulation will apply today, Sunday, so Shapps will also have to quarantine after his return.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures for returnees.
But the regulation applies to those who are just on the deadline of leave, only from Saturday, August 1, and was not introduced overnight.
In Austria, Spain is considered one of the "safe countries" for which quarantine is not required.
"Numerous ministers may have known in advance that there is a possibility that a quarantine for holidaymakers will be imposed on Spain," Labour MP Diane Abbot said in a statement.
"But apparently no one has bothered to tell Grant Shapps".
Almost a month after the end of the coronavirus emergency in Spain and the expiry of the strict curfew, the number of infections in the country is rising again.
Virologists blame the nightlife for the renewed spread.
Spain is one of the UK’s favorite holiday destinations.
The British government currently advises against unnecessary trips to mainland Spain, with the exception of the Canary Islands and Balearic Islands, which are particularly popular among British holidaymakers.
So far, more than 272,000 infections with the novel coronavirus and more than 28,000 deaths have been registered in Spain.
Russia: Naval Day: Putin Announces Hypersonic Weapons for Warships
Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced on Naval Day in his country the equipping of warships with state-of-the-art hypersonic weapons.
With these weapons unique in the world, the combat capabilities of the Russian naval forces would be expanded, Putin said on Sunday in St. Petersburg at the central naval parade.
The Ministry of Defence also informed the agency Interfax about successful tests of the hypersonic missile Zirkon built for the Navy.
The hypersonic weapons have a multiple of the speed of sound of around 343 meters per second.
They are seen as weapons of the future.
Underwater Tropedeo continues to be built
It will also be built on the atomically assembled underwater torpedo Poseidon, it said.
The planned drone is planned to destroy coastal targets.
The president, who also sailed on a military boat, said that this year alone, 40 new ships would be put into service at the individual fleet associations of the largest country in the world.
Russia has such a large coastal area as no other country in the world.
For 300 years, the Navy has been protecting Russia reliably, Putin said at the day celebrated by sailors nationwide.
Also in many other Russian coastal towns, the naval forces celebrated the day of the navy with parades.
In Syria, where Russia is fighting alongside ruler Bashar al-Assad, the military demonstrated strength at a weapons show in the Mediterranean port of Tartus.
Ammunition was also fired.
A video released by the Ministry of Defence showed not only warships, including a submarine, but also combat helicopters and jets.
Hurricane "Hanna" reaches Texas: Aid made more difficult due to coronavirus
This year’s first hurricane over the Atlantic Ocean landed in Texas.
Life-threatening floods, strong winds and heavy rains are now threatening parts of the U.S. state, the National Hurricane Center told the U.S. climate agency NOAA at night on Sunday (local time).
Governor Greg Abbott declared a state of emergency for many counties.
The corona pandemic in Texas is making the work of the aid workers more difficult, Abbott said, according to US media.
Evacuated to be cautious
"Every hurricane is a huge challenge," Abbott said, according to the Houston Chronicle newspaper.
Looking at the cyclone in Texas, he added, "This challenge is complicated and is getting even worse considering that it is sweeping through an area that is the state's most affected area by Covid-19."
According to the Johns Hopkins University, around 5,000 people have died in Texas alone as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.
Abbott called on people who had to leave their homes to be cautious.
They should not disregard practices “to which we have become accustomed,” such as wearing masks, the governor said, according to CBS.
It is important that everyone keeps a distance.
In some places, hotel rooms were also provided.
In addition, Corona should be tested in emergency shelters.
At first, damage was reported only from the coastal town of Port Mansfield.
Storm warning taken back
With wind speeds of up to 150 kilometers per hour, "Hanna" was reportedly hit on land on the island of Padre Island just off the Texas coast.
The tropical storm had previously been upgraded to the lowest level one hurricane.
For the stretch of coast from Port Mansfield to Sargent, a storm surge warning had first been issued and later taken back.
Authorities expected a weakening as "Hanna" moves further inland and heads towards the northeast of Mexico.
"Douglas" moves to Hawaii
In the Pacific, Hurricane "Douglas" was on the way to Hawaii at night on Sunday at wind speeds of around 150 kilometers per hour.
However, the hurricane center expected it to weaken further.
According to the forecast, he is expected to be near the largest islands in Hawaii on Sunday (local time) - then as a storm just below the hurricane threshold.
Over the Atlantic, NOAA expected an above-average active hurricane season this year, according to a May forecast.
From June to the end of November, up to ten hurricanes could be expected, of which up to six could become very strong hurricanes, the agency said.
On average, there are six hurricanes per year over the Atlantic Ocean, three of which develop into storms of great strength.
Given available climate data and the higher water temperature in the Atlantic and Caribbean, the likelihood of a normal season is only 30 percent, one below average is even only 10 percent, it said at the time.
U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted that his administration is closely watching the storms and is in contact with the affected states.
Video assistant "punished" Sassuolo
Sassuolos Filip Djuricic was denied two goals
Naples - Four goals scored, four goals denied: Sassuolo Calcio experienced a raven-black night at the 0:2 (0:1) at the SSC Naples in the Italian football league Serie A - and was really mad at the referee's video assistant.
"A festival of unspecified goals for Sassuolo.
Never before has the VAR acted so hard against a team," commented the "Corriere dello Sport".
Host Naples had gone through a goal from outside defender Elseid Hisaj in the 8th minute in the lead, in the 32nd minute Filip Djuricic initially cheered the compensation.
The Video Assistant Referee (VAR) took the hit back due to a offside position.
Five minutes later, Djuricic shot the ball into the net again - again the VAR intervened.
Also the goals of attackers Francesco Caputo (50th) and Domenico Berardi (61th) took the referee team back after the VAR notice.
In the extra time, Allan made the 2-0 finish for Naples and the bitter evening for Sassuolo perfect.
"The VAR is worse for Sassuolo than a radar trap on the road and punishes Sassuolo like no team before.
The new technology sets records,” writes Gazzetta dello Sport.
FC Bayern Munich: Pavard injured
Munich (dpa) - The start to the hot preparation phase for the Champions League began for doubles winner FC Bayern with a setback.
Hansi Flick, who recovered after a short holiday and a few days of training, has already had to consider how he can rebuild his successful defence after the injury of world champion Benjamin Pavard.
The Frenchman, who has the third most minutes of use behind captain Manuel Neuer and midfielder Joshua Kimmich, suffered a ligament injury to the left foot root and threatens to be missing in decisive royal-class duels.
In Munich’s dirty weather, the right-wing defender broke off a training game and was driven off the pitch with a golf card.
How long the unrestricted regular player has to pause in the fight for the title is open.
A play in the eighth-final return match against FC Chelsea on 8 August is likely to be difficult, but the 24-year-old can hope for the final tournament starting on 12 August in Lisbon.
But Bayern will not let the misfortune of training on Sunday stop them.
In his personal triple formula, Flick named the three attributes he wants to see from his stars on the way to Portugal’s capital.
Quality, intensity and concentration are to be demonstrated by his victorious title collectors in the ideally following 28 days until the king class final on 23 August.
"We have mastered the compulsory tasks with championship and cup simply excellent.
Now we need to create something special,” said Flick.
Until the Munich can deal with the final tournament and previously a training camp in the Algarve concrete, but is the eighth-final obligation against FC Chelsea.
After the 3-0 in the first leg before the Corona break, the Londoners in the home arena should not become a Bayern nightmare again like in the lost "Finale dahoam" in 2012.
“We have to go through the door first.
We want to win, create good conditions and fuel confidence with a good game," Flick said.
A test to tune in is on Friday against Olympique Marseille.
With a long speech, Flick had sworn in his stars, who had 13 days of holiday after the double, on a unique August.
He welcomed 31 players on Säbener Straße, including the new players around Edel-Shopping Leroy Sané, who met all new colleagues on the pitch for the first time after his change from Manchester City.
"Leroy, like all the new ones, has been well-fitted," Flick said.
But instead of talking about the new season, when Sané & Co. are no longer allowed to just coach, Flick preferred to talk about the current title project of the German series champion.
After days of single and small group training, team strength is now being trained for the Londoners, who are in the game rhythm in contrast to the Flick ensemble.
After that, the Munich could face a quarter-final against FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi, in the semi-finals are Real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin possible opponents.
A path to the final in Lisbon "is not quite that easy," stressed the head coach, who can rely on the services of his new assistant Miroslav Klose in training from Tuesday.
The World Cup record scorers Klose and Flick know about so many common tournament preparations, which is especially important in the 0-to-100 match.
With his current team, working is "a pleasure," Flick praised.
The "focus on winning" is an impressive trait of his team.
The tournament with nine teams on Sunday was also ambitious.
All of the performers were there, including Thiago and defender David Alaba, whose stay beyond the royal-class season is not assured.
Formula 1 needs a special rule to choose its world champion
Since it is not possible to drive on the required number of continents, the FIA must improvise in order to award the World Cup titles.
All American races have been cancelled.
Race calendar is becoming more concrete
The race calendar of the current Formula 1 season continues to take shape.
In addition to the ten confirmed Grand Prix, three other race tracks were added during the week.
In October, the Nürburgring in Germany and Portimão in Portugal will be driven.
On the first of November, Lewis Hamilton and Co. are competing for World Cup points on the Italian traditional race track in Imola.
This means that the 2020 race calendar includes 13 races as of now.
“We are delighted to continue to make great progress in completing our plans for the 2020 season,” said Chase Carey.
A total of 15 to 18 races in the world of motorsport will be completed in this exceptional season.
Formula 1 will finish its season in Asia.
The final race calendar is to be fixed and published in the coming weeks.
According to media reports, before the races in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi in December, performances in Vietnam and Malaysia could take place at the end of November.
Rules require races on three continents
The rules of Formula 1 require races on at least three continents for the award of the world championship.
Even if, as currently planned, only two continents will be driven, there will be a world champion.
With the help of a special rule, the FIA wants to award the titles citing "exceptional circumstances" due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The traditional season start in Australia in March had to be cancelled at short notice due to the impending corona crisis.
A return to the continent this year is not an issue.
In addition, Formula 1 will not be a guest in America this year.
Rejection is Criticized in Brazil
Due to the tense corona situation, the races will not take place in Canada, the USA, Mexico and Brazil.
"We are looking forward to being with them again next season," Carey said.
The cancellation of the American races was criticized especially in Brazil: "The cancellation came as no surprise for us, but we cannot accept the reasons for it," said Tamas Rohonyi, promoter of the Grand Prix in São Paulo.
For example, the number of infections in the São Paulo area is significantly lower than in other regions of Brazil.
The concerns of some teams about not wanting to drive in Brazil would also not justify a rejection.
Be prepared for the required security measures.
Greta Thunberg: Evil Eyes on Donald Trump Gone Around the World
Greta Thunberg spoke about her meeting with US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was a guest on Stephen Colbert’s famous Latenight show via video switches and revealed in the interview what she had in mind during her encounter with Donald Trump.
Climate Kivist Greta Thunberg was a guest on a popular U.S. late-night show via video switches.
Among other things, she told about her struggle against the powerful of the world.
The teenager also spoke about her famous "evil look" at her meeting with Donald Trump.
In the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg has made her relentless commitment to the “Fridays For Future” movement.
Now she spoke in a well-known Latenight show about her plans for the future as well as her meeting with US President Donald Trump at the UN climate summit last year.
Latenight presenter Stephen Colbert greeted 17-year-old Thunberg in your show on Tuesday and conducted a longer interview with the Swede.
She spoke not only about her fight against climate change, but also about her conflict with the world’s powerful.
"There are some things that surprised me," she said.
"How far people go to direct the focus away from the climate crisis," she said.
“Everything from organized hate campaigns to threats just because a group of children is going out on the streets,” she said.
Heads of state and leading politicians who ridicule her on social media or even try to silence her, she finds it "fun" because the reactions show her "since they have no other answer to that."
It became particularly interesting at the end of the interview, when Greta Thunberg was addressed to a well-known scene in which she threw a bitterly evil look at US President Trump.
At the 2019 UN Climate Summit in New York, for which the nudist sailed across the Atlantic, her expressive gaze was captured by the cameras and has since been seen by countless people on the Internet.
The short clip created a GIF, an animated image that eventually became one of the most commonly used images for Trump opponents.
But what did the 17-year-old think about the US president at that moment?
To Stephen Colbert's relatively open-ended question, she replied briefly and dryly: "To be honest, I don't think that needs any further explanation."
The experienced satirist Colbert had probably not expected the swift answer and disappeared from the picture laughing briefly.
With her “How dare you?” speech on the principles of climate protection, she was remembered by many at the climate conference.
Ex-Dortmunder Immobile with triple pack for Lazio Rome
Ciro Immobile is now on par with Bavaria’s Robert Lewandowski in the race for Europe’s Golden Shoe.
Former Dortmunder Ciro Immobile still has the best chances of becoming the goal scorer king in the Italian football championship.
The former BVB professional contributed three goals in the 5:1 (1:1) victory of Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona, including two converted penalties in the follow-up times of both halves.
Thus, the 30-year-old from the table fourth has two season games before the end now 34 season goals on his account - just as many scored Robert Lewandowski from FC Bayern Munich in the past Bundesliga season.
In Italy, Cristiano Ronaldo follows with 30 goals so far, the Portuguese superstar hit with the leader in the evening still on Sampdoria Genoa.
Fleetwood-Mac co-founder Peter Green has died.
His life was like a roller coaster ride: after a fast ascent with Fleetwood Mac, it went steeply downhill and then slowly back up.
Blues rock guitarist Peter Green has died at the age of 73.
Genius guitarist, drug junkie, cult fan: The co-founder of the band Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, is dead.
He died peacefully in his sleep at the age of 73, family members said in an official statement on Saturday that another statement would be announced for the next few days.
Top musicians like Peter Frampton honored Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
Mick Fleetwood spoke in an emotional response of a "monumental loss" for all former and current members of the band Fleetwood Mac.
The drummer Fleetwood and the guitarist Green had founded the now legendary band in London in 1967, until today his dreamy instrumental hit "Albatross" is unforgettable.
The musician's life ("The End Of The Game", "In The Skies") resembled a roller coaster ride.
With Fleetwood Mac, Green experienced a rapid rise - the band celebrated their greatest successes but then without him.
There was a dispute, among other things, because Green wanted to donate all the profits of the group to charity.
He began to perform in wide robes and with a large crucifix.
Mental health problems also played a role.
Three years after the band was founded, Green left the band in 1970.
This was followed by a social decline.
The blues rock guitarist suffered from drug abuse and schizophrenia, as biographers reported.
For a long time, Green was treated in psychiatry.
During much of the 1970s, the musician disappeared from the scene.
He is said to have temporarily lived on the street, worked as a cemetery gardener and spent some time in an Israeli kibbutz.
Green was born in 1946 to a Jewish working-class family in the London district of Bethnal Green.
At an early age, he was enthusiastic about US blues musicians such as B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
At the age of eleven, he learned the first guitar grips.
At the age of 15, the teenager began playing the guitar professionally and five years later got the chance to play as lead guitarist for the instrumental band Peter B's Looners on stage.
Shortly afterwards, he was hired as a substitute for his idol Eric Clapton at the Bluesbreakers.
In the middle of the blues boom, Green founded Fleetwood Mac in the summer of 1967 with his Bluesbreakers colleagues Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
The song "Albatross", composed by Green, gave the group the first number 1 hit in the winter of 1968/69 and catapulted them to the top of the British music scene.
But the rapid rise soon showed its shadows: Green did not cope with the media rumours, his experiments with the drug LSD became more and more extreme.
He later commented on life between music and addiction in an interview: "The worst thing that has happened to me in life is the drugs - the best thing was to land a number one hit."
Towards the end of the decade, Green was surprisingly successful in 1979 with an album inspired by religious themes.
Fleetwood Mac, meanwhile, swam on a wave of success without him in a new formation.
Their 1977 album "Rumours" sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Despite several small solo successes, Green did not make a major comeback until he started again in 1996 with a group of friends musicians.
The Daily Telegraph spoke of a rock star who had returned to Earth.
Free from drugs, Green released several albums with the Peter Green Splinter Group until the band dissolved in 2004.
For music experts, he was already a blues legend in his lifetime – and with his gentle sound one of the most influential guitarists of the past decades.
