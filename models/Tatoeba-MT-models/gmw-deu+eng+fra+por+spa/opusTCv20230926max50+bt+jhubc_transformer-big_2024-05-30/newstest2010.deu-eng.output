Barack Obama is the fourth US President to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
U.S. President Barack Obama will visit Oslo, Norway for 26 hours to be the fourth U.S. President in history to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
In addition, he receives the diploma, medal and a cheque worth $1.4 million for his extraordinary efforts to intensify world diplomacy and cooperation among peoples.
The head of the White House arrives tomorrow with his wife Michelle in the northern metropolis and will be busy all the time.
First, he visits the Nobel Institute, where he meets for the first time with the five committee members who elected him in October from 172 people and 33 organizations.
The presidential couple has scheduled a meeting with Norwegian King Harald V and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit reaches its peak with the ceremony in which Obama takes over the prestige prize.
He is the fourth president of the United States, but only the third to receive the prize directly in office.
The White House has already announced that Obama will talk about the war in Afghanistan when he takes over the prize.
The president does not want to evade this issue because he knows that he will take the prize as a president who is currently at war in two countries.
He intensified the war effort a few days ago by sending more troops to Afghanistan, which none of his critics forget to highlight.
At the ceremony, Obama also received the gold medal, diploma and check of ten million Swedish kronor (approximately 24 million Czech kronor).
He intends to donate the money to charity, but has not yet decided on a concrete charitable work.
The event program then includes a banquet with the President and his wife, with the Prime Minister and another 250 invited guests in addition to Norway’s King and Queen.
Obama was very cautious about the price from the start.
He said, for example, that he feels that he doesn’t deserve the prize.
He also repeated several times that the prize is not only for him, but for all who aspire to the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement, he stated that for him this is "invitation to action".
Conservationists accused of blackmail
The Leitmeritz police accused the chairman of the civil society "Naturschutzgemeinschaft Leitmeritz" of extortion.
In several cases he filed appeals last year against some construction proceedings, for the withdrawal of his appeals he demanded money from investors in his favor, said the Leitmeritz police spokeswoman, Alena Romova.
The chairman of the Leitmeritz-Naturschutzgemeinschaft is Lubomir Studnicka.
He is now in prison and faces a prison sentence of up to three years.
The sorting trash containers in Brno do not smell good
In Prague, people can sort the beverage packaging, in the southern Moravian towns you can find the sorting trash containers every step of the way.
And in Brno?
There you would have to reserve a few minutes to find the suitable trash cans.
I am not saying that waste separation in Brno would not work at all.
But it seems to me that the Councillors are insufficiently concerned about this problem, even though we are the second largest city in the Republic.
Brno is located in the waste divisions in the Urwaldliga, not only because we as citizens here can always dispose of only paper, glass and plastics in the sorting containers, but above all because of the number of trash cans for such waste.
Have you ever tried to dispose of the PET bottles in a collection basket, for example?
This is just art, it takes time and strong nerves.
The only spot I have found so far is the Moravian square opposite the Goose hit.
Mr Onderka and his colleagues should not be annoyed, but that seems far too little to me.
Apart from the fact that the waste separation is not a honey dish in other parts.
Entire ranks of my friends therefore prefer not to sort the waste at all.
Out of laziness.
It is too far from the garbage bins.
I'm not surprised.
I even offered to dispose of a few glass and plastic bottles after the celebration.
But on the Konicova street I did not see any paint rubbish barrels in sight.
Fortunately, I came to the right place when I was driving the tram.
The garbage almost ran over.
This is still the center of Brno, which represents the whole city, isn’t it?!
However, ecology and some kind of aesthetics probably leave the Brno socialists cold.
They prefer to buy the city an ice hockey league that shames us all over the Republic instead of buying a few more trash cans and offering the sorting of further raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I am glad that I was able to confirm my assumption even with official statistics after searching the Internet for a while.
According to the data of the company EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst in the whole district of South Moravia.
The Paroubek budget has withdrawn the money for pensions and sickness benefits
After the Left Party gave more money to farmers and officials despite the government’s view, there is no more money in the budget for pensions, sickness benefits and housing savings.
But also not for the sovereign debt interest rates or for the international court disputes.
This is causing even more problems for those who will be in government in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists imposed the salary increase for some groups, they expected the government to borrow the money for the sensitive expenses, old-age pensions or for the sickness benefits. "This is just a postponement of the problems into the future, mining," says Janota.
Of the loans are nominally paying ever higher interest, and you have to refund the money at some point.
Too much to choose from, the state treasury is empty.
If the social benefits or costs for the state enterprise are not reduced, the tax is to be increased.
For all those to whom the Left Party now gave more money: the fire brigade, the teachers, the farmers.
And later for their children as well.
For the pensions or the sickness benefit, from whose account 1.8 billion have disappeared, people need not be afraid to get that money.
But at the price that the state is in debt even more - next year, not only 163 billion will be missing in the state treasury, but far more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, debt will thus increase faster and faster, and together with it also the costs and interest.
The state will need the money to compensate, then it will no longer be enough to raise the value added tax only slightly or cut the maternity allowance, as the government did in its counter-deficit package.
Because of the money circulation in favor of some electoral groups, five billion will also be missing next year for the expansion of highways and railways.
These are mainly the sections won in the competition, which can no longer be re-projected and possibly reduced.
At the very most, which is not free.
This means delay or discontinuation of thirty large buildings, also endangers the European monetary creation, warns the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The CSSD has proposed that it resolves the outflow of money salomonically – it attacks the CEZ share dividends, in which the state owns the majority, and from which the money is then distributed into the Transport Fund.
The problem is that the amount of the dividend is never certain and it is by no means an infinite source.
Last year, CEZ put 18 billion in the budget.
Every year, the dividends are used to pay the environmental damage liquidation, the pension account is replenished and this money also serves as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
With this trick, according to EU rules, the actual budget deficit increases to the level of 5.7 percent of GDP.
But this is not yet the end of the carnival of revolutions.
Almost three billion cut the budget for various compensations for victims of communism and crimes, or for expenses for court disputes, even for building savings.
Whether the state can cope without this money is not certain.
This is pure gambling.
If we lose an international court dispute, we have to pay it anyway, Janota clarifies.
The minister must then save the money in-house or, in the worst case, attack the government budget reserve.
One hundred million are also missing for the already begun two-billion project "State Treasury", which is to allow to monitor on-line what the individual authorities spend the money for.
The first stage starts in January.
If the finance minister does not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and in this case sanctions would come, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will master two operating systems
The Americans expect a mobile phone in the future, where the user can switch between different operating systems by pressing a single button.
The proposed plans look promising.
It is enough to press just one button, and from Windows Mobile will switch to Android within a few seconds.
This is exactly what the American company VMware wants to introduce, which focuses primarily on the development of virtual software for computers.
We enable you to execute two user profiles simultaneously on your mobile phone.
You can switch between them, you can separate them into two home and work profiles.
Both will work in parallel, Srinivas Krishnamurti of the company VMware indicated in the interview for the magazine Computerworld.
It was presented in November of last year and presented for the first time a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
The virtualization of smart phones is not fiction.
VMware already successfully presented the smartphone test pattern with two operating systems to the journalists.
One was a modified Nokia N800 with a 128 MB RAM memory, on which simultaneously the aforementioned systems ran Windows Mobile and Android.
The development of the new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
Now, the company VMware is working with the European and American operators on the smartphone virtualization and the devices are expected to come to the customer within the year 2012.
The lack of snow in the mountains afflicts the hotel owners
Snowless slopes worry not only the Giant Mountains residents.
The lack of snow also deters people from ordering ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
That is why you can still get free rooms in Giant Mountains for all winter dates including Christmas and New Year's Eve.
Our pages are frequently visited.
People go through the offers, set the prices, but now they are afraid to order binding.
And when they call us, they immediately ask if in our opinion this year's Christmas will be on snow or "on mud", the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info, Martin Jandura, quoted.
Who wants the New Year's Eve stay in the spindle mill exactly according to his ideas, should not hesitate with the order.
Those who prefer saving and where the quality of the stay comes second only, can try to wait a few more days.
The Spindelmühle hotel owners now mainly only offer weekly stays for New Year’s Eve.
I think they will try to sell them for a while, but then they too will have to give in and respond to shorter times.
And then the free rooms will quickly disappear, Jandura appreciated.
The travel agency Ingtours in Vrchlabi always offers free beds on all winter dates.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which is not yet sold out.
In our offer, about half of the seats are still free.
That is why we have already prepared some cheaper Christmas stays for the last moment, said the director of the travel agency Ingtours, Petr Schiefert.
New Year’s Eve in Giant Mountains can also be offered by the Vrchlabi travel agency, but there are fewer free seats here.
The first fourteen days in February are also good sales, the remaining winter dates are sold on average.
This year, the interest in winter stays is also negatively influenced by the fact that there is always no snow in the Giant Mountains.
People are waiting to see if snow falls.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are snowed within a week, Christmas will also be sold out, says Schiefert.
Conversely, and slightly better than last year, it manages to occupy the rooms at the Hotel Horizont in Pecpod Snezkou.
We are about five percent better than last year.
On New Year’s Eve and Christmas we only have a few free rooms.
There is great interest in the Polish holidays in Janua, and in February the business will also run well, informed the director of the best Pec hotel, Karel Rada.
For the New Year’s Eve stays, Hotel Omnia is also occupied by 80 percent at the central parking lot in Janske Lazne.
On the other hand, half of the beds remain free at the newest hotel in Janske Lazne for Christmas.
We were pleasantly surprised this year by January, for which we are currently already 60 percent occupied.
February is now a bit weaker, but at the moment when the snow comes, the interest in staying in the Giant Mountains will certainly increase, said the director of the Hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
The Giant Mountains hotel owners are now waiting for a bigger snowfall.
On Thursday it should cool down and if it comes to rain, it should be snow on the mountains.
But after that, a warming is to come again, informed Jiri Jakubsky from the location of the Czech Weather Office in Hradec Kralove.
USA: Repetition is Mother of Wisdom
It is almost weird that Barack Obama, the president with his reputation of the smartest, repeats the strategy of his predecessor on the Afghanistan issue, which he himself considered the stupidest.
When he finally sweated out his eagerly anticipated Afghanistan doctrine, it turned out that he wrote it off over the copy paper from the Bush-Iraq scenario three years ago.
Not only did he use the phrase "as in Iraq" several times in the text itself, he even used the name of the Bush Declaration of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "New Forward Path" without hesitation.
Three years ago, he himself criticized the Bush idea of sending fresh contingents of troops to Iraq, which was plagued by the civil war, as an "irresponsible and catastrophic decision".
However, the following months showed that the Bush strategy, based on recommendations from the military, was the only one possible and very successful in that today no one talks about Iraq at all in the news.
This did not improve Bush’s reputation, for objectively he left his successor with a much more grateful starting point than was to be expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes the miracle will repeat itself.
The military again asked him for an increase in the contingent, especially the commander-in-chief of the Afghanistan operation, General Stanley McCristal, who, despite the subordination habits, harshly criticized the roaring shooters in the White House.
He called for 40,000 soldiers to reverse the situation for the better.
The President delayed for three months, but did not come up with a better idea, and so he cheated the general about 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe, he has pressed the pledge for another 5,000, even though he himself originally expected at least 10,000.
The most problematic thing about the entire Obama strategy is his plan to withdraw troops from Afghanistan in 18 months, and to complete this process in three years. The entire Obama doctrine leaves more questions than answers.
Some doubt that the halved increase will have the same effect as the measure in Iraq.
Despite the fraternal war of recent years, the Iraq society is relatively well structured and its leaders honor the values.
The Afghan situation is characterized by the contraindication - no one can be trusted and no agreements are kept.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, who are used to changing their minds every day.
The political institutions, even if they were formally established correctly, remain only fake buildings, behind which the patriarchal tribal relations will continue to flourish.
The balancing of interests between the different ethnic groups is unusually complicated, especially because of the obscurity of the situation, which complicates the Pakistan and Iran influences even more.
The construction of a "capable state", which is the minimalist goal of the whole operation, is also very unrealistic.
Time horizon of Obama’s strategy alienated by its voluntarism
Over the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only further deteriorated and now it is on the verge of explosion.
Believing that the little soldiers who have erupted into the war cry of "early return" can create a miracle here, only a truly romantic soul who is not impressed by facts can.
From a political point of view, the date for the withdrawal of troops is pure irresponsibility, because the Taliban will take it as the indirect confession of the American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to participate in the fighting in Afghanistan is fading.
Europe’s politicians cannot and do not want to explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy is related to the war in the Hindu Kush mountain range.
Another possible factor that can radically influence the situation is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions do not affect the Iranians, the United States will face a very difficult question of whether the problem cannot be solved with troops.
This question needs to be answered during the time that America moves to Obama’s victorious withdrawal from Afghanistan.
However, any solution will also mean a dramatic change in the Afghan situation.
The only consolation for Barack Obama is the fact that there are still three years left until the presidential election, and so there is still enough time for him to resort to a different strategy if it turns out to be a total failure.
Bank Goldman Sachs managers no longer receive bonuses in cash
The senior executives of the American bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive bonuses in cash this year.
This was announced by the company, which is responding to the harsh criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 top managers receives shares instead of the money, but they are only allowed to sell in five years.
In addition, the shares can be withdrawn from the managers in the event that they are overly risky.
Goldman Sachs is thus putting itself at the forefront of efforts to combine Wall Street’s premium bonuses with long-term performance, according to Reuters.
I believe Wall Street is aware of the far-reaching direction in which it has to go, JPMorgan’s former banker Douglas Elliott said.
The problem lies in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs became a target of criticism after setting aside nearly $17 billion in premium bonuses for the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of premium bonuses over the course of this year is likely to exceed $20 billion, according to the agency Reuters, despite the measure announced today.
The high premium bonuses in the banking sector have become the hottest political issue in a number of countries since the start of the financial crisis.
Britain reported on Wednesday that it intends to charge bankers’ bonuses, which exceed <0xC2><0xA3>25,000, once with a tax of 50 percent.
Similar steps are also being taken by France.
This year, women have won the Nobel Prizes in all disciplines, except physics.
Five record-breaking women took over this year’s Nobel Prizes in the subject categories and for literature from the hands of the King of Sweden Carl XVI Gustaf in Stockholm today.
In addition to the four female scientists, the German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Müller, was among them.
The Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with their compatriot Jack Szostak for research in the chromosome field.
The prize for chemistry was awarded to Israeli Ada Jonath, along with the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, for elucidating the ribosome structure and function.
The last laureate awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics, which the American Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson received for analysis of the economic report.
The only subject category in which no woman received a Nobel Prize this year was physics.
Today, scientists Charles Kao and George Smith, together with Willard Boyl, have won this award for the CCD chip invention, which is the basis of all digital cameras, fax machines or astronomical telescopes.
Each of these laureates has received the Diploma, the Nobel Medal and the Certificate of Acquisition of the Money Prize.
This amounts to 10 million Swedish kroner in each category.
If there are several prize winners in each category, the cash prize will be divided among them.
Traditionally, the American President, Barak Obama, has received the most anticipated Nobel Peace Prize this afternoon in Oslo.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversies of his appointment because he is only at the beginning of his path, and moreover, at the head of the country that wages two wars - in Iraq and in Afghanistan.
In keeping with his policy, however, he added that wars in certain situations are necessary to achieve world peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota is considering resignation. Klaus invited him to the castle
President Vaclav Klaus welcomes Finance Minister Eduard Janota on Friday morning, who is reflecting on his stay in government because he disagrees with the execution of the state budget for next year in the form it was approved by the Assembly on Wednesday.
It is believed that the budget and perhaps Janota’s staying in the cabinet will be the topics of the Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the budget deficit is too high, which also deepens the crisis of public finances.
The presidential spokesman, Radim Ochvat, informed about the meeting.
Janota wants to negotiate with Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday to remain in his position.
According to the budget law, which is now given to Klaus for signature, the Czech Republic should be operating with a deficit of 163 billion kroner.
In parliament, however, the Left Party proposals for money-turn were voted on Wednesday and the money for the state officials' salaries, for the maintenance of the social benefits and direct wages of farmers increased.
The government has opposed the proposals of the Social Democracy that they are covertly increasing the budget deficit.
On the one hand, the Left Party and the government, Klaus and the Right Party, on the other, therefore, a sharp domestic political dispute has arisen, which raises the question mark about the further work of the Fischer Cabinet, on whose design the ODS, CSSD and the Green Party agreed in spring.
Critics claim that the budget, as adopted by Parliament, virtually liquidates the package of austerity measures enforced by the fishermen’s government in the autumn, and which they understand is intended to end government debt.
Klaus, who can but does not have to sign the law on the state budget, explained today at the breakfast discussion with the entrepreneurs that the politicians neglected the "serious problem" that represents "the unsustainable deficit" of public finances for a long time.
In his opinion, there is no good solution today.
An improvement could only be achieved by a strong government that could build on a broader consensus among political parties.
ODS Chairman Mirek Topolanek stated that the budget is horrific, and the government should weigh its continued existence.
ODS Chairman Petr Necas told CTK that the Cabinet concept, with the support of CSSD, ODS and the Green Party, obviously no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer described similar words in the editorial as "strong sayings".
The CSSD chief, Jiri Paroubek, responded to the Topolanek words that the budget deficit was horrific, that the former Topolanek government had prepared for this year, and that exceeds 200 billion crowns.
As early as Wednesday, the CSSD rated the approval of the state budget for the next year as a success.
The People’s Party was also satisfied.
Mandela was played in new film by Clint Eastwood by Morgan Freeman
South Africans claim that the world's new Hollywood film "Invictus: The Unbeaten" shows much of the country's struggle and victories despite some criticisms that the lead role was occupied by an American actor.
The story tells of sport, race, and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid government system in the South African Republic, as well as its first black president, Nelson Mandela, portrays the American Oscar actor, Morgan Freeman, in his life story.
Freeman said he was asked by the ninety-one-year-old Mandela if he could portray him in the Eastwood movie.
Another important role is played by Matt Damon.
I told him, "If I'm going to play you, I have to meet you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who received the award for his role in the Eastwood drama from the boxing section "Million Dollar Baby," already represented the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, which eventually became the slave owner, a fictional US president, and also God in "Evan Almighty," but rarely someone who is still alive and is as important as Mandela for many people.
The former South African statesman was imprisoned for 27 years for his active activity in ending apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was set free in 1990 and for four years he became president of the country.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "unbeaten," and at the same time that is the name of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, which was published in 1875.
The requirement was how to speak
The film portrays a real event in which Nelson Mandela joined forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to unite the country. The new President Mandela knows that his people still remain racially and economically divided even after apartheid.
He believes he can unite his people through sport, so he decides to unite the rugby players that are among the outsiders worldwide.
Finally, the South African team rises to the World Cup of 1995.
Freeman worked for several years to bring the Mandela story to the cinema screen.
He had no other goal than to play this role in such a way as to bring it as close to reality as possible, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge, of course, was to speak like him.
The actor said if he and the world politician were in the same country, he would try to meet Mandela, have dinner with him, and be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake Mandela’s hand.
I have noticed that when I shake your hand, I take over your energy, it is transmitted, and I had the feeling that I know what you are feeling, he said.
It is important to me to become another person.
Matt Damon portrays François Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team, in which the white players prevailed.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for the role in the tough rugby world.
It was a big surprise for him when he first met Pienaar in his house.
I remember when I ringed the doorbell that it opened and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was, 'In the movie, I look much bigger.'
Despite the obvious differences in the stature of the actors compared to their actual role models, he has received positive reviews under the direction of director Eastwood "Invictus: Unbeaten" and one also speaks of prospects for an Oscar.
The Daily Variety’s film critic Todd McCarthy summarized his analysis in the following words: “This was a very good story, a very well-executed film.”
In the film reviews on the websites rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive reviews.
Light secret over Norway: Russians have tested a rocket
A special light effect of unknown origin was observed over Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defence admitted yesterday that an intercontinental ballistic missile was being tested near the Norwegian border.
However, the launch was unsuccessful again and the rocket referred to as the "Bulava" type, which was originally supposed to be the pride of the Russian army, will slowly become the nightmare of the Russian generality as well as the Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin.
His repeated presence on site in the missile test also had no positive effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava has mostly not been launched or damaged in the air.
In the Russian newspapers it is already written about "Bulava" as about a "missile that does not fly".
A rocket that does not fly but lights up
This 13th attempt was normal in the beginning.
It was only at the end of the flight that technical damage to the rocket occurred.
The engine probably exploded in the third stage of the missile.
This time, "Bulava" launched from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskiy, which sailed under the waters of the White Sea.
This type of rocket allows the launch from the submarine.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light caused by an indeterminate flying object over northern pathways was actually the damaged "Bulava".
In addition, the Norwegians have not doubted since the first moment that it is a Russian missile.
This time the generality has resisted, claiming that one cannot clearly speak of a failure.
The first two stages of the missile did not fail and only the third stage was affected by the accident.
In the previous cases, the engines were damaged in the first stage.
Even though no test start was made without errors, the Department of Defense’s management considers only six out of thirteen to be unsuccessful.
The almost fifty percent success therefore fulfills the generality with optimism and thus continues to claim that the "Bulava" will once without problems fly and even carry up to ten hypersonic nuclear warheads with a total weight of up to 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov has signed an annual contract with the CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
The legendary defender Vjaceslav Fetisov introduces himself in a professional ice hockey game at the age of 51.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup holder helps out his team CSKA Moscow in need, and probably already competes in the Friday duel KHL against Petersburg.
Fetisov, who finished his career at the age of forty, in 1998, is currently president of the CSKA.
After Denis Kuljas was injured, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov has trained regularly and agreed that he will support the team.
We just need to clarify some remaining formalities, the agency AP quoted the coach of the Moscow club of Sergei Nemcinov.
Meanwhile, it is not clear whether the comeback of the famous hockey player will affect only one game.
I mean that Fetisov is one of those who can raise the morale of other players, Nemcinov pointed out.
When Fetisov returns to the ice, he will become the oldest Russian professional ice hockey game, according to AP.
In the NHL, legendary striker Gordie Howe played an entire season for Hartford at age fifty-one, earning 15 hits and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous Five, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful ice hockey players in history.
In the dress of the Soviet Union, he has won two Olympic gold medals, seven world championship titles and he has also triumphed in the Canada Cup as well as in the Junior World Cup.
In the second part of his career, he also gained success in the NHL, where he twice lifted the Stanley Cup over his head in Detroit dress.
Since 2001 he has been a member of the Ice Hockey Star Room.
Hyundai surrendered to the unions. All overtime is cancelled
The management of the Nosovice-Automobilfabrik Hyundai agreed with the union on the cancellation of all overtime hours.
Due to frequent overtime, the union announced its readiness to strike on Monday.
This was confirmed by Hyundai Automobile Factory spokesman Petr Vanek.
However, the management wants to agree with the trade unionists on a Saturday shift this week.
We must not give up our manufacturing plan, which is a principle, so on Saturday, December 19, voluntary overtime was proposed for the reason that two shifts would be worked, Vanek said.
The website Sedmicka.cz wrote that the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to the employees who would work the Saturday shift.
Employees will also receive this in retrospect for the Saturday shift on 28 November.
According to Vanek, the company has decided to change the type of motivation of employees for the proposed overtime hours.
Either they have to pay the overtime surcharge or they can take a substitute holiday on December 28th and thus extend the Christmas holidays, Vanek explained.
In addition, all employees of the Saturday shift will be paid the fare and lunch.
Taking into account that the overtime was the most urgent and burning point regarding the demands and complaints of the trade unionists who stopped production last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon with immediate effect on the cancellation of all overtime hours for the month of December, Van<0xC4><0x9B>k said.
Until last week, the employees of the automobile factory had been forced to work 2 overtime hours practically every day after the eight-hour shift.
Upon signing of the agreement, the willingness to strike on the part of the trade unions will be revoked.
Further negotiations between the management of the automobile factory and the trade unionists are scheduled to take place on Friday afternoon.
The union leader, Petr Kuchar, said on Wednesday that if they can agree to meet the demands and sign a joint document, they are ready to lift the readiness to strike.
The situation in the automobile factory worsened last week, on Wednesday, when about 400 employees spontaneously went on strike because of constant overtime.
They also protested the poor payment terms and alleged harassment.
The management, on the other hand, held that employees had to work overtime to meet the automotive supply needs.
Trade unionists also called for no sanctions on employees who had interrupted production last Wednesday in their Monday strike readiness declaration.
In the area of overtime, the unions are demanding that overtime work be reduced to a minimum.
In addition, they are demanding the payment of 5,000 kroner this year.
The Nosovice automobile factory Hyundai now employs 2,000 people.
Serial production started in the company in November last year.
Approximately 80,000 vehicles were manufactured here by this September, with the current production capacity of 200,000 vehicles per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also works on 'steeled' HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds to prevent the spread of HIV viruses in the organism.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works against the viruses that are already resistant to drugs.
This fact outweighs the disadvantage that the compound does not act as strongly on conventional virus variants as one of the already existing drugs.
AIDS can’t be cured yet.
However, the patient can prolong life and prevent the proliferation of HIV viruses in the body.
However, their intake is accompanied by a number of side effects.
Incomplete suppression of virus propagation also leads to the development of resistant viruses against which no drugs are effective.
The work of experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences CR, VSCHT (Chemical Technological University) Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way to deal with virus resistance.
They have proven that the substances called metalocarboranes act on the protein responsible for the propagation of the HIV virus.
The metalocarboranes are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block virus proliferation in a different way than all drugs used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, the scientists come up with new ‘enhanced’ compounds that have been prepared based on the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to the virus protein.
The metalocarboranes have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multifaceted cages consisting of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms and coupled by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Insidious and persistent virus
HIV protease is the protein of the HIV virus, which is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the cleaving of the HIV virus caused by the HIV protease, no mature infectious virus particles would form.
If we turn off the HIV protease, we also turn off the propagation of the virus in the patient’s body, the scientists explain in the press report published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences CR.
In the paper published in the scientific journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the scientists describe entire rows of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are coupled by a short organic chain, which is then systematically further modified.
A little weaker, but more reliable
The effect of this series of substances against HIV protease was tested in the test tube, also against their resistant variants obtained from HIV-infected patients.
The effect of the metalocarboranes on the usual enzyme variant is not as strong as with the clinically used drugs, but it does not lose its effect on the resistant variants against which the drugs used are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action and its other properties, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical designs, make metalocarboranes interesting compounds for further research aimed at the development of effective anti-HIV drugs, says Pavlina Rezacova, head of the Laboratory of Structural Biology of the Institutes of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
Dispute over budget. ODS started on Fischer, who resists
ODS chairman Mirek Topolanek described the approved budget for the next year as "grayful" and Jan Fischer's government should consider its continued existence.
The statement of the ODS described the Prime Minister as "strong statements".
It is supposed to be time for analysis.
Deputy ODS chairman, Petr Necas, said that the concept of the Cabinet of Officials with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party apparently no longer works.
According to Necas, the Prime Minister has to decide whether he intends to rely on the minority in Parliament when it comes to fighting the rising deficit, or whether he is concerned with his stay in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
The approach of the ODS and the Social Democrats to the problem of public deficits is diametrically different, Necas pointed out.
Parliament adopted the 2010 budget on Wednesday, albeit with Left Party amendment proposals of more than 12 billion kroner.
Parliament has increased the money for civil servants' salaries, for the maintenance of social benefits and for direct payments to farmers.
The government has opposed the Social-Democracy’s proposals that it is covertly increasing the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic is expected to have a backlog of 163 billion kroner.
The ODS has left the room before the vote, so it has complied with the wishes of the government, because even the amended budget is only a less bad variant of the budget proviso.
Disappointment and senselessness
The Finance Minister, Eduard Janota, has spoken about his disappointment and a sense of futility, whereas Prime Minister Jan Fischer has argued that the government is still judging the current situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janota had seriously threatened his resignation in case the amendments were accepted, the situation would be different.
According to Czech television, Janota has signed up for Monday after the government business with the Premier.
He indicated that he was considering his further stay in office.
The reason for this is his disappointment about the negotiation of the budget.
According to Necas, the nominees of the Social Democracy (CSSD), who had enforced the budget changes, have nothing to do with the government.
The prime minister should also say clearly that he will resign if Parliament continues to adopt deficit-enhancing laws, such as those relating to sickness benefits and pensions or the Service Act amendment.
Topolanek: Ministers nominated by ODS were not wrong
That is the responsibility of the Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS have made no mistakes, Topolanek highlighted in a text message from the US.
It has mentioned that in some ministries, in deputy function, people are sitting up to TOP 09 who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that if Fischer decides to renounce the fight against the deficit level of public finances, "it is perfectly logical and correct that he relies on the left-wing majority that is currently in Parliament."
Then he allegedly cannot count on the support and tolerance of the bourgeois Democrats.
I haven’t thought about it, and if that’s up to date, then I’ll deal with it,” Defence Minister Martin Bartak, nominated by the Citizen Democrats, told journalists in Parliament.
Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels in the afternoon to attend the European Council.
The ODS resigned at the request of the Prime Minister
At the same time, Necas stressed that the ODS would likely vote against the amended budget in parliament on Wednesday if the prime minister explicitly asked the deputies of the Citizen Democrats to allow for the adoption of the budget.
We do not appear to be orphans, we are not small children, so he then responded to the question of whether the ODS was not pushed back in the political negotiations on the budget due to the absence of the party leader in Parliament and in the Czech Republic.
I didn’t realize that my voice was missing.
Even when I renounced the mandate, I knew that in the coming months it would be mainly about Bolshevikization of Parliament and destruction of all positives, Topolanek himself responded.
According to the new timetable of the CD (Czech Railway), fewer trains will run for roughly the same fare.
From 13 December, the Czech Railways will end or restrict some less busy fast and local trains, while other connections will be strengthened.
The total traffic volume will be reduced by two percent from the date of validity of the new timetable compared to today.
Most fares incl. basic and customer fare will not be changed.
For example, the inhabitants of the Ostrava area have several connections to the capital, and the railway uses Pendolino trains for this route.
The express train will no longer travel to Bratislava (Pressburg).
Fewer high-speed trains will also run on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis route, basically the direct connections from Prague to Letohrad will be reduced.
The largest reduction is planned by the railway in the district of Hradec Kralove (Kingsgraz), by a total of eight percent, but Prague and the surrounding area can look forward to an increase.
Two night trains on the Prague - Tabor - Budweis route will also be cancelled and to a few days a week the operation of some high-speed trains on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis route will be reduced.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of the new direct transport route from Milovice to Prague, currently the inhabitants of Milovice have to change to Lysa nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth route of the Esko suburban transport system, whose opening is possible thanks to railway electrification from Lysa nad Labem to Milovice.
The long-distance routes to the capital will end at the destination station Prague - Hauptbahnhof.
The CD introduces more connecting lines SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and the trains to Sumperk/Jesenik will run at a time interval of two hours.
Passengers can no longer travel to Bratislava with the Pendolino since 13 December.
This year’s regional railway bill: increase by 200 million
The high-speed trains are ordered and paid for by the Ministry of Transport, the railway will receive a total of four billion kroner in order to pay for the so-called loss of liquidity in the next year, just as this year.The local trains will supply the districts, in total they will pay eight billion kroner in the next year, with the state to add three billion.
This year, the regional trains are 200 million Czech kroner more expensive.
For the local trains and the express trains, the railway has a new ten-year contract, so far the contract has only been concluded for one year.
The railways praise the system, perhaps because of this they have not resorted to price increases in the vast majority of tickets.
Changes only occur with one-day network tickets CD Net and with cheap internet tickets eLiska.
For passengers without the customer card, the price of CD Net will be increased from 450 kronor to 600 kronor.
The price eLiska will then depend on the driven point, until now it was uniform for the trip between any district cities and cost 160 crowns.
Philippine militants arrested more than 50 people, the children were released.
Militants abducted 75 people in the south of the Philippines today, including some elementary school students and their teachers.
According to the AFP, the agency initially reported only 65 abducted persons.
All 17 detained children were released after eight hours, including a teacher.
The kidnapping took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
Approximately 19 militiamen allegedly used the hostages as a living shield when fleeing the police.
The local negotiators are now trying to release the remaining hostages.
According to the agency AFP, the militants belong to the New People’s Army (NPA), which is the arms faction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AP, police were pursuing the kidnappers over the violence that demanded revenge between the two local family clans.
In the south of the Philippines, in Maguindanao province, civil status has been imposed because of the recent massacre that killed 57 people.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre, which was linked to the election to the governor’s office, were 30 journalists.
Suspected of participating in the massacre, the governor of this southern Philippine province and his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan clan, were arrested.
Muslim separatists are also active on the island of Mindanao.
However, on Tuesday, the peace negotiations with the Philippine government resumed.
The history of South Africa affects everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Nelson Mandela
In the coming days, the new Hollywood film Clint Eastwood will be released in American cinemas, “Invictus: The Unbeaten,” which covers part of the life story of former President of the Republic of South Africa, Nelsona Mandela.
The role of the world-famous fighter against apartheid has been retained by Morgan Freeman, who was allegedly elected by Mandela himself a few years ago.
The supporting role of the legendary South African champion in rugby, Francois Pienaar, has been given to Matt Damon.
With the cinema launch of the film, reactions from critics as well as the public will be heard.
Nelson Mandela
His full name is Nelson Rolihlaha Mandela, born on 18 July 1918 in Mvez, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sachar Prize, then in 1993 together with de Klerk the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was elected President of the Republic of South Africa in 1994-1999.
Great expectations are placed in the film because it is coming to cinemas at a time when preparations for the World Cup are culminating in South Africa on the one hand, but at the same time the media are shaking the world public with frightening news about the rising racial hatred and the discrimination of the inhabitants on the part of the black ruling majority.
According to the AP news agency, the reactions to the new film in South Africa are consistently positive for the time being, despite numerous reservations about the casting of the leading roles with American Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is proud of the new film.
I have dreamed of this role for many years and have prepared myself well for it.
I also met Nelson Mandela several times in person so that I could - as they say - receive his energy, he performed in the interview after the film's festival premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it's good if we can remember Mandela's personality and his message with this film.
This is a history of South Africa, but it affects every person, he added.
In the dress of the rugby national team
The film is based on the book template of the British writer John Carlin, freely translated ‘In the Role of the Enemy’: Nelson Mandela and the Game that United the People, portrays the South African advocate of human rights during his first presidential term.
Throughout the film, Morgan Freeman strives to bring together two ethnic groups that have been separated each year and day, and like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also plays in the South African National Rugby Dress on the World Cup field that South Africa won at the time.
For entering the lawn in dress, which in South Africa is almost considered a sacred ordinance, Mandela harvested great ovations fourteen years ago, predominantly from white audiences, thus gaining recognition from the white population.
The rugby championship may be able to bring people together to form a single nation, led by rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" in the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa is improving will only become apparent.
However, the white South Africans are skeptical, as LN’s rugby fan Christopher Dawson revealed in a recent interview with LN, who fled the country to the UK.
The championship starts on June 11, 2010.
In Louny area, transformers burn for several 10 million crowns
The fire broke out in the morning at the transformer of the Ceps company in the switchgear near the municipality of Vyskov in the Louny area.
According to the spokesman of the district fire department Usti nad Labem, Lukas Marvan, six units intervened in the fire.
Originally, the fire brigade wanted to burn out the transformers, but later they changed the view and now the fire is extinguished with a mixture of water - foam and special extinguishing materials.
The cause was a technical defect, a transformer internal short-circuit.
No one was injured, the accident did not endanger the safety operation of the line system, according to the company spokeswoman, Pavla Mandatova.
The damage was estimated at several 10 million crowns, more precisely, the damage can only be quantified after the fire.
According to Mandatova, the destroyed transformer must be replaced by a new one.
For more than 10 years, nothing similar has happened with the Ceps company, mistakes of this kind are rare, she added.
The power supply was not interrupted, according to the spokeswoman of the CEZ company for Northern Bohemia, Sona Holingerova, the fire of the transformer station did not affect the functioning of households, authorities and companies.
A.G. Ceps operates on the Czech territory as a sole operator of the line system, the electrical lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renovates and develops 39 switchgears with 67 transformers that transfer electrical energy into distribution system and line line with a length of 4,339 kilometers.
Jancura filed a criminal complaint for defamation against three CSSD heads.
The owner of the Student Agency, Radim Jancura, is now suing for defamation against three social-democratic leaders.
Against Michal Hasek from the district of South Moravia, Radko Martinek from the district of Pardubice and the head of the district of Olomouc, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a twenty-minute inteview on the radio journal.
The lawsuit is related to the company's effort to operate regional train traffic in some districts.
However, all regions have finally signed the long-term contracts with the Czech Railway.
All three ladders attack us and say that we take the raisins out, but we only submitted the offer about the scope as agreed with them.
They claim that we are expensive than the Czech Railway because we would know the prices of the Czech Railway, which were completed last week.
We have no choice but to defend ourselves.
Because of this slander to the Society Student Agency, Jancura told the Radiojournal.
At the same time, he stated that he has evidence from all districts that they have taken their steps in accordance with European law.
That is why we are preparing an indictment for the European Commission.
Hasek considers the filing of the criminal complaint to be the further continuation of Jancura’s media show, which serves him as a free advertisement for his society as well as for his own person.
I am, of course, ready to defend my good name and the good reputation of my district, and I am also calling for further leaders.
I assume that in this matter, too, it will become clear that it is Jancura who is manipulating the public in the matter of regional rail transport and using lying and untrue arguments, Hasek said.
Jancura reported last week that he had invested several million crowns in advertising, which will point to the districts’ adverse move.
He told the radiojournal that he wants to interrupt the campaign after Christmas and continue it after New Year.
He stated that he would lead the campaign against corruption as such.
The campaign was initiated by Jancura after the districts agreed on the operation of regional rail transport with the Czech Railway and did not tender for the order in the amount of 150 billion kroner.
According to Vancura, such conduct is unlawful and contrary to the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
Because of the criticism of the train traffic in the districts, he was threatened, according to Jancura, already a member of the CSSD.
The only threat was that if we do not give up, we could lose the bus licenses.
He introduced himself as a member of the CSSD, I know who it is, I do not say his name, Jancura told the radio journal today.
Vaccination against pneumococcal disease free of charge and voluntary
Vaccination against pneumococcal changes the habit from January.
It should be the first to be free and voluntary for families.
But already, voices are reporting that mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococcal culminate.
The pharmaceutical institute already sets the maximum prices of vaccines that health insurance must pay.
Experts are also aware of the vaccination procedure.
New vaccination
Vaccines free for August children
Starting in January, children can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococcal infections that were born on August 2nd last year and later.
The condition is that you have not received a vaccine dose yet.
Anyone who has already started vaccination in the past year or earlier must also pay for further re-vaccination themselves.
The first dose of the vaccine must be given between the child’s 3rd and 5th months of life.
Already last year, a quarter of families had their children vaccinated against pneumococcal diseases.
The parents paid 1600 kroner and more for one dose.
The vaccination of the youngest children requires four doses.
Overall, the experts estimate that health insurance companies spend 300,000 to 450,000 crowns per year on the vaccine doses.
But you save on the treatment that children would need without vaccination.
So far, the state has spent about 500,000 a year on all area vaccinations of the children.
The mandatory vaccination was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococcal causes middle ear infection, but also severe infections including meningitis and blood poisoning.
Pneumococcal infections kill up to 28 children up to 10 years old each year after examination in hospitals.
Outside the Czech Republic, the mandatory vaccination of children against pneumococcal disease was introduced in about 40 countries.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccination could be mandatory in the future.
Starting in January, it will be paid by the insurance companies and will be voluntary.
That compulsory vaccination would be better, mentioned, for example, the head of the Nahlas Citizens' Association, Rudolf Kalovsky.
His association has been promoting pneumococcal vaccination over the long term.
The experts at the international conference, in which our association was involved, were not very satisfied with the fact that we had voluntary vaccination.
That's not quite ideal.
On the other hand, we are glad that we have succeeded in at least enforcing that.
“I think that’s the way we have to go now,” Kalovsky said.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococcal disease.
At this moment, we are not considering it at all, his spokesman Vlastimil Sesen said.
Voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages, the doctors claim.
The chair of the Society of Practical Pediatricians, Hana Cabrnochova, admits that voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages.
"In a situation where the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccination was started as a voluntary one," says Cabrnochova.
Experts expect more than 80 percent of parents to vaccinate their infants against pneumococcal disease from next year.
The vaccination against pneumococcal is also groundbreaking in that it is the first area vaccination paid by health insurance companies and not by the state.
Insurance companies should spend the money on prevention, thus saving them for further treatment, Cabrnochova explains.
The doctors have to buy the vaccines themselves.
However, this is associated with a concern of practical pediatricians, which concerns the purchase of the vaccines.
According to the original plan, the vaccines were to be purchased through the insurance companies and doctors would then receive them in the same way as other vaccines issued to them by the state.
However, some MEPs feared that the insurance companies could thus "export the money out of the health insurance."
Therefore, doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves and wait for insurance to pay them.
According to estimates, the individual practitioners will have to invest 40,000 kroner per month, which is a significant sum.
This is not going to be easy, Cabrnochova says.
US artist's son involved in "museum theft"
The son of the famous American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta was accused of attempting to steal $20 million worth of paintings from his father’s museum.
According to the Pennsylvania police, Alfonso Frank Frazetta was arrested while inviting 90 paintings into his vehicle with trailer.
It is said that Frank Frazetta junior and another man used an excavator to enter the museum in the Pocono Mountains.
The 81-year-old Frank Frazetta Senior is famous for his portrayal of figures such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
As the Associated Press reported, the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP quoted an unnamed police officer who said Frank Frazetta Junior may have been motivated by a family feud.
The agency reported that, according to a police affidavit, Frazetta Junior claimed he was instructed by his father to "invade the museum by all means to bring all the paintings into a warehouse."
The agency announced that Frank Frazetta Senior denied having given any permission.
Labour Defends Budget and Tax Increase
Ministers have defended the tax increases and spending halts announced in the pre-finance report against the criticism of the opposition, the economy and the trade unions.
The Conservatives said Alistair Darling had “spotted” an opportunity to show that he was serious about reducing the deficit by postponing the decisions until after the election.
The Chancellor of the Treasury also came under fire for targeting low- and middle-income workers.
His main proposals include a 0.5 percent increase in social security and a 1 percent cap on public payroll for 2011.
Social security issues
Trade unions have protested that low-wage recipients will be punished for a recession they did not cause, warning of impending “problems.”
The increase in social security – to about <0xC2><0xA3>3 billion a year – has upset the private sector, which says it is a tax on jobs, even though the focus should be on the economic upturn.
The increase, which is limited to those earning more than <0xC2><0xA3>20,000 a year, will affect about 10 million workers.
PRINCIPLES OF THE PREVIOUS REPORT
Increased social security by another 0.5% from April 2011
This year, the economy shrunk by more than expected 4.75%
New 50% tax on banking bonuses
1 percent increase in corporation tax for small businesses rejected
Electric Vehicles and Wind Turbines
Increase in public pensions by 2.5%
According to estimates of the Treasury, someone with an annual income of <0xC2><0xA3>30,000 will be poorer by <0xC2><0xA3>90 a year, and someone with <0xC2><0xA3>40,000 a year will be poorer by <0xC2><0xA3>190, while a person with <0xC2><0xA3>10,000 annual income will be richer by <0xC2><0xA3>110.
Ministers said their goal of deficit halving by 2013 meant "difficult decisions," but they also said that 60% of the additional tax burden would be on the 5% of the top earners.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms denied that the outlined tax hikes and spending stops would be "a drop on the hot stone" compared to the necessary measures.
"These are big numbers, they will bring us deficit halving and this will be absolutely necessary over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Timms said he was confident that the economy would return to growth by the end of the year.
Labour Party predictions about future economic growth – which affects the scale of new debt and the speed of deficit cancellation – have been challenged after the Chancellor of the Treasury was forced to revise previous figures.
He said in his statement that the economy is likely to shrink by 4.75% this year – far more than the 3.5% decline predicted in April – while debt would be <0xC2><0xA3>3 billion higher than previously estimated.
"Missed Opportunity"
The Conservatives, who want to launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday to warn of Labour's "debt crisis," said the planned <0xC2><0xA3>789 billion in debt over the next six years is unsustainable.
They added that the ministers have failed to present a credible plan on how they will pay back and “cynically” push themselves from difficult decisions until after the election – which must take place at the latest in June 2010.
"They didn't say anything significant about what they're going to do," shadow finance minister Philip Hammond said. "They had their opportunity to do this, and they let them pass by."
"The significant announcements will only be made after the election, whoever wins them".
Roger Bootle and Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and the police be protected from future cuts, unlike the Conservatives’ proposals, which see deficit caps coming faster and more likely.
But the Liberal Democrats said the money gained through the tax hikes and spending stops is being used to cover next year’s spending, not to reduce the deficit, and therefore argue that the plans are “built on sand.”
BBC political editor Nick Robinson said that some at the time of the announcements – such as the above inflation adjustment on some disability pensions next April – would expose the Chancellor of the Treasury to the accusation of voting, as the money could simply be recovered next year.
Labour insists on providing extra aid when people need it most and that the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"High budget"
Although the ministers have not announced budget details beyond 2011, economists say that the pressure on public spending will only come to bear in the medium term.
The recognized Institute for Tax Investigations said the Chancellor’s figures would mean significant cuts in many areas, possibly also in the areas of transport, higher education, science and defence in the future.
"It only shifts the pain to later," said its leader Robert Chote.
"The significant announcements are made only after the election, whoever wins them," added Roger Bootle, economic adviser at the audit firm Deloitte.
"This was just the hollow upfront budget report. The markets are recognizing that."
FBI Investigates "Arrests of U.S. Citizens in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the arrest of five reported U.S. citizens on suspicion of extremist connections in Pakistan.
The men were arrested in a raid on a house in Sarghoda, in eastern Punjab province, the American embassy in Pakistan told the BBC.
The FBI said it is investigating whether these are the same men who were reported missing last month in the U.S. state of Virginia.
The U.S. State Department said they are also looking for information about the men.
Three of them are said to be of Pakistani descent, one is of Egyptian origin and the other has a Yemeni background.
"If they are American citizens, of course, we are very interested in the charges they are charged with and under what circumstances they are detained," Kelly said.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency was informed of the arrests and was in touch with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to find out their identities and the purpose of their stay there if it is actually the missing students," she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington said the men were arrested in a house owned by the uncle of one of the students.
He said the local police had previously been interested in the house and that no charges have yet been filed against the detained men.
The Reuters news agency reported that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton refused to comment on the arrests, but she said the U.S. must “cooperate closer with Afghanistan and Pakistan in eradicating the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and educate people.”
The five students were reported missing by their families in northern Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty condemns "abuse" in Iran
According to a report by Amnesty International, human rights in Iran are still as bad as they have been in the past 20 years.
The report details "abuse patterns" by the regime, both before and after the contested presidential elections in June.
One man quoted in the report said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, while another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran rejected previous criticism of its human rights record.
Officials said such criticism was politically motivated.
Following the contested election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, thousands of people were arrested and dozens killed in Iran, leading to the biggest street protests since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens received jail sentences and prosecutors said at least five people were sentenced to death.
BBC Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne, now in London, said that at the beginning of the protests, the highest leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some of the allegations of abuse and ordered the closure of the Kahrizak prison.
But since then, there has been no tolerance from the authorities for criticism, our correspondent said.
"Wrong Confessions"
Amnesty International cited the report of 26-year-old computer science student Ebrahim Mehtari, who said he was charged with “working with Facebook networks” and protesting the election results.
"They hit me in the face more often," he was quoted as saying.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, in my neck, on my head ... they threatened me with death and they humiliated me".
After five days, he signed a false confession and, still bleeding and half unconscious, was released on the street, Amnesty said.
Defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said some protesters arrested after the election were tortured to death in prison in August and others were raped.
Iranian authorities denied the allegations of rape, but admitted that abuses took place.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee who said he and 75 others had been detained in a container for more than eight weeks at a detention centre in Kahrizak.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and the courts had set up a committee to investigate the post-election unrest and the government’s response to it, but said the mandates and power of these bodies would be unclear and the results obtained by the parliamentary committees had not been made public.
The group said at least 90 people have been detained in the last three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
In the city park ski slope has been set up
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn a landmark in Bristol into a competitive runway.
The ski slope of this park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who competed for cash prizes.
At the top of the slope in Brandon Hill Park, there was a short jump at the beginning of a 100-meter-long slope.
Student John Hickman, who is studying medicine in the fourth year, said there was a beautiful view from the top of the hill, but it was also quite intimidating.
It is a great view with all the lights of the city glistening below.
He added: “There are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country here – some real talents.”
Awards were awarded for the best feats – or tricks – performed on the slope.
After the event on Thursday evening, the snow is left to melt.
Still you and me
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters voted for a minaret ban and concerns about the alleged Islamization of Europe are widespread, John Bowen, an American academic, has written a well-founded and well-thought-out report on whether Muslims can be integrated into one of Europe’s declared most secularized societies — and be integrated.
Some readers will read this new book out of admiration for the author's final work, "Why the French don't love headscarves" (2006), an elegant and densely argumentative study of a dispute that divided and occupied the country over a decade and a half, and whose effects can still be perceived today.
Bowen’s latest book offers a broader and bolder spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what the politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but what is really happening in the field.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now offer the 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as Bowen calls it, “Islamic free spaces.”
He is a good listener, he reflects debates between teachers and students about the issues that worry them the most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or a town hall (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about the evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it permissible for a Muslim to use an interest rate-based banking system to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly profane affairs, he claims, that make up daily life, in contrast to the political dramas that the media are dealing with.
The author recognizes a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none with a known name, possibly with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, an Arab-Muslim scholar and academic born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open up the debate on how it is possible to be a good Muslim on the one hand and a good citizen on the other in a modern secular society.
They don’t have all the arguments on their side.
The conservatives are suspicious of the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists that Bowen interviewed are mostly in disagreement with their Salafi counterparts – advocates of purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia – who nowadays show a small but influential presence among Europe’s Muslims.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But an agreement requires giving and taking on both sides.
He questions to what extent French policymakers (and the intellectual elite so passionately guarding the separation of church and state) are truly committed to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims may experience harsher treatment than Catholics, Protestants, and Jews, who in turn had to make their historic compromise with secular republicanism.
He recognizes a "sharpening of the value screws" rather than a growing pragmatism.
After reading this book, one is inclined to say "Yes, but not yet".
The World's Most Desperate View
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other environmental region on Earth.
The ice that characterizes them melts at an alarming rate, taking lives that nowhere else can survive.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing interests have gone into the newly open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now also authors in their keel waters.
Richard Ellis, an author and illustrator, draws in "On Thin Ice" (original title: "On Thin Ice") a natural history of the icon of the North, the polar bear.
Known in the complicated history and politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who have proven themselves in hunting polar bears.
Admiral Nelson’s encounter with a polar bear as a brave 14-year-old sailor who fought only with his musket’s rifle butterfly is certainly a legend, but others are true.
Young bears caught swimming behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers were taken to zoos and circuses.
A circus performance at the beginning of the 20th century showed 75 polar bears at a performance.
Even today, zoos typically still own one-millionth of the wildlife area of an ancient animal. The climate is rarely suitable: The polar bear in Singapore became quite green from the algae that grow in the hollow hairs of his fur.

Ellis refers to the accounts of other authors and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters pose to the survival of the species.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunters in helicopters and motor sleigh-driving Inuit use powerful assault rifles to track down their prey.
Ironically, in the waters in the north of these two hunting nations, the ice will last the longest.
In his new book, After the Ice, Alun Anderson, a former editor of the science magazine New Scientist, offers a clear and disturbing description of the science of the Arctic and a gripping insight into how the future could evolve.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of the changes.
This is not due to a lack of explanations.
The pioneering journeys of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century for the first time suggested the turbulence of the pack ice.
In the Cold War, submarines saw the moving ridges while underwater.
A useful addition are satellite surveys and the large-area deployment of probes on icebergs, but still much is achieved by intrepid people camping outside in the cold.
Anderson takes a look at the peculiar, tiny world of the inflow system within the Arctic ice formed by saltwater cascades compressed during freezing.
But, from the bear on the ice to the microscopic wonders in the ice, everyone is threatened by the passing of the summer ice, which is expected in the period between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months ... that could be us"
Marines were among the 6,000 who laid wreaths in Arlington
De'Angello Robinson travelled by bus for seven hours to lay a single wreath on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who made the trip from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the National Cemetery in Arlington to decorate graves, the day was a tribute to the men and women in whose footsteps they walked.
In a few months, from wherever we are brought back, we could be, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If we were, I wish someone would do the same for me, so I try to show that respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers gathered on Saturday morning to lay wreaths on the graves of veterans in several sections of the Arlington Cemetery.
Morrill Worcester, owner of the funeral wreath manufacturer Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, established this tradition in 1992 when he and several others decided to decorate several hundred tombs at the cemetery in Arlington.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition and Morrill and his wife Karen, who make this trip every year, stop in various cities along the way to conduct events dedicated to people in the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which extended the event to other states as well.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 wreaths on the tombs at Arlington Cemetery, in areas at the Pentagon, on tombs at Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, at Battery Park in New York, and at the memorial site for United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second time, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 to purchase and transport the wreaths.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster said she made the trip to Arlington in memory of her husband, a deceased professional soldier.
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said, this is their way of giving back to those who sacrificed.
She said this is a small contribution to how we civilians can support our soldiers.
It’s like visiting a family cemetery.
Packed in layers of warm clothing, the volunteers wandered across the extensive lawns and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers targeted older tombs from the First and Second World Wars and the Vietnam War, as these are not visited as often as the newer tombs, the organizers said.
The mood was cheerful, children were playing, and couples held their hand as they carried the fresh pine branches to the graying tombstones.
Each round wreath was dark green with a small red bow attached to the upper part.
Section 60, which is located nearby and where mostly veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, remained virtually calm.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 wreaths to decorate this section, but the gloomy mood of the current wars filled this area.
Individuals were crying openly, others were praying, and families and friends were clinging to each other in the icy air.
Some read aloud the names carved in stone, while others bowed down to small black and white place maps, which had been put into the damp mud for those whose tombstones had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who shed bitter tears in front of her son’s grave.
She drove 8 hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the tomb of naval infantry sub-officer David Shane Spicer, who fell in battle in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free ..., my son paid for it, she said.
"When I've been gone for a long time, I want someone to remember him."
U.S. government contractor arrested by Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. government contractor who sold mobile phones and notebook computers in the country, foreign ministry officials said on Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for clients, such as USAID, the U.S. Agency for International Development and for the World Bank.
Consular officials of the U.S. Interest Representation in Havana are trying to gain access to the detainee who was arrested on December 5.
The special charges have not yet been published, although under Cuban law a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested for almost anything under the accusation of "endangerment".
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, which include slight protests and critical writings, carry a risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and statements are considered a serious crime.
Cuba has a growing blogger community led by popular reporter Yoani Sánchez, who often describes how she and her husband are being persecuted and attacked by government officials.
Sánchez has repeatedly requested permission to leave the country to receive prizes, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractor is likely to increase tensions between the Castro Brother’s communist government in Cuba and the Obama administration, which had sought a “slow” approach to improving relations with the island.
The news of the arrest was first reported Friday night by the New York Times.
The new U.S. policy emphasizes that the United States will pay in return if the Cuban government takes concrete steps in this direction, such as the release of political prisoners and creating more room for opposition.
Mobile phones and notebooks are legal in Cuba, although they are new and sought-after products in a country where the average earnings of a government employee are $15 per month.
The Cuban government has only allowed ordinary citizens to buy a mobile phone since this year, they are mainly used to send text messages, as a 15-minute phone call would cost a daily wage.
Internet use is extremely restricted on the island.
It is accessible to foreign visitors in expensive hotels and at some government offices, such as universities.
Cubans who want to log in often have to report their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
In Cuba, the arrest of an American is rare.
Most of the few U.S. citizens in jail in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berbena, the press spokeswoman for the U.S. Interests Agency in Havana.
Berbena said she could not provide any further information on the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly wrong.
An activity that would be legal in any other free society - the surrender of free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the American section of the group "Human Rights Watch", which recently released a harsh report on freedom in Cuba entitled "New Castro, equal Cuba", alluding to the appointment of Raul Castro as leader of the country, who replaced the elderly Fidel.
Vivanco said the defendants were very often arrested, sentenced and imprisoned within a day.
He said that probably any solution would be political and that the Cuban government is often provoking a negative reaction in the United States, just at the time when both countries are moving towards each other for more dialogue readiness.
Pakistani government officials uncover plan to send men to Afghanistan
Pakistani authorities on Saturday uncovered an allegedly leading head of a conspiracy aimed at sending five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. soldiers, saying they hope this case could help uncover an extensive network of terrorist recruiters searching the Internet for radicalized young men.
Investigators said they were looking for an opaque insurgent known as Saifullah who invited the men to Pakistan after locating them because one of them had made endorsing comments on terror attacks on the YouTube video site.
Saifullah became the leader of these men after their arrival in Pakistan, trying to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan’s tribal belt that is home to Al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of Pakistan’s intelligence service who was informed of the matter said on Saturday, Saifullah could not convince the al-Qaeda leaders that the men are not part of a CIA conspiracy to undermine the terrorist network.
As a result, they were detained for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the inhospitable mountains in the northwest, which have become a terrorist refuge.
They were seen as part of a covert operation.
That is why they were rejected, said the government official, who wanted to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the matter.
The government official said the men were by no means discouraged and continued trying to get the right recommendations to gain access to the al-Qaeda camps when they were arrested by Pakistani prison authorities.
The case of the five men — who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI — highlights the crucial role of recruiters in identifying future terrorists and, possibly more importantly, in deciding who is trustworthy.
Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, U.S. intelligence has made it a matter of utmost urgency to house human assets within Al Qaeda.
The recruiters of the organization act as gatekeepers who do not let in those whose commitment to the Holy War is not serious enough and those who could be spies.
American prospective recruits are undergoing special scrutiny by A Qaeda, analysts said.
However, due to their potential access to U.S. targets and their propaganda value, they are also considered to be incredibly attractive to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst at the US-based NEFA Foundation, said terrorist groups have also become much more cautious about who they allow access to in recent years, as U.S. intelligence agencies have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you’re trying to introduce someone into these groups, what better way could you go than following the recruitment model so many have already followed?, said Kohlmann.
The model is now much more based on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of protesters call for climate action in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of protesters marched through the streets here on Saturday and demanded that the negotiators in the city’s Bella Congress Centre take bolder action on climate protection.
Protesters said 100,000 people had joined the event, whereas police estimates were more likely to estimate about 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists fired small explosives near some government buildings in downtown.
On a day when little happened in the UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists wandered through the city with banners in English saying "There is no Planet B" and one in Spanish saying "The Earth says 'enough'.
Some stars joined the protest, for example Danish model photographer Helena Christensen, who said that travelling to Peru, her mother’s birthplace, makes her aware of the heartbreaking problems the country is facing due to the already tangible impacts of climate change.
That is part of the reasons why I decided to take part in the big demonstration - to pass the word and appeal to world leaders to reach a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it has to be done now and there is no way around it anymore.
Police stopped the protesters from getting too close to the Bella Center, saying they had arrested 19 people, mainly because they were either masked or carrying pocket knives.
According to Danish law, these actions are prohibited in demonstrations.
According to a spectator who did not want to be named because he is involved in the climate negotiations, masked protesters in black clothing fired several explosives near the Copenhagen main canal, which is close to several ministries.
They threw them near the buildings, he said, adding that they began as flares, but were then followed by “a few major explosions.”
Inside the convention center, people gathered in front of television screens to watch the demonstration throughout the afternoon.
But the protest has apparently not reached the awareness of the main officials, such as Su Wie, China’s chief climate negotiator.
When asked if he thinks the demonstration would have a constructive effect on international considerations, he replied in English: "This is something I was not even aware of."
He then went on to say in Mandarin, "Because the venue is big, I can't hear what's happening outside."
He noted that it depends on the perspective of the individual whether the demonstration would harm or help.
It shows the focus of the general public and various sectors on the issue of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, “one can also say that they interfere with the negotiations or the freedom of other people.”
Examination data show stubborn racial divide
The mathematics performance testimonials last week were welcome good news for public schools in Washington D.C.
Although Washington District is still far behind the country’s high-performance schools, the evidence shows that fourth and eighth graders have made faster progress over the past two years than cities that include Atlanta, Chicago, and New York.
However, what is included in the latest figures of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is the stubborn performance gap between African-American and white students, both at local and national levels.
The average score of white fourth graders from Washington D.C. rose over the last two years from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but their African-American peers rose only by three points from 209 to 212.
The performance gap actually increased from 53 to 58 points between 2007 and 2009.
The progress of the African-American eighth graders remained basically the same, it fell by a statistically negligible point from 245 to 244.
The average score of white students was not included in the test data because the sample size was not large enough.
The picture over a six-year period is also not more encouraging.
The gap that separated white and black fourth graders in 2003, when the first NAEP was recorded in this district, was 60 scale points (262 to 202).
And although the score that children of both groups have achieved has grown during this period, the difference has barely decreased with now 58 points.
Some of the district’s education advocates expressed concern last week that the results, celebrated by school chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and Democratic mayor Adrian M. Fenty, were largely driven by white students who are already high-performing children anyway.
This suggests that we raised the overall score by treating those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and difficult, said Jeff Smith, board member of D.C. Voice, a nonprofit group advocating for education equality in Washington D.C.
"I'm not jumping up and down for a span of two or three points," said Democratic Washington City Councilman Kwame R. Brown, who has a fourth-grade Eaton primary school daughter.
Brown, a frequent critic of Rhee’s management style, said the message of exam scores is that the city’s middle schools urgently need attention.
Of course, you always want to see the positive signs, I respect that.
What frightens me, however, is that we don’t spend nearly the time and energy we would have to devote to our middle school.
Rhee said the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of low-performance students.
This fall, for example, some teachers are being trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, which targets students in the upper grades of primary and middle school who have not mastered basic reading skills at the beginning of their school careers and who are significantly behind their peers.
Everyday mathematics, a curriculum that brings from kindergarten to sixth grade games and lifelike experiences to the forefront, was brought to Washington under former senior school inspector Clifford Janey, and this curriculum is credited with some of the NAEP progress reported last week.
I think we need to continue working to get the best measures for students who are below grade level, Rhee said.
Others say the NAEP results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system while continuing to provide the additional money and resources for the low-performance schools that are needed to reduce the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, professor of education at the University of California in Berkeley, who is investigating urban exam results.
The conventional remedy is to direct its resources and management reforms to the schools located in the poorest areas of Washington D.C.
The objective could create political aftermath that works against this important item of the agenda.
The weak point, of course, as with other urban school inspectors, is that they are trying to keep the white and black middle class.
Our focus is to ensure that we build a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in the neighborhoods so that all families, no matter where they live, can be sure that their children can receive excellent public education.
Janey, who is now a school inspector in Newark, said in an interview this week that one of the most significant elements for closing the performance gap is to extend the traditional public school year, which is currently 180 days in Washington, to compete with charter schools.
One needs to increase the school year to nearly 200 days to have the power to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with his teacher union last year about 185 days a year, which he sees as “a milestone” on the way to a greater increase in the next contract.
Higher education for more people as a future prospect
The coach reaches Gettysburg College with a loud whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, gets out and blinks for a moment at the sight of the white columns, the brick facades and the emerald green lawn.
Graciela’s parents have hardly finished high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela, who was recovered in Silver Spring and now lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Their attitude and that of the group’s other eighth graders exploring Gettysburg, where lessons cost $38,690 a year, was more that of an awe-inspiring visitor than that of an enthusiastic future student.
"Yes, I will be here soon!" exclaimed Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when the guide announced that they had now entered the building for natural sciences.
“Wow, really?” she said thoughtfully when she was reported the school’s low professor-to-student ratio.
The college in Pennsylvania was the 7th the kids attended on their three-day tour and now they have fully embraced the intended message: the question is not whether to go to college.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is a growing concern about the large number of children of Hispanic immigrants born in the US who do not finish high school or become pregnant as teenagers, but on the other hand, there are hundreds of thousands who receive the college education needed to rise into the middle class.
In truth, one in five of these “second generation” of Hispanics graduated from college — which is a remarkable achievement, as many of their immigrant parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, came to the U.S. without graduating from high school.
Their success stories are important, researchers say, because they show the way forward for a generation that will play a huge role in the country’s workforce.
Those who examine powerful children say they often have a natural affinity for school and an intrinsic drive to success.
Many of them also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But counseling programs also play a big role by helping Graciela and millions of children like them get into college, especially if these efforts persist over a longer period of time.
If you look at low-income children whose parents don’t have the experience and skills to help them find their way through the system, then a single measure at some point won’t solve the problem either, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California in Davis who studied Hispano-American students.
We need to think about providing a supportive network for these children from preschool through high school.
The federal program that Gracielas College tour had funded is a useful example.
It’s known as GEAR UP — Switching a Gang Up — and provides more than $300 million a year for local school systems to launch college preparatory programs that start when low-income students are in middle school and continue running until they finish high school.
According to the U.S. Department of Education, the program has helped more than 10 million students since 1999, more than 60% of whom have gone to college.
Iraqi Oil Ministry signs contracts with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has been able to get larger oil companies to rebuild its damaged infrastructure at two auctions closed Saturday.
The 10 contracts signed with foreign oil companies by the Iraqi Oil Ministry suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are ready to play an important role in renovating the Iraqi oil industry, which has been paralyzed by war and economic sanctions for decades.
American companies were only able to register shares in two of the 10 auctioned fields.
Seven American companies had paid for participation in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only company that has made a bid has pulled the shorter.
Two American companies were able to conclude contracts for fields auctioned in June.
The thinly sown representatives of American oil multinationals at the opening of the Iraqi oil industry surprised the analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after 6 years of war and instead of US companies, Asians and Europeans are paving the way, said Ruba Husari, editor of Iraq Oil Forum, an online news service.
There will be no more offers in Iraq for a long time.
Security concerns underlined by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday and the political instability caused by the withdrawal of the U.S. military have likely prevented American oil companies from getting more involved in Iraq, which holds the world’s third-largest proven crude reserves.
U.S. companies have been disadvantaged in some cases because competitors, especially Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower labor costs and are more likely to take risks because they don’t have to account to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies to sign contracts with the ministry.
Larger U.S. companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have maintained close ties with the Iraqi oil ministry and have provided technical advice in recent years, have gone empty.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main players in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation has bid for more contracts than any other company and has been able to go home with large packages of contracts for two larger fields.
We all know, said the spokesman for the oil ministry, Assam Jihad, that China is on its way to becoming one of the world’s major economies as well as a technology power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company will be able to compete with its competitors and fulfil its commitments to Iraq.
Companies preselected for bidding made bids, which were then compared to the fee per barrel of oil that the ministry was willing to pay to increase the output of each field beyond the current level.
Al Qaeda planner apparently killed in Pakistan
In an apparent US missile attack along the Pakistani border with Afghanistan, a top Al Qaeda deployment planner is said to have been killed this week, U.S. counter-terrorism officials reported Friday.
This would be, if it were to be confirmed, the second deadly attack on a high-ranking terrorist organization this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arabs alleged to have been killed by a number of rockets, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani officials in the region, which hit their vehicle on Tuesday near the town of Miran Shah in the province of North Waziristan.
Local authorities reported that the missiles were fired by a drone type used by the CIA in Pakistan’s lawless tribal belt.
They drove in a white vehicle towards the Afghan border when the car was hit, a Pakistani civil intelligence official from Miran Shah said by phone.
Locals suspected of belonging to the militants ran to the site and quickly seized everything that was left of the "completely destroyed bodies".
Local authorities were unable to verify the identity of the victims, but two U.S. counter-terrorism officials cited indefinite evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali has been described as the leading military planner of Al Qaeda, leading operations of terrorist groups outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was involved in conspiracies around the world, noted a senior official who wanted to remain anonymous, pointing to the delicate nature of U.S. airstrikes on Pakistani soil.
Assuming its central role as given, it also included planning attacks against the US and Europe.
He accepted strategic instructions from Al Qaeda’s top leaders and put them into operational planning for potential terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. official said Somali quickly rose into the al-Qaeda hierarchy and maintained best ties to other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to some Americans, the second official said, but this by no means diminishes the danger he posed to us and our allies.
If his death was confirmed, Somali would be the second leading Al Qaeda or Taliban leader to be killed since September when Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal area and three other top activists were killed in a similar attack.
The rate of CIA drone attacks has dropped from an average of six operations per month to two since the summer, according to a summary published by the Long War Journal, a nonprofit-owned website.
The decline may be due to improved tactics by terrorist groups that have taken steps to reduce their vulnerability while at the same time brutally killing suspected informants, the site reported.
Leading UN envoy to Kabul resigns
Leading UN envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would step down from office in March, ending a stormy term clouded by allegations of widespread corruption in the UN-backed Afghan presidential election.
The Obama administration has decided to send another 30,000 U.S. soldiers to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said he supports the troops increase, but he also expressed his concerns that the U.S. military withdrawal schedule, scheduled to begin in 18 months, could cause other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the build-up of the Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
Commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian helpers to help with the political transition of Afghanistan.
The increase in troops on the military side must correspond to an increase on the civilian side, he said.
Eide said he was not resigning, but only fulfilling an agreement made to his family in March 2008 to stay in Kabul for just two years.
He said he wanted to notify the U.N.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now forward, so that he has time to provide a replacement.
What I said is that he better start looking for a successor, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between my predecessor’s departure and my arrival.
According to UN officials, Ban has begun searching for a replacement.
The UN representatives say that he has considered the Swedish-Italian-born Staffan di Mistura, who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad and the French Jean-Marie Guéhenno, who previously led UN peacekeeping operations.
His position in Afghanistan was put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai in the country’s presidential election and covering up evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide has denied all accusations, but he also said that Galbraith's accusations - which were fired - "had undoubtedly damaged the mission because there was already a great deal of skepticism about international interference in the election."
Eide said he recommended the appointment of a leading civilian representative to coordinate the aid operations of the U.S.-led armed forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged the UN leadership to allow his successor to hire more personnel from the United States and other Western countries who donate to the Afghan mission, saying that this would strengthen their confidence in their money being used properly.
Eide expressed his disappointment at the restraining of his forces in Afghanistan, saying that the cumbersome UN hiring arrangements undermined his ability to bring in capable people.
The UN rules are designed in such a way that since May, he said, I have been able to hire only one person.
This is disastrous and must not continue.
U.S. Defense Secretary Gates: Iran Must Expect Additional Sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said on Friday that the world powers will soon impose “significant additional sanctions” on Iran because it has not participated in talks about its nuclear plans.
Gates spoke to a group of about 300 U.S. soldiers in northern Iraq during a 7-day trip through the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, downplaying the prospect of a military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
There are no good options in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier’s question about the likelihood of such a development.
"One of the things that is on my mind is, if we have learned something from Iraq in the last six years, the war's own unpredictability."
The Obama administration is considering a sanctions package aimed at Iran’s military and political elite, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect the average Iranian.
He said a "package of positive and negative incentives" is needed "to convince the Iranian government that nuclear weapons are in reality less protected" because "your people will suffer tremendously" from the sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement issued by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the U.S. government joined European leaders in warning that Iran would face “credible” consequences if its nuclear program failed to meet the demands of the UN Security Council and its nuclear surveillance organization, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran continues to claim that the knowledge of nuclear technology is to be gained only for peaceful purposes.
At talks in Geneva on October 1, Iran said it would resume talks to restrict its nuclear program and waive a substantial portion of its stockpile of enriched uranium in exchange for much-needed nuclear fuel for its medical research reactor.
The U.S. government has pushed for this kind of agreement to build trust between the two parties and gain time for negotiations.
However, Iran seems to have abandoned negotiations on the provisional agreements since then -- in part, experts say, because Iran’s leadership disagrees on whether they should commit to the United States.
That Iran has simply left the international community standing in terms of some proposals that they had already agreed to in early October has, frankly, brought the international community, including the Russians and Chinese, together in a way they have never been in connection with important additional sanctions for Iran, Gates said.
President Obama has set Dec. 31 as a deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals before continuing to pursue other options, including those that Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called “crushing sanctions.”
In a statement issued in New York, the Iranian mission to the United Nations condemned what it called on Thursday "unfounded and unfounded claims" by some Security Council members about Iran's nuclear activities, saying they are ready to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers "to achieve an appropriate long-term solution."
Gates, who was due to return to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in the morning before flying to the oil-rich Kurdish region in Iraq to meet with soldiers in Kirkuk and with Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq remain high, particularly in terms of borders, property rights and the distribution of public revenue.
Gates urged both sides to lower the conflict potential to prevent delays in U.S. plans to lower U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
US officials quoted Gates, who told Masud Barzani, president of the Kurdish regional government, “We will maintain your security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq.
We will not leave you."
A change of course in aging China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters telling them that "Mother Earth is too tired to entertain more children" and "A baby more means a grave more".
They learned these lessons so well that when government officials in Shanghai, who suddenly began to change course this summer due to the low birth rate and the aging population, and encouraged young couples to have more than one child, their answer was immediate and final: “Not at all.”
We have already invested all our time and energy in a child.
There is nothing left for a second child, said Wang, 31, a human resources manager with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, which has produced two generations of notoriously fat, depraved single children, affectionately called "little emperors," a population crisis is emerging in the country.
The average birth rate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple compared to 6 at the time this policy came into force, the UN reports.
Department of Population Issues set, while the number of populations aged 60 and older is expected to explode from 16.7 percent of the population by 2050 to 31.1 percent by 2020, far above the global average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is stronger in rich coastal towns with an educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds and seniors accounted for almost 22 percent of Shanghai’s reported residents, while the birth rate was below one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, head of the Shanghai City Population and Family Planning Commission, has said that couples of childbearing age must have babies in order to “help lower the proportion of aging populations and alleviate the labour shortage of the future.”
"Shanghai will soon be as old -- but not as rich -- as the industrialized countries, like Japan and Sweden," she said.
A step-by-step relaxation
Enshrined in the country’s 1978 constitution, China’s one-child policy is arguably the most controversial provision introduced by the ruling Communist Party to date.
Married couples who violate this policy face huge fines -- up to three times their annual salary in some regions -- and discrimination in their workplace.
Chinese officials have attributed to this policy that the critical use of natural land resources could be avoided, whereas human rights representatives have condemned abuses in the enforcement of policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women who already had a child to aborte.
Many couples also had sex-selective abortions, which resulted in an unnaturally high ratio of men to women.
In recent years, government officials for the population have gradually weakened their attitude to one-child policies.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule -- including city dwellers, members of ethnic minorities, and cases where both husband and wife have been single children -- and in 2007, the tone of many harsh slogans was mitigated.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research at the University of Beijing, said government officials have recently discussed even more radical changes, for example, allowing couples to have two children with a partner who is an only child.
Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to promote more births in July.
Posters teaching families to have only one child have been replaced almost overnight by guidelines describing in detail who is eligible for a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city administration has sent city employees and volunteers for family planning to visit couples at home and push through information sheets under the doors.
She also asked for psychological and financial advice for those who have more than one child.
The response was not exactly encouraging, family planning officials said.
Disappointing reaction
Although officials from a rural small town in the outskirts of Shanghai said that there was an upswing in the applications from couples who wanted a second child after the campaign started, the urban districts, on the other hand, reported no change.
The Huinan municipality with a population of 115,000 still receives as an example only four to five applications per month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that the expected number of births in the city for 2010 will still be around 165,000 despite the campaign -- slightly higher than 2009, but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the Caolu Community Family Planning Committee in Shanghai, said financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people don’t want to have more children.
They want to give their first one the best, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said that they would like to have two children and that this is legally permitted.
But they, like many Chinese, have only a small government health and life insurance.
Without a social network, they say, this decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West misjudge the one-child policy as a human rights issue, said Yang, a civil engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with her first child.
Yes, we are robbed of the opportunity to have more than one child.
The problem is not simply in politics.
The problem is money.
Other couples give psychological reasons for their hesitation.
Wang, the human resources manager, said she only wants a child because she was also an only child. "We were the center of the family and used to the fact that everyone took care of us.
We’re not used to caring for others and we don’t really want to.”
Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old who owns a translation company, said it bluntly.
For middle-class parents with double careers, which lowers the birth rate, he said, it’s about being successful and for that you have to be selfish.
The age group of today’s 20- to 39-year-olds grew up watching their parents fight during the early days of the Chinese capitalism experiment and they don’t want such a life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child, he said, puts huge demands on parents’ time.
A mother must give up her social life for at least two years.
Then there's the room question -- "You have to rebuild your apartment" -- and life planning -- "When the child is 9 months old, you already have to have a resume ready for the best preschools."
Most of his friends are ready to go through this once, Chen said, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to achieve a higher standard of living, he said.
We do not want to make too many sacrifices.
UN Group Drafts Plan to Reduce Emissions
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- which so far has been characterized by wild poses and mutual accusations -- has once again set a focus on Friday with the release of a document that records an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gases for the next 40 years, with industrialized nations having to bear the greatest burdens in the near future.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement on greenhouse gas control, has both identified the remaining obstacles and shown the way forward.
But it was seen as important progress in a negotiation that is running out of time, as more than 100 top politicians from around the world will arrive in Copenhagen next week.
The text, formulated by a specially created UN working group, is silent on the money supply that rich countries should give to poor countries so that they can manage global warming in the short and long term.
It also offers a range of options for key issues, including how industrialized and large emerging economies can limit their carbon emissions and what the upper limit of global temperature rise should be that policymakers would support.
The process is given a great deal of flexibility, said John Coequyt, senior representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the six-page document, has summarized a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the UN’s leading climate protection official, Yvo de Boer, has called “the big picture.”
It shows the outline of a possible agreement whereby developed nations would collectively reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 percent by 2020, compared to the 1990 thresholds, while larger developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 percent over the same period.
Together, the countries could reduce emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Community also boosted Friday’s talks by pledging to allocate $3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the impacts of climate change – from mastering floods and droughts to avoiding deforestation.
Friday nevertheless brought the same verbal fireworks that had determined the talks last week.
U.S. Climate Special Representative Todd Stern has rejected formulations calling for mandatory reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for developed countries, compared to voluntary reductions for larger emerging economies if they are not funded by the developed nations.
This train announced that the Obama administration is taking a tougher line with China than Bush administration representatives not even two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without major emerging markets standing up and taking action, Stern said, complaining that the text does not go far enough to ensure that the cuts could also be confirmed by outsiders.
Stern made his statement an hour after China’s Deputy Secretary of State He Yafei stated that the leading American climate negotiator was either lacking “reason” or it was “highly irresponsible” by him that he said earlier this week that the United States would not help China financially to cope with global warming.
With the future economic march of the great world powers at stake, lines of fracture have arisen both within the industrialized nations and between the industrialized nations and the emerging economies.
The current struggle equally relates to saving individual economies, as well as saving the planet, with China and the United States fighting for their corresponding commitments, while poorer countries claim that the two dozen most influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take more courageous action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the major powers are struggling to determine who should bear the costs of curbing greenhouse gas emissions, as even affected countries have moved to take more aggressive measures to hold countries with very high greenhouse gas emissions accountable for their actions.
This is clearly a game from which a new economic hegemony will develop, says Ulate, who is also working as a regional climate change advisor for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries most exposed to the impacts of climate change said they would continue to fight for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although the leading participants say the talks will lead to a political agreement at best.
The Alliance of Small Island States with 43 members presented a 24-page draft treaty early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who heads the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said the offensive of the small island states "exerts political pressure on the entire political process," partly because they are now united and demand action from emerging economies, such as China and India.
The talks were given a new urgency as the delegates focused on the fact that most of the open issues still need to be clarified before the arrival of the leaders to reach an agreement.
High-ranking representatives, such as India’s Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and China’s Deputy Minister, got off their planes and raced through the corridors of the Bella Center to meetings behind closed doors and press conferences to identify claims to be negotiated over the next week.
The pure scale of the gathering -- 13,000 people go in and out of the convention center every day, guitar-playing activists host night-time shows making fun of the countries they think are betraying and selling, and draft contracts are hand-in-hand rather than emailed -- is already a challenge.
The intensity is just building up: Almost all major ministers are now here and from Wednesday, 60 government leaders will be in Copenhagen.
“We’re coming to the upper league,” said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice President of Global Policy at Conservation International.
The heavyweights are coming.
UK's first 225 km/h train redefines Monday feeling
Monday morning at 5pm 13 a pipe will penetrate the darkness to announce a train descent that represents a revolution in traffic in the UK.
The first high-speed commuter train in the country will reach 225 km/h from Ashfort, Kent to London St. Pancras and cover 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lady Kelly Holmes will then board the first Javelin commuter service from London to Lord Adonis, the Transport Minister.
He hopes that the new service will eventually connect the UK to an international rail network of faster, more reliable trains and connect the major metropolitan areas of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
The neglected province could become vibrant commuter cities, work-access times would be radically reduced, and switching from airplane and car to rail would reduce national carbon emissions and road congestion.
In theory, the three major parties believe in this vision.
But the many billions of British pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable planning battle and fears of environmental damage could still pull the brakes on the British high-speed tracks.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company founded in January to submit a feasibility study to the government, will present the report to Lord Adonis on December 30, according to the Times.
As a result, it receives a detailed route map of the next planned stage of the high-speed rail network.
The new rail line, which will connect London to the West Midlands, will lead past urban areas and places where the impact on the environment is controversial, with a five-metre margin.
In the open terrain, the plan will show the concept within a distance of 25 meters from the final route.
HS2 will also create three options for a larger, northward leading high-speed rail network.
Lord Adonis will respond to this in the spring.
The preferred proposed option is a Y-shaped route, where a single high-speed route would lead to the West Midlands.
The route would divide in or near Birmingham and one branch would lead west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems to be the best working option," said a railroad insider.
Once completed, the travel time between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The first section, which would not be opened before 2025, would allow travellers to cover the London-Birmingham route in 49 minutes, compared to just over an hour today.
The designs offer trains the possibility to travel at a speed of 400 km/h, making the British rail network the fastest in Europe.
The first line was planned in such a way that 400 meters long trains with a maximum capacity of 1,100 people can travel on it.
Up to 18 trains per hour could operate on the London-Birmingham route.
This, in turn, would mean that a final stop would be needed in London, at which 20,000 travellers could be handled per hour.
Given the spatial constraints in the capital, an existing station is expected to be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
Railway experts say that only St. Pancras International or Euston have this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether he believes this plan should be continued or not, but the lengthy public consultation and planning measures mean that a final decision will not be made until after the parliamentary elections.
But even if it sets the wheels in motion, the rail network must be built in sections.
The trains would first have to switch from high-speed lines to existing rail lines in the north of Birmingham, which would continue to take more than three hours to travel between London and Scotland.
This is considered a decisive breaking point in order to ensure a change from an airplane to a railroad, a benchmark for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers Appeal for Mortgage for <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 Orangery of a Conservative
Alan Duncan, the Conservative leader of the House of Commons, has charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orangery he had built in his house in his constituency.
The party's prison spokesman, who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that members of the House of Commons have to live "from lean rations," raised his mortgage by <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 to build an oak fencing plant on his second home in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge the taxpayer the additional interest income, a sum of hundreds of pounds per month.
The House of Commons officials approved the motions at the time, and they were also not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who is conducting a review of the spending of the members of the House of Commons. Last night Duncan said the motions could not have been "even cleaner or more understandable".
Duncan, one of the richest members of the House of Commons, owns a two-storey house in a village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
Nearby houses have achieved a purchase price of almost one million pounds (1.1 million euros).
The ground floor includes kitchen, living and dining rooms, but the Fees Office, a spending control post of the lower house, has agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year, he cultivated a conservatory, which is referred to as an "orangery" in the plans.
Neighbors described it as a "glasshouse for entertainment".
Duncan was also not asked by the Standards and Privileges Committee to comment on the increased withdrawal of money during a recent investigation of his previous mortgage contracts.
The committee acquitted him last month after an examination of his expenditures from breaching the rules.
In 2004, Duncan transferred the security for a <0xC2><0xA3>271,406 mortgage from his London home to his constituency house, which he bought in 1991, a year before he was elected a member of parliament.
Documents published this week show that by March last year, Duncan was refunded approximately <0xC2><0xA3>1,400 per month as mortgage interest.
In April, his claims rose to more than 1,800 pounds (2,000 euros) per month.
The interest rate of Duncan’s RBS mortgage has not changed during this time, suggesting that the total increase was used to fund the <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 withdrawal.
The normal RBS mortgage rate dropped from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March this year, where it still stands.
The latest documents published by the House of Commons show that Duncan continued to claim his claim to <0xC2><0xA3>1,250 per month this May.
Duncan lost his position as the opposition leader of the House of Commons in September after an undercover reporter filmed him doing so when he said after the spending scandal that members of parliament would live "from lean rations."
“Essentially, working for the state means living from lean rations and being treated like shit.”
He said, "I have spent my money on my garden and claim a small portion of what belongs to me.
And I could have demanded the whole damn sum, but I don't."
The member of parliament, a millionaire from his previous career as an oil wholesaler, was first attacked in May for his spending when it became clear that he had claimed thousands of pounds for his garden before settled with the Fees Office that this "could be considered an exaggerated claim."
In protest, an activist dug a hole in Duncan’s lawn in the form of a pound sign after it became known that he had demanded 4,000 pounds (4,500 euros) over three years.
When questioned about the raised mortgage last night, Duncan said, "This had been approved by both the Fees Office and subsequently by Legg to increase value."
He added: "There is no debate about dodging and winding through or bending the rules or the like.
Everything is perfectly transparent and moves strictly within the rules, is approved and everything.
It couldn’t be cleaner and clearer.”
Come all of you believers to admire Brighton’s beach hut advent calendar
Beach cabins in Brighton have found a new way of life for the winter months as an interactive Advent calendar.
"Beyond", an alternative church group that encourages spiritual discoveries through creativity, has invited 24 owners to decorate their huts for each December day with Christmas songs as a theme.
The event started on December 1st and visitors were allowed to watch the latest hut every day from 5:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. with free mulled wine and traditional mince pies, filled with dried fruit pastries.
The Christmas songs selected so far are "I saw three ships", "O come, o come, Emmanuel" and "The first No<0xC3><0xAB>l", where the hut decoration is the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is a volunteer minister of the Chichester Diocese and head of Beyond.
He said: "We want to make religion more important to people in a post-Christian society.
Why do we, as a church, expect people to come into a strange old building? I think the church should go to the people and organize inspiring celebrations.
The idea for the beach hut advent calendar began as a conversation with some friends at dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastically creative and vibrant place and we try to express it through our spirituality.”
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and in the world for the climate.
Tens of thousands of people around the world and in Copenhagen on Saturday demonstrated to demand an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against global warming, where police have made several hundred arrests.
At least 30,000 people, according to police, one hundred thousand according to the organizers, have marched in the cold of the Danish capital, on the verge of the United Nations climate conference, which should lead to a conclusion by Friday, which could come into force from 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, the Danish president of the climate conference, the increasing mobilisation in the world for the climate contributes to what is illustrated by these demonstrations that the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen would be very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital took place shortly after the train passed, when a group of 300 protesters, dressed entirely in black, had smashed windows with paving stones and hammers, a journalist of the AFP noted.
Anti-unrest policemen intervened immediately and without consideration.
Police have announced that 600 to 700 people, mainly members of the Blacks Blocs, this extremely violent splinter group, which already made itself famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, were arrested in eastern France in April.
The Coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, has sharply criticized the conditions under which hundreds of militant supporters had been detained "without distinction", and has underlined that about one hundred of them were "still detained in the streets on Saturday evening", despite the extreme cold with handcuffs and in-seat position.
The rather peaceful train went from the parliament to the Bella Center where the negotiations took place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building without attempting to enter.
A stage was installed to welcome the speakers for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of the former South African Archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
The majority of the protesters arrived by buses and trains from the major European cities, but also many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans were present, as well as some Africans.
Approximately 3,000 people, most of them wearing sky-blue raincoats, made their first run in Copenhagen in the morning as they responded to the call of the Friends of the Earth to form “blue tides” for “climate justice.”
Today we are going to the streets to demand a reparation of the ecological debt in favor of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, Filipino activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can’t go on and say we have time, said Angelique Kidjo, singer from Benin.
There are rivers in Africa that dry out, watercourses where you can walk, as it has never been the case in the past.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, founded in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of globalisation critics has approached environmental organizations.
MEP José Bové, figure of the globalisation critic, announced that he came to Copenhagen to link "climate justice and social justice": "Today there is no difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world."
The Asia-Pacific region, where there are many islands that are particularly at risk as a result of warming, has given the start to the demonstrations.
About 50,000 people have taken to the streets in Australia, according to the organizers.
In Manila, there were several hundred people, mostly students, who marched in red and raised bandanas in which you boasted solar energy.
In Hong Kong or in Jakarta, but also in Canada, marches of several hundred protesters took place to demand a vigorous approach to climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the 350 network have gathered several hundred people, namely in Paris, in Marseille (south), in Lille (north), in Bordeaux (west) and in Lyon (east).
A few people gathered in Geneva.
The separatist Abkhazia has elected its president, Georgia denounces that this is a "stroke".
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, a little more than a year after Moscow recognized this pro-Russian separatist Georgian area as independent, Tbilisi denounced the "stroke."
Approximately 131,000 people were called to participate in the first election after the Russian-Georgian War of August 2008 for control of the South Ossetian territory, another Georgian secessionist territory recognized by Russia.
The polling stations are closed at 5 p.m. GMT.
The turnout was about 58% a few hours before the polling station closed, according to the Abkhaz Election Commission officials.
The first preliminary results should be announced on the night of Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates, including the former president, Serguei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemns the election.
These elections are a farce.
For his part, the Georgian president, Mikheil Saakachvili, regrets that Abkhazia is now under Russian total occupation, his press spokeswoman, Manana Manjgaladze, has declared.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this area with 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world perceives it as a part of Georgia that is illegally occupied by Russia.
Having separated from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, killing several thousand people, Abkhazia wants to prove by this election that it is willing to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, a new era, as an independent state, has explained Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claims to have elected for Mr. Bagapch.
She was one of the voters who went to vote in a polling station located in a school in the capital Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian dominance is at the heart of this presidential election, in a region with beautiful landscapes on the Black Sea.
Large signs showing Bagapch on the side of the Russian president and the head of government, Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are everywhere in this small area that has 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, which is located in the east of the country, the district chief, Beslan Archba, has prepared a warm welcome to the Russian representatives who have come to supervise the elections.
We, the Abkhaz people, are grateful, he said at a small celebration, as an allusion to Moscow’s support, especially regarding the decision to recognize Abkhazia’s independence.
“I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations,” Alexei Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian parliament, replied, raising a glass of vodka.
The opposition, for its part, represented by the former vice president and two Russian businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, has criticized the agreements made with Moscow last year, as the one in which Abkhazia gives Russia control of the railway for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Banba, claims to support neither the current government nor the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is necessary to win the election.
If none of the candidates reaches this threshold, a second round of voting must be organized within two weeks.
Climate: Demos Worldwide, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated all over the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding treaty from the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where the police, ready for action at any time, have arrested about 700 people on the verge of an important demonstration.
Thirty thousand people according to the police, one hundred thousand according to the organizers have demonstrated in the afternoon cold in the Danish capital, which by 18 December will welcome delegates from 193 countries who are looking for an agreement to come into force on 1 January 2013.
From the parliament, the peaceful train marched towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations are taking place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the center and did not attempt to penetrate.
A stage was set up to welcome the planned speakers for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of the former South African Archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the train passed, a group of protesters dressed entirely in black and armed with bricks and hammers began smashing slices, a AFP journalist noted.
Anti-unrest police immediately surrounded you and intervened without consideration by throwing some of you on the floor.
Police have announced that 600 to 700 people have been detained and have made it clear that they are mainly members of the Blacks Blocs, these extremely violent splinter groups that have already made themselves famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
In the evening, a police officer suffered an injury to the chin during the incidents, in which, according to police, about twenty people were provisionally arrested. Four vehicles burned near an occupied house.
"We have the extreme groups under control," said police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen, while the helicopters of the law enforcement forces were circling in the air.
Most of the protesters arriving by train or by their own vehicle from major German cities, from London, Amsterdam or Milan were Europeans.
However, there were also many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, and Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in a sky-blue raincoat, formed in Copenhagen in the morning after the call of the "Friends of the Earth" to form a first group, which should represent the "blue seas" for "climate justice".
"Today we are going to the streets to demand that the ecological debt be repaid to the people of the South," activist Lidy Nacpil told the Jubilee South Coalition of the Philippines in Copenhagen.
“We can’t say we still have time,” said Benin singer Angélique Kidjo.
“In Africa, there are rivers that dry up, there are streams through which you can walk, which was never the case before.”
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was launched in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of the anti-globalization opposers has approached environmental protection organizations.
José Bové, a French member of the European Parliament and critic of globalisation, told AFP that he had come to Copenhagen to "combine climate justice and social justice" and that "there is no difference today between fighting global warming and fighting for another world."
The organization Oxfam has mobilized several personalities, such as the Danish model Helena Christensen or the former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, who turn to the masses.
The Asia-Pacific region, where there are many islands that are particularly vulnerable to global warming, has given the impetus to the demonstrations.
In Australia, according to the organizers, about 50,000 people took to the streets.
In Manila, several hundred people, most of them students, dressed in red with bandanas, have advertised for solar energy in front of the city administration of the Philippine capital.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta, hundreds of protesters have also gathered in an action against climate change.
In France, several hundred people joined forces during the demonstrations organized by the "Net of 350", particularly in Paris, Marseille in the south, Lille in the north, Bordeaux in the west and Lyon in the east.
Several people gathered in Geneva.
According to Chatel, the subjects of geography and history emerge from the school reform of the lycées.
National Minister of Education Luc Chatel stated in an interview published in the Sunday newspaper "Journal du dimanche" that the subjects of geography and history emerge from the school reform of the lycées, even if they are not taught in the terminal (12th school year) compulsory.
"The students of the Première (11th year of school) now have every four hours of the week and the same program," confirms Mr. Chatel.
For the minister, "this hypocrisy must be overcome", because, according to him, "the scientific profile is no longer a scientific profile", but, on the whole, a concentration of "the best pupils."
"The socio-economic and literary profile (ES and L) must not become a sub-profile of the scientific profile," he continued. He underlined : "I have not heard many historians and intellectuals who would have been outraged by the lack of historical-geographical education in the terminals on technical liceen."
On Saturday, an IFOP survey published in Humanité found that nearly seven out of ten French (69%) criticized the state project of removing the mandatory teaching of history and geography in Terminale S (12th year of school with a scientific profile). Many teachers and intellectuals also criticized this project, as well as the left and some representatives of the right.
The Minister, however, replied that there was no question of limiting the philosophy of the program of Terminale S.
Luc Chatel also defended the education reform for teachers, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) had called for Tuesday to protest against the project, which, in their opinion, is the pedagogical training of future teachers.
The Minister explained that in the Master 2 (M2) they undergo a subject-related aptitude test at the beginning of the year and at the end of the year an admissions examination, during which their teaching skills are tested.
They also conduct internships during the year in the M2 and then teach one year in front of the students as a teacher in the internship.
He continued, “If you add all the internships offered before the performance exam, you’ll achieve even more hours spent in front of the students, i.e. more than 300 hours.”
Finally, the minister stated that he wants to offer "the individual right to education" - a "thing that does not exist in popular education."
He confirmed once again that he wants to abolish the school card "by 2012".
15 minutes for the climate at the "Ecole Normale Supérieure"
Fifteen minutes to talk about the deployment at the Copenhagen summit: this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, had to tackle on Saturday morning at the Ecole Normale Supérieure in the Rue d'Ulm in Paris.
As one AFP journalist noted, Nobel Peace Prize winner Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, in which experts each turn to the audience for fifteen minutes with filmed contributions.
“We want to do something to reach people and make them feel like they want to learn more,” said Edouard Hannezo, 22 years old and one of the organizers of this day, on the edge of the conference. The name of this event is derived from the name given by the students to the fish in the basin of the school.
“Among the experts, around twenty discussion participants were selected, also according to their charisma,” he specifies.
"You can talk about climate warming for hours, but the core goals can also be set in a few minutes," Jean Jouzel told the AFP, who acquitted about 50 people only with the help of slides.
"This is part of our role as a scientist," he stressed, hoping that the audience might see that "the Copenhagen Conference is based on an absolutely serious scientific dossier."
The videos filmed by these conferences will be available online on the school’s website from December 15.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February and will take place every two months thereafter.
Delay in payment : angry prison guards, actions planned
The unions of the prison officials called for a general day of action on Friday to ensure that the premiums and overtime, which were postponed for budget reasons until January, are transferred before the Christmas holidays.
The 2nd union of prison officials ("FO-Penitentiaire"), called on employees who are not on duty to demonstrate in front of the prison on Tuesday morning and block it in order to draw attention to the "theft of what is due to them."
The third union of prison officials (CGT-Penitentiaire) called for "a strong mobilisation in the various prisons" on which the non-payment of overtime hours, night surcharges and Sunday and holiday surcharges in December is branded as "shameful and unacceptable".
The first union of prison officials, the Autonomous Federal Penitentiary Union (UFAP/UNSA), called for "general mobilizations (...) to show dissatisfaction and anger."
The management of the prison and the Ministry of Justice stated that overtime increased sharply in 2009 and not all of them were planned in the budget, but they guarantee that the remaining claims will be paid in January.
According to the Ministry of Justice, Michèle Alliot-Marie sent a letter to the prison officials’ unions guaranteeing that the payment will be made next month.
"I know very well the efforts of the personnel to keep our prison system functional and modernize," the Minister of Justice said in this letter.
"I have instructed the management of the prison to take immediate action so that such a situation, created by a lack of appreciation of the overtime incurred, will not be repeated in the future," Ms Alliot-Marie added.
The December salary is therefore low, except for the management staff, who enjoy high service and target premiums, explains the UFAP/UNSA, for whom the "budgetary constraints" must be met.
"This is an absolute scandal," the interregional trade union FO in Marseilles is outraged and announces to boycott "all gatherings and convocations" until new instructions.
"The staff does not go to work on Sundays and public holidays when the hours of October in December are still unpaid. This also applies to their overtime hours," the FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne threatens.
"At a time when more and more tasks are being imposed on us without hiring more personnel, trying to enrich themselves in the personnel's funds is more than inappropriate," said the Bordeaux CGT union.
According to the trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, and some are less affected than others.
In any case, however, it is wrong, states the Secretary-General of the UFAP, Jean-François Forget.
Obama says he’s always giving Christmas better gifts than he gets himself.
US President Barack Obama, who will be spending Christmas with his family in the White House for the first time, has told TV talk master Oprah Winfrey that he is always distributing better gifts than he himself is getting.
During a special show broadcast on ABC on Sunday evening, the president and his wife Michelle gave a glimpse of how they will spend the holidays in their new illustrious home.
Even Bo, the little four-legged companion of the family, will be part of the game.
"Santa Claus also loves Bo," reaffirms Michelle Obama, adding that the dog will of course also receive a gift.
Michelle Obama decisively rejected her husband's claims about the quality of the gifts. "I gave you beautiful gifts last year," she teases the president.
"So please," he whispered, pointing to the first lady's pearl necklace, "and who gave you this?"
During this one-hour broadcast in a casual atmosphere with the well-known television presenter, who had so vehemently supported Barack Obama during his campaign, the president and his wife also talked about gifts they loved most as a child.
Barack Obama remembered a ten-speed bicycle and a basketball that his father, whom he rarely saw, had brought him from Kenya for Christmas.
“I remember my dad once visiting us at Christmas and bringing me a basketball,” the president said.
“It wasn’t until much later in my life that I realized that I had this ball from him.”
The first lady, for her part, remembered her dollhouse.
"I didn't know how to arrange the furniture in a house at all, so I put them all on the wall instead of grouping them around the fireplace, but I loved this little dollhouse," Michelle told Obama.
Johnny Hallyday re-opened, RTL confirms he has been put into artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was again operated in Los Angeles for significant "damage" following an operation in France. According to the people around him, the situation is "under control", although RTL confirms that the singer has been put into an artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rock musician was re-opened at the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles on the night of Wednesday to Thursday after American doctors found “damage resulting from the operation of a disc hernia” he suffered in Paris on November 26, according to his production company in Paris, which added that these damages required re-operation.
The singer's production company nevertheless wanted to clarify that the situation was "under control" and announced that a new medical opinion would be available in 48 hours at the latest.
However, according to RTL, the partner during the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday was put in an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications."
However, only after 48 hours was there a little more certainty about the condition of the patient when he opened his eyes, RTL added.
At the request of the AFP, there was no confirmation or comment from the production company.
RTL also confirms that "certain sources indicate" that after its first operation in Paris, "no drainage of any kind" was laid.
The rocker had been operated on in the international clinic of Parc Monceau because of a herniated disc.
The procedure, scheduled for several days, was performed by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor who had already treated many stars.
This was not available for comments to RTL on Thursday night.
After the operation of Johnny Hallyday, the singer was hospitalized at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday due to a follow-up infection after the procedure.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, who is very close to Johnny Hallyday, told RTL on Thursday that his boyfriend is currently walking through a "deep valley", but he assured that there was "no need to worry" about the rock musician, as he is "a good fighter".
"He called me to Los Angeles before he left, and I told him it was nonsense to sit on an airplane for 12 hours after such an operation, but that's not the way it is," said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday evening, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, confirmed that Johnny Hallyday "reacts well to the antibiotics" and that "the infection is contained."
Mr. Camus also stated that he had spoken with Laeticia, the singer’s wife, and he did not feel any particular concern.
Nevertheless, concerns about the singer’s health had grown ever greater since he spent nine days in a hospital in July after falling on his yacht.
Two months later, the general amazement was that Johnny Hallyday had a "small colorectal cancer operation" which resulted in a mild infection.
At the end of September, the singer recorded his long "Tour 66" as a farewell tour.
Fans and journalists have not missed the fact that the singer had trouble moving on stage.
It was not until mid-November that the people around him denied a readmission to the hospital.
Euro-2009/Kurzbahn: First place for Bousquet over his favourite distance
The Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, three-time medal winner at the 2009 World Swimming Championships, won an international title on Thursday over his favourite distance, 50m freestyle, at the Euro 2009 on the short track in Istanbul.
On the first day of this race, the last time the polyurethane suits were allowed, there were only three world records, while a true record flood was expected.
A record was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto over 4 x 200 m positions and the other two by Russia at 4 x 50m positions of the men.
Too bad for Bousquet, who wanted to reach for the world record in the 50m freestyle, whose record he holds in the big pool (20.94).
At one of the two royal distances in swimming, 50m freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman asserted himself in 20.53 seconds,. in a final with ten swimmers at the start (usually there are eight) - a premiere on an international level.
Bousquet defeated the Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and the Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but he failed to break the world record (20.30) as planned.
"You can believe in ever-greater and in this case, I have said that if the world record is within my reach, I will try."
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers started in polyurethane suits, which were banned from 1 January 2010.
With 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations end their epic in Istanbul, which began in 1999 at the same competition for the first time.
The use of the combination did not pay off this time for the German Paul Biedermann, two-time world champion in the basin this summer in Rome and world record, in the end.
The young swimmer has not managed to improve his best time over 400m freestyle (3:32.77), yet he prevailed with the second best time in his career (3:34.55), ahead of the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
“I didn’t give everything this time.
I knew I couldn't win a world record today, but I defended my title and did my job."
"Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future," Biedermann said.
USA: Zola tombstone estimated at $1.5 million
A Roman grave plaque, which appeared precisely with French writer Emile Zola, was estimated at $1.5 million above its value on Thursday, art dealer Sotheby's said.
This plate is two meters long and 63 cm high. It dates from the 3rd century AD and has always been valued at 150,000 to 250,000 dollars.
The marble, which "represents four scenes of Dionysus in a sophisticated architectural decor, surrounded by satyres and Bacchus figures, is a rare piece. There are only four or five of them in the world," Florent Heintz, vice-president for auctioning Roman and Egyptian antiques at Sotheby's, told AFP on Tuesday.
It was sold among hundreds of pieces.
"The sale is still ongoing, but this part is certainly what buyers have been bidding the most for so far," Sotheby's spokesman Dan Abernethy told AFP.
The discovery of this purchase of the marble part by Emile Zola goes back a long way.
The plate was at home in Rome for almost 300 years in the famous collection of the Borghese family, after which it appeared piece by piece at the French actress Cécile Sorel, who used it in her bathroom at her Paris hotel and at Paul Reynaud, minister in the III French Republic and president of the Council, before Marshal Pétain came to power.
The next 50 years are in the dark.
When searching the Louvre database, Florent Heintz discovered that this plate was part of a "Legacy of Emile Zola", which was opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of the "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco "Rougon-Macquart".
Zelaya's attempt to leave Honduras for Mexico has been defeated
On Thursday, Mexico declared the conditions for the transfer of overthrown Honduran President Manuel Zelaya to domestic soil as incompatible after this was rejected by the coup government as unacceptable.
“After a telephone conversation with President Zelaya that took place at night, everything seems to indicate that there is disagreement about the possibilities of carrying out this transfer,” said Patricia Espinosa, Mexico’s foreign affairs minister.
According to the immigration agency, the plane provided by the Mexican government, which arrived in Salvador on Wednesday for the purpose of transferring M. Zelaya, has returned to its starting point.
The coup government wanted to force M. Zelaya to "abdicate" and request political asylum for him abroad under escort.
The overthrown president, however, declined, wishing to return to Mexico as the welcomed, acting head of state.
The coup regime "has suffered another failure by trying to get me to give up at my expense (...), they wanted me to abdicate," Zelaya told Radio Globo on Thursday, in which he often speaks since the beginning of the political crisis, which has already lasted five months in the Central American country.
I can stay here well and gladly for ten years, here I have my guitar, added the overthrown president, who had fled to the Brazilian embassy of Tegucigalpa two and a half months ago, under the striking of some chords.
The Mexican embassy has presented us with a request for escort, but unfortunately we cannot accept it, as it does not include a request for asylum, Oscar Raul Matute, Interior Minister of the coup government, told Honduran radio HRN on Wednesday.
I am not asking for asylum in any country at all, Manuel Zelaya had answered in an interview with the channel Telesur, whose headquarters is in Caracas.
A possible exit from Honduras, he had underlined, would only act as president of the Honduran people.
The rumours of an exit of M. Zelaya had mobilized on Wednesday the supporters of the overthrown president, who had set out to and gathered around the Brazilian embassy, after which the military there had intensified its deployment.
The Brazilian foreign minister Celso Amorim criticized the position of the coup government.
This, according to his assessment, reveals the marginal character of this government in the face of international norms.
Zelaya, who had approached socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, had been overthrown on June 28, on the day of the popular referendum he organized in preparation for his re-election, contrary to the advice of the Supreme Court, the Army and Congress.
From his exile in Costa Rica, he had surprisingly returned on September 21 and had fled to the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves, he is imprisoned for treason, of which he is accused by the judiciary, according to the coup d'état government.
The coup president Roberto Micheletti has managed to organize a presidential election on November 29 to replace M. Zelaya.
In the course of the controversial election, Porfirio Lobo had been recognized by the United States, but rejected by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argeninien or Brazil.
Three days later, the Congress had voted massively against M. Zelaya’s return to office until the end of his mandate on January 27.
Wall Street on the upswing, US trade balance feeds optimism
The New York Stock Exchange closed on Thursday with a high, the figures of the US trade balance testify to a price recovery of the shares of the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones rose by 0.67%, the Nasdaq by 0.33%.
According to the closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose from 68.78 points to 10,405.83 points, while the Nasdaq, which is dominated by technology, rose from 7.13 points to 2,190.06 points.
The extended index Standard & Poor <0xCC><0x81>s 500 was registered with 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1,102.35 points.
There is good news from various industries, said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
However, this remains anecdotally under the premise that the market focuses only on "semi-full glasses", she moderated.
According to Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors are focused on the numbers in the US trade balance, “which shows an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter.”
The trade deficit in the United States fell 7.6% in October compared to September to $32.9 billion.
Analysts, on the other hand, had expected a deficit increase.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The big news is the increase in the total volume of trade, especially in goods exports, which reflects the economic growth of the main trading partners of the United States, commented Christopher Cornell from Business Research Economy.com.
In return, unemployment reports in the United States have risen in the last week contrary to expectations and have now reached the level of 474,000 requests.
However, the average number of new job seekers has fallen "to the lowest point of the year over the last four weeks," said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The 10-year profitability of government bonds rose to 3.482% compared to 3.432% on Tuesday night, and the 30-year profitability of bonds to 4.492 percent compared to the 4.408 percent of the previous day.
Cuba: Hundreds of Partisans in power whistle "ladies in white"
Hundreds of Cuban-led partisans whistled out the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana on Thursday for the purpose of World Human Rights Day and also thwarted another rally, which resulted in a good dozen dissidents being temporarily detained.
Around the forty "women in white", wives or close political prisoners, were whipped on the open streets by government partisans under Raul Castro, just as they were on the walk to the center of the capital to demand the liberation of political prisoners, a journalist confirmed to the AFP.
Down with the Yankies!, "Soldiers!", "The street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Fidel and Raul live!", the empowered partisans shouted with a raised fist towards the dissident women.
The latter were escorted by civilian agents who appeared to “ensure their protection.”
A similar demonstration against the "Ladies in White" had taken place in Havana on the eve, in which there were neither injured nor arrested.
In the Havana district of Vedado, on the other hand, a dozen dissidents, who also set out for the demonstration on Thursday in the face of the International Human Rights Day, were temporarily arrested by civil police, a reporter of the AFP confirmed.
According to this journalist, the police have forced the dissidents, who have been exploited by the government’s partisans, to enter civilian vehicles by force.
Temporary detention of dissidents in such circumstances is usually limited to a few hours.
As candidates for the Sakharov Prize awarded by the European Parliament in 2005, the "Ladies in White" have organized an unauthorised march for the purpose of the "Please release of all political prisoners", the number of which, according to the dissident list, numbers about 200 people, explained Laura Pollan, one of the leaders, whose husband Hector Maceda is serving a prison sentence of 20 years.
M. Maceda belongs to the group of 75 Cuban dissidents imprisoned in March 2003, 53 of whom are currently behind bars.
The Cuban authorities see the regime’s opponents as “mercenaries” or “agents” in the service of the declared archenemy, the United States.
A rarity in itself is that Cuban television reported on Thursday’s demonstration events between pro-government militants and “counter-revolutionary” militants.
Cuba, led by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of slandering rights and freedoms, in particular freedom of expression.
Maniac kills eighty-year-old with knife and leaves 5 injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
An insane man armed with two knives killed an eighty-year-old and injured five other people in the city centre of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) around late afternoon at peak business hours on Friday.
According to the first data of the survey, the 28-year-old attacker had injured the eighty-year-old with two knives in or outside a pharmacy on Boulevard Jean-Jaures for previously unexplained cause and this, according to police data, in the presence of witnesses.
The old man, born in 1929, according to a responsible of the police syndicate Alliance, died in the hospital after his injuries.
In or in front of the same pharmacy, he pre-buttoned a couple with a pregnant woman.
The man, about in his thirties, intervened and was injured.
The first two victims were taken to the hospital, where the 80-year-old died.
The other injured person is in danger of death, as he appears to have been affected by vital organs, according to police sources.
The pregnant woman has become sick as a result of the events and she is said to have been hospitalized in a "shock state", according to a police source.
The armed man, who according to police reports seemed to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, is said to have immediately escaped on the street, the same Boulevard Jean Jaures.
He would have injured two other passers-by, apparently by accident: a thirty-year-old and a forty-year-old, the latter of both severely.
The scenario remained in the dark in the evening.
He had been armed with two butcher’s knives, which he carried crossed behind his back, explained locally Arnaud Pressé, a responsible of the Alliance syndicate of the Hauts-de-Seine area.
Several passers-by, including teenagers, are said to have tried to curb the madman, according to the witness reports investigated by the AFP.
I saw a guy in his thirties wearing a green vest.
Three teenagers tried to intervene.
They didn't make it because the guy was well-built, Alberto, a waiter at a nearby bar, reported.
A horde fell over him, he added, including a city policeman who broke his wrist in the process.
Still on Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at number 61, two city policemen, including their superior, have attempted to arrest the armed man and have been wounded with knife stabs, according to police information.
The event took place in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where a number of shops are located.
Passengers have come to me to tell me that there is an injured person outside.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old person lying on the floor, I put her in first aid position and noticed a gaping wound in the stomach area, Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, told the AFP.
Five minutes later, a second, about thirty-year-old person came, wounded by cuts.
Police officers have finally arrested the man who did not carry any ID documents.
The prosecution of Nanterre has commissioned the District Department of the Criminal Police of Hauts-de Seine (SDPJ 92) with the investigation of the case.
The madman was hospitalized on Thursday night.
In view of his condition, he has not yet been heard in court.
A police source does not rule out him being taken to a mental hospital.
According to another police source, it scented six policemen to tame him at the police station in Clichy, where he had been deported.
He was "in a state of overexcitement" like "all mentally confused of this kind, in which the forces are released during the path of death."
USA: Polanski's lawyer again calls for cessation of prosecution
The lawyer of the French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski has repeatedly called on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, western United States) to drop the prosecution against his client, who is currently in court at his home in Switzerland due to a moral violation of more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, attorney for the director of the "Pianist", has denounced gross procedural errors at the time of the trial in 1977 before three judges of the Second District Court of Appeal in California.
I demand remission of punishment immediately, M. Hummel explained, before adding that the behavior of the judge Laurence Rittenband, who was charged with the case at the time of the trial, "made it run cold down a back".
According to him, the - now deceased - Judge Rittenband, before he gave his judge's verdict, had discussed with a prosecutor who said he had earned Roman Polanski prison - which constituted a serious procedural error.
This discussion had been raised in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski: pursued and desired), especially by the questioning prosecutor David Wells.
M. Wells had finally declared at the end of September that he had "lied" to the authors of the documentary.
If the Court refuses to close the criminal proceedings, Mr Hummel demands that he lead a trial that would enable him to submit the evidence for his argument.
The prosecution, for its part, has repeated the evidence already explained in the first instance, i.e. a discussion on the annulment of the facts accused of the accused cannot be seriously considered until Roman Polanski appears in court.
The 76-year-old director fled the United States in 1978 before the sentence was pronounced for "illegal sexual relations" with a 13-year-old minor.
Since then, he has not traveled to the United States.
The deputy prosecutor of Los Angeles County, Phyllis Asayama, had stated that Roman Polanski "must be there to attend the trial."
Would you like to spread the message in this matter, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, that flight is a way out?, asks Ms. Asayma.
According to her, “the filmmaker asks the court for a favor and thus despises his authority.”
One of the three judges – who now has 90 days to announce their decision – even stressed that “there are other escape alternatives.”
Hummel was not the only one who had requested the cessation of prosecution against Roman Polanski.
The lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, also demanded once again the suspension of the criminal proceedings.
She recalled that her client would no longer tolerate being harassed by any resurgence of the Polanski affair, adding: "No one in this room can say that this procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough.”
Roman Polanski was arrested in Switzerland on September 26 at the request of an American warrant.
After spending two months behind bars, he was then sentenced to house arrest in his chalet in Gstaad in anticipation of possible extradition.
Wall Street is slowed by the rise of the dollar and closes at no rate.
The New York Stock Exchange closed on Friday at no rate in a market torn back and forth between better indicators than expected in the US and a rise in the dollar: The Dow Jones gained 0.63%, while the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
Based on the final figures available at closing, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points, while the technologically dominated Nasdaq gave 0.55 points to 2,190.31 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 expanded index rose by 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1,106.41 points.
"Honestly, the market is quite quiet," Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management noted.
“It remains tightly limited, the volume of trade has become very low and I think it will remain that way until the end of the year.”
The trend was supported by the publication of better economic indicators than intended, which "contributed to improving the market view of the solidity of the economy's recovery", the analysts of Charles Schwab summarized.
In the US, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November, already two months in a row and far more than anticipated.
Furthermore, American consumer confidence improved significantly in December, to 73.4 compared to 67.4 in the previous month, according to the University of Michigan index preview.
However, the indices were slowed by a new rise in the dollar rate, which has reached its highest level against the euro for two months, pushing down “sectors vulnerable to the economic situation,” said Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
As a result, technological values have lost some ground.
The bond market has declined.
The 10-year yield of the Treasury bond rose by 3.540% on Wednesday evening, up from 3.482%, and the 30-year yield of the Treasury bond to 4.497%, up from 4.492 percent on the previous day.
Miss World election again in South Africa
After a month of touring South Africa, the 112 Miss World candidates will cross the last hurdle on Saturday to realize their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion television viewers.
During this great beauty fair, which will be held for the second time in a row in the area of Johannesburg, five of them have already obtained their ticket to the semi-finals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were named Miss Sportive or Miss Topmodel during their African stay.
This was a true swirl of pleasures.
Visiting beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Horn was simply extraordinary.
I’ve seen a lot of things and had a lot of experience!, said Miss Sierra Leone with full enthusiasm.
This competition will take place for the ninth time in South Africa and will be broadcast live from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, on Saturday, from 5 pm (15 pm CET).
I couldn't imagine a better country to hand over my crown.
This experience was simply fascinating.
I am happy to have had this experience twice, underlined Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the South African summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges of experience with candidates and the rediscovery of "breathtaking landscapes".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, press encounters and safari, the Miss is now concentrating on the competition.
The Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, who was elected in 2000 and will also be present at this election, as well as emulate Aishwarya Rai, who was elected in 1994 and both became Bollywood stars.
Of course, every woman’s dream is to be crowned the most beautiful woman in the world, but it’s not just about the look here.
We are ambassadors of our country and I want to come home with the crown, Miss India throws in with a broad smile.
According to the organizers, this 59th edition is underlined with music and dance.
The candidates defil in traditional costumes and not to forget, in a swimsuit.
The show will be presented by a television host, Chinese Angela Chow, by the ex-beauty queen from South Africa, Michelle McLean, and by a responsible Miss World committee member, Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it knows how to welcome the world with an unsurpassable warmth and pride, assures Julia Morley, president of Miss World.
The candidates, like last year, went on a safari, visiting the famous township in Soweto, but this time by bike and tasted the local cuisine.
However, the meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who gave them his hand, was exceptional.
Not usual for a head of state, noted Miss Sierra Leone.
Her most beautiful memory, however, remains undoubtedly the draw in Cape Town (Southwest) to the World Cup in June 2010, a kind of country to advertise for this event a little more.
I'm with people I'd probably never get close to.
I will definitely come back to the 2010 World Cup, promised enthusiastically Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
Johnny Hallyday's news is "very positive," according to his son David.
The news about Johnny Hallyday is "very positive," his son David assured on Friday when he arrived at the airport of Los Angeles, where he visited his father, who has been hospitalized there for a few days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong, everything is going very well, David Hallyday told the press when he got off the plane, in which he arrived shortly after 1 p.m. local time (21 p.m. CET) from Paris.
The singer's son, who made a relaxed impression, assured him that he would be "fastest" to go to Cedars-Sinaï Hospital, where Johnny Hallyday was hospitalized Monday for a bacterial consequential infection following surgery on a disc hernia on November 26 in Paris.
The singer was "set into an artificial coma that night in Los Angeles to be able to alleviate his severe pain and carry out his treatment, the press service announced.
Johnny Hallyday was placed in an artificial coma by doctors at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, where he was admitted to Paris on Monday for a bacterial consequential infection following intervertebral disc surgery on November 26.
The singer had to undergo surgery again on the night of Wednesday to Thursday due to the ill-healthy changes caused by the last intervention.
His wife Laeticia attended a school event at the French high school in Los Angeles on Friday morning, where her daughter Jade goes to school, a photographer of the AFP noted.
The head of the department of orthopedic and traumatological surgery at the hospital Pitié-Salpêtrière, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer at the hospital in Los Angeles on Monday.
The producer has severely burdened neurosurgeon Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, who operated on the singer on November 26 at the Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told that he had done the utmost massacre.
The Los Angeles surgeons said they were totally indignant, Mr. Camus explained.
I have heard that you may be going to court, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday "traveled to Los Angeles far too fast and this with the permission of the Parisian surgeon".
I spoke to this doctor personally on the phone, who assured me that he sees this trip as completely unproblematic, which surprised me very much, since I have already had two intervertebral disc operations myself, he added.
Shortly before, he announced to RTL that the singer had apparently left the hospital "without drainage, without everything" after the operation.
Dr Stéphane Delajoux is very well known in the artistic environment.
He had operated on actress Marie Trintignant a few days before her death in Vilnius, at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he was practicing at that time.
In 2007, he had also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to absorb a hematoma after a brain hemorrhage.
But he is also a doctor with a dubious reputation, who has already been convicted several times for failed operations, not to mention for tax evasion and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, attorney at the Medical Association, has described him as "a man without scruples" who has to answer "regularly" before the board of directors and "everything other than recommended".
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux made a statement on Friday about his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
He explained that the intervention was "perfect" and the post-operative examinations were "normal".
The operation "provoked no bleeding and therefore does not require drainage," he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have been evolving since the last summer, seems to be in question.
It is quite clear that it is a bit too short for a continuation of the tour on January 8 (in Amiens), Mr. Camus explained.
The party alliance UDF (Union for French Democracy) becomes energetic and calls on the Nouveau Centre party to stop using its seal
The party alliance, supervised by François Bayrou's MoDem party, reacted vehemently on Friday to an attempt to take over the seal, the party once founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, on the part of the chairman of the Nouveau Centre party, Hervé Morin, urging him, under threat of prosecution, to no longer use this seal on any document.
Hervé Morin publicly announces his intention to take over this UDF seal, considering that François Bayrou would not be worthy of defending this political legacy after handing the left hand.
The defense minister, whose party partner is the UMP, wanted to reaffirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
To underline his efforts, he had received the support of Deputy Hervé de Charette (formerly UMP, now NC), who is claiming the property of the UDF trademark, since he was the first to apply for this mark at the "Institut national de la propriété industrielle" in 2004.
However, the branch of the UDF party alliance, supervised by François Bayrous' friends, broke the silence and made it clear that they could not be expropriated and, under threat of prosecution, set a time limit for the minister and the deputy to stop using this seal and transfer the trademark's ownership rights to her.
You have made numerous statements in recent days that you would propose to your political movement to take over the UDF seal, the party alliance wrote in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 office members, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the party MoDem, and the Senator Jean Arthuis of the centrist alliance.
You probably also thought you had the right to have the name of this movement +Nouveau centre+, the slogan + of today’s UDF+, printed on their political material as well as on the homepage of your website.
As you know, you have no right to use this seal, UDF’s office said, and urged the NC party to “immediately remove the mention of the UDF name from all material as well as from (its) website.”
In addition, Hervé de Charette was required "to transfer the trademark's ownership rights to their legal entitlements."
If you refuse to do so, we will bring a lawsuit against you to gain respect for the law and to defend the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warned.
In their letter, they emphasize that "UDF has been a full-fledged political movement since 1978 and recall that Morin and his friends "made the choice" to leave this in 2007 to form a competing movement, as others had already done in 2002 to form the party "UMP".
According to the signatories, the Nouveau centre party therefore has no right to use the UDF seal (Union pour la démocratie française).
They also recall that the last UDF Congress in 2007 approved the three-year membership of the MoDem party and the establishment of a branch to defend "the material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, “he had not been a member of the UDF for three years at the time he applied for the brand name” but of the UMP.
He profits in a scandalous and fraudulent way from the lack of depositing the acronym UDF to carry out this for himself.
Further, they point out that this recklessness is on the way to turning into a crime, ironing the NC’s strategy: “It seems more dignified to us in politics as well as in life to make a name for ourselves rather than trying to get out of anonymity by fraudulently acquiring a name on which you have no legal claims.”
Affaire Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier sentenced for exploitation of weakness
The Court of Nanterre decided on Friday to judge artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether, as the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettencourt claims, he used a weak moment of the eighty-year-old to sneak up on part of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his star photographs, will face trial on 15 and 16 April 2010 for exploitation of weakness, a crime punishable by a maximum imprisonment of three years and a fine of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>375,000.
This decision means that there will indeed be a process in this affair worthy of the saga of one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter snatch each other, while at the same time holding the reins of the cosmetic empire L'Oréal.
However, the 15th Criminal Chamber also ordered a medical examination of 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt, which is carried out jointly by three doctors.
The heir and main shareholder of L'Oréal has thus far refused to undergo such an investigation, especially under the conditions presented during the investigation by the Prosecutor's Office of Nanterre.
The doctors appointed on Friday are to present a report before 10 March 2010 in which you clearly announce whether and at what times Liliane Bettencourt may have been in a state of weakness.
I think she will undergo these investigations.
I will speak with her, explained Ms. Bettencourt’s lawyer, Me Georges Kiejman, after the trial.
As for the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, he is very satisfied with the decision of the court.
This is an excellent news (...). The expert report will prove that he (Banier) manipulated this old lady, which you have to protect, he affirmed.
For two years, Liliane Bettencourt’s only daughter has filed a criminal lawsuit against François-Marie Banier, photographer and all-round artist, accusing him of exploiting her mother’s weakness for years in order to steal gifts totalling one billion euros in the form of bank cheques, insurance policies or paintings.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt had always denied being manipulated by the photographer, whom she sees as a long-standing friend.
Although the court would have to examine the admissibility of the lawsuit initiated by Ms Bettencourt-Meyers, the Plaidoyers of the lawyers led to a major family debacle on Friday.
For example, Liliane Bettencourt’s lawyer has relied on three letters sent to her notary by his client (1999, 2003 and 2005) in which she wrote that she mistrusts Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers’ husband.
According to her lawyer, Liliane Bettencourt added: "Please explain to my daughter that for fifteen years, I wrote to Banier once or twice a day.
I have never been able to speak to Françoise since her marriage."
The prosecution of Nanterre once again believes that the plaintiff had no right to react in this way, especially because a guardian judge in recent days has rejected her request to initiate a judicial protection proceedings against her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully legal, is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one has the right to act in their place,” said Marie-Christine Daubigney, the prosecutor’s representative.
The court has now decided to issue a judgment after the trial of the admissibility of Ms Bettencourt-Meyers took place.
Manager Revolution or the End of Strategic Early Education?
If nothing changes to the leadership of the great French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence has been in vain ...
For over a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies in relation to its employees, said the position of the companies vis-à-vis the consumers before the marketing revolution: It is for the personnel to join "values" determined the best, as it was formerly designed to impose on the consumer products by the technicians in the factory.
By putting the customer at the center of the business, the marketing revolution has given the strategies of conquering the markets in the place ... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products separately factors preferences of the customers again regularly!
Demobilization of employees can lead to deadly demoralization.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just the tip of a much larger phenomenon that touches employees in particular.
This demobilization has a negative impact on the development of all of the company’s intellectual functions, especially those of R&E and, more crucially, those of economic intelligence.
Indeed, the IE (Intelligence Economique <0x3D> economic intelligence) "demands from all parties involved (...) a proactive approach and a forward-looking view"; it demands from the employees a commitment that the instructions of authoritarian management completely contradict.
That is why we call for an operational revolution, which would consist in placing the employees at the center of the company’s concerns on an equal footing with the customers.
The Very Conditional Benefits of Internal Opinion Surveys
Will the internal opinion polls, such as the questionnaire Orange submitted to its wage recipients, stimulate this revolution in terms of management practice?
I'm afraid, unfortunately not.
- First, because I was able to find that in the face of a new situation, after many detours, the whole fabric finally comes to do primarily what it has always done....
Also because authoritarianism – one of the pathologies of power – increases proportionally to the importance of its own failures.
And finally, because most executives have a highly simplified notion of human behavior.
Emanating from the major engineering schools, their interpretation of psychology is mechanistic.
They adopt through intellectual comfort the old behaviorist theory, which has recently been reactivated by the US “neurosciences” and unknowingly widely disseminated by research institutes and through the media.
Thus, and by suggesting that it is possible to use the “lever” (sic) to engage employees, a recent survey by Ipsos, published in Le Figaro.fr, strengthens executives in an attitude towards a mechanistic control system that is unsuitable for today’s world.
Identify and measure the mobilization factors
Instead, an operational revolution necessary for the smooth functioning of modern enterprises presupposes the adoption of a definitive view of human behavior.
It consists in integrating a basic protocol into any consideration or practice of governance: for the payees, commitment to the company is only possible if it clearly appears as a means to realize part of their dreams, ambitions and plans.
Currently, only the studies from the multifunctional analysis adopt this conception of the motivation of the employees.
These studies have shown that they assess their company on the basis of a predetermined Doxa that allows them, through their perceived image of the company, to estimate what it offers them to achieve their life goals.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, the executives of the companies can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and place their Human Resource Management back in the right place.
In this way, they create a fertile soil that is favourable for the coordinated development of robust and efficient economic intelligence.
The speech of Oslo: the "just war" brings Obama praise from the right
The American Right welcomed the speech delivered by Barack Obama in Oslo on Friday and was satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize defended the notion of “just war” against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who mocked the award to Obama on October 9, this time applauded the president's speech, following the example of former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin in the 2008 elections.
I liked what he said, Palin explained the face of the Republican Party’s right wing in the daily USA Today, adding that she herself raised the topic of a “sometimes necessary” war in her just-published memoirs.
The war, of course, is the last thing I think Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We have to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, who inherited two wars from his predecessor, George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, sought on Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of force; a way of declaring his decision nine days ago to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, said the president had done “very good work” in Oslo.
I found that the speech was really very good, the former president of the House of Representatives cheered, recognizing in particular the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in Obama's words.
In some parts, I felt that this speech was entirely historical, explained Ginrich, who was interviewed on the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former MP, who is seen by some as a potential candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said he was delighted to have seen a “President of the Left” reminding the members of the Nobel Committee that they “could not be free and would not be able to hand over a prize for peace if the use of force did not exist.”
For Michael Gerson, former writer of George W. Bush and now editor at the Washington Post, Obama has given "a very American speech."
In addition to portraying himself as a "cosmopolitan," as "he always does," he "talked like an American president" when he pointed out that Europeans "live like a security bubble that they didn't create themselves and don't do much for their protection," Gerson said.
Among the few unconvinced right-wingers, former United Nations Ambassador John Bolton, a Bush-era falcon, described the speech on the National Review Online website as "boring, lofty and uninspiring."
To the left of the president, Democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is concerned about how Barack Obama defends the recourse to the armed forces.
If the war is packaged under the guise of justice, the massacre of the innocent can easily be justified, he warns.
The media of the moderate left, however, continues to praise the president.
The Los Angeles Times, which still believes that the Nobel Prize was awarded prematurely to Obama, called the address itself a "monumental work" for a speaker like him, who is known for his talent.
The speech in Oslo "offers a schedule for managing international decisions against conflicts, poverty and repression," the California daily said in a statement.
The New York Times believes that Obama “proclaimed the necessary discourse” and describes his speech as “dark and exemplary at the same time.”
Long-distance drivers: Three marathons for an agreement that secures supplies for Christmas
After a three-week negotiating marathon, the unions of the street association and the TLF – the only employers’ organization that remained until the end – came to an agreement on Friday evening that would put an end to the strike order and the impending severe supply bottleneck for Christmas.
At the signing session on Friday evening, the Secretary of State responsible for transport, Dominique Bussereau, "welcomed" the agreement, which was initiated on Wednesday morning after several weeks of negotiations.
After a second night of negotiations, the negotiators broke up early Friday morning in hopes of quickly signing the agreement in the late morning.
And this despite the fact that the three employers' associations (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) had left the meeting upset.
However, more than six hours passed from the beginning of the meeting at 11 a.m. to the conclusion of the agreement and the agreement was only signed at 6 p.m.
The conflict "would have done a lot of damage to the companies" and "it was to be feared that it would affect the holidays at the end of the year," said Bussereau.
The agreement provides for an increase in wages of 4% for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest wage groups (international transport).
The hourly rate for employees with the lowest wages is thus rising from 8.72 euros to 9.06 euros.
"That's not much, but we're starting small," says Patrice Clos (FO).
The activists are now instructed to stop blocking the supply centers.
"However, there will probably always be some rebels who are not satisfied with the agreement," he adds.
TLF chairman Philippe Grillot spoke of a "good deal", although it was "difficult to allow these wage increases in the face of international competition."
According to him, the increase is 170 euros per month for the low and 100 to 120 euros for the high wage groups.
"This agreement is based on common sense and respect for employees," said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) spoke of "a historic agreement."
Richard Jaubert (CGT) commented on "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for an increase in travel costs of 3% and the maintenance of the total budget for road transport in the first half of 2010, which will allow in particular to address the topic of 13th monthly salary and the modernisation of collective agreements.
M. Bussereau recalled that "the fall in employer levies of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million" was the subject of a government amendment to the 2009 bill of amended finances, which was passed by the National Assembly on the night of Thursday to Friday.
The government demands an "identical" vote from the Senate.
The signature of the TLF allows the agreement to apply first to the companies affiliated to this organisation and then, in the event of an extension by the Minister of Labour, to the entire profession.
This will be the case "in the shortest possible time", Bussereau assures.
The opposition of employers’ associations can only delay the proceedings.
The association FNTR denounced a “fraudulent trade” because the 100 million euros had already been promised to the sector to compensate for part of the carbon tax.
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate as soon as possible, but not on the basis of a joint analysis, but in order not to deter the goose-eaters on the approaching Christmas days, complains the Unostra.
For the association Otre, the agreement threatens "to dig a big grave for the industry's small and medium-sized enterprises in the next 12 months."
Line RER A: disturbances this weekend, unions dissatisfied with the proposals of the RATP
The disturbances on the RER A line, the largest high-speed train network in France for the Greater Paris and <0xC3><0x8E>le-de-France area, continued over the weekend, while a meeting on Friday, the 2nd day of strike between the trade unions and the management of the RATP (Independent Paris Passenger Transport Administration) kept the strikers waiting with their demands for wage surcharges.
On this important shopping weekend before Christmas, no trains ran between 10:00 and 20:00.On the central line (between La Défense and Nation) only one of two trains and outside the central line only one of four trains was operational.
The connection to the trains of the SNCF was interrupted in Nanterre Préfecture, which forced the travellers to change.
The Galeries Lafayette department store chain, which has 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that “RATP is striving to connect the major stores to traffic.”
The RER A line runs through the Paris metropolitan area from west to east.
The section of the RATP connects the towns of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre as well as Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one of two trains operated as scheduled during peak hours, and almost none during low traffic.
As on Thursday, there was no crowding on the platforms, as the inhabitants of <0xC3><0x8E>le-de-France had adjusted to the situation.
So early in the morning, the train station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was far less crowded than usual, mainly because of the lack of high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, 29, engineer, said he “woke up an hour and a half earlier to get to work on time.”
The SNCF, which had planned to provide staff and law enforcement services to the passengers, pointed out that there had been no bottlenecks at Saint-Lazare railway station.
The trains operated by the SNCF on the RER A line or in the direction of Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed via Saint-Lazare station to ensure connection to the metro.
On Saturday and Sunday, general meetings of the strikers were held again, during which the results were reviewed, which the associations had classified as "thirty" after the meeting with the leadership on Friday afternoon.
The RER Managing Director proposed the specific development of a protocol for the RER A line with regard to all relevant aspects, working hours, careers, etc.
However, this is not what the drivers want, according to Thierry Garon (Sud), they are demanding a long-due wage surcharge.
The CGT was outraged that the RATP itself puts its wage surcharge proposals in brackets and stressed that the leadership "is unable to solve a problem, while this was also possible for the long-distance drivers and the SNCF."
The RATP made clear that a renewed meeting was scheduled for Monday to "examine comprehensively the working conditions".
This also shows the associations that the company “ignores the weekend drivers”.
In the morning about 150 drivers visited the branch of a committee in Paris.
Once again, it was the leadership who rejected any discussion during the strike and suggested a meeting after a calming of the situation.
On Tuesday, the conflict threatened to expand to the RER B line after an announcement by Unsa and Independants.
The associations demand a salary surcharge of 120 (US) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants), and they also complain of the deterioration of working conditions on this route, which is used by millions of travellers every day.
The drivers of the RER line, who have years of professional experience, receive a gross wage of 2,200 to 2,700 euros as well as a wage surcharge of 600 to 650 euros for shift services as well as Sundays and holidays.
Turkish Constitutional Court dissolves pro-Kurdish party. Decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court on Friday announced the dissolution of the country’s main pro-Kurdish party; a decision that was immediately followed by furious demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision threatens to make the work of the government tremendously difficult, which is striving to reach out to the Kurdish community to put an end to the conflicts that have been going on for 25 years.
The "Party for a Democratic Society" (DTP) was disbanded because it had become a "site of activities detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," according to the President of the Constitutional Court Hasim Kiliç four days after the decision to the press.
Kiliç said the decision would have been taken unanimously by 11 judges, requiring a seven-vote majority to impose the dissolution, and pointed out that 37 of the party’s executives, including Ahmet Türk and Aysel Tugluk, were excluded from political action for five years.
Furthermore, the judge announced the lifting of parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Turks and Tugluk, as well as the confiscation of the party’s property.
The DTP now has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 550).
The party leaders expressed before the verdict that the parliamentarians would rather leave the parliament than meet like partyless parliamentarians.
The decision followed a 2007 trial initiated by the prosecutor of the Turkish Federal Court, Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, who accused the DTP of following the "instructions" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which Ankara and numerous other countries consider to be a terrorist organization.
Numerous observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
The party assures that it has "no connection" to the PKK, but refuses to call it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate.
The verdict of the Constitutional Court is sparking in between the government, which is striving to meet the Kurdish community and propose a series of measures to strengthen the rights of the Kurds in order to dry up the support of the Kurds for the PKK and put an end to the conflicts.
The leaders of the DTP reaffirm that a dissolution could lead to a resurgence of tensions in Southeast Anatolia, where numerous demonstrations against the detention conditions of PKK leader Abdullah <0xC3><0x96>calan have led to clashes with the police in recent weeks.
Since the court’s announcement, thousands of protesters have gathered in front of the DTP’s premises in Diyarbakir, a city in the southeast, mostly populated by Kurds.
The law enforcement forces deployed tear gas grenades and water cannons as the protesters began to throw Molotov cocktails and stones.
Hundreds of people also protested in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Türk assumed that the court’s decision will “deepens despair even further.”
"Turkey cannot clarify this (Kurdish, Editorial) question on the basis of a party's ban," he told the press.
The government, consisting of a party that emerged from the Islamist movement, also regretted the decision.
"We are opposed to the closure of the parties on principle.
This does not solve the problems," said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
"This decision is a torpedoing of the democratic opening promoted by the government," political market observer Ahmet Island said.
"You can obviously expect a reaction from the PKK," he adds.
On Thursday, the PKK pledged to commit an attack that killed seven soldiers in northern Turkey three days earlier, one of the most brutal attacks in recent months.
The snow can come
A really crisp winter, that’s what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to harass the citizens, says the winter service manager of the FES.
Instead, so that its employees can try out and learn to master the entire vehicle technology.
According to meteorologists, this could be the first time this weekend.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
In doing so, the FES proceeds according to a precise plan.
As soon as it snows nationwide in Frankfurt and the temperatures are below zero degrees, 20 so-called A-routes will be run with large-scale scattering vehicles, Brauburger explains.
These include main traffic and transit roads such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
But also fire brigade accesses, public transport routes, pedestrian zones and routes with gradients, such as the Atzelbergstraße.
FES service starts at three o’clock in the morning
The approximately 1040 kilometers would have to be sprinkled in a maximum of three hours with damp salt, which adheres better.
This is why the FES starts at three o'clock in the night, "so that the routes are free until the professional traffic starts."
It will be difficult if it snows only at 7.30 am.
Then we have a problem, says the winter service manager, "because then no one is ready to make room for the scattering vehicles."
Only afterwards, if it does not snow any longer, are supply and development roads, which also includes the Rat-Beil-Straße, the turn.
The last priority are side and side roads.
There will be complaints there, Brauburg knows.
At five o’clock in the morning, the pedestrians of the FES set out on their way, with dangerous points and transitions being cleared as a priority.
The FES usually cannot take care of all cycle paths.
There is a special service in Frankfurt, which mainly keeps an eye on the bridges from 22:00 to 4:30, says Brauburger.
Since there is smoothness on this fast, as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees, the spreader is on the way.
If necessary, they will also be called by the police.
The cradle of dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like many other carnivorous dinosaurs: the two-metre-long and 1.50-metre-large animal ran on two strong hind legs, had an elongated skull with sharp, curved teeth, short arms with sickle claws and a long tail.
If the species had lived a few million years later, it would have been nothing special.
However, Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs to have these body features, Sterling Nesbitt from the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the journal Science reported Thursday.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in today's New Mexico, which was then in a dry zone of the supercontinent Pangaea on the equator.
Tawa opens a new window on the early evolution of the dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
He tells us a lot about the relationships, the spread and the characteristics of the early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began excavating the Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
We have sometimes found a dozen dinosaur bones in one day, which is unprecedented for Triassic deposits, team member Randall Irmis of the Utah Museum of Natural History reports.
Some of the bones quickly identified the researchers as a new species.
In the course of the excavation, they collected the remains of a total of five individuals.
Find confirms theories about dino early history
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it is an extraordinary find: "Dinosaur fossils from the Triassic are extremely rare, usually you only find individual fragments."
Other dinosaur experts do not necessarily share the enthusiasm.
This finding is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the early history of the dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to the current teaching, the dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
However, many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, which is why the assignment of these primitive dinosaurs is mostly controversial.
For example, the experts debate when the lizards split into their three main developmental lines: the carnivorous theropods, which later included the Tyrannosaurus rex, the Velociraptor and also the birds, which are known as "long necks".
According to Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa hallae is an original theropod.
It has an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
At the skull of Tawa hallae, for example, the researchers found clues to airbags, as they also possess the descendants of the theropods, the birds.
Thanks to the air bags, the breathing of birds is more efficient than that of mammals.
At Tawa hallae, the bones of the spine were also partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropod with airbags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the related line of giant sauropods later also had airbags and lightweight bones, probably the common ancestor of both groups had already produced this useful innovation.
At least three waves of migration to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs known to date lived in South America, the researchers conclude that the lizards first appeared there.
According to this, the three development lines separated early and spread from South America to all continents, which at that time still formed a single land mass as a supercontinent Pangaea.
This is supported by the fact that the team, together with Tawa hallae, found the remains of two other, not particularly closely related theropods.
The three cannot be descended from a common immigrant ancestor, the researchers argue.
We believe there were at least three waves of migration to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the science study.
Of course, there are also contradictions.
An even older species, Silesaurus, belonging to a sister group of dinosaurs, lived in what is now Poland, says Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
In his opinion, it could be a distorted picture, because in South America, especially many primitive dinosaur fossils have been preserved, while there is hardly anything to be found on other continents.
How the dinosaurs managed to evolve from a relatively rare sideline of the reptile tribe to the dominant terrestrial vertebrates of the Earth’s Middle Ages is still mysterious.
During the Triassic, the dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, for example, with the ancestors of today's crocodiles and fly-saurs, and with numerous other lizards.
Towards the end of the Triassic, the dinosaurs spread around the world, developing many new species, while the kinship at the border of the Triassic to the Jura became extinct.
Success story didn’t last forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There could have been a mass extinction that the dinosaurs accidentally survived, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted so they could beat the competition out of the field.
The success story did not last forever.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact helped a group of animals bloom, which had also evolved in the Triassic, and since then a shadow existed: the mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
Professors from the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna, or from Berkeley, California, insist on it.
Teachers from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen are present.
The police eviction of the occupied casino at the Goethe University in Frankfurt is making waves worldwide.
278 professors and lecturers from Goethe University, as well as from universities all over Germany, Europe and North and South America are in solidarity with the protesting students on the Campus Westend.
In a statement written in German and English, they "disapprove" of the police operation initiated by the Bureau.
University President Werner Müller-Estler had the building occupied by students and lecturers in the education strike cleared last week because walls and works of art had been smeared.
Five students were injured.
The material damage, the signatories judge, did not justify "the violent dissolution of self-organized courses of students and teachers by a police command".
The eviction constitutes an "unacceptable interference" in the freedom of research and teaching.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves "the deligitimization and criminalization of the protest" and distracts from the content.
The Bureau has evaded the necessary discourse.
The teachers call for immediate cessation of criminal prosecution.
The majority of the occupiers did not support the damage to property, it says.
Legitimate Protest
The youth of the Verdi trade union and the German Trade Union Confederation are also in solidarity with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of a growing concern for one’s own future, says Verdi Youth Secretary Alexander Klein.
Hessen’s science minister Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) defended the actions of the university president and the police.
We are grateful to the President.
Destruction and occupation are completely unacceptable means, she said in an actual hour on Thursday in the Wiesbadener Landtag.
We have an understanding of the protest, but no understanding of vandalism, according to CDU MEP Peter Beuth.
The opposition groups SPD, Greens and Left saw this differently.
The CDU uses painted walls as a pretext to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (left).
Instead of dealing with the arguments and demands of the students, they have cleared up.
The Left has filed a motion calling on the Interior Minister to report on the police operation.
New Silicon Valley
For many years it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of ten districts of the capital Moscow, was a strictly guarded site for secret arms research in the Soviet Union.
Today, the municipality with its 216,000 inhabitants, 37 kilometers from the center of Moscow, is considered "Russian Silicon Valley".
Significant research and production facilities for micro and nanoelectronics are located here.
Since September 2008, Selenograd’s representatives have been establishing contacts with the university institutes and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Center (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and on Wednesday Selenograd and Riedberg signed a "protocol for closer cooperation" in Frankfurt.
The Moscow Deputy Mayor Yuri Roslyak and Prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd led the Russian delegation, for Frankfurt signed planning deputy Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises of the scientific research focus will travel to Selenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
It is about a continuous scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
FIZ companies will be able to gain a foothold in the growing Russian market.
Conversely, Russian science firms want to get orders in Germany.
Selenograd is the headquarters of major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electron Engineering, the large corporations Sitronics and Rosssijskaya Elektronika.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planned city" for arms research.
Selenograd (literally translated "green city") got its name from the wooded hilly landscape in which the research facilities are embedded.
Stuttgart brake pad
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 cannot be set high enough.
For the supporters of the project, it is simply about "the new heart of Europe".
S21 is much more than the lowering of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project that will plunge the city of the Baden-Württemberg state capital into unhealthy construction site chaos for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 was born from the spirit of the 1980s.
Head railway stations with tracks ending in the middle of the city were then considered to be 19th-century transport fossils, which acted like brake blocks of modern rail transport, as it once took a tremendous amount of time to wrap locomotives from the rear to the front.
Drive in, keep short, continue - that's how it should go.
And that’s why the main railway stations should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a transit station located about halfway between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava – hence the slogan of the “Heart of Europe”.
S21 is now actually being tackled, although the visions of the 80s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even very ambitious planners have realised that in the Hessian and Bavarian cities it is almost priceless to implement lowering.
Head railway stations, however, no longer have an entry and exit problem, since there are modern turnaround trains with locomotives and control cars at both ends.
Nevertheless: Stuttgart 21 along with the ICE new construction line to Ulm is now being tackled.
Local and local politicians have enforced it.
The railway is taking part, also because the risks of the Republic’s largest individual infrastructure project are borne by taxpayers and not by the state corporation.
In terms of urban planning, the project can still be reasonably justified.
New urban space is being created, which - it is believed the computer-generated graphics of the planners - is equipped with a lot of green.
S21 is harmful to the rail transport system.
The transit station and the extension of the line are intended for passenger transport, which was attributed - typically in the 80s - huge growth.
At that time, there was no competition for low-cost airlines.
However, modern transport policy must first focus on strengthening freight transport, as transport by rail is considerably more environmentally friendly than by trucks on the road.
But the new construction line is not suitable for freight trains due to heavy slopes.
Even more serious is that S21 indirectly affects many other railway projects.
A good six billion euros are to be invested in Swabian.
This is the official number.
Experts believe 10 to 15 billion is realistic.
It is certain that in the next decade, the money will be missing at other hubs and bottlenecks on the net.
A total of sixty major projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the extension of the 180-kilometre-long route through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987, the track has been built in slow motion.
It would be urgently necessary to press the tube right here.
But S21 will act as a brake pad.
The Rhine Valley line is becoming a bottleneck for international freight transport: right in the heart of Europe.
The government is judging the airport.
The state government has left open in the Wiesbadener Landtag, whether it will go against the judgment of the Hessian Administrative Court (VGH) on the night flight ban in revision.
The CDU/FDP coalition has commissioned experts to have the more than 400 pages of the VGH ruling legally reviewed, said Economic Minister Dieter Posch (FDP).
The VGH in Kassel had justified in writing that in the event of the construction of the planned Northwest runway at Frankfurt Airport, the country would have to re-regulate the night flight ban.
The admission of 17 flights between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m., as planned by the state government, is not compatible with the legally required protection of the population against nighttime aircraft noise.
The coalition must decide by January 4 whether it will go against the verdict in revision.
The opposition criticized this postponement and urged the representatives of the government to refrain from a revision at the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD leader Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel called on the CDU and the FDP to return to their promises made before the election of a night flight ban. Otherwise, this should be considered a "break of words".
It's damn hard if you can keep your word, Greens leader Tarek Al-Wazir said in reference to the FDP election slogan "We keep our word."
Minister Posch rejected Schäfer-Gümbel's accusation that the state government is still trying to come to its night flights with "right-wing twisting and trickery".
A thorough legal examination takes your time.
The coalition does not want to operate on the basis of a “fast first impression.”
We need a legally secure decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As they represent the opposition, his group’s statements on the night flight ban were never.
U.S. banks pay back aid
The crisis-stricken U.S. large banks are stripping off their state bonds.
The Bank of America on Wednesday repaid aid from the banking rescue fund Tarp totaling $45 billion (some 30 billion euros) in one stroke.
Citigroup also plans to repay state aid, according to a report by CNBC.
The institutions want to get rid of the restrictions that came with accepting the money – such as limiting the payment of manager bonuses and paying high fees.
The Bank of America had secured $19 billion in fresh money from investors through convertible bonds.
She took the rest of the sum from her own cash register, which was well filled, among other things, by divisional sales.
Bank chief Kenneth Lewis expressly thanked the American taxpayer on Wednesday evening: The money injection helped over a very difficult time.
The money house had risen to the height of the financial crisis with the acquisition of investment bank Merrill Lynch.
The Citigroup also intends to raise money on the capital market in order to free itself from its liabilities to the state.
As early as Thursday, the US bank could announce a $20 billion increase in its capital, CNBC reported citing circles.
A Citigroup spokesperson did not want to comment.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already repaid their aid.
Quick choice
It all went faster than I thought.
Almost two weeks after the ZDF Board of Directors had pushed the incumbent editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender out of office, the station can present a successor.
Last night, the committee wanted to vote on the staff.
The favourite was Peter Frey, head of the ZDF-Hauptstadtstudio in Berlin.
However, there was no confirmation from the transmitter for this - officially, so as not to anticipate the procedure.
However, it is likely that this proposal would also have played a role in preventing further damage to ZDF director Markus Schächter if the Board of Directors did not approve of this proposal.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 board members.
The result of the vote was not yet determined at the end of this issue.
Two weeks ago, Schächter failed in the Board of Directors with his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
Only seven members voted for Brender, seven voted against him, and Brender's defeat was a hard defeat for the butchers, but an anticipated defeat.
After all, the Union majority in the Board of Directors had already signaled weeks before the election not to confirm Brender in office.
The resistance against the editor-in-chief of the Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch had been organized.
With the argument that under Brender the news broadcasts of the ZDF had lost ratings, he declined another term of office of the highly regarded editor-in-chief.
Until shortly before the election, there were therefore protests in which the political influence on the ZDF was whipped.
More recently, even 35 state lawmakers had intervened in the debate, deeming Koch’s actions unconstitutional.
It has nothing to do with it.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and Romance studies.
He then worked for Südwestfunk and the Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983 Frey switched to ZDF, initially to the "today journal".
Subsequent posts: 1988 to 1990 personal speaker of the editor-in-chief; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 head and moderator of the "Morning Magazine"; until 2001 head of the ZDF foreign policy; since then head of the ZDF-Hauptstadtstudio.
The Greens announced a constitutional lawsuit after Brender’s re-election, which was voted the Journalist of the Year by the industry magazine Medium Magazine on Wednesday.
Koch's opponent on the board of directors, the Rhineland-Palatinate Prime Minister Kurt Beck, stated last week that the countries should change the ZDF state contract in such a way that personnel proposals of the director cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
However, an excerpt of party politicians from the supervisory boards of the ZDF also excluded Beck.
Brender's prospective successor Peter Frey had recommended himself to the Board of Directors with a clever move - by heavily criticizing the board immediately after the Brender de-election.
Thanks to this proof of journalistic independence, he was able to nominate Schachter without loss of face for the post of editor-in-chief and to elect the board of directors without being suspected of hiring a party member.
In party arithmetic, Frey is anyway attributed to the left-liberals.
Studies are dismantled
Partly successful for the students: After a year of education strike, the Ministers of Culture of the Länder finally took action on Thursday: At a meeting of Ministers of Culture and Rectors’ Conference, both sides agreed to improve the study conditions for Bachelor and Master’s degrees.
Students should be able to complete their studies in the future.
In detail, they agreed to reduce the exam burden: In principle, each study module should only be completed with a single exam.
In addition, the workload of the students is to be checked and "a realistic and reasonable measure" is ensured.
Politics and universities also want to simplify the recognition of exam achievements between universities within and outside Germany.
The countries pledged to make common structural requirements for bachelor and master’s programmes more flexible.
In addition, there should be no deviating country regulations.
Less exams
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, ministers of culture and university principals have been bearing the winged word of better studyability in their mouths.
It was filled with concrete content for the first time.
The so-called accreditation council decided to partly drastically reduce the number of exams: "Each module usually concludes with only one exam," says a 30-page paper, which is to partly re-regulate the admission of courses of study.
With the "significant reduction in the exam burden," said the accreditation board chairman Reinhold Grimm, "a poor development that significantly impaired the studyability should be stopped."
In addition, "studyability" will in future be "the decisive criterion" in the design.
Modules such as content should be "strictly checked" whether "unnecessary constraints on students in the choice of
"Events" should be avoided.
The students would have "a claim to be given scope that enables and promotes self-initiative."
The rules should apply when admitting new courses of study, but also when reviewing existing courses of study.
These must be "reaccredited" every five years – which means that it will take until 2015 for all degree programs to be reviewed.
Ten accreditation agencies nationwide are responsible for this, which are subject to the Accreditation Council set up by the countries.
In October, the Ministers of Culture urged the countries to act on the agencies in such a way that the material abundance is not too large and the examination regime is not too strict.
In individual federal states, universities and universities of applied sciences have already agreed on appropriate measures with the state ministries.
As the only country to date, Rhineland-Palatinate has committed additional funds for the further development of the Bologna process.
The main aim of the funds is to set up tutoring programs and strengthen student counselling as well as examination and foreign offices.
State and universities want to spend 10 million euros on this.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants to introduce a revision of the Higher Education Act in Parliament.
After this, only a single exam will be required for the completion of a study model.
The aim is to make study design more flexible, to ensure recognition of certificates of achievement at other universities and to facilitate access to the master’s degree.
By the end of next year, all study programs in the country are to be checked for their studyability.
The government and the opposition again argued on Thursday about the study conditions in the country.
In addition to praise, there were also criticisms of the resolutions.
The Federal Board of the Juso University Groups demanded that the design of the education policy should no longer take place "behind closed doors" of the ministers and university rectors in the future.
At the latest after the education strikes, the students should now also "discuss a word" as affected.
The future academics received support from the president of the University Rectors' Conference (HRK), Margret Wintermantel: "We need the experience of the students," she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Culture, with whom the HRK discussed a joint reform paper.
Overall, the Bonn resolutions of the trade union for education and science (GEW) did not go far enough: it demands a legal claim that gives every graduate with a bachelor’s degree access to a further master’s degree.
On the other hand, the countries must ensure that the current generation of bachelor students will have sufficient master’s degree courses with the best possible study conditions available tomorrow, according to GEW member of the board of directors Andreas Keller.
Countries need to hire significantly more teachers.
However, the Ministers of Culture did not comment on a freer access to the Master.
More than a footnote on Herta Müller
Entering Germany and from there is almost no control..." is the beginning line of a poem by lyricist Werner Söllner, in which this in disturbing snippets of language themes the arrival experience of a dissident who has gained freedom but at the same time lost his language space.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in the Romanian Banat, had first worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as an editor in a children's book publishing house before moving to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner has been awarded various literary prizes, in 1993 he gave the legendary Frankfurt Poetics Lectures at Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been Head of the Hessian Literature Forum at the Mouson Tower in Frankfurt.
He caused considerable extra-literary sensation last Tuesday during a conference in Munich, which was about "German literature in Romania in the mirror and a distorted mirror of its securitate files".
Visibly confused and embarrassed, Söllner read a statement in which he admitted to colleagues of Romanian German writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer, his collaboration as IM for the Romanian secret service Securitate.
Together with some of the attendees, Söllner received the German Language Prize in 1989.
The recruitment attempts had begun gradually, initially in 1971.
I am, concluded Söllner, "so someone who has not resisted enough intimidation attempts by the Securitate."
The lyricist Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost simultaneously with the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and her unprecedented literary examination of the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literary scene and in particular the community of German authors from Romania are shaken by a case that highlights the abysses and contempt of a political system based on surveillance and spying.
As far as we can say, Werner Söllner is not only a perpetrator, but also a victim.
In his securitate file IM Walter played a role, said the literary scholar Michael Markel after Söllner’s confession, referring to the IM Walter’s positive influence for him.
He had "cut him out" in all the difficult points for him at the time, according to Markel.
It is a moral need for him to make this comment.
Söllner’s statement was unexpected in the form and in front of this audience, but it is not surprising the confession of a former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian intelligence service.
Germany was a cozy reserve for securitate spices, Herta Müller had already written in July in the time after reading her own file, 914 pages.
The victims, it may be assumed, are speculated and in some cases probably also knew what clear name was hidden behind the nicknames Sorin, Voicu and Walter.
Unlike in the case of the Stasi files, which are now very procedure-safe, the handling of the legacies of the Securitate surveillance is still very diffuse.
Systematic enlightenment has been hampered and hampered in recent years.
A National Council for the Revision of the Securitate Files (CNSAS) according to the Birthler Authority was founded only in 1999, but the publication of the files has been rather slow since then.
It has only been since 2005 that a law governing the administration of the files has been in place.
The fact that the influence of former Securitate members in Romania is still very large was confirmed by an interview after the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller, in which a former Securitate chief from Temesvar expressed disdain over the laureate.
She has a psychosis, after all, she was only interrogated once.
The infamy of power meant to be able to express itself here quite openly in the form of freedom of expression.
Certainly the case of Söllner, as so often in connection with concealed guilt, involves unavoidable questions.
The prudent response of the listeners to Söllner’s confession makes us hope that the continuation of this chapter will be determined by the urge for knowledge rather than by guilt and shame.
To the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Saturation Supplement Champions League
It seemed as if a well-dressed salesman was just coming from a very nice Christmas party, at which a sports goods manufacturer had distributed goodies, when the new VfB coach Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag of the outfit, stepped into a summoned C-Class a quarter of an hour after midnight.
The man with the striking baldness was chauffeured because of the city that was still strange to him.
Otherwise, he could have driven himself - alcohol was not in the game after all, and the 55-year-old was not drunk with luck either.
It was a pleasant evening, but tomorrow the work will continue.
Or start right now.
In the words of the Swiss, committed only three days earlier: "We have reached the octave-finals", namely in the Champions League thanks to the 3-1 success against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not be blinded by the success: it will be a brutally hard fight against the descent."
The "much more important task" is ahead on Sunday.
Then it is necessary to repeat in Mainz the royal class performance in the league everyday.
And once again the weaknesses revealed after the fast three goals by Marica (5th), Träsch (8th) and Pogrebnyak (11th) to stop.
Draw (disambiguation)
The eighth-final of the Champions League (innings 16/17 + 23/24 February / returns 9/10 + 16/17 March) will be drawn in Nyon on 18 December.
The joy over the fulminant standing of the Babbel successor thus remained subdued.
Not only the supposed healer, who had imparted confidence, dedication and playing pleasure to the insecure Stuttgart professionals in the short time.
I approached the players and told them to reflect on their strengths, and encouraged them to be more courageous, mental plumber Gross explained the simple-sounding success recipe, which had no effect under therapist Babbel.
He has ignited some magic, Babbel advocate Jens Lehmann admitted, "when a new impulse comes in football, sometimes things happen that you didn't think possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, thanks to his dynamism, became the best player on the pitch after weeks of injury, tried to describe the observed "phenomenon" with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the workings of the new supervisor: "He is a man who acts through and demands discipline.
That's what we need in the current situation."
Under Babbel, it was obviously lacking.
VfB Stuttgart has not yet crossed the mountain, sports director Horst Heldt warns
But the VfB Stuttgart needs consistency above all else.
Like Gross, players and managers were also careful not to overestimate the victory against a substitute-weakened and completely overwhelmed defense of the Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen came the evil awakening at 0:4, Khedira pointed out.
And sports director Horst Heldt warned that although one season goal was achieved, the other was still a long way off.
We're not over the mountain yet.
The fact that Heldt was not happy to celebrate his 40th birthday even after his first home win in three months was due to the events of the weekend, which were freshly revived in the form of a TV interview by goalkeeper Jens Lehmann broadcast immediately before the start of the game.
There are decisions that others make and not the Jens, Heldt countered Lehmann’s harsh criticism.
He had accused the board of leadership weakness and decided to change coaches under pressure from puberty fans.
Also that his free day had been cancelled after games, Lehmann considered as a sign of lack of sovereignty and envy.
Lehmann's statements were "characterized by pure egoism," Heldt wagged back and announced consequences for the final man.
You will no longer be friends for life, the two forty-year-olds.
After all, however, they agreed with everyone else that without the preliminary work by the detached coaching team, the playful and combatively strong idea would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "a big part of the success," said Heldt and Lehmann in unison - and also the man with the plastic bag agreed.
World Cup fight in heavyweight
Heated duel in Bern: repeatedly provoked challenger Kevin Johnson world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve hard laps, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title according to the version of the WBC.
The judge’s verdict was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains heavyweight boxing world champion.
The 38-year-old champion, according to the WBC, defeated American Kevin Johnson on Saturday night in Berne unanimously by points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko, it was the third successful title defense after his comeback in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian has been twice world champion of the associations WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately, the K.O., which everyone expected, did not work out.
Klitschko expanded his record to 39 wins in 41 professional fights, twice having to give up due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to accept the first defeat in the 24th battle.
In front of around 17,000 spectators in the Berner Arena, Klitschko, who is 2.02 metres tall, wanted to dictate the fight with his left hand.
The eleven centimeters smaller Johnson, who had announced the end of the Klitschko era before the duel, but again and again escaped the World Champion's blows, so that Klitschko could not bring his dangerous rights decisively to the finish.
Overall, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger and only tried to get over the laps.
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his punches hit the world champion rarely.
After all, he is only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who went over the full distance of twelve laps with Klitschko.
The challenger had caused some turmoil in the Swiss capital before the fight.
He insulted Klitschko as an "ugly zombie" who "can't do anything right".
In weighing, the champion was then provoked on Friday to push Johnson's sunglasses off his nose "to see his eyes."
Fourth victory after Klitschko's comeback
Klitschko also remained victorious in his fourth fight after his comeback on 11 October 2008.
After almost four years off, he had beaten the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and retrieved his "WBC" belt, which he had previously had to give up without a fight.
This year he defeated Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and Chris Arreola from the United States in September.
I only got one punch in this fight and am in very good physical shape, Klitschko had justified the quick return to the ring.
However, his dream remains the union of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is the world champion of the associations WBO and IBF.
The belt of the WBA, however, is worn by the British David Haye, after he was able to dethrone the 2.13 meter Nikolai Waluyev in November.
Haye had previously cancelled a September fight against Vitali Klitschko.
It is said that his promotional company is already planning a fight against Klitschko at London's Wembley Stadium.
Kunduz
Frontal attack from the opposition: Greens group leader Jürgen Trittin has called Defense Minister Guttenberg a liar for false information on the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and the left demand clarification from the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest findings on the airstrike of Kunduz, the opposition Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) has assumed a deliberate deception.
The minister said "knowingly the untruth" about the deadly bombing of two tanker trucks in September, Greens group leader Jürgen Trittin said on Saturday in the ARD news broadcast "Tagesschau".
It's commonly called: He lied.
The order to kill was issued in disregard for the rules of the International Security Force for Afghanistan (ISAF).
That is the substance of the report that NATO had read by Mr Guttenberg, Trittin said.
On Friday, it became known that the attack was not only about the destruction of the hijacked trucks, but also about the purpose of killing two Taliban leaders.
In the US air strike requested by German Kunduz commander Colonel Klein, up to 142 people were killed or injured, according to the NATO investigation report.
On Saturday, the Greens, the SPD and the Left urged Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak out immediately before the Bundestag and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Merkel has to clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing is part of the German government’s Afghanistan policy – and whether the Chancellery, the Bundeswehr and the intelligence service have endorsed this new strategy, demanded Jürgen Trittin and Green colleague Renate Künast.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm decisively rejected the criticism.
The Chancellery did not have any influence on concrete operations of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, doubts had also been raised about the ministry’s presentation of the background to the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to information from the SPIEGEL, the two Guttenberg have correctly and completely informed about the background of the tanker attack.
Officially, they had denied the existence of NATO reports and denied sensitive details to the minister.
However, the two senior officials reported that they had even pointed to several reports by the Department of Defense, including a two-page document by commander-in-chief Colonel Klein and a field-hunter report.
Wichert is said to have asked for clarification of the facts in a letter, reports the "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung".
He has not yet received an answer, he said.
The ministry did not comment on the allegations on Saturday and pointed out that this will be clarified in the Bundestag’s investigative committee, which wants to constitute itself next Wednesday.
Dream worlds
Some see images in the awake state and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only in the case of mentally ill and in the drug rush, the boundaries between imagination and reality blur.
As long as it happens in sleep, everything is fine.
When we lie in our dark rooms with our eyes closed, we are allowed to surrender uninhibited to the wildest imaginations and imaginations.
However, those who experience traumatic states while they are awake, see and hear things that others do not see or hear, are usually considered crazy or drug addicts in the modern Western world, at least as strangers.
But such images and voices do not only arise in the case of mentally ill or in the drug rush.
Our imagination is to blame: the same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels sometimes blur the boundaries between dream, delusions and reality.
Dreamlikely altered waking consciousness states can occur in a wide variety of forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case delusions.
Although triggers and effects may differ, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, shamanic rapture states, psychoses and hallucinations can still be attributed to similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions occur when the balance of the brain's neural messengers - primarily dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and acetylcholine - derails and the interaction of different brain parts is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts occur very often during schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity has no more power over him.
The connection of delusions and dreams has occupied philosophers and physicians since ancient times.
Aristotle conceived hallucinations as a form of dream in the awake state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, found in 1861 a "great resemblance of madness to dream states", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis, with all the inconsistencies, delusions, sensory delusions of such".
It is autumn 2001 when Henning T. turns into a comic character.
His body is two-dimensional and squeaky.
Gravity no longer has any power over him, he's floating on the ceiling.
He feels a kick.
Behind him winged devil figures with blood-red, distorted faces, clapping teeth.
They chase him, kick him with heavy, flaming boots, throw him against the walls, he feels the pain all over the body.
Loud, vicious voices roar from walls and radio.
He can no longer bear them, the voices that insult and insult him.
Henning T. pulls two cables out of the stereo system, knots them into a loop and attaches them to a hook on the ceiling.
He climbs onto a loudspeaker and puts the loop around his neck.
- Jump.
The sling loosens.
This is supposed to be a lesson for you, the voices shout in a drumming choir, "Go to the clinic and let yourself be healed!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychoses, the last two years ago, the first nearly 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoaffective-paranoid psychosis, he is also manic-depressive, he takes medication, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
In psychosis, I have experienced worst fear and deepest despair, he says.
Mysteries are cruel reality
About one percent of the population suffers from schizophrenia at least once in their lives, and in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most common disease after depression.
In acute schizophrenic psychosis, people can no longer distinguish between the inner and the outer world, they fall into an overexcited state that can lead to hallucinations, size, relationship or persecution.
Particularly common is hearing voices - voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also not uncommon.
The affected person is no longer able to separate the important from the unimportant, the brain is no longer able to filter out disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded by impressions.
Like the dream, psychosis also opens the doors to a flood of ideas and fantasies that originate from deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is subject-centered, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, senior physician at the Department of General Psychiatry at Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenic is at the center of the action, everything has a meaning directed at him.
At the same time, he gets into a passive role, he is, like in a dream, overwhelmed by the events and cannot actively shape them.
Schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A comparison of reality is usually not possible for them, the delusions are cruel reality, waking up excluded.
Having had a hallucination once in life
Unlike in the dream, Fuchs says, "but the sensory and spatial structure of reality, which is perceived in psychosis, remains fundamentally preserved."
The delusional thoughts and hallucinations are based in reality, the alienation of the experience takes place in the real framework.
Exactly why our brains are struggling is still a mystery for researchers.
Exceptional states can cause any person to lose the reference to reality for a short time, says Fuchs.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that the genes are not the sole determining factors.
Researchers estimate that there are minimal brain damage in those affected.
We suspect that neural maturation of the brain is disrupted at an early stage of development, due to a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, for example, explains Fuchs.
But it remains a mystery how the disruption of the neural system occurs, which at first does not manifest itself at all for many years.
Environmental influences also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be triggers for psychosis if the disposition is present.
Also, hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis as they interfere with the transmitter system.
When our brain runs hot
The crazy thing is, psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive drugs to get rid of them, others spend money on drugs to get them, says Lübeck psychology professor Erich Kasten.
Whether misconceptions are perceived as pleasant or unpleasant is often just a matter of point of view.
Kasten has been collecting reports of hallucinations and misfortunes for ten years, and last year he evaluated his findings in the book "The irreal world in our heads".
Hallucinations are among the typical side effects of psychosis, but also of astonishingly many other diseases.
In addition to mental disorders such as borderline or depression, these often include diseases such as migraines, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer’s and cranial brain trauma.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions, even the brain of healthy people hallucinates.
Hallucinations, according to Box, are composed of memory contents that are usually held back.
They arise when brain areas in which sensory perceptions are processed are overactive or insufficiently inhibited; when our brain is hot or also when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this condition just as much as brain damage or psychosis.
But also stimulus withdrawal, stress, love distress or other mental exceptional states.
In recent studies, up to a third of respondents reported having had a hallucination at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005 Sarah K. is 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and attends high school there.
A normal girl, actually.
If it weren’t for pictures and voices.
During the break, it may happen that a sloppy boy with long, dark hair appeals to it.
When it responds to him, the classmates look at it with surprise - no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think of the shy girl as a spun daydreamer, but Sarah K. doesn't dream, she knows that.
She is awake, she hears and sees this boy, just as she hears and sees the girl in the bench next to her.
She can even feel his presence, at least for a moment.
A pleasant feeling is that she likes the boy.
Am I crazy? she sometimes wonders.
But she knows that this boy and the other delusions are not real and disappear again.
At night, the appearances are usually frightening
Often the misconceptions are also a burden.
When she sits in the classroom, she sometimes cannot follow the teaching material because the teacher in her eyes and ears is just introducing a new classmate, while he explains mathematical equations to everyone else, both audible and visible on the board.
At night, the appearances are usually frightening.
When she waits in her dark room for sleep, which is far too rare and far too late, she can often not distinguish whether she is awake or already dreaming, whether the pictures she sees, the scraps or the girl with the bleeding cut wounds on her arms and legs, arise in front of her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, she screams at the figures.
Parents and friends don't tell her about it, they'd think she was crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She graduated from high school last year and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Since she made contact with the psychologist Box on the Internet, she knows exactly that she is not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art from despair
If someone is socially isolated or suffers from stimulus withdrawal, they are most likely to have hallucinations after a while, Kasten says.
I suspect that the brain is then underemployed and takes care of its own entertainment.
Sarah K., a single child, was afraid of other children as a little girl, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at age 13 that the man she has been calling Dad since she can think is not her biological father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations have the same brain regions that process real impressions and sounds, it is difficult for people like Sarah K. to distinguish between fantasies and reality.
Hallucinations are also images that the brain creates, which is why they seem so real.”
Even night dream images value box as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, mentally healthy people are able to recognize their misconceptions as irreal.
Kasten therefore advises his patients to appreciate the hallucinations as a special ability.
The boundary between dream and hallucination
In our too much-conscious world, imaginary experience is unfortunately mostly pathologized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and chief physician of the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy of the Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful illness, but it also carries positive, creative – madness is also a work of art out of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has explored the so-called oniroid form of experience, a special form of traumatically altered waking consciousness.
Oneiroids are highly complex, detailed quasi-dreams, which the experiencer considers real and which he cannot distinguish from the waking state even afterwards.
The oniroid state of consciousness arises in extreme trauma or disease-related situations, for example in polyradiculitis patients who experience motor paralysis when fully conscious.
When a person is threatened with loss of self and the world, for example by sustained, complete inability to move, he replaces the life-threatening real situation with his own, imaginary world, which is decoupled from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
A kind of boundary state between dream and hallucination.
Since coping with a situation in reality is not possible, a world change takes place, but the real situation is present in the imagination.
An intensive form of meaning creation and meaning in an intrinsically unbearable situation that allows us humans our own ability to design, not to sink into a nothingness of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
The Zurich art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his oniroid experiences in his book "Changing Hearts" as a rescue of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness travels for days after a heart valve operation followed by a heart transplant, while his body is sentenced to immobility in the intensive care unit.
Claussen immerses himself in a self-created world, visits strange times and places: he experiences himself as a bedridden, old man, on board a train sanatorium, a robot guards his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages among nobles who make intoxicants from blood.
When a Greek rides a motorcycle to his home country, he surfs with his hospital bed in the firn snow of the Alps and meets a Korean mafioso.
It is completely absorbed in the imagined event, everything is real, even later in memory.
For Claussen, these inner journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
Dream is another state, he describes his experience.
In contrast, the memories from mental travels are clear to me after years and in minor details.
Clearer and more intense even than really experienced.
The intensity of this experience blows the horizon of our other life-worldly experiences, says the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
In the end, oniroids, psychoses, hallucinations and drug addiction show how fragile our inner images of external reality are also in the wake.
Any change in the state of consciousness, the psychologist sums up box, "can lead to a deformation of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be enriching.
The snow can come
Burda
Children should take over the publishing house at the age of 27
The new publishing director Kallen is an intermediate solution: in the long run, Hubert Burda wants to give his company into the hands of his two children, he told Spiegel.
The holding company will continue to belong to 100% of the family in the future.
Hamburg - Publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the long term.
Both children inherit at the age of 27 and have the firm will to join the company, the 69-year-old told Spiegel.
We have regulated the details as a precautionary measure.
The question of whether they are also active in the company only arises afterwards.
Also the question of whether they are able to do so.
You can't put your children in front of 7500 employees if they aren't sufficiently skilled.
This kills the children and the company too.
Burda announced on Thursday that he will retire from the board chairmanship in January, and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
The 52-year-old Kallen has been a board member at Burda since 1999.
Initially, he was responsible for technology.
Later, the Treasury department was responsible for the company’s assets and, after Jürgen Todenhöfer left, for direct marketing, abroad, printing and finance.
For the first time, no family member is at the top of the publishing house.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who was 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
The designation of Kallen also serves to "bridge 10, 15 years," according to Burda.
The holding company will continue to belong to 100 percent of the family in the future, Burda said.
With regard to the cases of Schickedanz and Schaeffler, Burda commented that even family businesses are not safe from the fall: "This always concerned families who were infected by a capital addiction, who have completely speculated and thought that they could thus become a very big player.
My strategy was never that.
"He never had world power dreams," Burda said.
I don't see myself as the political preceptor of this country, as it was Springer, and I don't want to play in the World League with 'Time' either, these stores have become too big.
Perfect Beauty
Everything you want in terms of beauty and well-being is now at your disposal.
At least that is what El Corte Inglés has set out to do, which recently opened a store with an area of more than 1000 m2 in the shopping center in Callao (Madrid), where everything is all about personal care.
In the wellness area, which is located on the eighth floor, you will find among other prestigious companies such as Hedonai, which provide hair removal with laser; Spaxión, with rooms for relaxation and beauty treatments; the hairdressers Luis & Tachi, Marina d'Or with a gym or L'Occitane with their natural cosmetics.
But there is also a food department, which stands out by its tea house with more than 130 different teas.
Enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner while enjoying a fantastic view of the capital, or rent the relaxation area for two hours to set up your own "beauty party" with eight girlfriends and then relax in the hot tub or with massages and a glass of champagne, these are just some of the many options that Spaxión offers.
The total area is 250 m2, which is divided into 12 rooms for the latest facial and body treatments as well as for hydrotherapy.
For example, for cavitation in the fight against cellulite or with vibrating surfaces.
The gym also has this type of equipment, and there are also virtual trainers who take care of the training sessions of the customers, providing them with a completely personalized training.
One starts a training session by entering a personal password on a touchscreen located opposite the devices.
After that, various videos will show you how to perform your training sessions correctly.
The head of the gym assures that 15 minutes (including warming up and stretching exercises) are sufficient to train the body muscles.
And if you want to stop by the hairdressing salon after exercising your body, the Luis & Tachi company has a room where treatments to regain the beauty, shine and health of your hair are offered in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to be the key words for this wellness area in the middle of the city, which is always open from 10.00 a.m. to 22.00 p.m. 365 days a year.
The most diverse décolletés
Christmas is getting closer and closer, so it’s another great opportunity to copy the look of the stars and bring their wedding dresses into our wardrobe.
The shape of the décolleté, which is very important to highlight the silhouette, is one of the points that must be considered.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie has chosen an exaggerated and very complicated décolleté.
Endesa and Barcelona by electric car
The electricity company Endesa, together with the city of Barcelona, has created the "LIVE office".
This is a project for the development and promotion of the electric car in the Catalan capital.
The "LIVE Office" (Logistics for the introduction of the electric car) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the introduction of the electric car in the city and make agreements on mobility through management, coordination, subsidization, etc.
On the other hand, the MOVELE project is being developed to promote the electric car and to summarize opinions and measures of the areas involved.
This is an attempt to advance the means of transport of the future.
3 "Electric Cities"
However, Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville are also participating in this project.
These are the three cities selected by the government in the MOVELE project to accelerate the introduction of the electric car.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Government of Catalonia (la Generalitat).
This framework agreement aims to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These activities are, among other things, activities related to energy and, in particular, to its performance.
However, it is by no means the only initiative in which Endesa participates with regard to the promotion of the electric car.
The company participates in standardization groups across Europe and maintains a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees "a horizon of calm" for the automotive sector
The president of the government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, prophesies of the Spanish automotive industry, which is the country's largest exporter, "a horizon of tranquillity".
In presenting the economic report for 2009 by the President of the Government, Zapatero recalled the measures the government has taken to support the automotive sector during the government year.
“Without the Automotive Competitiveness Plan, today we would have a panorama of neglect and closure of some of our main production plants,” he said.
“Thanks to this plan and the willingness of car manufacturers to continue to produce in Spain in a very competitive industry, we can see a calm horizon for the future of this industry, which is our largest export industry,” he added.
He also recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, which is part of the overall plan for the automotive industry (PIA), has allocated <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>800 million to projects from 19 vehicle manufacturers and 137 suppliers, which in turn generated investments of more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3 billion.
The head of government stated that these investments are intended both for the development of new models and for the modernization of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also underlined the government’s efforts to boost demand, citing Plan 2000E, which is being implemented in cooperation with the Autonomous Communities and car manufacturers.
According to the head of government, this plan allows to reduce emissions from new vehicles sold on the Spanish market by an average of 6%, which in turn led to a "strong increase" in approvals, which increased "by 40%" in November.
On 20,000 square meters of classic vehicles

Mazda3 i-Stop: Eco-friendly sportiness
Mazda wants to prove that sporting is perfectly compatible with protecting the environment.
For this reason, Mazda recently introduced the engine’s automatic stop-and-start system, called i-Stop, on the Mazda3 model, a device that is currently only available for the 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
This second generation of the Mazdas 3 stands out for its good notes in the overall picture.
The finish, the design of the vehicle, the comfort, its road behaviour, the mechanics, the i-Stop system ...
All of these aspects are "very good" on the new Mazda3.
Starting with the front seats, you can notice that the front seats offer excellent ergonomics and good grip.
Furthermore, the game of the steering wheel is excellent.
Looking further at the unit, which consists of the dashboard and dashboard, one can see that Mazda is on the same track as the Japanese trend towards a futuristic interior design, with a variety of buttons and switches in the eye-catching colors red and blue.
This style reminds us partly of the style of the Honda Civic.
Therefore, it can be easily said that both the Mazda 3 and the Civic, both Japanese models, stand out from the sobriety of the German automobiles, especially the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to surpass.
The passenger compartment of these two Japanese compact cars offers more than ever the appropriate comfort, so that four adults can drive comfortably.
To all this comes a large and clearly shaped trunk.
Until now, the stop and start system is only available for the 2-litre gasoline engine with 150 hp and a 6-speed gearbox.
This motor is a real pleasure. It stands out for its fineness, its quiet noise, its power and its low consumption.
And all those who don’t drive many kilometers a year should consider this i-Stop with gasoline engine because of its great comfort in gearshift and low consumption, even though at Mazda the diesel models are the best-selling.
In terms of equipment, the so-called Sportive model chosen for the test drive is a special feature, as it has a significantly larger number of elements from the standard equipment.
From the series equipment stands out above all the assistant for the lane change (RVM), which thus eliminates the dead angle, but also the controls for traction and stability, the speed control, the light-sensitive interior mirror, the on-board computer with a large screen, the sensors for parking, an independent air conditioning, rain and light sensors, Bluetooth and audio Bluetooth as well as the
In addition, this version also includes, as if that were not enough in terms of equipment, the Premium package, which contains the following for an additional 1,500 euros: among other elements, above all the learnable bixenon headlights and the sound system BOSE with CD charger.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is particularly outstanding in terms of the materials used, its handling and the variety of equipment.
In addition, those who do not travel many kilometers a year can also buy the i-Stop version, which is only available with a 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
The only negative thing about this model is its somewhat high price, which is between 21,770 euros for the model Luxury and 23,270 euros for the trial-driven model Sportive.
However, in return for this high price, the Mazda3 offers us the highest driving pleasure every day.
A premiere with a lot of glamour
L.A. rolls out the red rug of sensuality for Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
At the premiere of "Nine", the stars, dressed in models that look as elegant as sexy, shined more than ever.
Our "Pe", as elegant as ever, opted for a dark "Lady" dress.
The Promises of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device that can only be used to read your emails without the ability to view certain attachments or browse the Internet.
It enjoyed its five minutes of fame when it was voted one of the products of the year by Time magazine.
To see it on the street is rather unlikely, but the idea in itself is still of interest especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek costs very little and has a very cheap flat rate, for example, only half the price of an iPhone’s flat rate.
After seeing the success with it, the company has launched two new devices: one intended only for Twitter, the other with a lifelong free data service, quite unlike the peek, where you have to pay a six-fold higher price.
Fonpeek, which was presented yesterday at the event Le Web, is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same limits as its American counterpart, but has a surprise ready.
The monthly maintenance price for the phone, about 12 euros a month, includes roaming for all of Europe.
Those who travel around the world with a smartphone already know what it means to do without all the data to be able to read their emails once you have crossed the national border or if you are desperately looking for a café with WIFI (or a way to connect with Fon).
The idea of roaming with flat rate is incredibly seductive and should actually be possible for a long time.
It is true that some phone providers already offer special contracts and prices for stays abroad, but in my experience you already need a doctorate in physics and good glasses to be able to read all the small print.
The European Commission’s repeated criticism of affordable roaming tariffs across Europe has almost always gone unnoticed.
Outside of your own country, you are always afraid to read your emails, and rightly so.
The fact that a small device like FonPeek (although it’s always amazing that it has the name Fon, although it doesn’t have Wi-Fi/Wi-Fi) can offer these types of rates means that phone providers have to slowly but surely rethink and start considering different ways to deploy their data network.
Kindle is another good example of this, its prices include downloading books and other requests on the Internet.
Without contract and without hooks.
This is an internet-enabled device and you only pay for it once, namely when you buy, and not month after month.
And that’s exactly what I expect from FonPeek one day, a purchase option with lifelong internet access as Peek already offers in the USA.
Not because I want to buy it.
I read my emails on the phone, thank you.
But I expect this because I think it would be a more appropriate model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
Michelle's Fetish Color
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the American first lady.
Already when Barack Obama took office as President of the United States, she appeared in a dress and a coat of this color and has chosen the same color again to accompany him at his, without a doubt, second most important moment in his life: the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama wore very similar models on both occasions: except that it was almost the same color - a shiny green-yellow -, the clothes consisted of three parts - dress, jacket and coat of the same fabric - and she wore some large embroidered or a necklace.
At first glance, it even seemed that the First Lady of the United States wanted to follow the example of the Princess of Asturias and decided to wear the same dress on more than one occasion.
However, the two dresses differ greatly in the type of fabric from which they are made.
At the inauguration, she wore a lace dress and in Oslo a patterned velvet.
The accessories were also different: green shoes with half-high heels for the first time and a similar model for the second time, but golden.
The hairstyle was also different every time: the hair was put up as a hair wreath on this occasion, the previous she wore the hair open.
75% of working mothers have problems at work because of their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially among younger women who want to have children.
This is the conclusion of the study "Fertility and career of women in Spain" carried out by CSIC in collaboration with the Institute for Women.
The survey of 9,737 women between the ages of 15 and 75 leaves no doubt: 75% of working women see their career opportunities in the labour market limited because of their maternity.
The study reveals that there are major differences in the decision to start a family and the number of children, depending on whether the women work or not and, if so, what kind of profession they practice.
Those of them who do not do any other work outside the house, work only half-day or do not have a fixed employment contract are more likely to become mothers and have more children.
In contrast, women with a permanent job, especially in the public sector, move the establishment of a family and motherhood and therefore have fewer children.
"The women in the age group between 35 and 49 years with a permanent employment get their first child on average only 3.7 years after moving together, a number that increases to 4.1 years for women with a permanent employment who have taken longer to achieve this and who have moved together and the first child realized much later.
Moreover, the type of work also has a major impact on maternity, albeit less than the calendar in terms of willingness to conceive," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that needs to be taken into account in the age of the women at the time of marriage and the first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of education, the higher the age at the time of marriage and the first child.
This difference was also found in women of the same age.
For example, the women in the group between the ages of 35 and 49, depending on whether they have only high school or higher education, were on average mothers for the first time with 25.1 or 32.1 each.
Furthermore, depending on their level of education, there is another difference between women.
While the women with a major degree get married before their first permanent job and have their first child, the women with a middle or high school graduation do the other way around and first look for a permanent job and then marry and then have their first child, notes Delgado.
Diane Kruger is well worth it.
L'Oréal Paris recently added a new name to its ever-envying list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will be the image of various products of the brand and also say the well-known slogan "Because you are worth it".
The main actress of "Joyeux No<0xC3><0xAB>l", one of the most elegant actresses on the international level, will become another famous figurehead as before her Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last to join this exclusive club were the actresses Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Freida Pinto ("Slumdog Millonaire").
Among the men, the cosmetics company also has only exceptional ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ("Grey's Anatomy") and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's acting colleague in "Lost").
The British Fashion Industry Awards Ceremony
The British have an important word to say in the fashion world.
Their highest representatives – fashion designers and models, both yesterday and today – met at the annual awards ceremony held in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
They had all appeared on that occasion.
Ex-model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was voted the best model this year.
The Poker Game by Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent presents in "Poker of Aces" (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) to the thirty x-ray images of writers who accompanied him in his literary life (and, in some cases, also in real life).
He does not use a predictable and fear-inspiring genre (short biography, life and work), but rather seeks a similarity to the glowing heart of the Creator.
The journey is exciting and Vicent saves neither horror nor enlightenment.
Besides that this book is a delicious reading pleasure, it is also a moving invitation to read and read over and over again.
Here are some excerpts from the book.
Albert Camus: “When I read his pages, I found that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but rather a spiritual, almost sensual impulse, just as I have always felt it, without finding words for it: joy in contrast to ominous fate, morality without guilt, and innocence without any god.”
"Nihilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote about what he had in the blood, not in his mind, between impotence and ignorance, with a stunning poetic humor, without any sense, like the knife blade that almost killed him."
About Graham Greene: "Our man was enchanted by this woman with a passion that lasted for thirteen years, in whose flesh the emotions of adultery merged with the pleasure of repentance, a spiritual privilege that consisted in coming to heaven by the way of destruction."
About James Joyce: "The Odysseus" was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the 8000 peaks in the world's literature, you have to climb on the north face, on the wall where the best climbers try again and again.
William Faulkner: "He was a weird guy.
He sometimes said about himself that he was the heir of a landowner of the county and other times he said that he was the son of a black and a crocodile.
Both dreams testified to a certain size."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: This writer captured the insane cry shouted from a bridge from that personality from Munich, so that his echo would echo in his literary way until deep into the night of the 20th century, on a journey on which he fled from himself and invoked posterity with a speech full of violence from the worms.
Dorothy Parker: "One day she knelt down and prayed, 'My dear God, I beg you to do everything in your power so that I finally stop writing like a woman.'"
On Joseph Conrad: "On his grave are engraved these verses of Spencer: 'the sleep after the effort,/ after the thunderstorm of the harbor,/ the rest after the war,/ after a rich life one finds pleasure in death."
Virginia Wolf: "She always had her depression in her luggage.
The husband accepted it with complete normality when she told him that Edward VII was spying on her between the azaleas or that the birds were singing in Greek.
There is not a single other case known where the man was so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent was even greater than her madness.
About Pío Baroja: "What did Martín-Santos do other than try to instil Joyce in Baroja?
What was the intention of Benet if he did not bring Baroja near to the weapons of Faulkner?
What did Cela do, besides destroying the fame of that man, so that he could stand himself on this platform?"
Feig aggression
My 70-year-old mother was walking through our neighborhood in the village of Fuenlabrada last week when suddenly a group of young people between 15 and 18 years of age ran alongside her and our dog, our dog is a mixed dog that we got from the shelter and weighs just six kilos, and then out of the blue they missed him two footsteps and severely injured him.
Our indignation cannot be expressed in words, because it is incomprehensible to us, where the fun should be in a cheap aggression against a small and helpless animal, which of course was carried out on a leash.
Add to this the suffocation that a woman who walked comfortably got when she tried to correct these people because of the incident, she even feared for her own life, because if such a madman attacks a dog, he may do the same with a woman, a child, an older gentleman, or probably even with anyone weaker than himself.
The incident occurred in a normally quiet neighborhood at five o’clock in the afternoon on an ordinary Tuesday.
The dog wept all day long.
Of course, we have filed a complaint in a nearby police station, but we have great doubts as to whether that will do anything at all, and in order to prevent any prejudice from the start, we just want to clarify that the cowardly criminals were Spanish.
Our indignation at what has happened has led us to report this incident.
We cannot understand what must be going on in the minds of these young people, that they find a cheap attack on a helpless animal funny, on an animal that gives us love, companionship and friendship.
We do not know where the good education and respect for animals and persons have remained.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helmet
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in cooperation with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote helmet use, especially among younger motorcyclists, as both companies announced today.
This initiative aims to draw attention to the importance of helmet use, as it is ultimately the only protective element that can prevent head injuries or even death in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of its commitment to road safety, which "encompasses far more than just designing and manufacturing products that become more and more safe every day" and further affirmed that they also contribute with other actions of educational and informative character to get one step closer to this goal every day.
This new campaign to promote the use of helmets on motorcycles, under the slogan 'To be or not to be', will in a first phase distribute posters to over 500 motorcycle workshops in order to achieve the best possible distribution.
In conclusion, Michelin stressed that road safety is "a constant concern" of the company, and precisely for the reason that, as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles, they are always committed to one of their main objectives must be the development of ever safer products.
Sales of small trucks are rising again
After almost two years, the car market for vans finally begins to see some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles registered in Spain in November represent a 12.6% increase compared to 2008 and, more importantly, the first ever increase after 22 consecutive months with a steady decline, according to the figures presented by the Anfac Manufacturers Association and the Ganvam Car Dealer Association.
However, these good figures are to be enjoyed with great caution at the moment, as the reference data used for comparison are November 2008, which was a particularly bad sales year with a drop of 60% compared to the previous year.
However, it must be borne in mind that, apart from the increase in the last month, the total registrations of these 11 months are still 40% below the sales figures of the previous financial year.
Since January, a total of 95,853 vehicles have been sold, but this number includes all vehicles that make up the van market: descendant of passenger cars, pick-ups, vans, small vans and lighter small trucks / chassis.
Furthermore, the same thunderstorm clouds in the sky continue to affect demand the most, because even if some of the vehicles are purchased by private individuals, the majority of the sales go to small and medium-sized enterprises, which in almost 100% of the cases make the purchase with third-party financing.
For example, these restrictions, which are the result of the tightening of the money taps of the credit institutions, have to include other factors, such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the poor economic situation.
In this panorama, and unlike passenger cars, the financial support provided for the purchase of a 2000E Plan car has helped little.
However, this plan is not only for private individuals, even self-employed and small businesses have a right to buy a van up to 3.5 tons with a CO2 emission that cannot exceed 160 grams per kilometre driven, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Just yesterday, Ganvam again reminded that it is absolutely necessary on the part of the state to pay special attention to these small trucks as well as, of course, to the industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The car dealership association predicts a similar year for 2010 as the previous one, for which it expects a sales loss (for passenger cars and off-road vehicles) of 19%.
Assistance in braking in critical situations is now mandatory
As was the case with the ABS anti-lock braking system and as is now the case with the ESP stability control system, the assistive braking systems for emergencies must become a mandatory equipment in European cars.
In fact, they are already mandatory for all newly registered passenger cars and light vans, for the remaining vehicles a deadline was set until the end of February 2011.
The measure adopted by the European Union aims to improve the protection of pedestrians, but these braking systems can also help to prevent many collisions due to their operation.
The task of the emergency braking assistant is to exert more pressure on the brakes in the event of a critical braking maneuver, which detects the system on the brake pedal based on the braking strength implemented by the driver.
However, this system does not exert this pressure until the end.
According to an investigation commissioned by the component manufacturer for the Bosch vehicles, one-third of the drivers involved in an accident did not even step on the brake pedal before the collision and half of them had not braked at full power.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The braking aid, on the other hand, acts with maximum force into the braking system and thereby reduces the braking time and thus also the braking distance that a car covers during the braking process.
According to an EU study, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be prevented each year if all cars were equipped with this type of emergency braking assistance.
There would be even fewer accidents - one in four accidents could be prevented with personal injury - as soon as the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems become popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that detects obstacles (via radar or a camera) and warns the driver, while at the same time exerting a slight pressure on the brakes.
When the driver responds, the system helps to increase the pressure on the brake pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not respond to the warning and even if the collision is already inevitable, the brake assistant applies maximum pressure to the brakes in order to keep the damage as low as possible.
General Motors postpones plan for Opel until January
While the staff at the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) were already informed by Nick Reilly, the new chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, that production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April, probably on the 8th, according to Javier Ortega, the American vehicle manufacturer points out that it takes more time to complete the rescue plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new chairman of GM Europe, wants to ensure that the affected side gives its consent to every single point of the plan in advance.
And for this reason, it may be that the final document, which will be presented first to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where there are works, will be postponed until early 2010.
On the other hand, GM is assured that it will make a decision in the next few days regarding the sale of Saab.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the American car manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in touch with some potential new buyers.
One of these buyers might be Geely, who would also like to buy Volvo, but the option of the Dutch manufacturer of the Skyper sports cars, which is backed by the Russian group Converg, is becoming increasingly popular.
If none of these buyers come to an agreement, GM could sell some assets to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to close Saab by the end of the year, if it has not been sold by then, will continue.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their newest and very expensive jewel, the engineers used the Boxster S as a basis and really managed to make it 80 kilos lighter, which now only weighs 1,275 kilos.
In order to create this, they first dispensed with the automatic fold-up roof, which was replaced by a tent canopy with manual drive, so that only 21 kilos have been saved; thanks to the aluminum doors used in this model such as the GT3 "disappear" another 15; by the removal of the air conditioner again 13; also 12 have been spared with a small fuel tank of 64 to 54 liters.
Then again six kilos less had been achieved by renouncing the audio system CDR-30 and by replacing the door handles with handles made of fabric.
Although it is also available with the double clutch transmission PDK, the test drive was carried out with a vehicle with a 6-speed manual transmission, mainly on the smaller land roads of California, on mountain routes that were really very curvy.
With his driving behavior, you can only give him the note flawlessly.
Reducing his weight, however, did not mean that he would no longer lie safely on the road.
It is quite the opposite: for a long time we have not tried such a small and lightweight model, but at the same time also gives you a feeling of great security in the corners, even at high speeds.
He is a small athlete, able to warm his muscles at a low gear in the required time until we give him the orders to race, brake, recover and then get everything out of his engine again ...
The car does everything we tell it to do with our hands on the steering wheel, thanks to its steering, which is as communicative as it is precise.
And he does it with the precision of a surgeon.
A motor sound for all tastes
The sound of his V6 Boxer with 320 hp (10 more than the Boxster S) is extremely successful and you can increase it with the 'sport' option as well as by means of a system that can change the engine noise, which was already used for the first time in the Panamera.
The acceleration capability is unimaginably brutal, whether from standing up or when accelerating again.
The suspensions are strong but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the land roads on which we drove the Boxster Spyder was already quite damaged, but the car mastered the potholes well.
The electronic assistants had almost nothing to do all over the track; and that, although we found ice in the dawn and roll shard in the morning on some of those curves.
In summary, it is an ultra-light car, a car with which you have an indescribable driving pleasure, as it is usually rare and there is much more in it than just a small improvement of the Boxster Ss.
The car will be on the market in February 2010 and will cost 70,831 EURO.
Bag Girl'
The singer, a bosom friend of Karl Lagerfeld, is the face of the cosmetics line Coco Cocoon and a casual starlet at the fashion shows of 'maison', she presents her evil face with the same neck stiffness as her bags from Chanel.
Much more than "Bad Girl" or "It Girl", she is a "Bag Girl".
The Bascony gives itself a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral, despite the many fancy players in the team of Dusko Ivanovic, celebrated an excellent triumph with 82-91 on his visit to the complicated football field of the Maccabi Electra, thus taking first place within his group after the great appearance of Mirza Teletovic, who was the best of his team with eight triples (29 in the rating).
The Vitoria team was able to replace the significant failures of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a large dose of effort and teamwork, even if they had to wait until the bitter end for their victory.
The great hits from the perimeter with 16 rated triples contributed to their final victory.
The game started with the lead of the blue-reds, who sat at the top of the billboard from the beginning.
Since the first four baskets of the team from Vitoria already came out of the perimeter, one could already guess that they had come to the field with well-heated wrists.
It was English and Teletovic who were mainly responsible for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was hardly different, except that the team from <0xC3><0x81>lava opted for an inside game of Barac and for the game of Eliyahu, who was received on his return to the team with whistles and applause, which is his home, to further extend their advantage until the break (34-43).
Teletovic already began to stand out as the best of his team with 13 points, even if the "minus six" score of Splitter was already guessing that this would not be the best evening of the Brazilian.
Nevertheless, despite the clear advantage in the break, the game was far from decided and the Maccabees wanted to remind the Vitorians once again that not everyone wins on their field, and thanks to the constantly attacking "hand of Elías" they came back into the game.
Eidson and Pnini made a decisive contribution to the "yellows" turning the helm (50-49).
Even More Disadvantages
The team of Ivanovic, injured, but anything but dead, had to prepare a few moves with accuracy to regain breath and at one of them suddenly came the pistol of Mirza Teletovic, who, with three almost consecutive triples and with the support of English and Ribas, ensured that the scoreboard could again soothe a nice distance of (54-67) which was displayed by the host at the end of the third (57).
The Alavesen were exposed in the last quarter and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already announced that they would not allow anyone to take away the victory they had honestly earned in the first thirty minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team, did not resign and tried to give their team strength again by three points from the line (70-77).
Despite this, and even though Ivanovic’s team was knocked out of the pitch due to fouls, they did not give up, defending well, and even though the Israelis were still catching up at the last minute (80-85), the game already had a winner and Tel Aviv lost for the first time this season.
Injuries prevented Unicaja from being faced
Unicaja lost loudly in Greece against Olympiacos and had to surrender the lead in Group B of the Euroliga to him, and that in a game characterized by the losses by the players of Unicajas (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially in the indoor game, which facilitated the Greeks victory.
The Málaga team was not afraid of the atmosphere in the Hall of Peace and Friendship, nor of the opposing team, which is perhaps one of the strongest in Europe and has a lot of money.
Thanks to their first quarter game, the Andalusians were able to begin to dream. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two of them by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, blinded the hosts with 12-18 in the 9th minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the match Unicaja, even though the local team with an indoor match between Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis managed to show the ad board 22-20 in their favor in the 13th minute, the minute in which it would have come almost to a fight due to an action between the two Americans Beverley and Williams and why both were disqualified.
The Greek team finally started warming up and his superiority on both halves, while the departure of the English Joel Freeland due to an injury and the three self-inflicted mistakes of Carlos Jiménez left clear traces at Unicaja.
Among their indoor players and Lithuanian foreplayer Linas Kleizas, with his triples, they increased their advantage in the 19th minute to 44-32.
A catch-up was impossible
The third quarter was characterized by many attacks against the team of Olympiacos, who proved superior despite his 19 losses and even managed to offset the difference of the game played in Málaga with 66-48 in the 27th minute, which in turn swayed the lead within the group.
Unicaja tried to overcome the many failures and the departure of the Scotsman Robert Archibald, who was injured during the game.
Despite the many drawbacks for the Unicaja, in the 31st minute, thanks to Cook's lead and triples and Lewis's use, some hope came back to 66-57.
Nevertheless, it was actually impossible, as the Olympiacos, as soon as he attacked and showed his superiority with centimeters within the basket area, was unable to brake.
Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic managed to raise the basket difference to 81-62 in the 37th minute and Unicaja had to give up and give up the lead to Olympics.
How Much Should You Earn Based on Your Profile on Facebook?
Facebook users can now find out their salary based on their profile thanks to the new application Trovit, the search engine with the most ads of real estate, job offers and cars in Spain.
The "How much should you earn?" tool calculates users' salaries based on more than 140,000 job vacancies available at Trovit in Spain. Users have a form on Facebook that allows them to enter their profession, work experience, age and the city in which they work.
Already after a week after the application was available for the first time, the search engine found that the Spanish employee feels on average "badly paid," explains the product responsible for Trovit, Albert Ribera, in a press release.
The Spaniards are the worst paid, according to the data Trovit has through its search engines in the UK and France.
A British programmer receives an annual gross salary of 45,226 euros and a Frenchman 31,059 euros, as opposed to the 24,000 euros that a Spaniard earns.
As a result, a truck driver has a net annual salary of 34,247 euros in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 euros in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst paid work in Spain is that of a waiter with 11,592 euros net annually; followed by the work of a seller with 14,725 euros and that of a worker with 15,667 euros.
The most searched jobs on the Internet in the last three months are those of a driver, half-day jobs and social workers.
Brazil calls Zelaya a date to leave
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya’s stay in its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The president removed from office must leave the diplomatic mission no later than January 27, 2010, when his mandate officially expires.
Francisco Catunda, trade delegate to the Brazilian embassy in the capital of Honduras, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that before that date he must have left the embassy where he had found asylum since September 21.
"He is aware that he must leave on January 27, as his mandate expires on that day and he must find a new shelter."
The broadcaster also cited the ex-president, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the appointed date: “My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the backing of the government of Brazil,” Zelaya said on the phone.
Following the November 29 elections (in which Porfirio Lobo emerged as the winner), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, he tried to get refuge in Brazil this week.
However, this failed because of Zelaya's refusal to recognize the status of an asylum-seeking politician, which the "de facto" government chaired by Roberto Micheletti wanted to impose on him.
Thank you very much!
After the most tempting days since last spring, when asset inflation was the dominant mood in the markets, uncertainty has returned in the markets, which is by no means surprising, as this is their natural state, in an environment where brokers make decisions about an inherently uncertain future.
The measure used to stabilise the markets was to settle the debt with the direct purchase of assets and to indirectly give liquidity free hand at interest rates that move around zero in order for banks to buy assets for settlement.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets are almost finished and, without questioning their heterodox liquidity policy, begin to sprinkle some sand into the gearbox, as the BCE näc already pretended with its annual auction taking place next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the world economy to sustain economic recovery without these heterodox measures, and we are witnessing a reversal in reducing risk premiums.
The volatility of the exchanges and the differences in corporate bonuses are rising again, even though they are still far from the paranormal amounts they reached at the beginning of the year.
States have been forced to nationalize private risks and government debt is rising again.
We are now relying again on quality and the US, Japan and Germany are the preferred refuge of investors, which in turn leads to an increase in the differences between the countries of the eurozone and Germany.
Spain was barely affected by this episode of instability, but then Standard & Poor's came and threatened with a new revision downwards regarding Spain's valuation.
On the other hand, a certain degree of uncertainty does not hurt to silence the defenders of moral risk, who had once again tried to raise awareness among those in charge of world economic policy for what they had caused, since they had slowed down the devastating effects that the restriction of credits led to the loss of jobs, when they should have decided on a new day of action for thanksgiving.
Nevertheless, what happened in Dubai indicates a tribal war between the emirs to restore power in the emirates, and development in Greece has also been foreseen earlier.
A government that conceals public debt, elections and a new government that draws on the same line.
Prodi made it in Italy after Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense that Ecofin will save Hungary from non-fulfilment of its foreign payments at the beginning of the year and thus grant a member country of the euro to no longer fulfil its obligations.
On the other hand, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and to involve its citizens in the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of state funds.
Yes, as expected, we are facing an episode of normalization of risk premiums, after some debauchery at too high amounts, that would now be within the expected.
In the case of Spain, there is no need to worry as long as the differences in government debt increase at the same rate as the European corporate bonuses.
However, if the European differences decrease and the Spanish ones continue to increase, then this would be a special Spanish risk.
Standard & Poor's is a farce. While the local preferential indicators force a large part of the market research institutes to prefer their scenarios to the recovery and to correct their 2011 upwards scenario, including the OCDE and the European Commission, which are again coming up with a long-term Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy.
Once again, it seems that it is an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish stocks, although at the moment "careful driving" is required.
Connected branches
Iberdrola’s chairman, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to appear before the Parliament’s subcommittee yesterday, where these days the strategy for Spain’s energy supply over the next two decades will be debated.
After his appearance, which was followed by Gas Natural-Fenosa chairman Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press some key points about what he had submitted to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to the chairman of Iberdrola, Spain must invest 50 billion euros by 2020 and a further 60 billion by 2030, provided that the current nuclear power plants continue to operate.
If this were not the case, the required investment would not be 60 billion, but up to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola believes that one should no longer invest in increasing energy production capacity, but in distribution networks and international associations.
From 2020 onwards, the question will change and performance should be increased.
His proposal focuses on both gas and coal plants with facilities for collecting carbon dioxide and, of course, mainly on renewable energies.
In this case, he assumes that 18,000 MW more will be needed, under the prerequisite of course by other "support energy".
Galán, who believes that the bill for a sustainable economy just passed by the government is in line with what his company has demanded, did not want to say anything against this law, how to create incentives for national coal consumption, which would be exactly the opposite of all policy strategies in the fight against climate change.
In his opinion, "in the long term, it is clearly in this direction, despite some" individual "measures," as the chairman of Iberdrola called it.
Either way, Galán believes that decisions about investments, even if they are long-term, should be made already now, as it will take some time and a stable remuneration framework must be created to tackle them.
Ferrovial receives Aer Lingus 'handling' at 10 airports
Ferrovial’s subsidiary for ground airport services, Swissport, is the preferred partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus for luggage service at ten European airports where it is represented.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are some of the most important.
The agreement, which has not yet been announced, is set to last for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Government of Castile-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed yesterday a protocol for cooperation in order to create an innovation center for intelligent infrastructures.
The alliance plans investments of 20 million by 2012, 50% of which will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be the study of energy efficiency on motorways and airports.
Acciona competes with Hochtief and Bouygues for its first highway construction in Australia
Acciona is struggling for the approval of its first highway in Australia, a market where they are already represented as an energy and water company.
The construction involved is a tunnel that will cost 1.7 billion Australian dollars (approximately 1.047 billion euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German Hochtief are its competitors.
A five-kilometre tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the best opportunity for Acciona to establish itself in the country as a construction company and highway operator.
The municipality wants the construction to be completed by the end of 2014.
After the administration opted for public-private cooperation (PPP is the English abbreviation) to advance the project according to a business plan established by Ernst & Young, the administration is already in possession of a final list of candidates for construction and toll management.
In anticipation of the offers presented in May, the estimated investment amounts to 1.7 billion Australian dollars (EUR 1.047 billion), with three consortia, mainly European construction companies, competing with each other in the final phase.
The group, called Transcity, is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first company is one of the largest construction companies in Australia, while the second, based in Italy, is one of the best specialists in civil engineering.
The Northern Direct consortium, formed by the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield, responsible for infrastructure, and the French Bouygues, is competing against Acciona’s team.
The third and last consortium to be shortlisted is LBRJV, formed from the capital of the Australian Leighton (subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, which in turn belongs to ACS), the also native Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the French company Razel, which specialises in public construction.
The Australian infrastructure market promises huge construction work and privatizations, but has a hurdle to overcome, as you can only access it by buying a local construction company.
A strategy followed by the companies Hochtief or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, and which has yet to be followed by the Spanish construction giants.
Even ACS has gained access to this market only through its 30% stake in Hochtief, the owner of the aforementioned Leighton.
Millions of assets
Acciona focuses on this geographical area of utmost importance for the industry, where it is already well known for its activity as an energy supplier and in the desalination industry.
Among other assets, it already has its largest windmill park (192 MW) in Victoria and leads the group of companies commissioned to build and manage Adelaide’s desalination plant with a budget of 700 million.
His intention now is to consolidate in these two areas and leverage these synergies to gain access to the construction and infrastructure branches.
The underground toll line, which will be promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and will be called Northern Link, has the purpose of connecting the western highway in Toowong with the bypass road in Kelvin Grove (see map) on a length of 5 kilometers through tunnels. This is the largest road to reduce traffic jams in Brisbane.
The timetable issued by the city administration foresees the award for summer 2010 and the start of construction work in December next year.
Although this toll line is already scheduled to open to traffic in the last months of 2014, it is expected that the construction work will continue until 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
It has two lanes in each direction, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The government of Queensland is participating in the financing with 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros).
For Hochtief, Brisbane is already a big business.
Australia has repeatedly awarded significant contracts to Hochtief, who signed a 154 million contract with the government yesterday.
The subsidiary ACS will improve the infrastructure of the domestic broadband network with fiber optic cable through its domestic subsidiary Leighton.
This improvement will provide fast Internet access for 400,000 people and will keep the German company occupied for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has received the 27-story construction project of the King George Tower in Brisbane, Australia. Construction has not yet begun and Hochtief has received 129 million for it.
Also in the United Kingdom, in Manchester, it competes with Laing O'Rourke for the construction and administration of two schools for 25 years.
The initial investment amounts to 75 million euros.
FCC receives contract for a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC, through its subsidiary Alpine, has secured the construction of a 2.1-kilometre-long tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia for a total of 64.5 million euros.
The company received this contract just a few days after it received the contract for the construction work to extend the Bosruck (Austria) tunnel over 130 million.
In this way, Alpine strengthens its experience in tunnel construction.
Construction work is scheduled to begin in early 2010 and will be carried out for over 32 months.
Mrs. Rushmore receives advertising budget from Renfe
Renfe has attributed the advertising and marketing services for the next two years to the agency Sra. Rushmore over a sum of approximately three million euros annually, the railway company said.
Mrs. Rushmore was selected among 16 agencies presenting for this competition presented by Renfe, of which 4 entered the final round, including TBWA, which was responsible for advertising over the last three years.
From now on, Sra. Rushmore will be responsible for designing and producing the campaigns.
Punishment of over 63 million for France Télécom for slowing down competition.
The French competition regulator has imposed a fine of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>63 million on France Télécom for anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean territories.
According to the agency, the telephone provider has restricted competition in landline and mobile phones by signing exclusive contracts, pricing plans and loyalty programs for consumers on the brink of regulation.
Along with this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company has accumulated more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>560 million in fines since 1994 for obstructing its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday has even been increased, as the supervisory authority believes that France Télécom has committed similar offences in the past and has therefore relapsed.
Application trading
On the other hand, the subsidiary of the French company has followed the example of other telephone providers and opened an application trading page on the Internet to increase revenue from non-telephone connection transactions.
Basically, this Orange application website is active in France and the United Kingdom.
You have to wait until 2010 for this page to be available to other countries, such as Spain.
The match in the Champions League has earned Madrid and Barça 476.4 million since the start.
Since its creation in 1992, the Champions League has evolved into a source of revenue for football clubs.
So much so that Real Madrid and Barcelona have since taken 476.4 million, earning them the third and fifth place of the football clubs that made the most money in the league.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
Winning UEFA’s Champions League is not only a source of fame, it is also one of the main sources of revenue for the big clubs.
According to UEFA, the league has allocated up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5,362.5 million to the 105 teams (including 12 Spanish) that have participated in this event since its inception in the 1992/93 season.
Real Madrid and the F.C. Barcelona have benefited from this distribution.
The white club is the third in Europe to earn the most money by participating and the only one to win the trophy three times besides AC Milan.
The reigning Catalan champion and last winner of the former 1992 European Cup takes fifth place.
Manchester United and Bayern Munich are on the top of the list, two teams that also made the most money from their participation in the past Champoins League.
Even though they lost to Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only ranked third among the countries that were able to collect money through the Champions, although it has more titles than any other (five, as opposed to four in Italy, three in England and two in Germany).
Distribution
This obvious contradiction is explained by the complicated money allocation procedure used by UEFA.
In this fiscal year, the organization, chaired by Michel Platini, expects revenues of 1,090 million from the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA provides 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 football clubs that participated in the preliminary qualifying round (among them Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who competed received 3.8 million by their mere attendance, in addition to the 550,000 euros for each game they contested.
There is also a bonus for winning (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>800,000) and for a draw (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400,000 per team). The clubs that have reached the round of 16 each receive three million; the four that have reached the quarter-finals, 3.3 million.
The last four get 4 million each.
The winner earns 9 million, as opposed to the second, which receives 5.2 million.
For example, a football club receives at least 7.1 million and at most 31.2 million in fixed revenues.
Barça, on the other hand, earned 2.5 million with his victory in the European Super Cup in August.
However, there are also the variable payments, for which 337.8 million are planned.
This money is allocated proportionally to the value of each individual television market.
The Spanish is among the first and has 4 allocated seats.
Last year’s champion receives 40% of the allocated money, 30% of the second, 20% of the third place and 10% for the fourth place.
The other part will be distributed depending on the number of games they play at this year’s edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million for 29.9% stake in Sos
The Nueva Rumasa Group leaked details of the offer to buy shares yesterday, with which it intends to purchase a cap between 25 and 29.9% of Sos's capital.
A percentage that does not force them to make a public tender (OPA) due to the number of shares.
In concrete terms, Nueva Rumasa offers 1.5025 euros per share, which are paid out on ten years and at an interest rate of 1% annually due to this shift.
Yesterday, the Sos shares closed at 1.85 euros, which is why Nueva Rumasa rated the company 18% below the market value.
According to Nuevan Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real valuation of Sos.
The offer is linked to the appointment of eight of the 15 consultants.
The Jerez Group gives shareholders a 15-day period to communicate their interest in selling their shares.
CNMV assured that it had not been informed of this offer, although the company Ruiz Mateos confirmed that it had contacted the authority.
With a closing, the deposit would amount to 611.7 million, while the value of Sos would be 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure its management.
In an attempt to stay on the edge of possible purchase offers and the judicial quarrels of his ex-managers, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar announced the appointment of María Luisa Jordá as head of internal audit.
A decision that will make her the first woman to hold a high post at the food company.
This is a newly created position directly under the chairman of the group.
This is anything but free of controversy because the company is involved in a court battle on suspicion of diverting more than 230 million of Sos to other societies of the Salazar family.
It cannot be ruled out that Sos will move further capital over the next few months.
Regarding Salazar’s loan, former advisors Ildefonso Ortega and <0xC3><0x81>ngel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) appeared before the National Assembly yesterday and confirmed that they had approved the postponement of 212 million without knowing their destination.
CNMV approves public exclusion tender for Paternina submitted by investment company Mer
The National Stock Exchange Commission (CNMV) approved the public exclusion tender for Federico Paternina submitted by the investment company Mer on October 9th.
The supervisory authority stated that it approved this call for tenders after it had been demonstrated that the conditions comply with the legally binding laws and thus the content of the submitted explanatory leaflet can be considered “sufficient” following the amendments of last December 2.
CNMV has also notified that this offer is aimed at the acquisition of 550.008 shares of Federico Paternina at the price of 7.65 euros per share, which in turn represents 8.95% of the share capital, which consists of 6,142,786 euros in shares admitted to the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
Furthermore, it has been notified that 5,592,778 million shares have been fixed, which in no way can be transferred until the closing of the tender and the price of which has been fixed by Federico Paternina in accordance with the legally binding laws.
New Vehicle Assessment Programs
In these days of storms and accidents, it is not only the car workshops that deserve
Every day, thousands of vehicles involved in an accident are towed to the workshops, where an expert must assess the damage and repair costs.
Not a single accident is the same and calculating the cost of the parts and working hours can be a lengthy and complicated task.
The calculation of repair costs of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros by hand, including parts and hours of work, can take up to two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the latest computer tools, it is a matter of minutes.
That is why almost 100% of reviewers use this type of system.
Accident assessment and repair service and application providers collect the information they receive from manufacturers in order to process it thereafter and offer it to their customers in the form of a useful program.
In Spain, Audatex, part of the American group Solera, is the market leader; 80% of all expert opinions are produced with their products.
The other two companies competing with in the tool market for reviewing and drafting a report are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data that manufacturers provide is anything but simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, sales manager of Audatex, it works with 63 manufacturers and importers, each of whom provides the information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed is increasing, to the point that more versions, variants and motorizations have been released on the market in the last five years than in the entire fifteen years before.
As soon as a new car comes on the market, the work begins for the companies.
It is an arduous task, because each of the thousands of vehicle parts must be catagolized and its price entered.
In addition, each model creates an "intelligent" graphic image on which you can "click" on different parts of the vehicle.
If this is a much-sold model, the work can be completed in a week, if the procedure proceeds quickly.
If it is a less common car, it can take up to three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information for 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
Among the more exclusive models, for example, they have information about the Porsche models, but not about Ferrari or Lamborghini.
With regard to the vehicle fleet on the roads, it is over 99%.
For the purpose of performing the documentation work and producing databases, Audatex has eight centers distributed worldwide (Spain, France, Germany, the USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them specializes in specific brands.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanics) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>90 million annually in the development of these databases.
They record 2.5 million data every month and their customers receive the updates every other day.
The development of this enormous flow of information allows companies to use it in different ways and thus offer different products.
The most common use is the use for repairs and repairs, but depending on the country, there are also tools for managing scrap parts or calculating the file or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that informs about the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer this offer in Spain, but in the United States.
When reviewing the products Audatex offers, you can easily get an overview of the type of support it gives to the industry experts.
This company offers ten different tools, with the star of the products being AudaPlus, a standard solution for assessing accidents for evaluators.
It includes vehicles, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it includes the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the painting prices.
This tool is paid for depending on the intended use, i.e. for each expert report.
It will be the most expensive for customers who rarely use it, a maximum of ten times a month, namely 5.75 euros per month.
On the other hand, any insurance company that produces thousands of expert opinions negotiates the price with Audatex.
With other products, such as AudaVIN, you can fully identify a vehicle and the equipment it used to run from the assembly line using the chassis number alone.
AudaGlass deals with the vehicle panes, and AudaSubastas is an internet service open to the specialist market, which can be used to provide vehicles that have been declared to be totally damaged.
Your statistical service is very useful in identifying trends, performing geodemographic analyses or obtaining information about deviations by brand and model.
For example, it can be used to investigate how many models of a particular car brand had to enter the workshop due to breakdowns or how many of them were involved in a serious accident in a certain period of time.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of computer tools.
It distributes, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for reviewers and provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official working hours of the manufacturer in the same way.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group, which was founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of damage, breakdowns and maintenance of vehicles.
The GT guide for expert opinions is a reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 reviewers and 53 insurance companies.
Their business volume has increased by 20% annually in the last three years and sales in 2008 amounted to 10.8 million euros.
At the beginning of last year, they started to enter the international market with the opening of an office in Paris.
Audatex, on the other hand, was founded in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company’s sources, 62% of its business is in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. They work with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of them in Spain.

In this country, the company has revenues of 19.1 million euros, 7.2% more than in the previous year.
In 2005, the group Solera was worth $1 billion on the stock exchange and today its shares are traded at a value of 2.4 billion dollars.
Since 2007, they have been listed on the New York Stock Exchange and are part of the Standard & Poor's benchmark index.
Auction of accident cars on the Internet
Last October, the Solera Autoonline group purchased a platform on the Internet for the sale of accident vehicles and motorcycles.
This purchase meant the payment of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>59.5 million for 85% of the company’s capital, which could increase to the remaining 15% next year.
The purpose of this purchase was to offer more services and value to its customers, with the opportunity to gain access to a huge international market.
This review and purchase service is only available to industry professionals, such as insurance companies, assessors, car rental companies, workshops, scrapyards and car dealers, who need to register before their activities.
Founded in Germany in 1996, this platform manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, 500,000 of which are in Germany alone.
Their main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The website now has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 reviewers.
Every day, 3,000 ads are managed and 100 new ads are added to the Spanish market every day.
According to Spanish legislation, a vehicle whose chassis number has been unregistered may no longer be driven on the roads, but certain parts that are not damaged may be used as spare parts.
The cars with historical value, on the other hand, may be re-registered, even if they have been unregistered after difficult procedures by the authorities.
Cost estimate of the workshop in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audatex ensures that the user receives a cost estimate in just four steps: identification of the vehicle, search for the spare part, preparation and creation of a cost estimate.
The ease of use of these systems is a fundamental condition, especially to convince the older professionals, who are usually more or less against the use of these new computer techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, 666 of which are passenger vehicles, 109 off-road vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, you need a computer with an internet connection to use.
After the model to be repaired has been identified by means of the chassis number, a graphic of the respective model appears and the required spare part is then selected.
The user can include variables such as the price of the working hours, surcharges or discounts and afterwards he can have the cost estimate printed and passed on to his customer.
However, AudaTaller is not a tool for peer review like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalog.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop-oriented does not include estimated working hours.
The cost of use for this tool is 350 euros per year, an amount that the customer can easily pay.
The company Audatex is currently working to be able to offer these images in three-dimensional format.
This is an innovation that car mechanics have been waiting for a long time, as it allows you to select a door, for example, and then turn the picture completely to look at the inside.
