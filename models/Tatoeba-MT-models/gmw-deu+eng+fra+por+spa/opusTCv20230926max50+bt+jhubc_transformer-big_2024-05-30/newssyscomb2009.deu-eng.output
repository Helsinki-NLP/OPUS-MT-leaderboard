The triumph of right-wing populists in Austria, totaling 29 percent
A noticeable weakening of both parties of the previous major coalition and a clear strengthening of the right-wing populist parties brought the early parliamentary elections of Sunday in Austria, according to the first preliminary results.
The <0xC3><0x96>sterreichische Volkspartei (<0xC3><0x96>VP) suffered particularly severe losses, where the position of former chairman Wilhelm Molterer is seriously at stake.
In contrast, the electoral director of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZ<0xC3><0x96>), the Carinthian state governor Jörg Haider, is preparing for a triumphant return to federal politics.
According to the results so far, the Social Democracy (SP<0xC3><0x96>) remains the strongest force in the country with 29.8 percent of the votes, but loses 5.5 percent of the votes compared to the last elections in 2006.
Even worse did the <0xC3><0x96>VP, which lost almost nine percent of the vote with 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in post-war Austrian history, and especially with the People’s Party, which had demanded the early elections, this is a truly disastrous result.
Even at the beginning of July, when the <0xC3><0x96>VP left the coalition, the People’s Party had a clear advantage over the SP<0xC3><0x96>.
But voters probably punished the party for letting the government fail.
Already in the first reactions to the results there was speculation about a possible resignation of the party chairman and former Vice-Chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could be the case already on Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the party’s board of directors.
Such a development would probably pave the way to the most likely way out of the electoral debacle, i.e. to a renewal of the large coalition of SP<0xC3><0x96> and <0xC3><0x96>VP.
In view of the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the Liberals (FP<0xC3><0x96>) received 18 percent for the time being, the BZ<0xC3><0x96> 11 percent of the votes - the Social Democrats expressed their fear that the year 1999 could be repeated when the People's Party had colluded with the populists (then the FP<0xC3><0x96> was still unified, in 2005 it even split itself from the BZ<0xC3><0x96> government)
Jörg Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to cooperate with each party, obviously relies on this development and assumes a return to Vienna in Austrian federal politics.
In addition, the Green Party moved into Parliament, but it suffered slight losses and slipped from third to fifth place among the Austrian political parties.
No other party has probably mastered the four-percent hurdle and therefore did not move into Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India may cool down
If it is not possible to solve the problem with the Czech scientists accused in India of illegally collecting beetles, Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg believes that there could be a certain cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
This was emphasized by the minister in New York after today’s meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherdshi.
"If this is not clear, then sure, then there will be a certain cooling down," he said after a meeting that took place on a Czech initiative.
Mukherdshi said after the talks that it was difficult for the executive to intervene in judicial matters.
Nevertheless, he stated that in the case of Petr <0xC5><0xA0>vácha, who was acquitted of the indictment and received a fine, the central government wants to join the local government in Dardjiling, in whose jurisdiction the matter falls.
"His problem could be resolved," the minister said.
For Emil Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era, who was sentenced to three years imprisonment, Mukherdshi believes it would be best for him to appeal to a higher court.
He could thus ask for release on bail and wait in freedom for his verdict, the minister said.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had said the same thing during negotiations.
"He recommends an appeal to a higher court, then a pardon would be in question for him," the head of the Czech diplomacy said.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in the whole matter is to give the convicted “competent legal support,” the Indian minister said.
At the same time, he said such help was already being offered to them by the Indian side.
"We have a great interest in maintaining good contacts with India, which have a long-term tradition.
The Indians also admit this,” Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, according to the Czech press agency <0xC4><0x8C>TK, before his partner, the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really think it is a big mistake to detain and indict these Czech scientists," he said.
The Minister avoided an answer to the question of whether he had received a promise from the Indian side to deal with the matter.
"I was promised a lot," he said.
A Czech judges the struggle for the bottom of the sea
He approaches an electronic map showing Australia and the adjacent sea areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but in a small point, lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and, together with it, the adjacent seabed.
The area is as large as the continent itself," said Italian lawyer Luigi Santosusso, who is part of the 30-member staff of the United Nations Ocean and Maritime Rights Division.
His chief, the division director, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the interpretation and supplements it from time to time.
Here there is work and enthusiasm.
The seabed holds a little-known world, rich in natural springs.
Oil, ore and other non-renewable raw materials can be found here, but also previously unknown living organisms that, for example, carry the key to the development of a drug against cancer.
A seabed larger than the mainland
Today, the neighbouring states vehemently declared their claim to the new sea areas.
Under a UN convention, they exercise their rights, which they agreed on in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often reaches up to a few hundred kilometers far from the shore of a country into the sea.
According to the Convention, this country has an exclusive right to all sources of the continental shelf.
"Simplified, a continental shelf is considered the part of the seabed and its soles that represents a natural continuation of the continent below the sea surface.
It crosses the borders of the sea, often also the border of two hundred nautical miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone," explains Mikulka.
The application submitted by the country concerned to the Commission to determine the external borders of the continental shelf must be supported by a comprehensive scientific and technical documentation based on many costly investigations and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide legal and technical support to the Commission.
The Commission has so far negotiated five applications from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the three latter countries have been successful," Mikulka adds.
The success of Australia, which was the first country to significantly enlarge its sea areas, has recently received an international echo.
But New Zealand is also a winner - the extent of the seabed, which was granted to the country last week by the Commission, is about 1.6 million square kilometers, which is about six times the size of the actual state.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the investigation.
The profits they will receive in the future from the use of the seabed will be, as they promise, invaluable.
Other countries will gradually submit their proposals.
They can do this for ten years from the moment they ratify the “Montego Bay Agreement.”
Where the continental shelf ends, the area of the ocean floor begins, which is referred to by the convention as "the common heritage of mankind".
In this case, no state has a special position.
The right to promote in this field is granted by an international institution established by the Convention.
"The seabed, however, is not a gold mining land," says Director Mikulka with some exaggeration, adding that "these individual areas are legally precisely defined and the system is contractually anchored."
Czechs in the Pacific
Today, part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other states of the former Eastern bloc within the framework of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
In 1991, the Convention granted it, as did the investors of a few other states, the status of a so-called "breakthrough investor".
The organization has the right to promote ClarionClipperton in the Pacific Ocean zone between Mexico, Hawai and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The seabed is divided there, it is a kind of Tatra on the seabed.
"You can fund there on an area of a total of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich site of polymetallic concretions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," said another lawyer, Indian Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian employee of the Rober Sandev division brings such concrete as a pattern.
It is reminiscent of a small potato or, with a little imagination, of the legendary scheme that, according to legend, brought the golems to life.
German Special Forces were on site during hostage liberation
The Egyptian government had requested help from Germany to solve the hostage crisis - the experts came.
When it became serious, the special forces were ready, but they did not come for deployment.
More and more details are becoming known about the circumstances of the liberation of eleven European tourists abducted in Egypt.
According to the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior, German special forces were indirectly involved in the rescue operation.
According to this, both specialists of the Bundeswehr and officials of the GSG 9, the aviation squadron of the Federal Police, the Federal Criminal Office and logistics experts of the Technical Aid Agency were at the place of the liberation.
However, spokespersons from the ministries further announced on Monday evening that the German forces were not needed because the hostage-takers let their prisoners flee and fled when they recognized signs of a violent liberation.
The Egyptian government has accepted the help offered by Germany to involve them as support forces on the ground.
“Fortunately, that has not happened,” said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
Attackers had abducted the group of five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian and their eight Egyptian companions in southern Egypt on September 19.
After the kidnapping in a desert area in the south of Egypt, the hostages in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad had been dragged back and forth.
The identity of the hostage holders remained unclear until the last moment, as well as the details of the exemption or possible ransom payments.
The rescued have now arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the freed hostages were in the custody of the German embassy.
He did not comment on the details of the release.
In Berlin there was initially no information on when they would return to Germany.
According to the "Bild" newspaper, the five holidaymakers and the special forces are to be flown out with an Airbus of the Air Force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
U.S. House of Representatives rejects rescue package
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress has failed the $700 billion bailout package for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones ran into the depths.
By 206 to 227 votes, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government’s bailout package for the financial markets.
Despite all the appeals from US President George W. Bush and leading politicians of both parties, there was no majority for the program to curb the chaos in the financial markets.
In a dramatic action, the proponents had desperately tried to convince the critics of the $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic negotiators, had called for MEPs to agree, even though the plan was unpopular.
"It's hard to get political recognition for avoiding something that hasn't happened yet," he admitted.
In the course of the vote, the Dow Jones fell by more than six percent or by 600 points.
Investors were worried that the government rescue package could fail.
He recovered shortly before the end of the vote and then, after the failure became known, crashed again.
Experts now anticipate further severe turbulence in the international financial markets.
Approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate is required for the program to enter into force.
Organizers report rising booking numbers
It seems to be a good winter for the German tour operators:
For travel bookings for the coming months, sales have increased significantly compared to the previous year according to a study - for the winter season even by more than 30 percent.
Despite weak economic outlooks, the desire to travel among Germans remains undisturbed, according to a study.
In terms of bookings for the winter season, the rice agencies recorded a 31 percent increase in sales compared to the same period of the previous year, as the German Travel Association (DRV) announced on Monday in Berlin.
According to the study by the market research institute GfK, there are already increased booking figures for the autumn months.
For example, the turnover of the travel agencies for October amounted to around eleven percent compared to 2007, the DRV said.
The basis for these results are figures from GfK, which evaluates monthly booking data from 1,200 German travel agencies and calculates them for the overall market.
This includes travel bookings made until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar exchange rate, travel to the United States in particular is in demand, the DRV said.
Here, the booking increase amounts to around a third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as the homelands, are particularly sought-after destinations among the Germans.
In particular, package travel is high in the course, said DRV President Klaus Laepple.
Given rising costs for energy and food, the costs for the customer are “better to calculate than for individually organized holidays”.
Consumers could save money, among other things, through early booking discounts or all-inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months were also very well booked, so that sales will again increase compared to the previous year - although, according to another study, the number of Germans who made a trip decreased compared to the previous year.
My first time at Oktoberfest
Ballermann-Apres-Ski-Hits in the Endless Loop, Beer from Liter Jars and Celebrities in Designer-Dirndln.
A Wiesn debut.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don’t have much in common.
She is blonde, TV presenter and wears a tailor-made dirndl.
I have dark hair, am a student and my dress is second hand.
But one thing connects us: barely three minutes on the meadow, the photographers are already rushing on us and flashing the memory cards full - very flattering and that on my first visit to the meadow.
That's how you make friends.
The cheap dirndl seems to be fulfilling its purpose.
As a resident of Wiesn-Touri and actually north of the White Sausage Equator, the feeling of well-being in the costume was still limited until now.
But once on the Theresienwiese, everything is half as bad.
Almost everyone wears dirndl or leather pants; no one looks disgusted or embarrassed - everything is completely normal.
Strange looks at the chocolate banana stand only reap my dirndl apron.
A Munich woman reminds me that I had tied the apron incorrectly: "Left hoast free, middle virgin, right forgiven, back widow."
Hiddenly, I froze the bow from the back to the left.
"Fits," he said and laughed.
Others put less effort into subtle flirting techniques and wear simple felt hats on which stands "To drunk to get dressed!" and stretch their naked buttocks towards an uninvited person.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitudes is named Bob, comes from England and also attends the Oktoberfest for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous", with an elongated "oooooo".
He tells me this after he has rid himself of his previously drunk measure.
Right next to one of those hydrants that everyone thinks is a trash can.
So Bob is one of those infamous "Wildbieslers".
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At about eight o’clock in the evening, paramedics run in crowds across the festival square to take care of the poor swallows.
The nurses always appear in the pack - always four at a time towing a covered carrier from tent to tent.
This works as with most Wiesn visitors: empty, full back.
You can't see who's under the tarpaulin in the Promille coffin.
"These are the ones where goarnimmer pack," one of the paramedics called to me upon request and disappeared in the turmoil.
Name of the victim of the accident announced by the police
The name of a 63-year-old female pedestrian who died in the hospital after being hit by a vehicle in Essex has been announced.
Carole Paulson, who lives at Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the Friday afternoon accident on Shenfield Road in the city center.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
A 51-year-old man was arrested after the accident on suspicion of reckless driving.
In the meantime, he was released on bail.
Turkey expands diplomatic horizon
Long before Turkey sought to join the European Union, the European powers were interested in penetrating deep into the hinterland of Turkey.
On the eastern side of the Bosphorus, perhaps just 20 steps inside Asia, stands one of the finest relics of this failed imperial endeavor.
The Hydarpasha railway station was designed by the two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in the Neo-Renaissance style.
At least that’s what the guides tell you.
The building sits riding at the end of the platforms with a tower at each corner of the front and thus looks like some provincial German town hall.
The rock is dirty.
The whole building is falling apart.
But once you are inside the vaulted ticket counter, there is no doubt about the majesty of the project, whose westernmost access it was.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolia-Bagdad Society.
Germany, which was a late retarder in the imperialist game, had before its ambitions to dominate the Middle East by means of a train connection to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond what is now Saudi Arabia.
But Germany’s imperialist plans lagged during the First World War.
His railroad tracks were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arabs.
The relative isolation from its surrounding region, created by the insurmountable boundaries of the Cold War, has disappeared.
British forces pulled out of Egypt, pushing the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria
And there was also bad news for the Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, an ammunition train flew into the air, destroying the artful roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has slowly disintegrated, largely ignored by history.
Nowadays, however, this railway line, at least symbolically, serves as a gateway to Anatolia and everything east of it to highlight the expansion of the diplomatic horizon of the Tükei.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the AKP, has introduced a completely new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from the neighbouring regions, created by the boundaries of the Cold War, has disappeared.
There is now a policy of rapprochement.
Remarkably, the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian splinter groups Hamas and Fatah, with Iran and Iraq and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
In order to assess the key data of this new foreign policy, I boarded the night train to the Turkish capital Ankara to visit one of the AKP’s leading foreign policy experts, the Turkish MP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, about ten and a half hours later, after a bumpy ride on tracks that produced the same footsteps of the old world in the well-known documentary "The Night Mail", I arrived in the Turkish capital, which is regarded as a new city for the new secular state project of turning the back on the Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, known for its Islamist roots, represents a paradigm shift in Turkish unity.
This has sparked a lot of distrust in the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi took me to the headquarters of the AKP, a specially crafted, state-of-the-art stone and steel structure, in a developing suburb, surrounded by semi-finished shopping malls and pubs where middle managers in suits, both men and women, met to complete the first shops of the day.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a centre-right politician of almost any other political party in Europe.
Suit, tie, I'm sure he even packed a Blackberry.
"The aim of the party's foreign policy is now to reintegrate Turkey with its immediate neighbouring countries.
The Cold War was an exceptional phenomenon,” he told me.
Turkey had been cut off from its hinterland.
Nowadays it has to look simultaneously to the east and west.
There would not be either one or the other.
She would have to do both.
"But certainly Turkey could someday," I asked, "be forced to decide?"
"Turkey," he said, "did not have to face this decision."
He then highlighted a point that almost everyone I was talking to repeated almost routinely: Turkey’s relations, not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and around the Black Sea, are as beneficial to Europe and the United States as they are to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the embassy seems to be able, in a figurative sense, to drive Europe as a whole on the same railway tracks eastwards towards Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha's station, after another largely sleepless night, I thought of these two German lords, Mr. Ritter and Mr. Conu, who had watched the construction of this building 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to learn that Europe’s ambitions in the Middle East could now, to a large extent, be in the hands of Turkey.
And while waiting at the dock for the ferry to take me back across the Bosphorus, I remembered that Turkey was always called "the sick man of Europe" in those days.
At the time, at least, there seemed to be little doubt as to which continent should be entitled to this fascinating country.
In memory of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon "Dead" Handley (September 11 obituary) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic and Choir.
As part of his music program for the city, he founded his great youth choir, Proteus, the following year.
It was intended for teenagers up to 21 years old, but when the choir last sang in 1979, some of us were already in our late 20s - we simply refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological shapeshifter) stood for the chorus' willingness and ability to tackle any piece of music that was presented to him, whether it was a madrigal or from the Messiah, whether a capella or with full orchestra.
The musical versatility of such a young choir was often astonishing, always exciting and existed solely thanks to the inspiration of that man and his enthusiasm for the music, which never faded over the years.
How often did death stop us from “leaving the music to speak for itself”?
He used to say, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all in the music.
So sing it!"
His manner of conducting was absolutely clear and precise, never masterful but never exuberant.
No matter how high the musical level was, he always demanded an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any conductor should have been beaten to the knight, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well for the last two decades, from 1962 to 1982, where he led the Guildford Philharmonic.
Over the past 40 years or so, I’ve written reviews for over a hundred of his concerts, and I can honestly say that I’ve never been disappointed by a single one – often I’ve been inspired by them.
Death Handley was that rare combination of greatness and personal modesty.
He detested conductors who, according to his words, simply "went out with one or two well-known show horses in the world."
So many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In your obituary for William Woodruff (September 25), you write that "he resumed teaching economic history at Oxford in 1946 and received a Houblon-Norman research scholarship in 1950...while at the same time studying for a BSc, an MA, and a doctorate.
This is a conclusion from an author's remark in Woodruff's book "Beyond Nab End", though it is not true.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a lecturer in economic history at the University of Nottingham and during this time he wrote a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers, which was later published in 1958 as "The British Rubber Industry".
He was in the United States in 1950-1951 in the course of a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and spent the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953, he finally left Nottingham and went to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff wanted to cover up this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philology.
<0x60>I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino <0x60>Flamenco and Life' because his photographs in black and white, in documentary style, are fantastic.
They made me aware of them because of their simplicity and the power they radiate, how they always deal with the protagonists with respect.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feelings.
Resino knows how to find the magical moments."
Second round of excellent sales at Honda.
In November, Honda will start marketing the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
While its predecessor model had a large interior, this wide-body sedan offers a much larger one.
In addition, the technical intricacies that allow even more comfortable driving and fuel savings are also added.
Changes before the upcoming revolution.
This is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although, aesthetically speaking, the new jazz has a similar line to its predecessor, the changes made to this grand sedan are numerous.
Among other things, the innovative design, the new space flexibility, the larger dimensions of the car and the new mechanics are to be emphasized.
Nevertheless, before you start analyzing the new model, you have to say that this new jazz appears six years later, after the first generation appeared on the market.
According to the first observations, Honda, compared to the other manufacturers, managed to renew this model for a shorter period of time.
Although the Honda Jazz is less well-known in Europe, this model is a phenomenon in terms of its sales in the other markets.
This is a case in Japan, in the country where jazz is the best-selling car of 2002 and also during this year 2008.
After jazz was released on the market, about a million models were sold in Japan alone.
The second market was the Old Continent, with about half a million cars sold in six years.
Nevertheless, Honda is trying to increase sales of the new Jazz model within the segment.
In this way, while the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 Jazz models in 2007, the expected estimates amount to 10,000 cars, which is 17% of the expected growth in the European market.
As far as the Spanish market is concerned, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 Jazz models since 2002, representing 6.7% of total sales at Honda in Spain.
As for the new generation of the model, the heads of the store in Spain expect to be able to sell 2,000 jazz models per year.
Looking more closely, the release of the new Honda Jazz model allows to cover up the sales cut in Spain.
In reality, the heads of the brand hope to close the year with total sales of 22,000 models, which is 4,000 cars less than in 2007, a 16% reduction.
Despite this growth in sales, Honda has increased its market share in Spain to 1.8% compared to the previous year (1.6%).
At the same time, the Japanese company hopes to reach the 2% in 2010.
To achieve this share, Honda is relying on the appearance of a new model.
It is Insight, a 5-door hybrid car with a compact size of 4.7 meters in length, of which the Japanese company hopes to sell around 200,000 models per year around the world.
According to market estimates by the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of Insight models are sold in the United States, while the remaining share is distributed on the Old Continent and Japan.
The launch of Insight on the market is scheduled for the first months of the year, for the first time its public presentation will take place in Valencia in January.
In terms of the first generation, the new jazz is growing in all its sizes.
Its length is 3.90 meters (plus 5 centimeters), its width is 1.69 meters (plus 2 centimeters) and the distance between the axes is 2.50 meters, which leads to the assumption that it has grown 5 centimeters larger.
The height, on the other hand, does not change and remains 1.52 meters.
Together with the increase in dimensions, the interior is also enlarged.
This success is due, on the one hand, to the new space flexibility program and, on the other hand, to the central position of the fuel tank, a solution that was also used in the predecessor model of Jazz.
Also, the capacity of the trunk, which has a system of double loading area, reaches up to 339 litres, which is 19 litres larger than the capacity of the trunk of the first generation.
It should be emphasized that these measures are available in the version with a 1.4 litre gasoline engine, because the capacity of the trunk of the Honda Jazz with a 1.2 litre gasoline engine is 379 litres.
Among other improvements, in addition to the additional equipment elements such as leather seats or the possibility of installing panoramic windows, an improved access to the seats is offered.
The opening angle of the rear doors is 80 degrees, with the first jazz having only 67 degrees.
The second generation of Jazz engines are also new.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model has 2 versions of petrol engines: 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both variants have i-VTEC system, which enables low fuel consumption and lower CO2 emissions, has excellent technical performance and at the same time provides high torque performance for the entire engine life.
The first version with 1.2 litres achieves the power of 90 hp at 6,000 revolutions with maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4,900 min?1 .
This petrol engine - the predecessor model of Jazz reaches 78 hp - has 5.3 liters of petrol consumption and CO2 emissions of 125 grams.
With regard to the predecessor engine, which reached 83 hp in the previous generation, it now manages to come to 100 hp.
The Jazz 100 hp model 1.4 has 5.4 liters of fuel consumption and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
<0x60>Auto-bee' that avoids collisions
To drive the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan this time took inspiration from nature, more precisely, from bees.
The Japanese company has developed a robot whose flight goes back to the swarm behavior of bees and avoids accidents.
This robot is a bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C and represents the first step in the technologies for accident prevention.
The engineers from the technical development center of Nissan Motor Co. have developed this small robot in cooperation with the Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology of the renowned University of Tokyo (Japan).
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Head of Technology PR and R&D Brand Management, the BR23C is an extension of the four-layer Nissan safety shield.
This robot is designed to ensure that the cars of this brand are able to avoid the collisions.
During the flight, each bee builds its own oval-shaped airspace, which is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important are the facet eyes of the bee, which can see in all directions at an angle of 300 degrees, which allows her to fly undisturbed in her personal airspace without interruption.
To recreate the all-round perspective, the technicians developed the so-called Laser Range Finder (LRF).
It detects obstacles up to two meters away from the BR23C and within a 180-degree radius, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to an on-board microprocessor, which is directly translated into a signal for avoiding the collision
<0x60>At the moment obstacle is noticed, the little robot will imitate the bee flight and immediately change direction by turning its wheels around 90o or even larger angles to avoid the collision.
The biggest difference from other arbitrary systems is that this evasion maneuver takes place absolutely instinctively.
If it were not, the robot might not be able to respond with sufficient speed to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, the director of the Laboratory for Mobility and the senior engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot deviate either upwards or downwards, but also not overhead; it can only move on two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to rotate its wheels and not in the infinite directions and in infinite ways that the bees do.
For this reason, Nissan has used the rotation function in addition to acceleration and deceleration functions so that the small robot avoids collisions.
<0x60>This device only takes a few seconds to process the information and act according to this information.
It does not require to store the information or the intuitive logic of the maneuvers, so it can continuously work with only a few dozen KB of storage space.
This sounds surprising, but it’s not about the GBs or even the MBs of the disk space.
This is the first step in the development of technologies for the immediate prevention of collisions, a technology that Nissan predicts to introduce to production cars over the next decade.
The robot works with lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than a variety of lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be the integration of the unit with a GPS navigation system by satellite to lead to the destination while driving, avoiding the obstacles on the way.
She is shaking before being charged with a mortgage.
One must recognize that the U.S. Treasury Department, apart from having sufficient liquidity to provide support, is not without skill.
Before the crisis and to avoid getting US citizens involved in mortgage histories of the allegedly solvent banks, a fun and informative game for internet surfers was developed: Bad Credit Hotel.
Or maybe, the 'hotel of bad credit' or the mess.
The third aspect of this accommodation and especially its receptionist is to think one, two, and up to three times about whether it is the moment to ask for no credit.
And most importantly, where you can do it, which is probably the goal of the game.
Surely it has useful information, but without details.
This is more of a site for teenagers than a place for all viewers.
What will happen if the game expands?
Well, when a dreamlike room appears in the hotel.
At least something, because it’s not about buying a better home
Morgan Stanley Provides Capital for MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) into its company, making it the first bank in Japan to spend $9 billion and thus take over 21% of its capital, an innovation due to a strong fall in its stock exchange price.
A week after a preliminary agreement was made public, the two banks announced that MUFG will buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley common shares at a single price of $25.25, totaling $3 billion.
The assumed price is below 19% of the share's price value as of August 31.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion in the acquisition of convertible shares, which will secure it a 10% profit and can be resold at a price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley stated that the global business will be conducted on the basis of a uniform average price of $29, i.e. 28% above the current price.
However, the Morgan Stanley stock dropped by 6.79% to $23.07 at 17:00 GMT.
“This strategic link represents an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to the status of a holding bank,” said John Mack, CEO of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley assumed this status last week, enabling him to expand his business to new areas, but under the supervision of the Federal Reserve.
Their association with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing Wall Street’s biggest names to take a much more cautious stance than before.
The arrangements presented on Monday also show that the deal has changed over the last few days: Last Monday, Morgan had simply stated that she would sell up to 20% of its shares to Japan for about $8.5 billion.
“A week ago,” Toshihide Mizuno, Managing Director of MUFG, explained in Tokyo, “we thought that the stake would consist entirely of common shares.
But given the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce the risks and hedge ourselves.”
Based on a balanced average price, MUFG will pay 7% below its price value for its Morgan Stanley shares.
And the business will go with a reduction in profits of about 20% per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferred shares into common shares in one year if the latter are exchanged within a given period to more than 50% above the sale value, i.e. to approximately $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the funds provided by MUFG will enable it to capitalize on investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its sales.
However, a press spokesman for the group refused to provide more detailed information on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
After MUFG’s investment, Morgan Stanley should have a payability ratio of around 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan said he had “significantly” lowered his balance sheet since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been tough for the group to watch their stock market price drop by half, while the price of insurance against insolvency has skyrocketed.
This price declined on Monday, but remained at a high level, at about 12%.
Goldman Sachs, the only remaining “survival” of Wall Street’s major investment banks following the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the acquisition of Merrill Lynch, announced last week that it had withdrawn $15 billion, partly from Berkshire Hathaway, the Warren Buffett group.
Rafael Correa this Monday in Quito.
Re-establishing the republic around 21st century socialism.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Equatorian Rafael Correa.
It was the third one who, following the example of his like-minded and friends, presented the plan of a new constitution for election this Sunday.
Mission fulfilled, because according to the public results of 80% of the voters, 64% voted 'yes' in the referendum.
According to these results, 28% voted 'no', 7% of the ballots were invalid and 0.7% were left empty.
In order for the constitutional project to be adopted, one vote must be obtained for more than half of all votes cast.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the polling stations' exits and a census by a non-governmental organization announced a clear victory for "yes," predicting it to be between 63% and 70%.
On the night of Sunday to Monday, Rafael Correa had demanded the victory of his constitutional project.
“The Constitution has triumphed overwhelmingly,” he had assured in Guayaquil, the government’s headquarters 280 kilometers southwest of Quito, and congratulated the Equatorians.
Of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales, but also by his Chilean like-minded Michelle Bachelet.
The election, which was silently held in accordance with the Observatory of the Organization of American States (OAS), referred to a text consisting of 444 points to secure the “new socialism” that the President advocates.
The constitutional project transfers state power to the economy by giving it the sole right to ‘development planning’ in a country that largely lives on the production of oil by foreign companies and on the foreign exchange that sends emigrants to the country.
The project, which is being promoted by Correa, who was elected in 2006, also grants the head of state more power, who will be able to exercise up to two consecutive mandates of four years each, and will have the opportunity to dissolve the National Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will make use of this power and will seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also secures the principle of free medical care and schooling, which the President has already begun to introduce in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
In the end, it also plans to ban the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington to use an Equatorian base as a base for American anti-drug operations.
The 19 hostages were freed in Chad.
An Egyptian commando launched the attack on the hijackers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions who had been captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions, who were held captive in the desert for eleven days, were returned to the Egyptian capital healthy and unharmed this Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they were liberated from an Egyptian commando in Chad.
Apparently in good condition, the hostages arrived at the al-Maza military base next to Cairo International Airport at around 3.30 p.m. on board a special aircraft.
They were taken directly, without being able to speak to the press, aboard a helicopter to the hospital of Maadi, a foreigner district of Cairo, to be examined there.
"They enjoy all the 'best health' and the kidnappers 'were not paid a ransom,'" Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garanna said in a statement.
After being captured on September 19 during an off-road safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat in the border area of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, the group of hostages was repeatedly taken from one hideout to the next by 35 unknown hijackers.
There are eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and eight Egyptians: two guides, four chauffeurs, a border guard and the director of the agency Aegyptus, organizer of the safari.
An Egyptian security official said that 30 members of the Special Forces, aboard two helicopters, launched the attack at night, just before dawn.
"There were shots on both sides and half of the kidnappers were killed, the rest fled," said the official, who wants to remain anonymous.
He explained that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian Special Forces had been sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commandos.
The head of Italian diplomat Franco Frattini reported from Belgrade, where he is currently, on the role played by secret agents and elements of the Italian Special Forces.
"We must acknowledge that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of our men from the intelligence services and special forces," he said without further details.
He also denied that a ransom had been paid.
On the evening before, the Sudanese army had claimed to have stopped an off-road vehicle in which the hijackers were located, of which they killed six, including the Chadian leader, and arrested two.
The army declared that they were connected to a rebel group from Darfour, the Libération du Soudan-Unité (SLA-U) movement, but immediately denied this movement.
Letters - The Silent Majority of Culture
A debate about the financing of culture is making headlines and is a central theme of the current election campaign.
All the better.
But an area of our cultural life remains in oblivion.
Who will stand up and denounce the pitiful sums granted to the small museums, the archives, the archaeological excavations or the national historical sites that starve to death?
Which politician will dare to remind the German government that it is neglecting its monuments and its culturally significant buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, there are no proper laws that effectively protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government is providing <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.5 million solely for the restoration of the castle of Chinon in the Loire Valley?
With our American neighbors, the Constitution of their country states that the protection of cultural heritage is part of the American culture, and that this cultural heritage must be protected by all citizens, all MPs and all districts, in mutual agreement.
In Quebec, in the Association of Historical Societies of Quebec, at least 40,000 volunteers, gathered in 211 historical societies, strive to deal intensively with history, save the numerous private archives with a few penny, and preserve the archaeological remains.
They are also often the watchdogs of our cultural heritage who protest with the power of despair when promoters and decision makers release their bulldozers on our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will there be a stage for history and cultural heritage?
Benelux governments nationalize parts of Fortis Bank
With a partial nationalisation, the Benelux countries want to help the Belgian-Dutch Fortis Bank, which is in turbulence due to the US financial crisis: The three states will make a total of EUR 11.2 billion available to the bank and insurance institute, which also has branches in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands have consulted at the highest level on the weekend, together with the President of the European Central Bank and the Commission’s Commissioner for Competition.
In the eurozone, the Fortis is the first victim of the international financial crisis that has lasted for a year, so decisions now made in connection with the bank could set precedent.
According to the decision taken on Sunday night, all three states buy the respective shares of the bank at about 49 percent.
The bank is expected to sell some of its holdings, most notably the insurance activities purchased by Dutch company ABN Amro last year.
The shares of Fortis started a steep downturn last week, with serious crisis scenarios already emerging in the second half of the week.
However, analysts agree that the bank with its 85,000 employees is far too big for a bankruptcy.
The securities of the institution fell by 12% to a 14-year low on Friday.
Since January, the value of the shares has fallen by more than two-thirds.
Given the current share prices, the Group’s market value is EUR 14 billion, but this is unrealistic according to management.
According to management, the USD 700 billion US bailout package and the resulting uncertainty in the markets is to blame for the downturn of Fortis shares.
On Monday, however, the prices rose slightly.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed as the new general director of the bank.
The financial institution was also looking for a private buyer, but it did not find any interested party with a factual offer.
The Belgian government was, however, trying to reassure - no investor should tremble for his money, it said.
So far, there has been no panic among the customers, the branches of the bank have not been stormed.
In Hungary, Fortis has independent branches, but it also calls leasing companies its own.
Fox in the henhouse
Due to a person’s drug use, life and health insurance companies in America often refuse to sign a contract with a customer.
Data protection experts fear that the data market could become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programs that link the use of the drug data in any case to the consent of the person concerned.
These should be in independent hands, otherwise we'll entrust the fox with the chickens" - quotes Washington Post Richard Dick, developer of the prescribed data tracking program.
Insurance companies determine the fees and payment amounts in case of damage depending on the health condition of the customer, and if the risk is overestimated, the insurance is not even concluded.
Previously, the customer was sent to a medical examination, and the contract was concluded only in knowledge of the examination results.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a far cheaper method: Using the customer’s identification number, he obtains the data of the last year and a half from the pharmacies, that is, which preparations were purchased, and the program calculates from what disease the customer suffers and how his health is.
For example, if he regularly buys large amounts of cholesterol-lowering drugs, it could be concluded that his blood lipid levels are untreatable, which would automatically place him in a higher risk group.
There are several versions of the program in circulation - some even define a risk multiplier, so insurance companies just have to do more of the paperwork, but there are minor difficulties.
One of the disadvantages is that many medications can be taken for various purposes, such as for migraines and hot flashes, but also for depression.
The latter is a high-risk factor from the point of view of insurers, while the previously mentioned ones are not.
For the query and processing of the data have formed their own societies, which before obtaining the data, ask the patient for their consent.
In the meantime, they have to do so by law, although omissions have not been punished so far.
Some companies even process the results of laboratory studies and link them to the data on drug use, providing an even more accurate picture of the patient’s health.
More and more companies have access to the data, and controlling its use is becoming more difficult at the same time.
Although there is a separate data protection law for health data, its effect only extends to healthcare and insurance providers.
The bill has already been submitted to Congress, according to which the authorities could also control the data processing companies.
Dick Richard sees that this is too little, so he wants to develop his program further, so that the data can only be passed on with the consent of the person concerned.
Another question is, of course, that the person concerned can hardly prohibit access to his data, as otherwise the insurance companies do not conclude a contract with him.
And so the chickens are somehow left to the grace of the fox.
Global meal plan from Marseille
India and the European Union are doubling their trade
Since the European Union and India are each other’s leading trading partners, this was the main issue among other global issues at the ninth summit.
Today, the Franco-Indian summit is also taking place, where cooperation in the nuclear energy sector is mainly discussed.
While the European Union recognizes that India is an emerging, democratic power that should be given more voices and voices in international concerns, so far member states have not been able to agree on whether or not to support the permanent membership of New Delhi in the UN Security Council.
This question was not discussed at yesterday's ninth summit in Marseille.
French President and current EU Council President Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Chief Diplomatic Officer Javier Solana, welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. An agreement was reached to double trade over the next five years, i.e. to more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 billion.
Given the fact that the exchange of goods had increased from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this goal is not even so ambitious.
In this sense, the 26 existing civil aviation agreements with India have also been legally combined into an agreement, so that air transport will also be boosted in the future.
India wants to sign the free trade agreement with the Union by 2009.
Sarkozy pledged to speed up the deal.
The aim is to strike a balance in the currently unbalanced relationship between the EU and India: while the Union is India’s number one partner, New Delhi is only ranked ninth among the EU partners.
The summit was dedicated to global concerns.
Among them were the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and terrorism, which both sides strongly condemned, and the convocation of a UN conference.
The Doha Round should also be concluded, with both sides blamed for the failure.
The EU stressed that it is sticking to its energy and climate programme, meaning that pollutant emissions are to be reduced by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agreed to this, as did the proposal to reach a kind of global compromise at the upcoming climate summit and to reduce greenhouse gas production by 50 percent by 2050.
Food price increases should also be combated, so both support the convocation of an international conference on the financial crisis.
The head of Indian government is visiting the French capital today, where he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, however, they are hoping for contracts to French companies worth EUR 20 billion for the construction of nuclear reactors in India.
According to the agency reports, the agreement is to be decided on 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the International Frankfurt Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishers will be present at the 60th Book Fair, the most important international event for the acquisition of rights.
The international Frankfurt Book Fair awaits over 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries for the current event. They will spread over the 171,790 square meters of the trade fair and present over 403,000 titles. Turkey will be the guest of honor of the event.
The Vice-Secretary of the Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities, Maria Giro, will represent the Italian Government in the exhibition hall during the opening ceremony: Italy will be represented in the 264 m2 exhibition space "Punto Italia".
This will be followed by a press conference near the Room Structure in the exhibition hall 5.0 of the book fair: this will be an opportunity to discuss numbers, trends and perspectives around the publishing industry in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of the books of foreign writers is decreasing throughout, but especially in the adult and youth sectors.
A year ago, billionaire Steve Fossett's missing small plane was recovered.
The small plane of Steve Fossett, the billionaire who disappeared on a flight over the desert of Nevada on September 3, 2007, was found.
The items have been found on a high plateau of 3,000 m in height, in the area of the Sierra Nevada Mammoth Lakes between the states of California and Nevada.
There were no human remains inside the aircraft.
The sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, completely disproved the final doubts during a press conference: "The plane has been localized, after which a troop was dispatched. Now we have the assurance that it is the plane that Steve Fossett flew with on the day of his disappearance."
Mr. Anderson also confirmed that no human remains were found in or near the plane.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The U.S. Office of Transportation Safety (Ntsb) noted that just a few hours after the sighting of the aircraft, a crew was sent to identify the aircraft: it was the Bellanca 8kcab, which was lost on September 3, 2007, after Fossett took off on a 3-hour flight in Yerington, Nevada.
Yesterday, some of Fossett’s personal belongings were also found in California, not far from the Nevada border, by a couple near their home at Mammoth Lakes.
These are two passports named Fossetts, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a jacket.
The search for Fossett had been abandoned a month after its disappearance.
The billionaire had conquered a place in history through a long series of records.
In 2002, in the sixth attempt, he was the first man to orbit the globe in a hot air balloon: a two-week, lonely flight.
Three years later, he flew around the world in a single flight without a stopover.
Among his many records is an elevation of 15445 m over the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, The Advertising You Don't Expect
A Suv that falls out of the traditional schemes due to its original design and the special lines, the expansive surface and its clear angles.
With this off-roader, Mercedes-Benz has tried to breathe a new breath into the sector.
It is precisely because of its exceptional characteristics that the presentation of the Suv Glk will be unconventional, which will be on display in the Mercedes-Benz showroom from 17 October.
Thus, the advertising drum, which will accompany the release of the new model, will also appear in a new dress, namely in the form of a 3D campaign – this is a novelty in the automotive sector in backward Italy.
A project with a maximum effort, which will be carried out in various stages, which will occupy the central shopping street of Milan, the Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase will consist of the presentation of the car in shape, with 3D glasses distributed near the Corso Como to give the whole a special look: the new Suv will thus appear in its almost real dimensions as a three-dimensional model.
In fact, the car will seemingly emerge from the poster on which it is depicted.
With the help of Elumina8 technology, the new Glk is then illuminated in all its details at different moments and then put back together as a whole.
Undoubtedly, Mercedes’ concern is to introduce a new kind of car advertising in this rather stereotypical field with this advertisement.
But will it succeed in attracting the interest of future buyers? We will see it.
Now it is clear who the Italian hooligans are
They come from the Triveneto – now they risk stadium ban
Who are these 150-200 boys and girls for whom all of Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the grouping "Ultras Italia", which has been following the Italian national team for years and which, honestly, until recently did not cause any serious problems.
There has never been any clashes with opposing fans.
The origin of the group lies in the right milieu.
The sponsors come from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
Other smaller groups from Campania and Puglia joined them in Sofia.
They wear the tricolori, on which the cities of the militants appear: but these were removed on Saturday to avoid identification.
Her role models are the English fans.
In Bulgaria there was now a clash with a truly right-wing fan scene, that of Levski.
From the Figc, 144 cards for the game were given to Italian fans: all were issued by name and thus easy to control.
In fact, they were also all controlled by the Viminal: among those travelling to Sofia, there was no one with an ongoing stadium banning procedure.
Four fans of the Italian team, who were already pre-loaded in this respect, were also denied the ticket and the trip to Bulgaria.
Now the Viminal is waiting for the reports from the Bulgarian police to take further steps: in this case, the Tifosi arrested or identified in the riots can expect a stadium ban of at least five years.
This is an international ban that prevents access to the stadiums throughout Europe.
So our hooligans will no longer put a foot in a stadium.
Thank goodness.
But now, of course, there is a fear of imitation offenders, who could follow them a little more than 150.
"This fire must be extinguished immediately, and there is no way to justify such behavior," the statement said.
Therefore, "eye on especially also with a view to the game of the national team on Wednesday in Lecce."
In fact, in Puglia there is a small core of the Italian Ultras.
Tomorrow the Osservatorio (Sports Supervisor) will meet, on Tuesday the Casms, which can count on a part of the Aise, i.e. the intelligence services that deal with the problem of stadium violence.
"Duce-duce calls and the raised right arm during the hymn of Mameli? In Bulgaria this is not a crime..."
This is the thought of Domenico Mazzilli (expressed clearly in without joy), who has been the director of the Osservatorio on the Viminal for a few weeks (he took over the post of Francensco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Previously, Mazzilli was the police chief of Trieste, where now a core of supporters of the Ultras Italia founded in 2002 comes from.
It is true, Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not against the law to praise the Duce, but without a doubt the behavior of these 150-200 people was a disgrace.
“I am not a sociologist – adds Osservatorio No. 1 – crimes are punished in the country of their deeds.
Until now, this group had kept themselves in check, but now it is necessary to reconsider what has happened and will happen.
But let us also speak of the whistles during the hymn Mamelis: even this is not a criminal offence, but allow me, there is no education ... ".
