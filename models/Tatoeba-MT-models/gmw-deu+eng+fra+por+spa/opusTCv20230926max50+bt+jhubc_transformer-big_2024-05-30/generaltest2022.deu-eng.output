The goods cost less than 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the value of the goods....
I am #PRS_ORG# big customer and so it is not a problem for me.
Just need a number or instruction what I should include the package so that it can be tracked by you as a return.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>.
Today it costs 179<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>.
I honestly find this very annoying.
Do I have to cancel the order and re-order for the better price or is there another way of crediting?
I also think that children should not be forced to take on a parenting role for their little siblings.
However, I think it is also good for big siblings to take care of the little ones in moderation.
Let's take a look, help, bring the bottle, etc.
In this way, they learn responsibility, help in the family and are involved.
As long as they can still be enough children, I don’t see any problem.
If your K1 is busy alone for the short time and it’s OK for him, that’s good.
You can determine whether this is the best fit for your children.
It is not that he should wrap K2 and accompany him for hours while falling asleep.
Purely legally, it is probably questionable.
Maybe that’s what the psychologist said.
Because if something should actually happen like a fire, burglary, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether this is a risk you want to take is, of course, your discretion ;)
Please help me find the title of a book.
I remember reading a crime/thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the whole plot but the title doesn't want to come to mind...
The story was about fear and how to treat it.
At the beginning of the story, an animal caregiver commits suicide by spilling food and going to his predatory cats.
The case is taken over by a commissioner who, after a short investigation, is sent to his therapist who runs a clinic where he treats anxiety patients.
The Commissioner has a little niece who is also afraid (of fire) and ends up with this therapist.
There are more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned to go to the place of the suicide and document and post the photos on the internet before each suicide.
In any case, it turns out that this therapist runs a kind of underground therapy group where the patient is transplanted a chip that suppresses an anxiety center in the brain and ultimately confronts the patients with their fear in the most extreme way.
(One woman jumps out of the window, another drives intentionally to death)
In the book, this face of fear is referred to as “the fight.”
In the end there is a big showdown in the clinic that had to do with a fire.
This is the rough plot I am quite sure that the book was written in the original by a French author / author.
If this story is known to someone or even someone can tell me the title of the book, I would be delighted.
Oh dear, I don't have the password for the wifi available.
I need to contact my husband first.
But that can take a while.
What steps do I need to take afterwards?
Is it possible to return the price difference?
Child, 4 y., splinter under thumb nail

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
By combining digital decoder and sound module on a printed circuit board, we achieve dimensions of only 30mm x 15.5mm and can therefore be installed in almost any locomotive of track widths H0 and 0.
LokSound 5 decoders are offered with all common interfaces and always come with an 11x15mm "sugar cube" speaker along with the acoustic capsule kit.
Like all family members, the LokSound5 is a true multi-protocol decoder.
He has mastered the DCC data format as well as Motorola<0xC2><0xAE>, Selectrix<0xC2><0xAE> and M4.
In the DCC format, 14 to 128 driving stages are as natural as 2- and 4-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus<0xC2><0xAE>, the decoders register fully automatically at a suitable digital center.
It masters all DCC programming modes and thanks to RailCom<0xC2><0xAE>, the CV values on the main track can be read out with matching centrals.
For central offices that can only program the CVs of 1-255 exist auxiliary registers.
Motorola<0xC2><0xAE> users benefit from up to 28 driving stages at 255 addresses.
Three additional Motorola<0xC2><0xAE> addresses enable the triggering of 16 functions.
A built-in programming mode also enables reprogramming with the venerable Control Unit 6021.
The M4 protocol allows automatic login to mfx<0xC2><0xAE>-compatible control centers.
The LokSound 5 decoder detects Märklin<0xC2><0xAE> braking distances as well as ZIMO<0xC2><0xAE> HLU braking commands or the Lenz<0xC2><0xAE> ABC system.
Braking with DCC brake modules or with DC voltage is also possible.
In addition, it also stops with a Selectrix<0xC2><0xAE> brake diode.
An ABC shuttle train automatic allows automatic commuting between two stations.
The LokSound 5 decoder can be used on analogue DC and AC paths.
After my voucher is no longer renewed due to a complaint that has not been received by me, I will renew my order in the value of approx.

Omikron: Johnson wants to boost boost
New omikron cases are getting politics and science in the UK.
By the New Year, all eligible adults in England should receive a vaccination offer.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to advance even faster than previously planned in the face of rapidly rising omikron numbers.
Every adult in England should have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said in a pre-recorded video message to his compatriots on Sunday evening.
So far, the target date has been at the end of January.
The UK government will provide additional support to accelerate vaccination campaigns in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
One faces an emergency in the face of the omikron variant, which is why vaccination protection needs to be strengthened urgently, Johnson said.
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased again with a third dose of vaccine.
"Let's boost now!" said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 more omikron cases were registered in the UK, bringing the total number to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, this was a whopping 65 percent increase. dpa
will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price at collection?
I am in favour of everyone introducing themselves with pronouns
I sent out an application.
Today the invitation came to an interview by mail.
I want to reply to the email.
But unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but a slightly more complicated name.
I googled him and depending on where he/she has a cultural background it is either a man or a woman.
**I have no idea how to write the email now.
Can anyone help me, please?
** I'm a foreigner and I don't want to kick an official over my feet.
Conclusion: Everyone should introduce themselves with pronouns.
I have a total of 5 books.
4 of them go.
Only the one I bought today can't
Obviously, the chair had an unobtrusive shortage in sales.
How can such an upholstery damage occur after 9 months otherwise?
First tried on the #PRS_ORG#.
But that has been working for about a year.
14 days no more.
So I always bought the last books through the website and then read on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# and wanted to buy 8.
However, there were no more.
Now they are available again and I want you to add 2 chairs to the order and charge me that.
[CW] The feeling when I can't help.
Content Warning: I’m going to write a little bit about domestic violence here.
I just have to write about the soul.
I (21) have more contact with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence for professional reasons.
One topic that really gnaws on me and unfortunately happens far too often is that many victims can not be helped or think we could not help them.
I understand that we can’t do everything and it’s not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than when I can’t do anything in such situations.
I see the bruises, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in a private conversation, with the perpetrator far out of sight and hearing range, I cannot reach everyone.
I don’t know what the reason is, maybe it’s fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the usual social environment, fear of taking the children out of it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, sometimes even very close to the tears, is that everyone is worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don’t just have to accept violence.
Often I wish I could help in any case... I know I can't.
But it will never be easier.
Please, always remember, you are worth living without violence, that is so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What does the series do to "League of Legends"?
Lots of fantasy, lots of complicated names, a breathtaking look: "Arcane", the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, has recently launched on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the already announced two seasons?
Basketball Bundesliga: Derby debacle of MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg at the Merlins Crailsheim
At least Youngster Johannes Patrick was trusted.
Again nothing: For the second time in less than three months, the giants in Crailsheim lost - and how!
Before the match, Ludwigsburg coach John Patrick had said, looking back on the cup defeat at the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim in early October: "We still have a bit of anger in our stomachs."
After the match, however, it did not lie down - but increased again in view of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the basketball Bundesliga.
Even more than the naked result disappointed the way of the appearance.
As a representative, a statistic that expresses the entire dilemma: The triple rate was just 13 percent, 4 hits (all from the young Johannes Patrick) in say and write 31 attempts - still questions?
John Patrick responded, “We just weren’t focused enough after the victory at Tenerife, and didn’t put into practice what we trained.”
To move the ball.
His opponent Sebastian Gleim reacted quite differently: "To win a horny game for the second time against Ludwigsburg," said the happy coach.
"It felt like before 10,000 people".
Only 750 visitors were admitted to the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, but they came at their expense.
Not least because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who marked 22 points and steered the game of his team.
"The best playmaker I've ever trained," Gleim said.
While in Patrick’s team itself, performers like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed on the whole line.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) the giants prevented a total debacle and came up to eight points after they had already backed 39:59.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon also scored 12 points.
Fortunately, there is not much time left to argue.
Already on Wednesday (19 o'clock) the giants welcome the Skyliners Frankfurt, before then also in Ludwigsburg a maximum of 750 spectators.
We used to have a different email address, but I changed it.
Yes, I called a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
We have legally informed ourselves again and have therefore contacted them again.
We initially contacted us half a year ago.
Max Raabe is 59 years old
He is able to inspire his audience with reinterpretations of hits from the 20s and 30s.
He is currently on the road with the program "Good day, dear luck" - if he is allowed to perform.
Actually, Max Raabe would have wanted to celebrate his birthday on the stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But it doesn't turn out to be anything.
The planned concert has been relocated to May 2022 – “on official instructions” to contain the corona virus.
Other of his performances planned in the Advent season must first be cancelled, as it is on the website of the singer, who today turns 59, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
From January onwards, the artists will then want to catch up with their dates already postponed in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962 in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe sang a lot as a teenager.
In Berlin he studied opera singing, in 1986 he founded the Palast Orchester together with fellow students.
Since then, the baritone has established itself with its repertoire of hits and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He has been awarded awards many times.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his successful album "Für Frauen ist das kein Problem" (2013) - second place in the charts.
He made it out of the niche into the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, the blonde hair strictly combed back and focused on etiquette, Max Raabe is indispensable from the current German-speaking music landscape.
With the program "Good day, dear luck" he has been on tour since 2020. dpa

Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz: Expropriation does not create a new apartment
The new Federal construction minister Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing companies, as was demanded in a referendum in Berlin.
"With an expropriation, not a single new apartment is created, it only changes the ownership structure," Geywitz said in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants confidence that their rent will remain affordable in the next few years.
By the way, a colorful mix of private landlords, cooperatives or housing companies is the best protection against monopoly formation.
In Berlin, the coalition of the SPD, the Greens and the Left Party wants to establish an expert commission on how to deal with the result of the referendum.
However, if the situation does not relax, Geywitz did not exclude talks with the FDP in the traffic lights coalition about further tightening of the lease law.
The coalition agreement provides for a rental price brake until 2029, a limitation of rent increases in tense housing markets and the expansion of the rental level.
I will talk to the Minister of Justice to implement this as soon as possible.
If the rental market nevertheless does not relax, "we will talk with the coalition partners about further steps," stressed the SPD politician.

At least 100 dead from tornadoes in Kentucky
In a devastating storm system, numerous tornadoes have travelled through the United States.
In Kentucky alone, there could be more than 100 deaths.
The pictures from there remind me of a war zone.
On the night of Saturday, several tornadoes in the United States caused serious devastation and possibly up to a hundred deaths.
The storms leave a roughly 320-kilometre-long trail of devastation, especially in Kentucky.
Its governor Andy Beshear said after a visit to the disaster area, wherever the tornado was seized, everything was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just away.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this is possible at all.
It counts up to 100 deaths in Kentucky alone, with official figures rising every hour.
Hello, I just saw that she displaycase #NAME# is sold out.
That's a pity.
Is it still produced?
Or is it completely out of the assortment?
Is it possible to order this showcase in another country?
until when do you get in touch?
If the delivery cannot be made to my apartment, I have to cancel the order !
I understand, but can I order the blanket now and have it delivered to Germany, which is in the shopping cart?
I had returned an article via the contact form or left a return and wanted to inquire if this was received or processed, as I have not yet received a confirmation.
Companies pay vaccination premiums and change advertising slogans
While the Federal Government continues to reject the proposals for a vaccination premium, companies in Austria have taken the initiative and offer their employees money premiums for vaccination.
They are thus in line with the social partners <0xC3><0x96>GB and the Chamber of Commerce, who today demanded financial incentives for vaccination.
The transformation of advertising slogans into vaccination calls - following the German model - should also increase the willingness to take corona vaccinations.
He moved into a company he blasphemed about.

Obviously, he didn't stitch himself to his old place and was looking for something else.
You're allowed to.
And that he didn't like you at the time: well, it doesn't matter.
He didn’t like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please accept the cancellation.
This will be legally relevant.

Help with your first campaign
Boron to hello!
I’m currently leading the adventure Over the Greifen Pass for a group of 4 friends and want to seamlessly lead my heroes into a campaign written specifically for the players.
We are playing DSA 5.
The big bow is made, the villains and their motivations written, the individual files devised and now I am in the process of writing the entry adventure and stumble upon my own feet already at the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes are to bring a carriage with grain from ridge rock to a small village near Lake Thuran.
There, the further action is to develop.
A few miles from the village, a group of goblins is supposed to be waiting for the heroes and lure them into an ambush.
I want to give the player characters the opportunity to solve the confrontation in different ways: convincing, acting, threatening, recognizing the danger at an early stage, whatever the players come up with.
Group strength: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 armed with spears, 6 armed with bows and sabres
If they do not notice, the goblins lurk at the hero in a hollow path and flank the vehicle armed with three bows on the left and right, while two with spears stop the vehicle.
If the heroes fall into battle, I have two solutions.
The heroes are all found unconscious and then healed by the son of the village school, a half eleven.
The cart is gone, of course.
If a defeat should be inevitable, this same half-elf intervenes with two of his servants and comes to the hero’s aid in the battle.
The cart is still there, everything is great.
How appropriate do you think Deus ex Machina of Solution 2?
Is the Encounter too much to start an adventure?
The group of goblins will play a decisive role later on, so it is not just cannon food.
EDIT: wow, I didn’t expect so many answers, especially not so many great suggestions and tips.
I’m sure I’ll take many of your ideas to heart and now I have more confidence in my narratives.
I assembled the lamp again.
And put it together again.
Unfortunately, it still does not work.
That's why I'd still like to send them back
If you can then send me the receipts, then I can pack the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG#.

I am annoyed by Sky Sport F1
Hello dear F1 fans, over the course of the season the quality on the German Sky has decreased more and more, so I want to take some breath with this post.
First of all, today in the middle of the F2 race, the transmission was cancelled in order to start F1 pre-reporting on time.
Although due to the delayed start and the start accident, the schedule was far behind schedule, but you could still have shown the last (planned) ten minutes as well as the championship decision (!).
Apparently, however, for legal reasons, F1 has priority and therefore has to limit everything else, so Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Still stupid, especially since Sky UK transferred the race to the end.
Nevertheless, a little praise: commentator Olivier Zwartyes has accompanied the difficult situation around the serious accident well.
Then there was again a lack of rules in F1 with the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both did not know that you can change the tyres under a red flag.
Although this situation already existed in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both came to the decision that Verstappen was allowed to change the tyres only when there were corresponding radio announcements on the subject to Hamilton.
At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators immediately knew that Verstappen had this opportunity.
I think such basic rules should be known when commenting on F1 on a pay TV channel.
It is also not the first guess, which is now possible or prescribed by rules, both simply have constant uncertainties about rules.
In general, I don't like the artificial commentary style of Roos, but admit that it's a matter of taste.
But I really like Heiko Water from RTL.
In addition, there are constant sillynesses that both seem unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from (also unsuspecting) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "Uuuuu HD" by Ralf Schumacher.
Especially the latter brings a lot of unrest into the comment, which he apparently does not take seriously.
Last but not least, the advertising is simply taking over at Sky, in the run-off round, Sky is the only channel that goes into advertising, as you can listen to on F1TV as only the German audio track has to get through without commenting directly after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.
Also, these two channels make less advertising in the trainings than Sky, and that as free TV channels.
Although you have to praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, that alone does not let me overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of the Sky Sport F1 program is also very poor and full of repetitions.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-language station to broadcast the F1.
Unironic makes RTL a better job at the four races that they are still allowed to transfer, except for the advertising.
So in any case, the grandiose F1 season is much less fun than it would be possible with a reasonable transmitter.
I'd be interested in your opinion.
To the here: #PRS_ORG# pendant lamp, brass and multicoloured glass x 1
Hello, I have an item that should be delivered last week and that is still not delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and so far nothing.
The first lady told me it would be sent on Monday, the second lady told me yesterday that she would check and send an email and she never answered.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of them has already had a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric has a hole on the front part of the chair).
I'm asking for support.
Fan pumps are ideal for supplying an aquarium with oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via air lifters.
This series is offered in 3 variants by us.
Look at the table at the end of the listing.
There you can see the benefits in comparison.
If the pumps are strong enough, you can operate entire plants with them.
If you have a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outputs are suitable for connecting multiple outlets.
The MK series has one, two or four outputs, depending on the model fan pump, but also offer to put an accent in the aquarium, e.g. with an air curtain (you can find in our shop) or with a decor, which convert the air bubbles into a function.
Here would be a treasure chest, shell or something like that.
The MK series has a special, sound-insulated construction, ensuring low operating noise.
The installation is very simple.
The fan pump is connected by means of an air hose 4/6 mm to an outflower or the like... and it can start now.
The fan pump should be the same or higher than the water level and be installed outside.
If the fan pump is lower than the water level, a check valve should be placed in between.
Simply cut through the air hose and place the valve in between.
This would prevent if once water was running backwards, the water from the pool would run through the pump...
If the fan pump is installed outdoors, it should be covered and protected from moisture, like other air pumps
The MK series pumps are pure power packs that consume little energy
Even if we specify here in ebay the processing time with 3 days, so packed daily and the parcels are picked up here also daily.
If everything goes well on the way, it goes very fast.
We just want to prevent a little bit so that no one is upset just because it took a little longer.
It would be the case, not everyone has understanding for the whole employees who also work in the forwarding industry... of course here no corona stops.
Please do not rate badly just because the delivery is delayed, this is solely due to the parcel services.
Of course, you like to talk about these services, even if we say at the moment...they are having a hard time.
This is also very different regionally.
Don’t be angry with anyone, stay healthy and we all hope that there will be better times.
how long does it take to order the yellow with and without armrest?
Can you order your legs in light here?
Amazon Founder Bezo Sends Astronaut Daughter and Moderator to Space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV presenter and four other passengers have taken a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday by the rocket system "New Shepard" of the company Blue Origin by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The take-off and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the US state of Texas.
Under bright blue skies, Bezos personally welcomed the newly chosen astronauts upon their return.
"Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue space suit as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
Under the applause of Blue Origin’s friends, family and employees, the six passengers gradually climbed out and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were on the road for 10 minutes and 13 seconds, reaching an altitude of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of NASA astronaut Alan Shepard (1923-1998), named after Blue Origin's rocket system, and 50-year-old TV presenter Michael Strahan were honorary guests of the company, the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, its investor Evan Dick, and technology entrepreneur Be Lane.
How much they each paid for their ticket, Blue Origin did not disclose.
Laura Shepard Churchley recalled her father’s mission after the short flight.
He had to work hard on his assignments and do everything himself.
She was just flying along, the 74-year-old said with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also expressed his enthusiasm.
He would like to return to space, the moderator said.
"New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometers
The "New Shepard" missile system flies largely automated.
The capsule, which was detached from the rocket during the flight, reached a height of about 100 kilometers above Earth, at times with zero gravity, before the reusable object landed again braked by large parachutes.
The International Aviation Association and many other experts see 100 kilometers above Earth as a border to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already Blue Origin’s third manned all-around trip: on the first in July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
The second in October included 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became world-famous for his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek," as well as former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries and Blue Origin's deputy boss, Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of pushing the business of space tourism largely without scientific research interests for the good of humanity and without regard to the climate.

Someone who works in biochemistry or has studied biochemistry
I am currently studying biochemistry in the first semester and find the subject in itself quite exciting and also in the lab is not bothering me (have already the inorganic chemistry internship behind me).
Of course, I had already informed myself about career prospects before studying, but I also thought at the time that I definitely would like to study until the doctorate.
At the moment, however, I have doubts, especially about my career prospects.
On the one hand (studycheck etc) you hear again and again great career opportunities and the profession is totally wanted, on the other hand you hear again and again of unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid jobs.
That's why I'd be really interested:
1) What are you currently working on?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/salary?
3) What did you study/ What education did you take?
4) Would you do it all again?
Thank you for your replies!
I am really insecure at the moment and may be considering discontinuing my studies in 2022 and completing an apprenticeship as a computer scientist.
If you have any experiences, you would like to write them too :)
Extra stress before holidays & holiday weekends
This topic came up to me last week.
But now I had to use my long weekend to relax.
That's why it's just a post now.
Not only before big holidays, such as the Christmas holidays, there is great stress in our company.
As it seems, there are also before holidays plus bridge days.
It was like this: Last week was the Assumption of Mary, which is called "ascension" in Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and businesses make a bridge day, which is therefore semi-official.
So last week there was a long 4-day weekend in the house.
So what happened last week?
Everywhere stress.
Loud e-mails, which absolutely had to be out before the driveway, order here order there, everything *absolutely * before the long weekend.
Because... yes because?
Because "next week then" sounds like so much time and that shouldn't be?
Or because people seriously want to do as much in a shortened week as they do in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but I was also very annoyed.
What is this self-hosting about holidays?
Why do we have holidays if we can’t treat them properly?!
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all quite independent.
My question is simple: are only we, the Swiss?
Is this our reformed-evangelical way?
Or do you know that in the North?
Yvonne Catterfeld looks forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian home - but has no gifts yet.
"The beauty, even if there should be no snow in Erfurt, then you simply drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will get ready for the party by baking and crafting cookies with her son.
"I love that," Catterfeld said.
But until the contemplative days, she still has a lot to do: "For the first time I have no gifts yet, I have to finally get started".
NEKTON-Bio supports the smooth running of the Mauser and the newly formed feather.
NEKTON-Bio contains all the essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 <0xCE><0xBC>g of biotin/kg.
NEKTON organic gives the bird a smooth and shiny plumage.
The majority of plumage damage occurring in bird husbandry is due exclusively to nutritional errors.
Since the plumage consists of protein-containing substance, a particularly rich and balanced protein nutrition of the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of a flawless plumage.
For a functioning metabolism, daily food must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
Most of the animal losses that occur during the mice are due to insufficient or imbalanced protein intake and/or insufficient supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON organic, the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant-based feed is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
No further vitamin supplement should be administered during the use of NEKTON-Bio.
NEKTON-Bio is cold water soluble and can be easily administered via drinking water or soft food.
Thank you, I found it
Unfortunately, it still does not work
GDR-Handarbeitsmodell Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the locomotive was used in Silesia and central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably comes from the conversion proposal of the model railway ME Issue 11/1968, used with game tracks and missing parts see photos, function well, the construction series E 95 is also a heavy freight train electric locomotive for the German
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and we are working on it
In 1924, the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft commissioned the AEG to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that could carry 2,200-tonne coal trains and 530-tonne passenger trains at 45 km/h of cruise speed on this route.
The maximum speed required was 65 km/h.
Thus, in March 1926, via the delivery as 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with AEG bearing drive with the delivery of the mechanical part, the DRG determined the Siemens-Schuckertwerke with the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which received operating numbers E 95 01-06.
All survived World War II and then found themselves on the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives entered the Soviet Union as reparations.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
In the Reichsbahnausbesserungswerk Dessau, the dignity of all six locomotives was determined.
[4] As a result of the progressive reelectrification of the central German network, there was an increasing need for locomotives for the heavy goods train service, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were refurbished in 1959, with the remaining machines serving as spare parts dispensers.
First, the E 04, E 44 and E 94, which are present in larger numbers, were preferably constructed.
Only when it was foreseeable at the E 94 that the reworking number could not be increased further, the E 95 came into the focus of the reworking.
[4] Initially, the locomotives were stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren railway plant.
They joined the railway plant Halle P in 1960.
They were mostly used in a separate circulation plan before coal trains from the Geiseltal towards Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
The complicated control of the locomotives proved to be problematic with increasing age.
For example, it was often the case that gunshots remained glued during switching actions.
Then the passenger, who was constantly driving on this locomotive with a hammer and a wooden wedge, had to untie the gunner again during the ride.
Damage to the driving engines occurred more often and resulted in months-long downtimes in the locomotive.
[5] As at the end of the 1960s there were enough new construction locomotives and a significant expansion of the electrical operation was not planned at the time, the Reichsbahn was able to dispense with old locomotives and with most splitter locomotives, so that the E 95 were put out of service.
In addition, the Deutsche Reichsbahn wanted to occupy electric locomotives only on a one-man basis, which would have caused a problem in the train operation due to the aforementioned difficulties with the machines and the visibility conditions of the driver's cabin.
[5] After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were dismantled in mid-1969, the last to follow them was the E 95 01, which resigned on October 5, 1970.
The new designation 255 001 was never used.
Except for the E 95 02, all locomotives were dismantled.
The E 95 02 was installed as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a switch heating system on the main station Halle.
It took some time before the managers of the Reichsbahn could be convinced that the E 95 was worth preserving as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the initial external reworking of the locomotive began with the aim of presenting it to a vehicle show in the RAW Dessau.
[5] Since then, it has belonged to the Verkehrsmuseum Dresden as an inoperable museum locomotive.
In 1986, the internal completion of the locomotive took place.
In the DB Museum Halle (Saale) the locomotive is supervised museally.
Since 1995, employees of the traditional community Bw Halle P have been working on the operational refurbishment of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time at an exhibition in the Museums-Bw Arnstadt with new inner and outer paintwork, with the transformers being inspected and five driving motors being operational.
-The locomotives were in use on the Silesian Mountain Railway and the branching sidelines until 1945, where they proved their worth due to their reliable drive and low maintenance.
In February 1945, the machines were relocated to Leipzig to the central German network.
The main area of operation was Silesia.
Handmade model H0 in OVP, function well, optical reworking of the locomotive is necessary in-house, dusted, with play tracks, cellar smell !!!, very rare handmade model, very small run- possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packaging may have labels and storage marks.
Yes, the F-parts are
I got a bed from you.
However, there were problems with one part.
The center beam is held by two feet..unfortunately these are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What do we do now?
I can't make the bed.
The center beam is held by two feet, which are unfortunately produced incorrectly.
The center beam does not fit into the intended bracket.
So I get new ones sent.
When will they be sent out?
No, no flats.
These are, according to the assembly instructions, the right ones from the shape, they were just too narrow
But it doesn't matter.
The main thing is that they fulfill their purpose
With me they are not flat
Could I get them sent to me?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem to you again?
House fire with two lightly injured and high damage
Two people were slightly injured in a fire in a residential building in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated damage in the six-digit euro area has occurred, as the police announced on Sunday.
The fire had probably spread from a carport to the adjacent residential building in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech district).
Two residents were reportedly taken to the hospital on Sunday with slight smoke poisoning.
The exact cause of the fire was not known at first, but the police did not assume that the fire was intentional.
Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigation.
But it will arrive much later.
And I have to pay shipping costs again
To Refute Fake News - Biontech CEO Releases Vaccine Photo
U<0xC4><0x9F>ur <0xC5><0x9E>ahin published a photo of his first vaccination in early 2021 on the social network "LinkedIn"
Biontech CEO U<0xC4><0x9F>ur <0xC5><0x9E>ahin has not yet publicly commented on his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur published a photo showing his corona vaccine.
The illness of a friend moved him to do so, <0xC5><0x9E>ahin said.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company Biontech, U<0xC4><0x9F>ur <0xC5><0x9E>ahin, has published a photo showing how to get vaccinated against the coronavirus.
There was misinformation on social media that I was allegedly not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I received 3 doses of the Biontech Pfizer vaccine," <0xC5><0x9E>ahin wrote in a post on the network "LinkedIn".
"For a few months, friends have been urging me to post a photo of me on which I will be vaccinated to counteract these false rumors".
So far, he has refused because the communication should not revolve around himself.
But a phone call last week changed his mind: “I was deeply saddened when I learned that an old school friend of mine is currently struggling for his life.
He is fighting a serious Covid-19 disease and has been hanging from a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, <0xC5><0x9E>ahin continued.
He did not ask the reasons.
"The most common cause, however, seems to be anxiety, which is often fueled by misinformation and mistrust".
Anxiety is difficult to combat with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
An interview with Deutsche Welle circulates on the Internet, in which U<0xC4><0x9F>ur <0xC5><0x9E>ahin says he has not been vaccinated.
However, the video was made in December 2020, as Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
"I am currently legally not allowed to get the vaccine myself," <0xC5><0x9E>ahin said at the time.
There is a priority in Germany in the vaccination of the vaccine.
In the meantime, the priority has long been lifted - and the Biontech CEO has been vaccinated three times, according to his own statements.
Fire in substation: Tens of thousands of people without electricity
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the lights went out on Friday evening: no more electricity and in many cases probably no heating.
A fire had paralyzed a substation.
After a fire with serious damage in a substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhine-Sieg-Kreis in North Rhine-Westphalia have had to live without electricity for about 24 hours.
As a result of the fire, 41,000 affected residents in several municipalities went out on Friday evening.
The utility Westnetz reported that numerous emergency power units were in operation on Saturday until the large-scale disturbance was finally completely fixed in the late evening.
Firefighters and helpers of the THW provided support in the municipalities.
The authorities offered childcare places in schools and called for neighbourhood assistance.
The supplier thanked those affected for their patience and the helpers for their efforts.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant constraints.
We would also like to thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire brigades and the THW for their tireless efforts," said Florian Witt, head of primary technology, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage will take a few days, as the Westnetz mechanics could initially only temporarily put some lines back into operation, he explained.
According to the company, a technical defect led to the fire.
Electricity is flowing again
According to Westnetz, the fire that broke out on Friday around 7:15 p.m. severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear at the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation.
There, expensive cleaning and repair work is required.
At the same time, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level was created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is restored.
Since Saturday 6 p.m., more than 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity again.
A further 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually switched over from 9:30 p.m.
Since 11:15 p.m., the last people affected by the failure also had electricity.
More than 80 installers from Westnetz and partner companies were in use.
After the establishment of an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon, the authorities also called for neighbourhood aid.
"It is now important that citizens take care of elderly or single people in their neighbourhood and inform the local fire engine houses if help is needed," said CDU Landrat Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
When setting up and operating emergency power generators, the focus was primarily on residents of retirement homes.
In addition, according to authorities, temporary care places in schools were set up for those people who could not provide for themselves or who need power-dependent medical devices or rely on medical care.

Yes, that's really easier!
Then let's do it like this!
Do you send me the return receipt by mail?
The repair is now complete.
I tried this before the chat.
Before I bought, however, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
You want me to do that now?
I find such a low credit almost outrageous.

To make the paint application even and clean, you should clean the components with some soapy water from dust, grease and fingerprints, rinse with clear water and dry.
Before applying a new paint to the brush for the first time, it is advisable to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the inside of the components that will later no longer be visible or on a yogurt cup.
The first line on the component
Draw the brush evenly next to the line.
Slight overlap of the paint layers later ensures a uniform surface.
Avoid swiping back and forth with the brush.
This creates unrealistic-looking surfaces.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the bright colors.
Otherwise, the dark ones could shine through later.
Metal tones and metallic colors come to an end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, it can lead to unsightly metal streaks if they mix with normal colors.
Allow the painted parts to dry for a day before plastering them.
The models achieve true appearance through the decals or decals.
From emblems on airplanes to ship names to trim strips and license plates on car models: the decals give the model the finishing touches.
Place the decals in the correct order as long as the components are still easy to reach.
An aircraft cockpit can be glued or easier before it is installed in the fuselage.
Even more important than the right tool such as scissors, tweezers and toothpicks are when sticking time, patience and a quiet hand.
Cut out each needed decal individually and set it up.
Decals are also called water slide pictures because you briefly moisten their backs with water until the carrier paper darkens through the wet.
Then you push the image only a small piece of paper and place the piece in the appropriate place on the model (which you also moistened before).
While holding the decal on the model with a tool, pull the carrier paper away from the side.
Attention: Always check if the picture fits correctly before pushing it completely off the paper, so that it does not stick to the finger, wrinkle or even tear.
Vacuum excess water with a household towel.
Not suitable for children under 3 years of age
I can only open a book briefly, as soon as I look for something else then I no longer read the book and have to unsubscribe and log in and reload the book and look for the place where I have read.
I have already communicated with you on Saturday.
Can I get this via email?
Also for all three packages?
Because the lamp arrived in 3 individual packages to me
ok thank you anyway!
Then I will buy somewhere else as soon as the money is back.
Can I get it back without any problems?
PKV / What is an "insurance case"?
Hello together,
we were some time in fertility treatment, now when it comes to the settlement with the PKV, it suddenly crosses.
In order of succession:
We had applied for the kinderwunschbahndlung in advance with the PKV and got the pledge over 3 attempts.
The experiments were not restricted in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first experiment led directly to successful pregnancy and childbirth and was settled with the PCV.
Some time later we tried to have a second child, and carried out 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but they did not yet settle for the PCV.
We again applied for the costs to the PKV and were again granted 3 further attempts.
After a few more attempts (we did more attempts than promised, logically calculating the most expensive with the PKV) we submitted the invoices to the PKV and got the nasty surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2 + 3), the PKV wants to refund only 3 attempts.
The reason: With the pregnancy/birth, the remaining 2 attempts of the first promise expire.
The second child is a new insurance case.
However, according to the AGB, "the insurance case starts with the treatment, it ends when the need for treatment no longer exists."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
* Who is right here to refund the PKV (only 3 attempts) or we (there are 5 attempts to refund)?
* Should the PKV have told us in the promises that with a birth the further attempts expire?
Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
The infertility (due to closed fallopian tubes) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here would give your opinion.
Thank you very much for your help!
Can you send me the three variants by email and tell me how to get back to them?
All right, all right.
We're not going to order anything from them anymore.
If they add up the sales of me and my friend #NAME# (same address), they’ve obviously lost good customer.
You are welcome to share this with your manager.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday, the colleague told me that the repayment had been initiated and now you tell me that I have to return the thing first.
I can't wait for the dresser to arrive at me completely disturbed
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague wrote
It is clear that the repayment was initiated and I still have not received a repayment via #PRS_ORG#
You can tell your manager that you have now lost two regular customers.
My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment through his account.
We're not going to do that anymore.
No, the defect has only occurred after a few months.
An office chair must endure normal use.
Otherwise, they can't sell it as an office chair.
Regardless, the warranty of 24 months applies.
No, it is not possible for me to get another type of packaging.
I will be able to dismantle the cabinet and make it available to the transport company.
Hello, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products are advertised with additional stools to be purchased, but unfortunately we cannot find these with you.
Can they help?
Topic of the Week: The Best Low Budget Movies
What a low-budget movie is exactly, there is no general definition with exact budget limits.
Wikipedia has the following to say about it:
>A **low-budget film** or **low-budget movie** is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
On the web you can find plenty of lists of low-budget movies, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What do you like about it?
And what might you not like at all?
I am a very good customer of you, have already furnished 2 apartments complete with your furniture.
I wanted to ask the best price for the grey leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended again, is it now also reliable?
Thank you!
With kind regards
If there is no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30min is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position... I will give up soon again, because it just doesn't work here.
Hallo!
"Half-way victory" against Belarus involves high costs for the EU
According to political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can announce a "half victory" in conflict with the Belarusian regime.
But the costs were very high and meant massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees in Belarus' border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU has not solved the confrontation sustainably, said the researcher of the Berlin Foundation for Science and Policy (SWP).
This stagnation - Belarus does not give in very small, but the EU feels like a winner - probably continues for a while.
Dealing with the people at the border is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong said.
There seems to be an “increasing normalization of pushbacks” by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole is not resolutely opposed, this is at the expense of fundamental rights.
At the same time, this development weakens cohesion in the Union.
"It doesn't seem to be able to prevail if a member state wants to do its thing," as is currently the case with Poland, which doesn't even allow the EU Border Protection Agency Frontex access to the border.
In addition, the EU is paying another price for its policy at the border with Belarus, Bossong said: A principle agreement on the asylum policy will be made more difficult, since the line "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Another attempt at crossing the border
According to Poland’s border guards, migrants have once again attempted to cross Belarus into Polish territory.
Fifty-five migrants were detained at night on Sunday and brought back to the border, a spokeswoman for the agency said on Sunday.
The Polish officials were stoned by the migrants in the incident not far from the town of Czeremsza.
According to the reports, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be treated by a military doctor.
A total of 52 attempted border crossings were registered within 24 hours.
As early as Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had crossed the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries like Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed or tried to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko as the leader in Minsk of enticing them with the prospect of entering the EU.
Poland and Lithuania, according to press reports, closed off border sections.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines bringing migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU Commissioners travelled to countries of origin of the people in order to prevent departures there.
The most effective element of the EU response is pressure on airlines, Bossong said.
"The EU has thrown its market power into the balance and demonstrated its determination to operate with tough bandages and extraterritorial sanctions."
Minsk must also take into account domestic policy costs.
The Belarusian society is probably not prepared for the security apparatus regularly sweeping thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes Protests After Controversial Formula 1 Final
Max Verstappen is said to have committed two violations of the rules during the race.
Abu Dhabi – After the controversial Formula 1 final of Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has filed an appeal.
The silver arrows suspect two breaches of the rules in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to an alleged breach by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull in the last safety car phase, when he is said to have overtaken illegally.
A second objection was filed against the ranking at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes, the protocol was not complied with.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton on the last lap in the Mercedes and had rushed to his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase in which the Dutchman had overtaken cars in front of him.
I'll check it out.
I'll talk to the bank and report back to you
Thanks for the support
Free admission for members: Europa-Park organizes SC-Freiburg-Fantag

Members and season ticket holders of the Sport-Club from Breisgau as well as members of the fan community were allowed to visit Europa-Park for free on this day.
In addition, there were vouchers for drinks and sausages.
The roller coaster trains glowed red and white through the jerseys that day.
Füchsle, Ed Euromaus and a lot of red and white balloons provided the perfect backdrop," says the park.
The cooperation between the Bundesliga and the amusement park in Rust, 40 kilometers north of Freiburg, has been in place since the early 1990s.
At the first SC Freiburg Fantag in Europa-Park, it was once again shown how well the partnership fits.
Seeing radiant fans having fun in the roller coaster together confirms this,” says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.

My question would be whether my request has been received.
Not everyone has time for your mad chat and incorrectly delivered cheap goods from China.
Your mistake that you fix and not all from our household.
Contact Mrs. #NAME#.
I can't chat with them every day
We chatted yesterday and agreed that I or Mrs. #NAME# would receive an email with a 60 Euro voucher, a reorder of the #PRS_ORG# bedside table and a return label.
This email has not yet arrived.
The package wants to bring to #PRS_ORG# today.
Please contact me

I'm sorry, but just because he says he's not an anti-Semite doesn't mean anything.
It’s like a foreigner says he has nothing against foreigners.
Both of you will not admit it.
But Kollegah is constantly reproducing any anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself, then you should just leave it completely.
Yes wow then you are not as serious as Kollegah.
Those who seriously question evolution are simply completely lost.
Because of me, a God has done it all.
But once you are a creationist, you have to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and that science is just making nonsense.
And with that you are an enemy of science and not to be taken seriously like Kollegah
To obtain an optimal field of view, the magnifying glass should be approached as close to the eye as possible.
The specially designed aplanatically-achromatic lens system allows you to use the magnifying glass up to the edge zone practically without any errors in terms of classification and color.
Often magnifying glasses are marked with magnification information.
However, this information only applies to precisely defined conditions that rarely correspond to the conditions of use.
To make the most of your magnifying glass, please follow the instructions in the table "Technical data" (see instructions in the package).
Light reflections are produced on the lens surfaces of all optical devices, including impact magnifiers.
By means of an anti-reflective coating, these reflections are significantly reduced.
If the optimal conditions of use are met - a magnifying glass close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.
Further information can be found in the enclosed instructions for use (available in German and English).

Pine sale in Schönwolde: In the municipality of Krembz, women choose the Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has already experienced so many curious situations during the sale of fir trees.
One day, a man would have driven home even without his partner, because both could not agree.
Each year, he plants more than 2,000 plants.
The 56-year-old has already experienced so many strange situations.
That always makes the pre-Christmas season a little funny, he says.
What about the voucher??
Or am I gone as a customer?
After all, I received a defective delivery and now paid the full price for it.
Then I will evaluate it accordingly!
We do not need to discuss the better court here, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating skewer.
Both have their name.
In German, an equivalent might be something like the "turner", which doesn't sound so tasty.
Problems with Fiber + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have a new fiber optic connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I now have trouble building a stable wifi network.
Previously, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and I used Devolo DLan, which received and broadcast 50 Mbit without problems except for a few failures.
The new fiber optic connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox, also arrives.
However, the other DLan module, which emits the Wifi, no longer reaches the full 500, but the further I move away in the house with the module, the less arrives (i.e. use a socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This means that with the new fiber connection, the Internet is now even slower on the first floor than before (<0x5C><0x7E>45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic set, which seems to use a new technology.
Although this was slightly better than the DLan, there were similarly large losses here.
Could someone explain to me why fiber optics "lose" so much internet speed over the power line?
Is LAN really the solution?
It would be extremely expensive to install LAN cables in the house.
I am really desperate, which is why I have created an account here.
That is why I would be all the more pleased to receive an answer.
When it is time to change the checking account
Anyone who would have thought that the checking accounts were quiet for the first time would be fooled.
While many banks have used the autumn to have their customers confirm the fee increases of the past with all kinds of tricks, the free amounts for negative interest rates also continue to fall.
Deutsche Bank, for example, was considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros for a long time.
Now she has just halved the allowance amount and even quartered for the daily allowance.
In a first step, the limit was reduced only for customers of the Group division Postbank - to 50,000 euros for current accounts and investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for daily money accounts.
Meanwhile, however, these lower allowances apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesperson confirmed on request.
Not only for new contracts, but also for "new individual agreements with existing customers".
Commerzbank had already fallen to a limit of 50,000 euros, which still applies, as with ING Germany.
The direct bank DKB, which is particularly popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the allowances in two stages, initially to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
After all, more than 100 banks now have an allowance of 25,000 euros or less, according to figures from the internet portal Verivox.
Sparda-Bank Berlin has also reached 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centers, which in the first instance have even gotten right against this regulation before the Regional Court of Berlin.
Now it is already being discussed in the banks whether the institutions should possibly make provisions - in the event that the upper authorities also declare the negative interest rates in principle inadmissible and many millions have to be repaid to bank customers.

Jennifer Aniston Employs an Entire Beauty Army
It is now officially at the forefront of Hollywood.
But their life is like a mountain and a descent.
Jennifer Aniston, 52, was voted the most influential woman of the year by The Hollywood Reporter magazine.
For them, who made furore in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of their series "The Morning Show", this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and work.
A whole army of assistants, stylists and trainers will take care of their appearance.
After all, according to Aniston, she would treat herself to a chip a day (yes, correctly read: a ONE chip from the bag).
The fact that the hearts of female and male fans still fly towards her is actually a miracle.
Maybe because she’s just unlucky with luck – and still looking for great love.
And the baby wish has been deleted from the list.
She was always asked when she would become a mother.
That hurt her.
The people who asked this have no idea what's going on with me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really hurtful.
Hopefully, success and fame will also make you happy.
Unworthy end of a career: Räikkönen must give up
Kimi Räikkönen’s farewell to Formula 1 was even quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped his sweat off his forehead.
That's it.
After a driving error and a slight tyre touch, Räikkönen had to turn off his Alfa Romeo at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after less than half the race distance.
It was his 349th and final Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ended his career in the motorsport royal class.
His wife Minttu and the two children had also travelled to the United Arab Emirates to say goodbye.
Räikkönen's biggest success was winning the 2007 Ferrari World Championship.
He achieved 21 Grand Prix wins, started 18 times from the pole and came on the podium 103 times. dpa
Friedrich wins 60th World Cup - Nolte wins in the Zweierbob - Sport
The brand of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the bob pilot.
"I've figured this out once, I'd have to win nine and a half per season, then I could make it to Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who recorded two successes in two days at the races in Winterberg.
Only on Saturday did he defeat the attack by Johannes Lochner by five hundredths, in which he drove from third place to one.
Then he changed a bit on the material setting and drove out a bigger lead with 0.30 seconds on Sunday.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle) he prevailed over the British Brad Hall.
Third was the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
"We took a bigger risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also entered his 22nd victory in series.
The Berchtesgadener Johannes Lochner, who is driving for Stuttgart, came in second place this time before in fifth place.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach finished fourth in the first race in eighth place.
"If I knew what he was doing differently, I would do it that way," Lochner said.
Nolte with home win - podium for Jamanka
Laura Nolte scored her third win of the season in the Zweierbob with the women on her home track.
After it was only enough for fourth place in the Monobob the day before, she rushed to the World Cup victory on Sunday at the German triple success with pusher Deborah Levi.
Two-time Olympic Bob Champion Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thuringia finished second with Germany’s fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
In addition to her Olympic qualification, she took the first podium place this winter.
The Wiesbadener Kim Kalicki ended up in third place with Leonie Fiebig.
For me it was super cool, first podium in the World Cup, I am super happy that Mariama takes me.
I am super happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay," said Burghardt, stressing: "It is not only pushing, but there is also a lot to do around it."
Jamanka was a little annoyed about the not completely flawless rides, but said: "It's going in the right direction".
I already had the blanket in my shopping cart and could buy it now!!!
What am I supposed to do?
I just did not receive it and therefore can not redeem why I finally asked for it.
Because of Corona last year, I had quite different problems and never had time for it.
And now it was said that he had expired, which annoyed me very much.
Look in the chat it was about the Asare bench.
I would like to return it and then order again as it has just been reduced :)
Why is shipping only started on March 16th?
There was nothing of such a long delivery time on your website
No, only when I tap comes an extra field with the message
Was taken yesterday by your colleague.
Why is this a problem today
I also sent you pictures of the wrongly delivered goods.
But we still want the shelf module, just a new undamaged
And not cancel the whole order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello dear great girls and girls and women,
I have a few things I just want to write and maybe some of them...
I am 24, have kPTBS, full-time student and dog mom - aside from my dog not screaming or going to kindergarten he is actually 1 to 1 my child.
My boyfriend (since 6 years together) is sick, got a 2nd grade burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I still have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we cuddled a lot and it was beautiful.
I helped him shower (because his hand is in the bandage wg burn).
It is also cooled and we currently see each other less (1-2x week), which makes me very concerned with my needs for affection and love.
My dog child just got stomachache, I cooked for him and now he lies in his cuddly blanket and has relaxed a bit after I was there with the heat lamp and caressing for him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she's just gone for a month.
Now we have to do some housework, which of course we share.
Cooking is a lot of work for me...
My PTSD disease is currently quite well adjusted, I am halfway well treated and can cope.
Not good, but I get along and am almost symptom-free.
My university just demands a lot (for me), tomorrow at 3pm I have a written test for which I have done nothing and the day after tomorrow anatomy lesson for which I should at least prepare a little something.
And next week I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes next is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no room anymore.
So my week goes like this: Only until the day after tomorrow, then is weekend.
But after that, does it all continue?
Only until the birthday.
Only until the start of the holidays.
Only until the weekend.
I've been...
And so it continues forever.
I think I’m just so stressed that I need these mental clues because otherwise I’ll pack the ned.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic," but otherwise I can't do it...
Is that how you feel?
Honestly, I'm infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
Really infinitely grateful, I can't put that in words.
I don't know if I would have survived my KPTBs.
I think this also has a lot to do with mental load of women and that's why I thought I'd find comrades of suffering here...
I wish you a relaxing evening, the week is almost over!
I got my order today unfortunately is the whole other color plus surface is scratched and table leg has imprint.
At the first delivery, the color was exactly the same as on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we change the table now, will I get another color or how?
The cancellation email was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
The other two times.
However, it was not confirmed.
At school, I found that many religious teachers do not believe in God and that it is just another subject for them like math or geography.
For me, this was always a bit strange, maybe because I was raised Christian and I always believed in some way.
What do you think?
You may also be able to talk about work and/or study colleagues with different attitudes.
Basically, I understand the difference between private and professional and it makes sense to separate.
There is also a curriculum, etc.
But it would also be strange to have a physics teacher who does not believe in the theory of relativity.
What makes you want to teach religion if you don’t believe it?
Culture or something?
I hope your question is not too private.
Can't it be changed or not?Write english that I understand well
That's been a long time, then I'd refrain from it
That's fine, thank you.
I expect a feedback by the beginning of next week at the latest.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Film Search Help please
Hello dear people,
I am looking for a movie from my childhood (I am 24).
I think it was a movie for young people.
There are two timelines (or parallel worlds) in the film.
Modern (real world).
Secondly, the past (or the realm of the dead) (not quite sure).
Since I can't describe it any more in the real world, there is a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead a young soldier (uniform similar to that of the soldiers from Curse of the Caribbean).
For some reason, the paths cross and an action arises.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this realm to be able to live for herself, I mean.
I believe the transition is also the tomb of the soldier.
In the end, I think both soldiers fight against each other.
If that tells you anything, I am grateful for every answer.
Our little girl slept on her stomach from week one.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax. Relax.
Such a child endures much more than you think.
Make sure that everything around it is right, no cuddly animals, go in and watch more often, but no minutes of surveillance.
That makes you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Achso and ours did not have a sleeping bag, but always had a blanket.
Watch your child when he is asleep.
Is it turning your head to the side?
Is it possible to get something up from the stomach?
Or is it with the face ahead directly in the mattress?
You can deduce from this that everything is fine.
We all grew up too, and when my husband was born, there was a gang and there was going to be that you put the kids on your stomach to sleep.
In addition, we are already "main customer" with you and have already bought a lot of items
So why are you offering me only $20?
Hello, I wrote with a colleague of yours yesterday and so far no feedback.
It's about my wardrobe that arrived before yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer does not fit in the cabinet.
Please contact me as soon as possible.
The closet is not available at the moment.
To be quite clear.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know, not everything can be held.
I also had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It is just that the politics of this broadcaster are now under all strain.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then go on a big begging tour at the same time.
It has been said that you are an “independent” Internet transmitter.
Quote Arno: You don't want to be a running lit barrel pillar.
What is one now?
A 0815 advertising station trying to bring his BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then there's Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
This applies to everyone except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, they can continue to offend people.
A Krogman who is completely lacking in empathy and at the expense of the action with the exploded rented rooms tries to make ashes.
How do you like all this?
Great if you like it, I think it's awful.
I ask for a return call, as my wooden table delivered was delivered defective.
Body breakage due to damaged delivery of the #PRS_ORG#.
Whether as a comforter with abdominal pain or just to cuddle – my little warmth friend can be used in a variety of ways.
Cherry kernel pillows are a traditional home remedy for soothing heat applications, as cherry kernels can very well absorb and dispense heat in a dosed manner.
The removable inner cushion can easily be heated in the microwave or oven.
The soft cover makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe, even if they are not so well.
The cherry core cushion with cover is suitable as a heat pad exclusively for the following application areas:
Before heating the pillow, check for atypical odor, stick or burn stains and dispose of them immediately if present.
Please remove the inner cushion for heating from the cover beforehand!
Heat in the microwave at a maximum of 300 watts for a maximum of 2 minutes (please note the microwave manufacturer's information!)
Immediately after heating, distribute the heat evenly in the pillow by shaking!
Then put the inner cushion back in the cover.
Slight moisture formation can occur on the surface during the first warming, but disappears with repeated applications.
Be sure to follow the heating instructions given, as longer periods of time or higher energy performance can lead to damage (risk of ignition and combustion!).
Before heating the pillow in the microwave, check that the heating of grain products is allowed in the manufacturer's instructions for use.
After the heated inner cushion has been placed back in the cover, please check the temperature of the cushion for suitability for babies (max. 43 °C) on your arm bend!
Do not use the pillow for acute and chronic, inflammatory or feverish diseases, circulatory disorders, fresh hematomas, bruising and open wounds, as well as for people with reduced pain.
In case of existing skin, heart, veins, diabetes or tumour diseases and pregnancy, please contact a doctor before use.
If seams have opened and loose cores leak out, dispose of the product and loose cores immediately and inaccessible to children.
If the product is used in babies under 1 year of age, the temperature of the child should be checked regularly during use to exclude overheating!
All serious incidents occurring in connection with the product shall be reported to the manufacturer and the competent authority of the country in which the user is established.
The cover is removable and machine washable at 30°C.
Please note the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt after Hinserie Second - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 can dream of returning to the Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 is working out of the table basement.
For Ingolstadt, it does not run under the third coach.
Cheering in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top game, joy in Hanover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt after the unsuccessful finish under the new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery broken?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer charged by my power supply.
I bought this one about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought power supply alone was enough for operation.
Error display, the battery is empty and the laptop no longer starts despite plugged in power supply.
Then I removed the battery, but nothing is going on here.
Do you have any ideas?
A new battery has been ordered, but why can't I use the laptop on mains?
Is there anything else broken?
Thank you for your help!
I want the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I book this?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
I don't know how high the seat is...
Often on tour and still with a lot of equipment?
With the Everyday V2 Backpack by Peak Design no problem!
20 litres of capacity can also swallow larger photo equipment without any problems, which can be safely stowed using the padded FlexFold dividers.
And what else you need in everyday objects, thanks to practical accesses in the individually configurable interior, remains well organized and separable from the photo equipment.
With the "update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series also presents itself in a new look.
The chic, minimalist design has it literally - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still providing access to the photo equipment in seconds.
This works with two possibilities: Once conventionally via the lid flap, which can be closed with the MagLatch locking system, a superbly thought-out solution for effective protection, which has already proven itself in the Messenger Bags.
There is a metal closure hook in the closure flap with matching anchor beams on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has considered different "fill levels": there are 4 anchor bars, stable riveted, in which the closure hook can be hooked.
If the backpack is fully loaded, just take the top beam, it is rather empty, a deeper one.
Flap closure and hook are also magnetic.
This way, the backpack can also be reliably closed without locking the hook.
The second option also distinguishes the Everyday Backpack fundamentally from other, photo backpacks: In addition to the lid flap, there is also a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest drawback of conventional backpacks with access from above - you no longer have to dig through the contents!
At the same time, this clever detail increases the everyday suitability of the backpack enormously: if you take not only your photo equipment, but also everyday objects or luggage.
In the Everyday Backpack you can individually configure the interior (more on this below) and thus easily store both separately - and access them independently through the two side openings.
You can also pull the backpack from the right side in front of the body, for example, to access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while the everyday things stay safe in the left side of the backpack and do not get in between.
Comfortable, uncomplicated adjustable straps help with this.
And since the outer cover of the backpack is also made entirely of 100% recycled weatherproof nylon, the contents remain dry even if you want to go to Scotland in the autumn.
Unfortunately, I wait in vain for the email from your support.
#NAME# sent me yesterday an email from confirmation for commissioning the
Contact was announced by the forwarding company to pick up the incorrectly delivered table.
So far, I have not received a message.
I ask for immediate settlement.
I’m already writing with the third support staff member, but I didn’t get any further than the promise that I would receive an email as confirmation.
It is the return of the incorrectly delivered custom #NAME#
Is it possible to see when the cabinet can be delivered again?
Keeping it that way is not an option for me...
It works.
Thank you very much for the help
Wishing you a nice evening
Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. when will the item be delivered?
Order and payment was on 12.1.21.
I was supplied with a completely different lamp than I ordered.
Please call me
If you renew the voucher, I will place a larger order right away, but after all, I have kept the damaged piece of furniture and did not return it.
And that the past year went differently than I thought I could not guess and just could not redeem and clarify it on time.
But I have the damage as a customer and I do not accept that.

Additionally created openings increase the effectiveness of cooling the disc, with the cuts improving the cleaning of the brake discs and brake pads.
The aesthetic characteristics of our tuned windows underline the character of each car with their attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, at the southern fork of the American River, a man discovered shining chunks of water.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, the news spread quickly and triggered the so-called 'California Gold Rush' of '49.
Thousands came from near and far, making Coloma one of the fastest growing and thriving cities in the country.
Areas were staked out, tents were set up, and saloons and hotels were built almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country’s wealth.
For many, it was: "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or bankruptcy)!
In this game, you are a pioneer who seeks wealth in the West and wants to make a name for himself.
You will search for gold, recruit workers, gather horses and build businesses.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding rivers and adjoining areas.
You’re not alone – the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to surpass your pioneering colleagues in order not to go bankrupt with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast strategy game with many ways to win.
You simultaneously choose your actions, have to use your resources to house and build a tableau that is more and more "working" for you (so-called "Engine Building").
The buildings on your Tableau allow you to become more efficient, get additional actions, or turn rules in your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge tiles, you can customize your own style of play with fine adjustments.
Coloma takes place over a period of three years from 1848 (the year in which the gold was discovered in Coloma), over 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year in which California gained official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will secretly and simultaneously select a location on the game plan where they can perform actions.
Afterwards, their selection is uncovered and they place their pioneers at the appropriate locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, it gets a ban!
This deactivates one-half of the site - thus reducing the possible actions there.
Then, players take turns performing actions, such as gathering resources, moving carts, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening shops, and positioning gunmen.
When all actions are completed, the pioneers return.
The advertiser turns to a new location at the beginning of each round and thus changes the available promotions.
This continues until the advertiser has moved five times, i.e. has covered each location once and the year ends.
There is a shooting in which players must defend Coloma from a raid of angry bandits.
When players have contributed enough gunmen and are superior in number to the bandits, they will receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they will receive lower rewards or end up in the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shooting, then the final score takes place.
The player with the most victory points wins!

"Why Children Are Not Tyrants" Documentary, ARD Media Library
CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentary appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I watched it right away.
>Child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a welcome guest in talk shows and gives lectures throughout Europe.
With his book "Why our children become tyrants" (2008), he sparked a fierce educational debate.
Former patients and guardians now make serious accusations against him.
Please be careful, the movie is hard to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
Our parents and other responsible people must never, never, never! be concerned about power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child free space for its development and to make the framework for the child as large as it makes sense and is possible in the situation.
Brrr, I'm still shaking.
Holetschek: Countries advise on the elimination of the test requirement for triple vaccinated
The health ministers of the countries want to decide at their next meeting on a nationwide elimination of the test requirement for triple vaccinated.
"We countries need to quickly clarify whether and when the test requirement for three vaccines can be eliminated," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Health Ministers' Conference, to the "Bild am Sonntag".
The elimination of 2G plus for triple vaccinated people “is not only medically meaningful, but also provides an additional vaccination incentive,” Holetschek said.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised that he will make a proposal to the Health Ministers' Conference next Tuesday.
So I want to send the lamp back
What is the best way to do that?
Hello, I find the #PRS_ORG# chair very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me out?
I can no longer make a purchase through my #PRS_ORG#.
Oops, an error has occurred.
Shopping through the #PRS_ORG# page on the computer goes.
I have updated my account details.
What could this be about?
What you describe is called *awareness*, meaning sensory perceptions under general anaesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of about 1 to 1000.
Most often it comes to hearing sounds/voices, rarer to see pictures and most rarely to perceive pain.
Relevant for this topic: C-sections are surgeries that are accompanied by an increased rate of awareness, as a very deep anesthesia is avoided to protect the child up to the navel.
Previous episodes of Awareness should be mentioned during the anaesthetic pre-conversation.
Certain anesthesia procedures such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Dear everyone, this comment of mine describes awareness correctly, but **u/Nitemarex **by definition had none.
I read your comment incorrectly.
The chair is defective.
Unfortunately, the $20 doesn’t help us either.
These are legal warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be that they take back the defective chair.
In addition to the legal obligation, this is also the standard in the field of eCommerce.
Please check again if you are at least taking back the defective chair.
We sell the second chair privately.
We also lose a lot of money.
I've already sent you an email that you haven't answered.
Again the question.
In the order and on the invoice it is stated that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The carrier is company #NAME#.
I was just calling there.
They told me they were only delivering on the doorstep - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that true?
If so, I have to cancel the order, as I do not know any person who can carry the heavy furniture to the first floor.
Am I not being called?
I had formulated a question
Theatre historian Günther Rühle dies at the age of 97
He has profiled himself as a theatre critic and as a director.
Later he wrote a monumental theatre story.
On Friday, Günther Rühle died at the age of 97.
There is a new book on the table, freshly printed: "An old man is getting older".
The shocking diarium of a slow farewell to the world led by the theatre historian and journalist Günther Rühle until April 2021.
And in the middle of the reading comes the news that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book is: “I’m already witnessing my life thanks here.”
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common is euro pallets, standardized wooden pallets, which are mainly used as cargo carriers in the European area.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL
According to data from Statistik Austria, more than ten million pallets were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value was about 79 million euros.
How many pallets are imported to Austria per year is not charged
New York wins MLS championship for the first time
New York City FC has won the Major League Soccer title for the first time.
After 1-1 in the regular season against host Portland Timbers, the Eastern Conference team decided the final in penalty shootout with 4:2.
In the final of the Eastern Conference, New York prevailed against Philadelphia Union, the team of the German Kai Wagner.
Rouladen Tips & Tricks
I had a lot of great tips for the perfect goulash here a week ago.
That was for Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and butterzart!
So thank you again :)
Now I have come to the taste and want to cook roulades for the first time at New Year's Eve.
Tomorrow I'm going to set up a cattle fund for this.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I don't have an oven, only a large pot.
What's next?
What about the books and how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English is not so good anymore, but I can do that.
IIt is about a refund of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>#NUMBER#
I was already informed by e-mail on 18.01. that the refund was made.
But to this day, the money has not been received by me.
Would you please check there.
Where there are Christmas roasts in the Lübeck area
For many people, goose or duck belongs to the Christmas days such as the fir tree and the gifts.
You haven't bought any poultry yet?
Now the time is running out.
We will tell you where you can still get a Christmas roast in the Lübeck area.
The "drive" of a tubular amplifier contributes significantly to the warmth and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME controls you can set the desired level and the distortion content of your sounds.
In addition, the VT+ Series amplifiers offer a unique POWER LEVEL controller that allows you to reduce sound levels without altering gain and distortion.
Further up, it already sounded that you can even flip a power reserve with the POWER LEVEL controller when it is outrageously loud.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL controller, the full potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The signal applied here is processed with a box simulation, so that you get an eminently "acoustic" sound impression even when using a headphone or with direct recordings.
A CD or MP3 player can be connected to the AUX jack so you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate tuner.
If you also buy a VFS5 footbutton, you can easily call up the sounds by foot, turn on/off the effect blocks and "tape" the tempo of the compatible effects.
This is essential for live use.
With its new power packs, VOX takes another step into the future!
But I had seen it that way with others.
Is it possible to return the lamp?
Since she hangs too low for over a dining table?
I would like to send her back.
Can you help me with this?
And the chest of drawers?
Will we receive an update on the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Hello, have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
If not, I would be happy with a discount or voucher.
I may find a buyer for the furniture.
Only over 1,000 euros for goods that I don’t need is a lot.
I just received my delivery and would have liked to know if screws were provided as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the provided hook.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting time was not worth it.
Is there a premium customer status with you?
Iran sees progress in nuclear deal negotiations
Iranian reports show progress in negotiations on a revival of the international nuclear agreement.
"Both sides are on the verge of agreeing on the issues on the agenda," Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri told the Irna news agency on Sunday.
This is a "positive and important development" because at first there was not even agreement on the issues to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks on the revival of the agreement had continued after a nearly one-week interruption.
Negotiators from Iran, Germany, the United Kingdom, China, France and Russia participate in the negotiations.
A US delegation is also on the ground in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Free State now state with highest corona incidence
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence in Germany.
As the only federal state, the value is above the mark of 1000.
Thuringia was the only federal state to be above the 1000 mark in the corona incidence on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute stated the seven-day value with 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which most recently had the highest incidence in the country, this figure was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had dropped slightly, but had also been above the value of 1000.
In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 other deaths related to infection were reported within one day.
200 COVID-19 patients were treated intensively in hospitals on Sunday.
Reporting delays may occur on weekends.
In addition, the health offices have been overloaded for weeks and are barely late with the recording of new cases.
I understand that.
Since the delivery will only take place at the beginning of March, it may be possible until then.
I have to print it and stick it on the package and leave it at the post office, right?
I don't have to click/specify/fill in anything else here?
That’s exactly what I want to avoid, so I’m writing to you.
I would like to accept the return at my own expense.
8 euro return fee is in my opinion a brazenness.
It's time for change
Greetings, I am u/StratorDE in the plenary room in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
Why the post here?
If you look at the activity in the past few months of the MBundentag, you can see one thing: It is not existential.
We got into a winter rigidity and extended the summer hole to a few months.
#What is the problem?
Yeah, what was it about?
For the most part, this is probably simply due to the dissatisfaction, how some things have turned out here and how we stand in general.
In the last few days, the impression has become more and more evident that many of us are still on the MBundestag.
What we need to change
At this point, the community around the MBundestag is asked who wants to keep it alive.
The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who has become aware of this project in recent days and found a, simply put, shard pile.
After some back and forth writing, several people from the community have found themselves wanting to rebuild the project.
However, I would also like to expressly call on everyone to participate, so that this project can continue to exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a discord server, on which we can exchange ideas and work out concrete things.
You can join the server via this link.
Objectives:
* How will the MBundestag work in the future?
* Which existing orders need to be changed / adjusted / removed?
* How should we act outside in the future?
* How should new members be recruited?
How do we create a fair electoral system?
I’m pretty sure I’ve forgotten some things, but that’s not bad, so we end up with the discord.
If you have time and desire, come to the discord, cooperate and let us decide democratically about the future.
I ordered a lampshade from you that will still be delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big/tubby for it and not suitable for my taste.
For this I have already ordered a different suspension from you.
I put it together and then noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope this will be returned and I have a full refund.
This is also quite sad as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have another question: the blanket #PRS_ORG#, is it also in oversized size, i.e. in 240/240 for example?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee that the faulty cabinet will be picked up in a timely manner.
And I ask you to arrange that now.
I do not have a suitable packaging, but will disassemble the cabinet as far as possible for collection - you have to clarify with #PRS_ORG# how this can work.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me by phone at any time to arrange a pick-up date.
Is there a guide for mounting?
How long do I have time to get it or decide to return it?
How do you answer the question of why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague I like.
She herself once lived vegetarian for a while, nowadays she probably rarely eats meat.
I was also a vegetarian a few years ago.
When asked if I had always wanted to be vegan, and vegetarianism was a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thinking.
For a long time I thought that as a vegetarian, I would support animal welfare, but at some point I reflected and understood that in the end, I also support animal cruelty.
That’s why I decided to become vegan.
At that moment, I had the impression that she was upset on her side, she then defended vegetarianism and said she knew where her meat came from and that as a vegetarian animal suffering was reduced.
Now I wonder if my answer was "pump"?
How do you answer the question?
I have the feeling that as a vegan, you are quickly put in a corner and conflicts arise without which you would put it on.
It greets a harmony-loving vegan (;
This is clearly not an exception according to <0xC2><0xA7> 312d BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG# does not release you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I am not on the assigned date when #PRS_ORG# will pick up my return.
Because I can't be there for a funeral, that can't be changed.
Can I be assigned an alternative pick-up date?
From the 01.02.#NUMBER# I can be found again all the time.
Lahnsteiner Wehr equipped for water rescue: 45,000 Euro subsidy from the country
Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Interior Minister Roger Lewentz handed over a grant of 45,000 euros for the new water rescue vehicle of the volunteer fire brigade Lahnstein to Mayor Peter Labonte at the Lahnstein City Hall.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, amounted to 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in security.
I am delighted that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us in this,” says Lahnstein’s mayor Peter Labonte.
The equipment trolley is used by the Lahnstein diving squadron, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Above and underwater, they perform tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, there is a long-term expectation of increasing stakes: the boom of hotel shipping on the Rhine and the Moselle and the further increasing use of the Lahn as a leisure river contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read at 10% and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
I followed their recommendations but have synchronized, removed and reloaded the app NOTHING worked.
I am a little frustrated because the whole action has taken me a lot of time and now I hope for help.
Okay, that's it.
I would like to order 3 items from the collection of #PRS_ORG# for June.
Can I enter an appointment in the order process?

First of all, thank you for standing up for the whole thing here, I have also spent almost a decade in the state service in a similar activity, that is, we were also weapons carriers in the executive branch, further I do not want to go into that!
I always find the question of the right and left very simplified.
In principle, however, one should say that, of course, the public servant comes from the liberal to conservative spectrum rather than from the revolutionary left, this should actually be clear to everyone.
That of course also in the special uniform and gun bearers people right from conservative magical attract should also be clear to everyone, that these people can then of course deal with the lived reality difficult is of course also clear, because you have of course besides the average white, meanwhile many Germans with migrant background, women and also homosexuals (and by that I mean now I can not leave you the exaggerated feminine ex-gays, but these women do not even have to say to you).
But these marginal groups also represent even if it sounds weird to my experience at first a conservative attitude, that is to say, they are proud of Germany and feel less caught up by exaggerated leftist politics, even if this policy supposedly advocates for them or thinks they have to do it right, they simply want to be treated normally.
Back to the right, since of course police and armed forces are also a cross-section of society, you will also find extreme right-wingers there, but that they can openly express their opinion there or even openly forge any state-threatening plans is medially completely exaggerated and annoys me too.
Of course, it also happens that police officers and soldiers who were often in service abroad often start to flatten out because of negative experiences and sometimes say things that are controversial or politically incorrect.
It also happens that right-wing associates meet, who engage in a lively exchange of ideas.
Nevertheless, such a thing is well fought in my opinion and also counteracted with political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so internationally entangled and that is also good so in my opinion that we could not afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks at all!
Yes, which I don't understand, I ordered the other basket on the German side.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered it was not sold out.
I ordered in November.
But it was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order
It is still about my order, which is no longer available.
I chatted with #NAME# before.
Alternatively, the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# Euro in black could still be delivered to Germany or this basket is also available somewhere in Germany.
I always find only you as a partner company.
but at the top of the edge of the wooden part are two deep notches filled with something yellow
and on the mirror itself is a small scratch
Ordinary by child?
Hello, I (w32) have been busy with one thing for a long time.
I am very disciplined and organized at work, (I am independent, very little free time), but all my life I get it more bad than right to keep my household clean and tidy.
There are always phases where everything stays, and then and when it grabs me and I clean up and clean up.
But it’s never like “someone could come to visit spontaneously.”
My husband is (unfortunately) not better either, it does bother me somewhere but most of the time household simply loses against work and displeasure.
The kitchen is cleaned even more regularly as we like to cook.
Now to my question, did you manage to become more orderly with a child?
We haven’t worked on it yet and this question has been busy for a long time.
Because for me I have no incentive, it just does not bother me so doll, as long as no visit comes and e.g. always fresh clothes there and the kitchen can be used.
Do you have a bigger incentive with a child or do you stay sloppy?
I look forward to your replies.
Exclusive, new, high-quality and anatomically preformed cut, offers maximum comfort, a perfect fit and thus allows almost unlimited freedom of movement.

Career in social work - as someone with an uncertain personality disorder?
I have been training in software development and have been learning for about a year now.
Unfortunately, I increasingly realize that this profession is not the right one for me, which is why I have been considering starting again and studying social work for a long time.
The problem: I have an insecure (or anxious-avoiding) personality disorder (EVPS).
That means, roughly speaking, I don’t have self-esteem and, accordingly, I’m shy.
I have no problem with talking to people on a factual level, but I find it very difficult to have loose conversations and I have been told many times that I seem out of touch (though I think that has already gotten better).
Can I become a social worker?
I do not want to work as a street worker or in an open youth meeting, but rather in addiction counselling or family help.
However, I do not know if the concrete workday is really the way I imagine it, and it is difficult to find something on the Internet.
The <0xC3><0x84>VPS already leads to problems in my job (for me, emotionally), because it pulls me down every time there is something to complain about my code ("already the simplest things fucked up") and I find it difficult to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should really know how to do this myself" / "I keep him off the job with my stupid questions" / "he really has to think I am less" etc).
I will probably have the problems in any profession but I wanted to mention it at the point.
Did you get the sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation for that either.
I'm waiting for an appointment for pickup
What do you mean by return please!
If I downloaded a book on the #PRS_ORG#, the message Your #PRS_ORG# does not authorize this book
Is there a problem?
I was chatting with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I got a delivery confirmation for my closet.
The protein (protein) ingested with the food, the bird breaks down in its gastrointestinal tract into the individual protein building materials (amino acids) and builds up from these in turn its body's own proteins, which it also needs for the formation of foliage.
The formation of feathers in the nestling and the formation of new feathers in the mauling bird are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high stress for the overall organism of the animal.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio should not be administered during breeding, otherwise there may be disturbances in the breeding flow.
Following this curative administration of NEKTON-Bio, the daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral preparation) should be resumed.

1 g of NEKTON organic on 250 ml of water or 100 g of soft food.
It is advisable to prepare only as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change water/food daily.
A coated measuring spoon (inside) corresponds to 1 g of NEKTON organic.
In the case of severe plumage damage, the double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given at the beginning until the approach to plumage re-formation is visible.
After that, the normal dose is administered until the plumage is completely completed.
Storage: NEKTON organic should be stored dry without sun exposure, between 15° and 25°C.
Please apologize, but the chair will be sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break after 9 months?
Warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
This is really very poor service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to inform that my order has arrived damaged and pictures have been attached.
Did you receive this email?
Statement of a municipal employee in opposition to the statute
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have this problem.
On our property a walnut tree is to be cut.
So the case application is made to the municipality.
An employee writes to me that the falling of fruit trees and thus also the walnut is not part of the statute.
However, the walnut is explicitly stated in the statutes as a tree to be protected.
Can I now rely on the employee’s statement or not?
On the one hand, I must be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statute is clear.
Thank you for your replies
We understand that.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I have not received a message
Well, then I still have a sofo without use.
Could you offer me a discount or a voucher?
What was more expensive?
yes, I think so, only the question is yes, can I pay in euros and have the blanket delivered to Germany
Can you check that?

Ah okay, I understand.
Thanks again for making it so easy!
Advice and ideas for further professional life
Merry Christmas to you for the first time!
My Christmas is unfortunately moderately good, because my dear head is now consuming everything you can consummate.
In short, I need advice, and best of all, from people who somehow know my situation, i.e., from you.
I'm just doing the ref as a cross entrant.
Originally I studied something else and worked there in an area (to stay at least a little anonymous, I don’t mention anything more precise here).
The whole thing was too boring for me and I was looking for alternatives that I could enjoy more.
At some point I ended up in the teaching profession and I was sure that it is - even if the framework conditions are significantly more inflexible than in my previous profession, but I didn't care.
I have now arrived at the third "I google other job postings".
And it's only been half a year.
In the paintings before that, I always decided to keep going and at least finish the ref, after that I can still swing around.
But I'm absolutely done right now.
I had so little free time last month that I was completely exhausted.
Now it’s holidays, but there’s still a bunch of work waiting for me.
Before the ref I always thought I was stress resistant, but there my weekend was also my weekend and my end of work was my end of work.
I was free.
And the stress at work didn’t matter in the moments.
The family party is too stressful for me.
And then there are those rigid structures that bother me extra.
Basically, it is fun and from the outside, the ref also runs well in terms of feedback and so on.
But I’m completely exhausted and wonder how much stress my body endures before it completely closes – if it’s not already doing so.
I wonder if I would like to have this for the rest of my working life - especially when I read some of your posts here - or if I should not go back to the old area where I was valued, where I could take my free time when I needed it, and the work was kind of boring, but was paid adequately for it, and working together in a team that has worked out, and not as a single fighter.
But then I wonder if I haven’t come back to the same place in a year and I’m dissatisfied.
You realize it’s all kind of confusing, but maybe you, as outsiders, have some advice or ideas on how to get out of this situation, that I’m completely finished and start crying at the slightest thought.
I’m not going to make decisions so emotionally right now, that probably won’t lead to anything good.
But maybe your views help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas, that's enough for me for now.
Thank you for reading and apologize for the weeping undertone of me.
I hope my situation has at least become a little clear.
Since its introduction in 2001, VOX’s Valvetronix series has evolved steadily, which has led to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the “Valve Reactor” circuitry, which perfectly mimics the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps, we introduce a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound.
Thanks to the VET (Virtual Element Technology) technology, which is based on the analysis of the components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers have an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Of course, these amps also contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamp.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because they simply get the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuit, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed casing and bass reflex system from which the natural resonances burst.
With VOX's "Tone Room" software, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and effects sound as you have always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound and modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Of course, it has since been refined several times to meet newly added sound requirements, which in 2010 led to a performance boost in the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamics and numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has also been designed to accommodate all guitarists looking for maximum sound diversity.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tubular amplifier: they expect a bold sound, a nuanced reproduction of game dynamics and string stroke, as well as a prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that the power amplifier in particular determines the tubular nature of an amplifier and developed VOX Valve Reactor technology on the basis of this finding.
Equipped with a 12AX7 tube, the Valve Reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier perfectly reflects the behavior, subtle nuances and sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner: Magic lose at Clippers
The Orlando Magic defeat series in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it is not enough to win against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven points from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost on Saturday 104:106 to the Los Angeles Clippers.
The large main compartment is also adaptable: with three individually plazable and foldable Velcro dividers, it is tailored to the needs of your photo equipment and is therefore suitable for any type of camera - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-frame mirror reflex cameras.
What ultimately fits in the backpack, of course, depends on the size of the camera and lenses.
One possible fitting would be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses and a plug-in flash.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the various models of the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 still leave room for more lenses.
In addition, you can store lots of accessories.
And those who have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-Series) can use the backpack for their equipment and for photo-alien things.
Even drone pilots make an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, because the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcano eruption on La Palma: arguably the longest in history
In the nearly three months since the start of the eruption, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused great damage.
Is an end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest in the history of the Spanish Canary Islands since Sunday.
So far, the eruption of the volcano Tehuya in 1585 was considered to be the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa, with 84 days.
There are no reliable data on previous outbreaks.
The activity of the still unnamed volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has declined somewhat in recent days, but volcanologists have not dared to predict when it could end.
The indicators indicate a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said the president of the island council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, to the state TV channel RTVE.
Damage in millions
In the nearly three months since the eruption began, the more than 1,000-degree lava has destroyed nearly 2,900 homes and other buildings, RTVE reported.
Nearly 1,200 hectares were covered by a layer of lava.
This corresponds to almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7,000 residents had to be evacuated, the damage is estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Off the coast, two new headlands with a total area of about 50 hectares were formed by cold lava.
The banana cultivation, of which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly and which was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption, was severely affected.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, further areas severely damaged, the newspaper "El País" wrote.
Christmas and the Gifts
Christmas is just around the corner and especially the children can’t wait for the heavenly feast.
The many colourful gifts under the Christmas tree have something seductive in themselves, combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still hold our increasingly divided society together.
Therefore, it is all the more important to become aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which, according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss, was a peace-building "society treaty of natural peoples", can escape from the rigid routine and be filled with life again in the context of this tradition.
How St. Nicholas became the child of Christ
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants through whom the Christmas days were closely linked to the gifts.
Before that, gifts were presented in one way or another on St. Nicholas’ Day.
The background of this custom, still popular today, is that as Bishop of Myra, Saint Nicholas secretly threw three women gold into their window in one night to save them another life in sin.
This unconventional way of giving came from the popular custom in Germany of filling the boots with gifts, especially for children.
Protestants opposed this custom because they rejected mediators between God and man as "sanctification."
For these reasons, they keep themselves against the institution.
Martin Luther made Nicholas the Child of Christ, thereby establishing a new line of tradition.
The focus of the gift was shifted to Christmas Eve.
However, since most Protestants do not see such detailed questions so closely, it is only the least annoying that the custom of St. Nicholas, similar to the Martinsbrauch with Martinssingen and Martinszug, is still an integral part of the pre-Christmas period.
Today in boots on the doorstep and under the Christmas tree you can find everything from socks to coveted luxury watches, everything your heart desires.
Diversity of traditions in Christian countries
Sources testify to a tradition of giving gifts since the 13th century on the day of St. Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the day of the gift was postponed to Christmas Eve.
In all Christian-minded countries, however, there is a cheerful mob about the question of who will bring the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the respective region, whether the Christ Child appears on Christmas Eve or Santa Claus, which is in principle a kind of Nicholas, to which some peculiarities have been assigned over time.
These include, for example, his white raucous beard, which has little in common with the rather strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh pulled by reindeer, and the preference of the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure on Christmas.
In Spain, the Holy Three Kings give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the Child Jesus.
In Scandinavia, legendary creatures sometimes bring the gifts, while in Russia it brought Father Frost to some glory.
Here it is not reindeer, but three horses that pull his sled as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the motherland of the Reformation in the course of the Hussite wars, the Christkind is responsible for the handover of the gifts.

Police shoot suspected bank robber near Royal Palace
Near Kensington Palace in London, an armed man was shot dead by police on Saturday.
Police said the caller reported a man who had gone to a bank and a bookmaker’s business with a gun.
The man fled, according to authorities, in a vehicle that could be stopped by officials shortly afterwards.
There were gunshots and the man was hit.
He was declared dead at the scene.
The police did not assume a terrorist background.
Several embassies are located in the area around Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and the three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
Which ones?

The decorative luminaire blends harmoniously into any bed, garden area or rock garden.
The luminaire is simply set up and can be anchored in the ground with 2 earth spikes.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Lighting time max. 10 hrs.
- The robust plastic version can be used outdoors all year round.
In the Hollywood spectacle, it is mostly threatening objects from distant galaxies that glow inside in colour.
On the other hand, »Smart Stone« is completely harmless: the sun alone makes this solar light shine in a fascinating way – either in white or colored light (in six different shades).
The edgeless, amorphous design has been deliberately chosen: like a naturally shaped large pebble, this modern light object presents itself during the day.
Its organic curves fit into any natural environment – whether on the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the stone bed.
He does well even in the neighbourhood of larger pebbles and findlings, where he knows how to assert himself thanks to his size.
You can save yourself large amounts of preliminary work: As a solar lamp, »Smart Stone« does not require any power supply or batteries.
Place the "lightstone" in any place that is illuminated by the sun during the day.
Two supplied earth skewers provide a firm hold if necessary.
The matt white plastic shell itself is robust and weatherproof.
Its solar panel discreetly hides »Smart Stone« inside, along with its battery and two LEDs – one for white, the other for colored light.
The battery is already charging when sunlight falls on the case.
At dawn, »Smart Stone« automatically starts to shine; in which color you decide: six attractive light colors are available to you – in addition to daylight white.
The switch-off also takes place automatically as soon as the battery charge level has dropped to a predetermined minimum or it becomes bright again.
As soon as the sun shines again, the charging cycle starts again the next day.
I’ve done this several times, it doesn’t work.

Pills
Hello dear female people,
I hope I do everything right here, after a year reddit is actually my first post.
To my problem: I had to start taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had such incredibly severe pain during the period and shit PMS before the period.
Now I would like to let this go again, because I already have to take enough medications due to chronic diseases that I cannot choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
I had gotten explosive pimples in my last roughly two-year break from 0 to 100 and these everywhere.
So far so superficial, but it has put a lot of stress on me and I didn't feel comfortable.
In the two years of pause, the whole thing has never really normalized.
Maybe someone has some tips to avoid that this time.
My cosmetics are perfume-free and without sweets already, but maybe there is something that someone can recommend to me.
Unfortunately, the gynecologist didn’t take me so seriously and the dermatologist’s appointment is yet to come.
Thank you to everyone who has read the novel!
Yes, the dear skin is such a thing.
Had pre-bump aggravated eczema, then a time of rest, then large-scale nodule melanoma and the acne topic.
I also tried all kinds of diet in the course of chr. illness and I stuck on sugar, milk and low-meat mixed foods, because nothing else worked so well.
It may also be good that Hormonell is simply the worm in it, but if you have a construction site like me, you would rather not go looking for anything else that goes wrong.
I already had everything from her colleague semina or so.
Written and now I have lost the conversation and do not know what was answered to my request.
I always have to work in between and on the phone and all of a sudden everything was gone...
What is there to check if the money was there, I would have seen it
Please check my bank details, maybe something was wrong
But in general, it is large.
since it is available in black

110 kV earth cable will be rebuilt in 2022
The approval for the installation of the new high-voltage cable at Tann is final.
The decision of the government of Lower Bavaria to establish plans paves the way for construction, which is scheduled to begin in 2022.
This was announced by the network operator Bayernwerk.
The approximately seven-kilometre-long earth cable will connect the Tann substation in the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable is connected to a mast of the overhead line near the village of Edermanning near Reut.

Ref: Plan lessons (EK)
Hello dear colleagues,
I have been in the Ref since summer, teaching is fun, but I still have great problems planning my lessons in geography time-efficiently.
Unfortunately, my school is not technically well equipped, so in principle I can only use the board, the textbook and an OHP as a medium.
In school, I can only copy s/w for free (which is annoying for earth students).
It takes me a lot of time to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently doing the topic of geofactors and with me, every hour stands for itself.
In principle, the methods are always repeated, but on the other hand, I do not want to invest too much time for simple lessons (I also need them for UBs, etc.).
When planning, I always start from the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build that (usually I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school does not have).
We have the book Terra and I am rather dissatisfied with most of the tasks in the book.
And so are the worksheets.
Maybe a geography teacher can tell me how to work time-efficiently with the book.
I'd be really happy.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
I have actually already decided on a new one at #PRS_ORG# but I would like to process the returns as soon as possible.
Trade fears about the 2G regulation for the Christmas business.
In most businesses, only those who have been vaccinated or cured are allowed.
Trading considers this unnecessary and complains of sales drops.
He also has a possible solution.
From the point of view of the Handelsverband Deutschland (HDE), the 2G regulations are spoiling the important Christmas business for retailers.
For stores with items of non-daily demand, revenue declines should be complained, criticised HDE chief executive officer Stefan Genth.
According to a recent HDE survey of 1,100 merchants, more than 70 percent of companies looked negatively at the rest of the year.
Many had already written off the Christmas business.
"What should actually be the positive highlight of the year is now often a hole without soil," Genth said.
Traders with 2G access restrictions lost nearly a third of their pre-crisis turnover in the past week.
It runs well only in the food retail and in the online area.
The association demanded consequences from the dramatic development.
The shopping with mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the CEO.
“2G when it comes to shopping doesn’t take us any further in the fight against the pandemic,” he said.
The current regulations deterred customers and required a high amount of personnel.
The system must be approved nationwide, he demanded.
After that, each customer only needs to be checked once on 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would have access to all stores with the tape received on that day.
In addition, sample checks should be sufficient in retail – as already in public transport under the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested).
The real estate group Deutsche Euroshop, which specializes in shopping centers, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were last without 2G at a good 75 percent of the pre-corona level, the turnover at about 90 percent.
These figures will now fall safely in the midst of such an important Christmas business," CEO Wilhelm Wellner told the "Wirtschaftswoche".
Due to the high human and administrative effort, the centers are trying to find and get approved solutions.
This includes the so-called ribbon solution, in which visitors, for example, at a central location in the center, once provide their 2G proof and then - equipped with a bracelet similar to a club hotel - can enter all shops undisturbed.
I recently ordered and received the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and the frame is also a flaw that was tried to be laminated with a yellow filler.
That looks ugly.
I would like to return the mirror and have already packed it back in the package and glued it.
How do I proceed for the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high power and high color rendering.
The color temperature and brightness of the lamp are adjusted by a modern microprocessor with exceptional possibilities.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually adjust and store the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in flash memory.
A special feature of the controller, it is simple and intuitive to use.
The luminaire produces a very light flow with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free.
The beam angle of 120 degrees, which allows you to illuminate large areas at relatively small distances, is excellent.
Incidentally, even in reporter situations in small rooms or short intervals.
You can adjust the brightness virtually without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work both on the film set or in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows remote control of the luminaire in TV studios or when the luminaire is mounted in hard-to-reach locations.
At the back of the light is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a luminous display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Furthermore, there is the slot for the NP-F batteries (not included)
The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To perform the settings of the individual settings on the memory locations, simply pressing one of the memory buttons for a longer time is occupied and done.
The memory controller stores the current state of the lamp when switched off, so that when switched on the familiar situation is again - Very convenient for studio work if, for example, the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
Working with battery one of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality results from the possibility of operating with cheap NP-F batteries.
These are often already owned by photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can rely on existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set whether the batteries have enough power - it is a battery tester installed - for each of the two battery compartments a value in the two display displays (the left battery top display, the right on the lower display).
In addition, it is of course possible to supply the headlight continuously with power via the supplied power supply.
The construction of the headlight is very simple.
You have to attach a 16mm sleeve as a connection, so you can directly to your photo tripod.
The inclination can be reliably adjusted by means of determining devices on both sides.
It was ensured that the mechanical components are also of extremely high quality and are therefore also designed for durability and hard use.
In addition, a tilt joint is included.
Great that a bag is also included in the scope of delivery.
So you can safely transport or store the luminaire with all the accessories you might still want to buy.
Too bad I got it and it's too small :(
"Party we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular response from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last two winners in a series were supposedly on their way to the next Bundesliga defeat.
But then the SGE turned up, within a good hour shot the frustration over a full start of the season from the soul and furiously defeated with 5:2. "It's madness what the boys have done today," cheered coach Oliver Glasner at DAZN and said a "package praise to everyone who was there."
Initially, it looked like a new damper for the Frankfurters, who are now ranked ninth and still behind their expectations.
Patrik Schick led the Leverkuseners 2-0.
What happened then also impressed the SGE trainer.
"The players came back and showed a fantastic performance," Glasner continued.
I am incredibly happy with the performance we have shown and, of course, with the result.
Defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to stand on the pitch again for the first time since the fourth game day and his overcome muscle injury, also emphasized the morale of his teammates.
"I think our mentality is incredibly great," said the 27-year-old, looking forward to the result especially for the spectators.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
However, Glasner now wants to keep the focus on the upcoming tasks, but also sees himself well positioned with regard to the personnel situation.
It’s extraordinary that we have all players fit in December, that all players are physically in a top constitution.
It’s top work in our medical department, but also the players live highly professionally.
Now we want to “go step by step and remain modest” and continue the tasks until the turn of the year “at this level”.
Next on Wednesday in the course of the English week a away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach (18.30, Sky) is on the program.
I receive the email that my package is coming back to you due to a mistake on my part.
I tried to call #PRS_ORG# and have it redirected, no chance.
Can it be sent back directly to me or do I have to wait until the money is transferred back and place the order again?
For me, unfortunately, that means I will not order again because it has already taken a long time.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Damper for handball women before quarter-finals against Spain
After the humiliation against Denmark, Germany's handball women slipped off the floor with hanging heads and empty eyes.
At the end of the World Cup main round, the DHB selection at 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers received a tough defeat and now has to run against host Spain in the quarter-finals.
"We were far too anxious and had too much respect for the opponent," said coach Henk Groener.
Against Spain we have to act differently.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished the main round group III with 8:2 points as second behind the Danish women (10:0).
It is a pity that we were not able to take the flow with us.
That was a bad game of all that we have to delete," said captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight for the semi-finals against the World Cup second of 2019 next Tuesday, a significant increase must come to keep the delicate dream of the first medal alive since 2007.
Best German thrower in a duel with three-time Olympic champion Denmark was back-space player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We just weren't there - neither in the attack, nor in the defense," backroom player Xenia Smits admitted, demanding: "We have to look forward quickly now."
From front to back not at the height
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not on top with the start.
Mistakes and technical errors in the attack and gaps in the defence were responsible for a quick 0:4 delay after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately on operating temperature and prevented worse with a few parades.
The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully completed a quick counter-stroke.
However, the expected initial ignition was not.
Against the aggressive coverage of the Danish women, the German women could hardly stand in the scene - and if they did, they mostly failed at the strong Althea Reinhardt in the gate of the Scandinavian women.
So the game had run at 3:10 after 20 minutes early, especially since back-space player Mia Zschocke a little later because of a hard foul on her opponent also saw red.
In the quarter-finals, however, she is allowed to participate again.
Only in the final phase of the first half did the DHB selection get a little better in the game and until the break at least to five goals.
The already slight hope of a catch-up after the change was already gone after seven minutes at 9:19.
Once again, the Groener pupils sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-placed opponent, who is one of the medal candidates in the final round.
As a result, the German team could no longer get up to an increase in performance and went off the court as a clear loser.
DACH Advent Calendar Day 6: Family traditions in the Christmas season
As part of the Reddit Advent calendar, we have caught up with St. Nicholas and use this as an occasion to devote ourselves to family traditions in the pre-Christmas season, Advent, St. Nicholas, Christmas Eve and the Christmas holidays.

Is it possible for you?
The title states that I work as a vaccine physician in mobile vaccination teams, in which (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is vaccinated mainly in nursing homes.
Since these are soon to be ready, I will continue in vaccination centers.
I am happy to answer questions without time limit on the organizational and human aspects and also medical questions, as long as these are not related to one personally (e.g. "I take medication X, does that agree with the vaccination.").
My responsibilities include the education for the vaccination, the indication (person is entitled to a vaccination according to corona vaccination regulations and no reasons that speak against), the medical documentation and, if necessary, emergency care in case of allergic reactions (I have never happened before).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, e.g. medical specialists.
In vaccination teams, however, we often have none, but "only" (for God's sake no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for vaccine preparation, who can not (can not?) carry out vaccinations, so that I also carry out most vaccinations there myself.
Severe "Huidlerer" question: Amberger knows the solution
What, please, is a "skinner"?
With this dialect word, sent in by an Amberger, in the BR TV show "Wir in Bayern" has been provided for intense reflection.
But unlike on many previous days, the term in the series "Host mi?" this time remained unaware of the callers.
No, it wasn't a "man who's nervous."
And no one who needs to go fast.
That, people heard from the TV presenter, was completely wrong.
After which the man from Amberg communicated the solution and thus probably also caused astonishment in many Upper Palatinate.
"The skinner," the spectators learned, "is a rag with which someone wipes out the oven."
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, interviewed by Bavarian TV as an expert for years, confirmed this.
With the note that this is a typical Upper Palatinate term, somehow derived from the more familiar vernacular word "Houdern".
With which an educational gap was closed - probably also for some who have lived in the Amberg area for a long time.
I haven't been able to buy books in two weeks.
The following error message always comes after confirmation: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I rebooted the #PRS_ORG# gel#PRS_ORG#n, connected to the PC, synchronized and repaired it.
Nothing helped.
Tyre choice on road bike - really so break-proof?
This morning I woke up full of energy, because I wanted to at least train a little to prepare for my bike tour next week.
Said, done and I started riding my road bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay.
The first 40km were also really nice - but then what lured in every city center (this time: thank you Krefeld!) happened.
Glass splinters on the track.
Zack, loud sizzling and my rear tires didn’t want to go on the rest of the track.
Since I had no real opportunity to get a replacement coat and hose due to the day of the week, I had to turn around with half a bad mood and take the first train home.
It was not so bad in terms of mood, maybe it is better if I practice the tyre change again before the bike tour.
Now I have a question and hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long distance in front of me over several days, I would be extremely reluctant to get this problem more often.
Now it was really not bad, because also the old tires from the previous owner (very nice old man, on the day I came to pick up the bike 120 km torn down!) and who had already described these as suboptimal, because he rode with them for several years.
But when I think that I still have to make a tyre change after 80-90kms, I think I’m really in a bad mood :D
Now I got into a conversation with an older man at the platform, who wondered why I didn’t have the Marathon Plus tyres; these are supposed to be unplatable.
Now, of course, the whole thing sounds very tempting.
But are they really so indestructible?
I don't feel like spending 40<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>/tyre now, just to be disappointed.
I also wonder: I currently have 25x622 on the road bike.
Although there are (apparently?) Marathon Plus tyres, but the majority is already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you generally advise me on other tyres for a road bike?
The Schwalbe side seems to be my absolute! Laienwissen rather recommend the Durano DD?
Thank you in advance for the help and greetings!
Car Throws Against Tree: Driver Deadly Injured
The 53-year-old had crashed on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten with his car from an unexplained cause against a central island and subsequently on the opposite lane, as the police announced.
There was a frontal collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The 53-year-old’s car was then thrown against a tree and the man was trapped in the car.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old passenger were seriously injured in the accident and taken to nearby hospitals.

After the release of our new high-end broadband B 100-6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series would get offspring again.
SOLO 15 is the name of the new offspring and visually reminds of the great models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, this construction proposal includes an appropriately designed foot directly to lift the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no influence on the acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length according to the conditions at home.
In principle, the SOLO 15 is very suitable for people where the maximum volume plays a rather minor role, but an exceptionally high level of sound is to be achieved.
A 10 cm loudspeaker is simply not able to produce such large sound pressure levels almost unfiltered.
However, this does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, she appears considerably adult and extremely impressive and accurate for her size.
Tonal the SOLO 15 was tuned with a slight high pitch.
This is generally common in broadbands in order to optimize the bundling which increases significantly to high frequencies.
Precisely aligned with the listening position, the SOLO 15 impresses with very clear and fine sound.
Slightly turned outwards, the high-pitched range can be reduced and the sound image can be made warmer.
Thanks to the point sound source, the location of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereo triangle is sharp and astonishingly precise.
The reference-suspicious extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM ensure an enemy dynamics that matches its own.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but also extends it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all our kits, it is advisable to think about the final look of the loudspeaker at first in order to plan for corresponding changes during construction.
If, for example, you want to veneer the housings, the lowering of the loudspeaker must be adjusted accordingly, because the veneer again applies material.
After all plates have been cut (e.g. in the DIY store), you should first drill an 8 mm hole in the base plate at the appropriate place, in order to be able to carry out the cable there without any problems later.
The loudspeaker opening in the front now follows with the help of an upper milling cutter, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be used flush later.
At the rear, this opening should be provided with a 45° chamfer to make the opening area of the speaker chassis inside as large as possible.
The four screw connection points of the B 100 - 6 OHM are interrupted in the chamfer, as shown in the picture "Detail chamfer".
Then you start with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of you.
The back wall, the lid, the front and the floor are now glued to these.
The three reinforcements should also be used and glued.
The stiffening itself can vary in the thickness of the material if necessary, provided, for example, you want to use finished strips from the DIY store instead of making them yourself from 16 mm MDF.
In the next working step, the second side is attached.
Then follow all the plates of the foot, i.e. the two sides, as well as the front.
The mounting of the openings of the bass reflex tube, as well as the connection terminal on the rear wall, is facilitated by means of a matching perforated circular saw or a forestry drill.
A round cutter is then used to round off all the edges of the actual box.
The top of the base plate can also be rounded off.
Subsequently, the base plate is firmly glued to the base of the housing and additionally screwed on with long wood screws.
This is followed by marking and pre-drilling (2.5 mm drill bits) of the screw connection points of the loudspeaker chassis and the connection terminal.
After the housing has been cleaned of wood dust (suction / blow-out), the laying of the cable begins.
The easiest way to do this is through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the rear wall.
You push the entire and uncut cable piece by piece through the 8 mm hole in the foot to the terminal opening and let it stand out there about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the housing, the cable is guided to the loudspeaker opening and also lets it hang out loosely.
Subsequently, the crossover is prepared and used.
The design plan of the crossover, as well as the corresponding connection plan, can be found in the following document:
If the crossover is installed and the connection terminal is screwed, the sealing of the 8 mm cable opening inside the box is followed, which is not yet completely closed.
Due to the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening and with some skill, hot glue can be dripped onto the opening and thus closed.
Through the opening of the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp, the seal can be checked accordingly.
Now the damping follows according to the description.
Subsequently, the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and screwed with the corresponding screws.
Polarity plays an important role here, so that the plus line (marked cable) at the plus pole of the speaker (larger contact) must be soldered.
Finally, the bass reflex tube is shortened to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and inserted.
For damping, a mat of the damping material is cut into two parts and loosely distributed in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept free.
Can I place an order now and have it delivered at the beginning of June?
"Hello to all,
> finally we can announce that we will be hosting the OSCAST again this year!
> For well-known reasons, it is unfortunately not possible for us to get more than four people into the studio, which has meant a higher planning effort and explains the short-termity of the announcement.
BUT: There will be at least three people per turn, so we’ll be watching the 2021 Oscars with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best to avoid delay or other problems.
But hey, it’s still a pandemic – yet we will do everything we can to accompany the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
> It will start around 0:30.
Prepare drinks cold, plan good food and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
