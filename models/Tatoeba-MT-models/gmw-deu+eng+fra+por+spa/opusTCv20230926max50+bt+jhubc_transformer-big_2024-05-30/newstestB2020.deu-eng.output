Fire in French chemical plant extinguished
The major fire in a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen has been extinguished. This was announced by the prefecture of Normandy on Friday. The fire broke out during the night on Thursday. No one was injured in the incident. The fire brigade was in use with around 200 fire trucks.
The fire could be stopped.
Neighbours were asked not to leave their homes. Buildings within a radius of 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens remained closed on Thursday. The chemical plant on the banks of the Seine is producing additives for lubricants. The factory belongs to the company Lubrizol of US billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called Seveso Directive of the EU, which requires particularly strict security requirements.
About 400 people work in the plant. The chemical factory has already made headlines in the past - for example, when in 2013 the gas escaped methane thiol due to a leak and the surrounding area smelled extensively of rotten eggs. In 2015, after a plant accident, around 2,000 liters of mineral oil flowed into the city’s wastewater system.
Woman quits her job to search for her missing bitch for 57 days
For two months, a woman from Washington searched for her missing dog - and gave up her job. The seven-year-old Border Collie had escaped from the hotel room during a short break in Montana. 57 days was missing any trace of the bitch - but Carole King did not give up.
"It was terrible. I got sick," Carole King told the Daily Inter Lake. She and her husband had left bitch Katie in the hotel room while they were going for dinner. When they returned to the hotel, Katie had disappeared. They were looking for the animal, but without success.
Donner had panicked the dog
In the hope that Katie might still be in the hotel somewhere, Carole King went to the reception. "The employee says: "She left about four, four and a half hours ago," Carole King recalls to "Daily Inter Lake". When the automatic entrance door opened, Katie ran out immediately. Presumably a loud thunder had caused the dog to panic.
With flyers and calls in Facebook groups, the Kings searched for their beloved dog. But days turned into weeks. "I never gave up. I never lost hope," Carole King told the "Daily Inter Lake," who quit her job as a post employee to continue her search for Katie.
"The tears flowed"
57 days after Katie's disappearance, Carole King received a phone call: a man contacted us and said that Katie was in his yard. But when King arrived there, Katie had already disappeared. She searched the neighborhood and suddenly her bitch stood under a tree. "I just hugged her. I didn't want to let her go", King recalled according to "Daily Inter Lake". "The people were flushing in her.
Losses in the Bundeswehr: Machine guns disappear without a trace
Friday, September 27, 2019
Six MG3 machine guns have disappeared.
In recent years, the Bundeswehr has lost numerous weapons and tens of thousands of ammunition. Among them are three machine guns. The location is in most cases unclear. The opposition speaks of a "terrifying" extent.
Arms and ammunition are constantly disappearing in the Bundeswehr, many of which have so far been without a trace. Since the beginning of 2014, the troops have recorded the loss of 39 weapons, 39 arms parts and almost 20,000 ammunition. This is according to a classified list of the Federal Ministry of Defence, which is reported by the editorial network Germany.
According to the paper from the Office of the Secretary of Defense Peter Tauber of the CDU, two weapons, a part of the weapon and 3474 ammunition have so far reappeared. The still missing weapons and parts of the weapon are, among other things, six machine guns of the type MG3, eleven guns of the type G3, four guns of the type G36, six signal guns of the type P.
The extent of gun and ammunition losses in the Bundeswehr was "terrifying," said the Left-Bundestags MP Martina Renner. This is all the more true, since in the course of investigations barely anything was found again. Franco's left-wing politician spoke of a "mighty balance sheet".
Oil tanker "Stena Impero" left Iranian port
More than two months after its arrest by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" left the port of Bandar Abbas on Friday. As ship observation data from Refinitiv showed, the tanker set in motion and left the Iranian port. Port Rashid was indicated as the destination port in the United Arab Emirates.
The tanker had actually been released by the Iranian government on Monday, but it initially remained in Iranian waters. The shipping company said they wanted to wait for an official notice from Tehran.
The "Stena Impero" was launched on July 19 by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in the Strait of Hormuz under the accusation of violating security regulations, but it was suspected that Iran was responding to the controversial, temporary detention of an Iranian oil tanker in front of Britain's Gibraltar.
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the most important sea routes in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the global oil exports are shipped through the Strait. Tensions in the region have intensified immensely in recent months. Trade shipping has been dragged into the conflict between the US and Iran. Several incidents have occurred with tankers and drones.
Merkel pays tribute to the courage of the people in the peaceful revolution
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel has acknowledged the commitment of the people in the GDR who took to the streets 30 years ago during the Peaceful Revolution. In autumn 1989, courageous citizens had shaken the security of the then GDR regime, Merkel said at a ceremony of the Thuringian CDU group.
Musk aims for extradition record
Tesla’s quarter may hold records, with losses last year at the electric car company despite a delivery boom.
New York. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car company a strong boost on the stock market with the prospect of new record numbers. "We have the chance to reach our first quarter of 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by the industry blog "Electrek."
The demand is strong, so that Tesla could book 110,000 orders, the challenge is to bring the cars quickly to the customers, and to do so, Tesla must offer as many resources as possible by the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla’s shares went out of business with an increase of more than six percent. The price has not increased so strongly in almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla delivered more than 95,000 cars, reaching its previous best value.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360000 to 400000 cars. For this, six-digit figures must be obtained in the current and coming quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there were losses recently.
Mysteries solved: That's why we can't tickle ourselves
A kind of braking in the brain prevents people from tingling themselves. Scientists at Humboldt University in Berlin found out this with the help of experiments on rats, as they announced on Thursday evening. Progress was also made on the question of why children resist tingling so strongly, only to then demand more.
Finally, it was also shown why the approach of a tickling hand alone triggers laughter even before the touch. This is due to a low-lying layer in the cerebellum, which triggers the laughter even when the expectation of the tickling.
Previous research showed that rats react with ultrasonic "laughter" when tickled by humans, which is mediated by the part of the cerebral cortex that serves to centrally process haptic perception.
Laughter is suppressed during self-touch
Until now, it had been assumed that the brain could distinguish between self-contact and touch by others - that is why humans cannot tickle themselves. However, the Berlin researchers now found in the experiments on the rats that the laughter as well as the activity of the area in question of the cerebral cortex are suppressed during a self-contact. But this was also the case when the brains were strengthened to cleanse themselves by the self.
But if the self-touch and the touch by others pass at the same time, the laughter is also suppressed. This indicates that the rat’s brain cannot distinguish between the self-touch and the touch by others. The new findings suggested that people cannot tickle themselves because the self-touch activates a brake in the brain.
The rats had also been trained to tickle themselves. In doing so, they sometimes stopped this initiation in the experiment prematurely, showed flight behavior or scare rigidity. This ambivalence is similar to the behavior of the children. The ambivalence of tickle is a behavioral reaction that is the same in rats and humans.
Avoided disaster: large-scale fire in French chemical plant extinguished
The fire in a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen has been extinguished, the Normandy prefecture told AFP on Friday. The fire broke out on Thursday night.
According to authorities, no harmful substances should have escaped. The samples taken do not give any reason to worry, as Prefect Pierre-André Durand said at a press conference on Friday morning. No one was injured in the incident. The fire brigade was in use with around 200 fire trucks.
Schools and kindergartens closed
Residents were urged not to leave their homes, buildings within a radius of 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens remained closed on Thursday.

Brexit: Johnson Criticized by His Own Sister
The Prime Minister’s sister commented on Boris Johnson’s speech at the first session in Parliament after the forced break was lifted on Wednesday evening. The Prime Minister threatens to lead the country out of the EU on 31 October without an agreement if Brussels does not respond to his demands for changes to the Brexit agreement. However, how he wants to achieve that is unclear.
Regarding Cox, who had campaigned for Britain's stay in the European Union, the prime minister said: "The best way to honor Jo Cox's memory and reunify this country would be to complete the EU exit." Cox had been murdered by a right-wing extremist during the referendum campaign in 2016.
Memorial to Oslo and Utoya attacks unveiled
More than eight years after the Oslo and Utöya attacks, a memorial in honor of the victims will be unveiled in Norway on Saturday. The monument "Jernrosene" (German: the iron roses) consists of around 1,000 iron rose replicas, commemorating the roses deposited by thousands of people in the days and weeks following the attacks at the cathedral in Oslo.
At the same place the project of artists Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud will be unveiled - the roses were forged by people from all over the world, including survivors and relatives of the victims. The opening is expected among others Crown Prince Haakon and Crown Princess Mette-Marit.
Anders Behring Breivik, a right-wing terrorist, first detonated a car bomb in the Oslo government district on July 22, 2011, and subsequently shot and killed dozens of participants in a holiday camp on the island of Utöya.
Iran releases British tanker
The UN General Debate did not bring a solution to the Iran conflict. But now there is one less problem. The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" held in Iran was able to set sail again. It could be a piece of a puzzle in the peace plan of Iranian President Rohani.
The British oil tanker Stena Impero, which has been detained in the Strait of Hormuz in Iran since mid-July, is back in international waters. After being released by Iranian authorities, the ship is on its way to Dubai, as the shipping company Stena Bulk announced.
The Stena Impero has left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew are now heading to Dubai for medical examinations, among other things, said Erik H<0xC3><0xA5>nell, head of the shipping company. At noon, the ship left the Iranian waters. "It's nice that it's over," he told the Swedish television station SVT.
"This is part of a pattern of attempts to compromise the freedom of the seas, and we are working with our international partners to uphold shipping and international law," it said in a statement.
The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had now detained the tanker on July 19 on the accusation of having disregarded maritime law regulations in the Persian Gulf. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released at the beginning of September. The remaining 16 crew members may be doing well according to the circumstances, H<0xC3><0xA5>nell said. They would have been reunited with the difficult and stressful situation in the past ten weeks to behave professionally.
The British government suspected a reaction to a similar incident in Britain's Gibraltar: At the beginning of July, a supertanker with oil from Iran, which was supposedly intended for Syria, was put on the chain. The delivery, according to the authorities, violated EU sanctions against the war country Syria. The British had received the reference to the ship from the United States.
Iran spoke of "piracy" and threatened with consequences. In mid-August, the "Adrian Darya-1" was finally released. Presumptions that it was an exchange deal to get the "Stena Impero" free, London vehemently rejected.
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the most important sea routes in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the world’s oil exports are shipped through the Strait. Tensions in the region have intensified immensely in recent months. Trade shipping has been dragged into the conflict between the US and Iran. Several incidents have occurred with tankers and drones.
Behind the tensions between Tehran and Washington is the nuclear dispute between the two countries. The Americans accuse the Iranian leadership of wanting to build nuclear weapons. Iran rejects this. The US had left the international nuclear agreement in 2018 alone, which should stop Iran from building a nuclear bomb. At the same time, it is strengthening its political and economic isolation. Since then, the US government has been pushing the leadership in Tehran with massive sanctions.
Due to the dispute over the "Stena Impero" and other incidents involving tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil installations in Saudi Arabia, the US is working on a coalition for military protection of merchant ships in the region.
Iranian President Hassan Rohani presented a plan for security and peace in the Strait of Hormuz at the UN General Assembly in New York, and with the initiative "Coalition of Hope" for the Persian Gulf, Iran wants to ensure the safety of shipping in the Persian Gulf, together with the Arab Gulf states and without foreign protective powers.
India is building a better future with its protectionist economic policy.
India would actually be predestined to become a "war-winner". Given the punitive tariffs imposed by America's President Donald Trump on Chinese producers, foreign producers in the People's Republic are forced to re-dispose. Financial chiefs of Asian companies, who are considering relocating their production from China to another country, call India in a survey by UBS as one of India's preferred alternatives.
But now India itself has fallen into Trump’s focus. Deprecatingly labelled as “the kingdom of tariffs” by the White House, America withdrew trade incentives for 2,000 products from the emerging market at the beginning of June. The US accuses India of prohibitively high tariffs and demands better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motorcycles and more.
On the world map of trade wars, however, the frictions with India are only a side-scene. In addition, America considers the world's largest democracy also through the security policy glasses. Delhi and Washington combine concerns about China's claims to power in the South Indian Ocean. Against this background, a surge of American punitive tariffs against India is therefore unlikely.
The problem, however, lies in another place: the empirically reinforced thesis that open markets are accelerating economic development, has a heavy standing in the Socialist Republic of India. Even under modes. His zeal for reform is mainly aimed at the bureaucratic madness, which for too long has stifled any kind of entrepreneurial spirit in the multi-ethnic state. Companies with con-
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. From an economic point of view, many things have turned for the better in India in the first five modes years. However, in trade policy, this does not apply. Inspired by protecting internationally uncompetitive companies from foreign suppliers, the national conservative government even erected new barriers.
In the West, Modi is attached to the nimbus of the energetic reformer Jandis, who is economically radically renewing his country. This impression is not least due to the fact that the charismatic prime minister knows all too well what vocabulary Western managers like. At the core, however, the "India First" advocate was never resigned from a protectionist economic policy, which prevents these Indian companies from being forced to resign themselves to the party.
Burial of Jacques Chirac on Monday in Paris
Former French President Jacques Chirac is expected to be buried in Paris next week. The former head of state will be buried on Monday at the Montparnasse cemetery in the south of the French capital, the AFP news agency reported, citing the Chiracs family. The funeral will take place in the close family circle. A public funeral ceremony was scheduled for Sunday in Paris invalidity.
Dabo is the first secret hero of the athletics world championship
The top of the world had long been in the goal, when the cooled down Khalifa International stadium already had enough heart-warming scenes. In the first run of the men over 5000 meters, Jonathan Busby from Aruba began to swing dangerously. He could hardly stop well 300 meters before the goal on his feet, ran in unhealthy bent posture, as the Braima Suncar Dabo from the West African countryside would have been to him.
"I just wanted to help him. Everybody in this situation would have done the same," said Dabo after the race in Mixed Zone, when he unexpectedly attracted the attention of the assembled journalists. Shyly he first evaded, did not want to talk about his heroic deed. After all, he was invited to run under his personal best and when he realized that this would be difficult, he would have been proud of being able to help my fellow country.
He did so that evening with force - and much more intensely than he might have imagined. Because this heroic deed will be remembered. Especially since Dabo even left his competitor Busby ahead of the finish line and voluntarily took the last place - by the way, well five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega, who won this lead.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and studies there in Lisbon, had competed to set a personal best time at the World Cup in Doha. Although according to official data, he managed with 18:10.87 minutes, he was still disappointed: "I wanted to run 17:55 minutes. Under 18 minutes I have already been". However, only in training, as best times do not count.
Egyptians prepare for wild protest day
In Egypt, security measures have been stepped up in the run-up to possible government-critical protests. A reinforced police presence was observed in the centre of Cairo on Friday. Several subway stations remained closed, roads around the central Tahrir square were closed.
Already in recent days, the police had strengthened their street controls and searched the cell phones of pedestrians in part for messages and photos related to the protests. Hundreds had been arrested according to two non-governmental organizations.
Opponents of Al-Sisi
The past weekend, however, it was called to the embassy in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura to protest with hundreds of participants. They were directed against the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who criticize corruption and mismanagement. A protest so open against the political leadership had not been in Egypt for years. The Egyptian contractor and actor in exile in Spain, Mohammed Ali, has come to the Facebook
The number of arrests in connection with the protests continued to rise, according to two groups of observers. The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) counted more than 1,570 arrests as of Friday. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and the human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW) said more than 2,000 arrests. Also, these figures could not be confirmed independently. The government confirmed and did not comment on the figures.
Arbitrary arrests
Many people have been "arbitrarily detained" "only because they were 'in the wrong place at the wrong time'," HRW said, citing lawyers. According to their lawyers, the allegations against the detainees range from "distribution of false information" to membership in a "terrorist association", but also inquiries about clothing in Cairo, Alexandria and other cities.
HRW also criticized the censorship in the North African country, which has blocked websites and online services in Cairo to stop further protests against Sisi.
Online retailers: mail order retailers should be able to donate returns more easily
For online retailers, many returned parcels are lost goods. Around 20 million returns end up in the garbage. But there is an alternative.
The Treasury has shown online retailers like Amazon and Zalando a way to donate returned products instead of destroying them.
Although the companies cannot be exempted from VAT on donations in kind, the ministry explained on a question of the Greens parliamentary group, which the newspapers of the Funke media group reported on Friday, but the traders could set the market value of the unselling returns so low that they would have to pay no or only little VAT.
Scientists at the University of Bamberg had determined that when ordering on the Internet, German citizens return every sixth package. Around four percent of the goods - around 20 million products - subsequently ended up in the garbage. Donating them would cost companies additional money according to the current legal situation, because the tax authorities evaluate donations as a turnover, which then incurs VAT.
Green Group leader Katrin Göring-Eckardt called on Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to clarify in a decree that companies can not evaluate products for sale accordingly and donate free of charge to non-profit organizations. The companies should be able to rely on not being punished for donating. This applies not only for online commerce, but also for other businesses.
Banksy art for auction: There has never been a better time to sell this painting
Street art star Banksy's famous work, "Devolved Parliament", is due to be auctioned soon.
For Branczik, Banksy's work underscores "the regression of the world's oldest parliamentary democracy to the animal and tribal stance". From Saturday, the painting will be exhibited at Sotheby's in the British capital until it is auctioned on 3 October. It is estimated at 1.5 to two million euros.
The work was first exhibited in 2009 at the Museum of Bristol in southwestern Britain, where Banksy lives. That year, the artist had re-exhibited the painting - at the same time as the original Brexit date on March 29. On this occasion, the work, formerly called "Question Hour", was renamed "Devolved Parliament".
The picture could change ownership for a million dollars.
On Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson held the first session of the House of Commons following the suspension of a mandatory break by the Supreme Court. Johnson wants to carry out the already twice postponed Brexit on 31 October, if necessary, even without an agreement with the EU.
This is not the first time Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, has been involved in the Brexit debate. In Dover in southeastern England, he painted a picture depicting a man breaking a star of the European flag with a chisel. The work sees thousands of truck drivers and other visitors entering the UK daily.
Brexit debate is like a “walk in the park”
The fierce verbal attacks by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Brexit opponents in parliament do not contribute to a climate of hatred, according to his top adviser. Compared to the 2016 Brexit referendum campaign, the current controversy is a "walk in the park," Dominic Cummings said at a book show on Friday. "We're enjoying this. We're going to leave (the EU) and we're going to win."
Johnson had harshly attacked Brexit opponents in parliament in recent days and accused them of, among other things, "treason" to the people, accusations that he could put the MPs in danger because they could be the target of death threats, he dismissed as "humbug".
Cummings said the only way to rest is if MEPs finally respect Britain's decision to leave the EU, and it's not surprising that people are upset that Britain still hasn't left the EU three years after the referendum.
In view of the charged mood, even the bishops of the Anglican Church called for restraint on Friday. "We should talk to each other with respect," it said in a statement. "And we should listen, too."
Pakistani Prime Minister Khan calls for UN intervention in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan called on the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict once again during his first appearance before the UN General Assembly.
If not, another war between Pakistan and India is likely, Khan said at the UN General Debate in New York on Friday. "If this goes bad, you hope for the best, but be prepared for the worst." The United Nations would have a responsibility for Kashmir. "You should have prevented that."
India and Pakistan have waged three wars since their independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two of them around the divided region of Kashmir. Both nuclear powers each control one part of Kashmir, another part belongs to China. At the beginning of August, India had withdrawn autonomy status from the Indian Kashmir region, thereby increasing tensions in relation to Pakistan abruptly.
Not even a bottle of water
The protesters in Cairo are calling for the overthrow of Egyptian President al-Sisi.
Against the current protests in Egypt, the government reacts with a hard hand. It fires with sharp ammunition on the population, over 2,000 detainees join in the prisons to the 60,000 political prisoners already incarcerated there. Protesting has never been safe in Egypt. But since the assumption of power by General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in the spring of 2013, the state apparatus is doing everything to avoid
But one of the triggers for the 2011 protests was the poor economic situation. Poverty, lack of prospects and the feeling of being suffocated by one’s own government drove millions out on the streets. And this is a problem that the regime of el-Sisi does not manage, no matter how hard it is against opponents. The situation has even worsened.
Today, one in three people in Egypt lives below the poverty line. Since 2016, the currency has lost more than half of its value, the inflation rate is ten percent. Anyone who wants to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket must decide who he finances: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The latter is not only responsible for the suppression but also the largest economic actor. The military has built roads, houses, football stadiums, produces and food.
Tüv tests in the terminal: BER-Chef: No more "showstoppers" for the capital airport
For two months, it was checked whether the complicated system mesh in the BER fire protection system works in interaction. The operators are satisfied with the course. But the Tüv is not yet finished at the BER.
After large-scale TÜV tests at the terminal of the future capital airport, the operators have confirmed the planned opening in October next year. This is certain, said Chairman of the Supervisory Board Rainer Bretschneider after a meeting of the supervisory board.
Airport chief Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successful completion of the test, but also said that there were still deficiencies in the terminal. "We have many details, but we do not have a real show stopper", he assured, the schedule for commissioning still contains buffers.
However, there are indications that the time reserve should no longer be too large. The construction completion announcement is now to be submitted to the construction office during the first quarter of 2020. At the beginning of the year, this was planned for this autumn.
Hundreds of deficiencies in power cables still have to be rectified; the TÜV wants to examine them until February. "In order to create the conditions for the start of flight operations, intensive work must continue on the settlement of the deficiencies," it said in a written notice.
Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases it is about missing evidence, less about new cables. There is also no release for all the dowels on which the cable paths hang. The airport manager expects them to be available by the end of the year.
In addition, the fire protection at the transition to the station below the terminal is not working satisfactorily. The problems had already led the project to another crisis three years ago. This time it is about smoke aprons that shut down in the event of a fire like a canvas so that the smoke does not spread. They run too far down. 36 engines therefore have to be replaced. Then there will be new tests with hot gas smoke at the beginning of the year.
Problems with fire protection and other tree defects as well as planning errors have delayed the opening of the airport for years. It was originally scheduled to go into operation in 2011. The costs increased from two billion euros since construction began in 2006 to approximately 6.5 billion euros expected to open next year.
Since the number of passengers in Berlin has risen significantly since then, the authorities are planning the expansion of the airport, which is why it will be in a special meeting of the Supervisory Board on 18 October, as the chairman Bretschneider announced.
The airport company is now looking for two new managing directors. Chief Financial Officer Heike Fölster is moving to Deutsche Bahn at the end of the year, Chief Human Resources Officer Manfred Bobke-von Camen is going to retire next year, Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster. She has put the airport finances on firm feet.
Chemnitz: A vending machine exploded for drugs - police arrest man
He needed money for drugs - and for this he exploded several machines in the Chemnitz city area! Now the perpetrator is finally in custody!
Over the past two years, the number of exploded cigarette and parking ticket machines in Chemnitz and the region has risen sharply.
After two explosions in late May, the police captured a 33-year-old German on the Bürgerstraße and on the Further Straße in Chemnitz.
Police spokesman Andrzej Rydzik: "In the course of the investigation into the inducement of explosive explosions in unit of action with particularly serious case of theft led by the Chemnitz criminal police, not only this suspicion against the 33-year-old confirmed itself."
Confronted with the new evidence, the 33-year-old Chemnitzer now confessed a total of eight acts.
The police spokesman: "It seems that he financed his addiction to narcotics with the loot" The bomber had blown up parking machines on the Bürgerstraße on four occasions between 20 August 2018 and 31 May 2019.
The total damage incurred amounts to at least 60,000 euros!
The automaton bomber is now in custody, and the police are continuing to investigate him.
It is conceivable that he was also responsible for further automaton blasts in Chemnitz and neighboring districts.
AUA takes over Eurowings flights from Vienna
In the midst of the price battle with low-cost airlines such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, the Lufthansa subsidiary AUA will take over "the commercial management of all Eurowings flights from Vienna," a press spokesperson for Austrian Airlines told APA on Friday.
The Vienna base of the Lufthansa low-cost airline Eurowings will thus de facto be dissolved. Four of the current seven Eurowings aircraft will remain in Vienna. This will take over the AUA from January 2020 in the "Wetlease", i.e. including Eurowings personnel. In the future, three Eurowings jets will be stationed in Salzburg, which will fly from Salzburg and Innsbruck as charter aircraft to holiday destinations. Routes from Vienna to Germany will be taken over by Eurowings
The Eurowings base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA hub and network planning, the spokesperson said. The flight times will be coordinated with connecting flights. The aim is to strengthen the Vienna hub on the one hand and to expand decentralized traffic from the federal states on the other.
As AviationNetOnline writes, Eurowings only serves in Vienna as a "Production Company" for the Group sister AUA. Thus, among other things, Barcelona and Rome would be operated with AUA flight number, but mainly with Eurowings device. Although the on-board product should be adapted to that of Austrian Airlines, the pilots and flight attendants come from Eurowings. According to the Eurowings.
Laudamotion, a subsidiary of Ryanair, announced on Thursday that it would increase the fleet in Vienna to 16 aircraft next summer. The Irish low-cost airline will send four Ryanair aircraft and crews to Vienna, also in the so-called "wetlease", which the trade union criticized as an circumvention construct to the collective agreement.
Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary's statement that Lauda will have overtaken the AUA in five years, AUA CEO Andreas Otto said on Friday: "We remain the number one on the site, in five, six or ten years."
Queen's granddaughter Princess Beatrice is engaged
Beatrice, Eugenie, William and Harry: When they were kids, the cousins were the best friends. Now the last of the four gets married. Beatrice is engaged!
Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi (34), a British royal, is reported to have paused for the hand of his girlfriend Princess Beatrice (31), during the holidays in Italy at the beginning of the month.
“We are extremely excited to announce our engagement, we are both so excited to start this adventure together and can’t wait to actually be married,” the couple, who have been together since October 2018, said in a statement.
“We share so many similar interests and values and we know that this will help us a lot in the coming years full of love and happiness.”
Sister Eugenie snapped the pictures
The official engagement photos have been taken by her sister, Princess Eugenie (29), and also published on her Instagram account.
A Royal Feast
The wedding is scheduled to take place in 2020. More information on date, location and everything else will be announced by the palace in the coming months.
What is certain, however, is that the marriage of the number nine of the British succession to the real estate magnate will be a celebration similar to the wedding of Eugenie on 12 October 2018 with Jack Brooksbank (33).
Study on causes of heart disease
Smoking, obesity, unhealthy diet - there are risk factors for cardiovascular disease. But what really triggers a heart failure or a heart attack? Hamburg researchers now want to take a closer look at the genetics of 9,000 healthy and sick people.
By analyzing the genetic material of 9,000 people, Hamburgers and Swiss scientists want to find out in more detail the causes of cardiovascular disease.
The research project is the largest of its kind in the German-speaking region, the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) announced on Friday. The Kühne Foundation funds the project with 12.5 million euros. From Switzerland, the Davos High Mountain Hospital, which belongs to the foundation, and the University Hospital Zurich are involved.
Obesity, smoking and an unhealthy diet are among the key risk factors that can be influenced by cardiovascular disease. Genetic factors contribute to the risk. However, the interaction between genes and external influences is insufficiently known, it said. Now the scientists want to compare the complete genetic material of 8,000 healthy people with that of 1,000 former patients of the University Heart and Vascular Center at the UKE.
Currently, more than 4,000 of the approximately 20,000 relevant human genes are known to cause possible disease-causing changes in DNA - so-called mutations -, said the clinic.
According to the initiators, the goal of the five-year project is to develop new options for the prevention, detection and treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure and heart attacks. The data could also be useful in the study of other common diseases, according to Stefan Blankenberg, head of the University Heart and Vascular Center. New findings on the interaction between heart and brain, heart and kidney are possible.
The chairman of the Kühne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), also stressed that there is a strong will to use the data also for the research of other diseases. The clinic of the foundation in Davos so far mainly treats allergies. Now on the medical campus there should be gratefully a Center for Cardiovascular Precision Medicine and a professorship open on bioinformatics were created in Hamburg.
The organic samples of the healthy participants come from Hamburgers, who are also participating in the "Hamburg City Health Study". According to the clinic, this is the largest local health study in the world according to 45,000 subjects. In the genetic decryption, strict attention is paid to the protection of the anonymized data, the scientists assured. It is about one petabyte (1000 terabytes) of data, said Holger Moch of the University.
According to UKE, a human’s genetic material can be deciphered within 24 hours today. The purely material costs for this would be 1300 euros. The first gene sequencing worldwide, whose results were published in 2001, still cost several hundred million euros. The study is scheduled to start on October 1st, by the end of 2020 all 9,000 samples should be analyzed. The first results are expected in the year following.
Nigerian police rescue hundreds of abused boys
In Nigeria, police have released more than 300 boys tortured and abused from a Koran school. According to information from local residents, security forces searched the school in the northern Nigerian city of Kaduna and discovered some of the minor victims, police spokesman Yakubu Sabo said. "The victims were abused. Some of them reported to have been raped by their teachers", Sabo said.
Sabo said the boys had been detained under the pretext of being taught and "improved" in the Qur'an. In fact, the protégés had been detained by their teachers in "the most degrading and inhumane conditions," Sabo said. About a hundred students, including children aged nine, had been chained up in a small room.
The Koran school existed for about ten years. Local residents had alerted the authorities to repeated irregularities in the facility. The parents had shown shock when they were taught about the conditions in the Koran school, Sabo said. They had no idea of the suffering of their children. The operator and six employees were arrested according to the police.
There are many private Koran schools in the predominantly Muslim north of Nigeria, replacing the often deficient state facilities. People in the region suffer from frequent attacks by armed gangs. According to the UN Refugee Agency, more than 40,000 people have fled across the border to the neighboring state of Niger in the past ten months.
Chained and tortured: Nigerian police free 400 children from school
“Many of them were chained and some had visible injuries indicating torture,” police spokesman Yakubu Sabo said.
There, the children had been discovered on Thursday after a hint in an Islamic-style school. The conditions there had been "unhumane". The officials arrested the school principal and six teachers after the liberation action.
The children, all boys, were held as slaves at their school and put in chains. Some were sexually abused. TV images showed slimmed and injured pupils in a noticeably poor state of health.
World soccer election: Further accusations after Messis and Klopp's release
Football "Signature not valid"
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe awarded
With a gala in Milan, the FIFA World Football Federation honors the best player, the best player and the best coach of the year. For Lionel Messi, it is the sixth honor and thus a record.
After Nicaragua's captain declared that he had never voted in the world football election, accusations come from other countries to FIFA. Egypt was not rated at all - with a curious reason.
In recent years, many things have turned out to be inappropriate at FIFA: the World Cup awards, the dubious plans of its president Gianni Infantino, the general behavior of various corrupt officials. However, the FIFA World Football Election has so far not been suspected of being unscrupulous.
But after Nicaragua’s captain had already complained that he had not voted at all, further inconsistencies are now revealed: Egypt complains that the votes of national coach Hossam El-Badry and captain Mohamed Salah were not taken into account. In fact, they do not appear in the official and publicly visible vote overview.
FIFA apologizes for the fact that "the signatures on the election forms were in uppercase letters and were therefore not valid" and has contacted the Egyptian federation several times to clarify the situation - without answer.
Sudan's coach also surprised
While the situation in the case of Egypt is understandable, the Sudanese association states that coach Zdravko Lugarisic did not vote as it was finally rated: with Lionel Messi in first place, Virgil van Dijk in second place and Sadio Mané in third place. According to Fifa, however, the vote was equally received by officials, with subscripts, and with subscripts.
Nicaraguan captain Juan Barrera had also been accused: "I did not vote for the #TheBest2019 Awards. All details about my vote are false, thank you," he wrote. In his case, it was suspected that the Nicaraguan football federation voted simply on his behalf.
The association announced on Friday that it was right, but of course it was not intentional. The completed ballot papers were "erroneously" provided with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan selection, according to a statement from the association. However, according to the official statement of the association, "the second captain, Manuel Rosas, was actually elected.
The other cases have now been examined by FIFA in an investigation, but emphasizes that the election process was externally supervised by the consulting firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers.As long as Lionel Messi remains the undisputed winner of the world football election - and Jürgen Klopp World Coach of the Year.
Ukraine affair: rank-high Republicans speak out for official investigation
Two senior Republicans have openly called for an official investigation against US President and party friend Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important," said Vermont state Republican Governor Phil Scott. "Where this leads from here is determined by the facts that are established". He wants to know more about the whistleblower's affair before action can be taken.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations, which showed that Trump had repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyj in a phone call to investigate the activities of Democratic presidential candidate and former vice president Joe Biden in Ukraine. According to Scott, Trump has been watching Biden "for years".
The Republicans have been reluctant to criticize Trump for the whistleblower affair so far, but few have expressed discomfort about it. Scott’s comments are now a first sign of this in Trump’s party, with the moderate governor of Virginia having repeatedly opposed Trump’s policies, such as the loosening of environmental regulations and the tightening of immigration regulations.
"It's a deeply disturbing situation," Baker said. "The right approach and responsibility for Congress now is to investigate the matter and get it to the bottom."
Scott and Baker, as governors of U.S. states, formally have no say in the case against Trump, which is being decided by Congress. Their statements are, therefore, above all symbolically important. Nevertheless, even the first senators of the Republicans have commented critically on the situation. For example, Mitt Romney, who represents the state of Utah in the second parliamentary chamber, said first reporting on the case was "extrepid, deeply disturbing the U.
The case could lead to the launch of impeachment proceedings against Trump, the Democrats in the House of Representatives have announced an investigation on the matter, accusing him of abuse of power for the purpose of foreign influence for his own political benefit.
There is no precise timetable for the impeachment procedure. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could file a so-called impeachment. However, the decision about an actual impeachment was taken in the Senate, where Trump’s Republicans have the majority. The prospects of such a procedure being successful are therefore low. So far, no US president has been enforced by an impeachment procedure.
Were torturers on board Rackete's "Sea Watch"?
Three men have been arrested in Sicily, allegedly raping and murdering in Libyan refugee camps.
German captain Carola Rackete, 31, had been arrested in June after she had unlawfully boarded the rescue ship "Sea Watch 3" and 53 Libyan refugees on board the port of Lampedusa. After fierce protests and international criticism - also by Austrian Federal President Alexander van der Bellen - her house arrest was lifted after a few days by an Italian judge.
Now there are new serious allegations against Rackete. For example, three men accused of torture in Libyan refugee camps could have arrived in Italy with the "Sea-Watch 3". The suspects have been arrested in a reception camp in Messina, Sicily, after German migrants recognized their tormentors in Italy.
The police said in mid-September that the suspects in the North African country had been raped, tortured and even murdered. They were Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). "The migrants were systematically harassed and exposed to atrocities - by repeated and constant physical violence", said the statement.
NGOs and aid organizations are now pointing out that they cannot know exactly who comes on the ships. "We can't scan who the people are. They come without passports," Neugebauer said. Torture is one of the main reasons why the people flee from Libya. It is therefore quite likely that perpetrators are also on the ships. "It is therefore very important that this is investigated".
Italy's right-wing former interior minister Matteo Salvini called for an immediate apology from Rackete, who is still under investigation in Italy for aid to illegal immigration.
Musk aims for Tesla deliveries record
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given its electric car company a strong boost on the stock market with the prospect of new record numbers.
“We have a chance to reach our first quarter of 100,000 deliveries,” Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by the industry blog “Electrek.”
The demand is strong, so that Tesla could book 110,000 orders, the challenge is to bring the cars quickly to the customers, and to do so, Tesla must offer as many resources as possible by the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla’s shares went out of business with an increase of more than six percent. The price hasn’t gained so much in almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla delivered more than 95,000 cars, reaching its previous best value.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. For this, six-digit figures must be obtained in the current and next quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there were losses recently.
U.S. Budget Controversy: Only Bridge Financing Again
The new fiscal year will begin in the US on October 1st without a proper budget. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and decided on transitional funding until November 21st.
Although the U.S. Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August on an increase in spending ceilings for the fiscal years 2020 and 2021, the United States is once again without spending plans before the new fiscal year that begins on October 1. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and has passed a resolution on Trump’s transitional funding (Continuing Resolution, CR) until November 21. Without such a decision, it would have been part of a shutdown on Monday.
Shutdown Avoided
For the time being, the Federal Administration is now being financed at the level and in accordance with the priorities of the expenditure plans for the financial year 2019 to come to an end on Monday. This is because Congress has not been able to agree in time on the 12 expenditure laws that allocate the funds to the various departments and authorities. The Federal Administration can therefore not benefit from the expanded expenditure framework for the new financial year from 1.3 Bio. to 1.4 Bio. $.
The Democrats have completed ten of the twelve bills in the House of Representatives, where they have the majority. But the spending laws reflect Democrats' priorities, which have little chance in the Republican-dominated Senate. Conversely, the Senate has also more or less prepared ten of the twelve spending plans, which are barely majority-capable.
In the Senate, the Republicans seem to be trying to force $12 billion for the construction of the wall, one of President Trump’s major priorities. The Democrats are interfering with the wall plans and their financing, which had actually been intended for other military buildings and projects. The dispute about the construction of the wall had already led to a downturn in December 2018.
On the wall building, the spirits separate
At present, it is unclear how the parties want to get closer on this issue. More likely than an agreement on all twelve spending laws in the coming seven weeks is an extension of transitional funding beyond November 21. Also, a shutdown is not excluded.
Against the background of Congress’ persistent inability to agree on the twelve spending laws in time, and the associated risk of a shutdown, ideas for automating the process are gaining popularity. Subject S. 1877 to avoid shutdowns, funding for the federal administration would automatically continue at the level of the previous year, stopping the travel activities of parliamentarians and withholding their wages until the new annual bills.
France allows artificial insemination for lesbians and singles
In France, artificial insemination is to be open to women and lesbians living alone: The Paris National Assembly voted by a large majority in favour of a government bill that allows all women to use in vitro insemination, thereby significantly increasing the demand for anonymous sperm donations.
The proposal still needs the approval of the Senate. In the three-day emotional debate, critics in the right-wing camp had warned that in the future many "children without a father" could grow up. The French Bishops' Conference is also against the innovation.
The new regulation is the core of a bioethics law, which Minister of Health Agnès Buzyn defended as an "opportunity" for society. It depicts the modern family, in which there are children with only one parent or with gay parents. According to her, the costs of artificial insemination should be borne for all women by the social security system.
Insemination with sperm of dead husband further banned
On the other hand, by a narrow majority, the National Assembly rejected an amendment that should give widows access to the semen of their dead husbands for artificial insemination. In Belgium, Spain and the United Kingdom, artificial insemination is allowed "post-mortem". In Germany, there have been cases in the past in which women complained in vain about the release of the semen of a deceased.
Many members of the governing party La République en Marche (LREM) of President Emmanuel Macron and members of the opposition were in favour of artificial insemination with the sperm of the deceased partner. They stressed that a widow would be imposed a "double mourning" if her husband's death would also leave her desire to have children unfulfilled.
The initiators of the now unsuccessful amendment consider it unfair that a widow can be fertilized with the semen of an unknown person in the future, but not with that of her own partner.
So far, artificial insemination in France is only allowed for heterosexual couples who cannot have children. They must be married or live together for at least two years. Buzyn had already announced in the summer that surrogacy would continue to be prohibited.
In Germany, artificial insemination is theoretically open to all women - it is nevertheless often difficult for single or lesbian couples.
Compensation for the climate: calls for flight levy for universities get louder
A lot is flown at the universities. That is why the country wants to have a climate tax paid there in the future. The rectors say they have no money for it. But now they are also under internal pressure.
The universities should also restrict themselves when flying. Photo: dpa/Julian Stratenschulte
The discussion about a climate tax on flights from universities and colleges, which was initially postponed before the summer break, is said to be still in motion again. After the State Rectors' Conference had reacted skeptically to a corresponding push from the green-black coalition, the plans now receive support from the universities. In a joint statement, the doctoral students of six Baden-Württemberg universities and a pedagogical university are called for a
Russia again arrests North Korean fishermen
According to the FSB intelligence service, the detainees were illegally fishing in Russian waters. Ten days earlier, 161 fishermen from North Korea had been arrested. At the time, there was an exchange of shots between the border guards and the boat crew. Three Russians and a North Korean were injured, the fisherman later succumbed to his serious injuries, but this time there were no injuries, it said.
The communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages, and the North Korean fishermen were traveling in Russian territorial waters, where the Russian Coast Guard patrols to protect its marine biological resources.
30,000 squids seized
During the renewed inspections, 30,000 squids were discovered on the boats and confiscated, and three fishing boats and two motor boats were confiscated and taken to Nachodka and Posjet near Vladivostok.
Russia's fisheries authority had not issued fishing licences to North Koreans this year, even after complaints by local entrepreneurs. According to media, thousands of North Korean fishermen have been detained there temporarily this year.
The head of the Association of Russian Fisheries Companies in the Far Eastern region of Primorye, Georgi Martynov, recently also complained of high ecological damage by the North Korean fishermen. They fished with narrow-mesh synthetic nets banned in Russia, which would also bring small living creatures out of the sea. In addition, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea, where it would take 200 years for them to be destroyed.
In the future, only 18,000: US lowers asylum ceiling
The "most generous nation in history": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police officials in the White House.
The richest country in the world is protecting refugees: As the State Department confirms in Washington, the limit for the legal ingress of refugees will be further lowered. In the future, especially threatened believers and Iraqis will receive asylum.
The U.S. government wants to reduce the already historically low limit for the reception of new refugees again. In the 2020 marketing year, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, a maximum of 18,000 people should be allowed into the country, according to the U.S. State Department. In the now almost expired marketing year, the limit is still 30,000 people.
The administration of President Donald Trump has drastically reduced the willingness to receive refugees from all over the world in recent years, with far higher admission limits under the predecessor government of Barack Obama.
The targeted limit of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the introduction of the U.S. refugee program in 1980, but the State Department called the U.S. “the most merciful and generous nation in history,” a phrase that strongly recalls the language used by the incumbent U.S. president.
A "responsible approach" to refugees is aimed at allowing refugees to return to their home countries to help rebuild their homelands, Trump said. For his tough course in migration policy, he receives a lot of praise from supporters, but there are also massive criticisms.
A major issue is the border with Mexico, which Trump wants to lock down. In order to finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had imposed the National Emergency. Whether there is a temporal link between the current measure and the current domestic political developments in the US capital is unclear. Trump is currently under pressure due to the Selenskyj affair and a potentially threatening impeachment.
According to the State Department, the US government wants to focus on the reception of two groups of refugees in the future: people who are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and are thus in danger, according to the State Department's statement.
In particular, the United States wants people from this "northern triangle" of Central America to apply for asylum in other countries, with the United States concluding migration agreements with Guatemala and now El Salvador and Honduras to curb immigration at the US southern border to Mexico.
Court orders release of orangutan from zoo
At the request of the Argentine judiciary, an orangutan female has been transferred from the former Buenos Aires zoo to a human ape shelter in the United States. The "Sandra" born in Rostock Zoo in 1986 was granted the rights of a "non-human person", so her release was mandatory. The animal was brought to Dallas on Thursday evening by direct flight - but not as a passenger, but in the cargo room An André
Since the 53-kilogram-pound man-office is unable to adapt to wildlife, it is expected to live in the open enclosure of the Center for Great Apes in Florida. There are already 21 more orangutans and 31 chimpanzees, including "Bubbles", a former pet of pop star Michael Jackson. However, before moving into Florida, "Sandra" has to be around 40 years old.
"Sandra" spent several years after her birth in Rostock in the former Ruhr Zoo in Gelsenkirchen, before being moved to Buenos Aires in 1995. The "Sandra's" fundamental rights trial, initiated by animal rights activists in 2014, helped to transform the zoo of Buenos Aires into an ecopark, where a research and education center for the preservation of biodiversity is to be built by 2023.
Swiss record for extreme climbers: 550 metres in 46 minutes
The extreme mountaineer Dani Arnold has succeeded in a new hussarian ride on the almost 3000-meter-high Großer Zinn in the Italian Alps.
Without a net, double floor or other aids, the Swiss conquered the 550-metre-high north face of the Great Tin in a new record time.
Dressed with jeans, t-shirt and only supported by absolute freedom from dizziness, Arnold took 46 minutes and 30 seconds to climb, undercutting the old record by almost 19 minutes.
Arnold is now the record holder in the Free Solo Speed on four of the six most important European north walls.
Nike Benefits from New Online Marketing Strategy
Despite the trade conflict with China, the U.S. sports goods manufacturer Nike has recorded a significant increase in profits. Net profit rose to 1.4 billion dollars (nearly 1.3 billion euros) in the past quarter. This is 25 percent more than in the same period of the previous year, the group announced on Tuesday. This is mainly due to the new marketing strategy "Nike Direct", with which the Adidas competitor directly addresses its customers online.
Sales rose to $10.7 billion in the three-month period until the end of August, the strongest in China, with a 22 percent increase in Nike sales. The Beaverton-based company in the U.S. state of Oregon also benefited from its approach to addressing consumers directly via the Internet or smartphone apps.
Chief Financial Officer Andy Campion announced that Nike will continue to drive the “digital transformation” of the sports goods manufacturer through strategic investments, thereby expanding its competitive advantage. Investors were pleased to respond to the quarterly figures – the sports goods manufacturer’s shares rose by more than five percent.
Lifelong stadium ban due to racism in Italy
Due to racist comments about football professional Juan Jesus of AS Rome, the club from the Italian capital has imposed a lifelong stadium ban on a fan. The Brazilian defender Jesus had been insulted by the fan on Instagram. Jesus then published the private news and asked his club to take action. "<0x40>officialasroma AS, you already know what to do with a FanR.
The club responded late Thursday. He reported the fan's account to Instagram and the police. In addition, the Roma supporters were never allowed to attend a match of the club again, the club wrote on Twitter.
Racism is a problem in Italian football. Italian fans regularly chant racist insults against black players of rival teams. "We cannot have racism in society or in sport. In Italy, the situation has not improved, and that is very serious. You have to identify the responsibles and throw them out of the stadiums", FIFA president Gianni Infantino said on the weekend. The occasion of the racist mountain were at the first Sunday party
The Italian authorities have now banned 38 raging fans of record-breaking Juventus Turin from entering the stadium. Four of them are no longer allowed to enter the stadium for a period of ten years, the police said. For the rest, there are bans of four to seven years.
The fans are linked to ongoing investigations against twelve leaders of ultra-fan groups in the vicinity of Juventus. The twelve are accused of heavy extortion, money laundering and private violence, among others. The club had launched the investigation with a complaint last year.
According to Italian media reports, the ultra-leaders are said to be behind the black-trade with tickets. They had "military control of the ticket trade for the fan curve" and were said to have blackmailed Juventus employees to get cheaper tickets.
Generation Z: Are they really different from Generation Y?
Millennials are narcissistic, the generation Z is political - whole vintages are given handy names. If you look more closely, the awards are full of contradictions. So how well do these labels describe the respective way of life of young people?
"The Crabs are Coming!" With this call, on September 21st, the Crab Catch at Lake Gucheng in Gaochun officially launched, which also ushered in the opening event of the 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival, as announced by the Nanjing-Gaochun District Committee's Public Relations Department.
Gaochun, which forms the southern foothills of Nanjing in the province of Jiangsu, is one of the national environmental zones. The city is the first international "slow city" in China and here is also the Chinese seat of the international "slow city" movement. The city has ideal ecological conditions with a mixture of "30 percent mountains, 20 percent water areas and 50 percent fields are rich. The great natural environment of Gaun offers all
The people of Gaochun started breeding crabs as early as the 1990s. Over time, the crab industry has developed into a formative industry that provided high incomes and has become an important part of the economic development of Gaochun. In recent years, Gaochun has been actively concerned with large-scale, ecological and scientific development of crab breeding.
In recent years, Gaochun has promoted a reform to "sharing power, optimizing administration and government services" and has carefully set up the service network for "licenses under one roof, a team for law enforcement, a network for services, a lending platform" to fully optimize the environment for licensing, services and development.
Gaochun continues to exploit the advantages of local tourism by connecting to the southern Jiangsu and the southern Anhui region, and to promote the development of the development zone and its position as an international "slow city" as a flagship, to provide intelligent high-end production facilities, companies for biomedical and medical technology, for energy storage and environmental protection, from the cultural and health sectors as well as farms for organic agriculture, which are to lead here in the "3+"
Conflict between Iran and USA: Rohani speaks of end of sanctions - Trump contradicts
Iranian President Hassan Rohani has spoken on his return from the UN General Assembly of an alleged offer by the United States to lift sanctions. The United States, in return for talks with Tehran's leadership, had called for an end to all sanctions, said Rohani on his official website.
US President Donald Trump tweeted: “Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on him so there would be a meeting. I said, of course, no.”
According to Rohani, Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron were present in New York, urging a meeting to take place. "And America says I lift the sanctions," added Rohani. The type of punitive measures that should be ended has stood for debate. "And they have clearly said, we all lift sanctions".
However, the move did not take place in an acceptable manner, said Ruhani, who could not predict the outcome of negotiations, given the sanctions in place and "the poisoned atmosphere of maximum pressure".
At the beginning of the week, Chancellor Angela Merkel met with Ruhani in New York. Background was the hope of the Europeans to save the nuclear agreement with Iran negotiated with Russia and China. This is to prevent the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. France President Emmanuel Macron had expressed hope, like Merkel on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, that Ruhani will meet with US President Donald Trump.
Severe earthquake near Istanbul - nearly 200 aftershocks
After two earthquakes shook Western Turkey within a very short time, fears of a disaster are growing. 34 people were injured in the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the earthquake on the previous day, there have been almost 200 aftershocks, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said on Friday. This increases the fear of a disaster.
14 schools in Istanbul have been closed for security reasons. Hundreds of buildings have been damaged. The magnitude 5.8 earthquake on Thursday had shaken the Marmara region off Istanbul and triggered panic in the million metropolis. Now the government wants to set up a commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future, Octay announced.
In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes, Istanbul’s mayor Ekrem Imamoglu said. In the city itself, the latent danger is repeatedly ignored. Every year, poorly built residential buildings collapse - made crumble by the many smaller earthquakes that regularly shake Istanbul.
Urban planners such as the well-known architect Mücella Yapici have been warning for years that large open spaces, which have been registered as refuges in the center, have long since been built. Only on the 20th anniversary of the Gölcük quake in August, the Civil Engineering Chamber of Istanbul had warned that an estimated one million buildings in Istanbul are not earthquake-proof.
The epicentre of Thursday’s quake was located in the Marmara Sea in front of the Silivri district and at about seven kilometers depth, according to the Afad Civil Protection Agency. A minor aftershock caused even greater panic on the streets a few minutes later.
Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu said on Twitter that no injuries or damage had been reported at first. The state broadcaster TRT showed people running out of the houses in panic. Students were brought out of the buildings in the Silivri district for security reasons. Some students were crying as shown in pictures.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly earthquake-prone. Under the Marmara Sea lies a section of the so-called North Anatolian Disturbance, which marks the border between the Eurasian and Anatolian Plate. Turkey is repeatedly shaken by earthquakes. One of the deadliest was the earthquake in 1999 near Istanbul. At that time more than 17,000 people were killed.
Researchers fear that an earthquake of magnitude 7.1 to 7.4 could threaten. However, when the earthquake will occur is unclear. The earthquake on Thursday hit the west of the country and Istanbul again.
Companies are designing emergency plans, private individuals have so-called go-bags packed with all the necessities next to front doors, and schools are teaching children how to behave when the earth is shaking.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said after his return from New York that eight people had been injured. Some buildings had suffered slight damage. Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu followed the developments of the Istanbul Disaster Coordination Centre (Akom). According to the reports, two minarets of mosques in the districts of Avcilar and Sariyer collapsed.
Warning of aftershocks in Istanbul
In the social networks, many users report panic. Buildings shook. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Telephone lines were interrupted. It was more violent than that of Tuesday, writes one user. The head of the Turkish Red Crescent, Kerem Klinik, warned via Twitter about aftershocks. He called on people to stay away from buildings that had suffered visible damage.
According to official data, the time of the quake is reported to be 13.59 (local time), and just minutes after the first quake, there was a remake, according to CNN Turkey, which was reported with a magnitude of 4.0 on the Richter scale.
It was only on Tuesday that a magnitude 4.6 earthquake shook the Turkish Marmara region - it was felt until Istanbul. Also its epicenter was located in the Marmara Sea west of the million metropolis, the disaster protection agency Afad already said on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that made headlines this Tuesday: Pakistan was also hit by a severe earthquake.
Researchers assume that sooner or later there could be a catastrophic earthquake in Istanbul - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high. Scientists believe it will eventually discharge - and cause massive damage.
Earthquake researcher Sükrü Ersoy expects that the earthquake is now a warning, which has made it more likely, he told CNN Türk. "These could be the signs of a major earthquake," Ersoy told the broadcaster. "Sooner or later, the big earthquake will also come."
A few weeks ago there had already been an incident - the earthquake also caused great concerns in Istanbul. In addition, there had only been a violent earthquake in Albania a few days ago - there were 68 injured. The earth had also quaked at Lake Constance this year.
Parliament: New ignition fuel in Ukraine affair
Two explosive documents provide for new fuel in the Ukraine affair about possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump. On the way to a possible impeachment procedure, the US Democrats see themselves reinforced: The complaint filed by an anonymous whistleblower about Trump and his controversial telephone conversation with the Ukrainian president. In addition, the Glauben bergen important clues for investigations against the president.
USA: United Airlines passenger locked in toilet - airplane diverted
The flight was blocked during the 1554 flight from Washington to San Francisco, the airline said, according to the United Airlines.
In an unscheduled stopover on Wednesday evening (local time) in Denver, the woman was finally freed from the narrow cabin. About an hour she had been imprisoned in it, U.S. media wrote citing other passengers. To continue the flight to San Francisco, the passengers had to change the aircraft.
In a video on the Internet, allegedly taken from Flight 1554 according to US media, several people are trying to free the woman. "We're working on opening the door right now, ma'am. We're going to get you out soon, okay?" says one man. The airline apologized to all passengers. At first, it was clear whether the woman was receiving compensation.
The cockroach: inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes Brexit novel
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with the whole Brexit chaos? He writes a book about it - and his protagonist is unmistakable.
Inspired by Franz Kafka’s famous narrative “The Transformation,” British author Ian McEwan (71) has written a book about the Brexit chaos in the UK.
The novel "The Cockroach" (Original: "The Cockroach") will be published in German on November 27, the Diogenes Verlag (Zurich) announced. It is about the transformation of a man named "Jim Sams", who was deliberately ignored or hated in his earlier life. But now at once is the most powerful man in Britain. He sees it as his mission to keep the
McEwan was quoted as saying, "If the parliament is closed so that the government cannot be challenged at a critical moment, when ministers blatantly lie like once the Soviet leaders, when Brexiteers in high positions almost implore the disaster of a no-deal - then a writer has to wonder what he can do. There's only one answer to that: writing about it".
Kafka's first published story in 1915 is about Gregor Samsa, who one morning wakes up and sees himself "transformed into an enormous vermin," is gradually excluded from family and society, and eventually perishes. "Ian McEwan bows to Kafka to describe a world that has a head," said Diogenes Publishing.
EU invests <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>9.5 million in Austria’s railway infrastructure
11,200 wagons in Austria and Hungary will be given whisper brakes to reduce the noise pollution caused by freight trains, and sections of the rail connections between Graz and Györ and Wiener Neustadt and Sopron will be modernised and electrified.
According to the EU authorities, this should make travel more comfortable and reduce CO2 emissions. The funds come from the EU infrastructure pool "Connecting Europe Facility".
Thomas Cook cancels all trips until October 31
The German tour operator Thomas Cook cancelled all trips until October 31, 2019, one day after his insolvency application. Travel could not be started for insolvency reasons, the company said on Thursday evening.
This includes bookings of the brands Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Reisen, <0xC3><0x96>GER TOURS, Bucher Reisen and Air Marin, which have already been paid or paid in full. As for travels starting from 1 November 2019, the company left open. In consultation with the insolvency insurance, the further procedure was examined, it said.
Thomas Cook in Germany had succumbed to the bankruptcy of the British parent company and filed for insolvency on Wednesday. The company, which includes Neckermann Reisen, <0xC3><0x96>ger Tours and Bucher Reisen, among others, employs around 2000 people in Germany.
Insurer wants to transfer money to hotels from now on
On the other hand, as of this Friday, hotels abroad, which currently still host Thomas Cook holidaymakers, are to receive money from the Zurich insurance.The payments to the hotels are subject to the condition that holidaymakers are no longer asked to make extra payments.
Based on the booking information and without presenting separate invoices, the hotels in the resorts are now to receive 50 percent of the outstanding payments, said a Zurich spokesman of the German press Agency. "This applies immediately and on the condition that Thomas Cook travellers from these hotels are now not asked to pay individual hotel bills or otherwise forced," said spokesman Bernd Engelien.
The insurance company responded to reports from hotel guests, who had been forced to pay for their accommodation on the spot themselves. Some had to put more than 1,000 euros on the table. The German Travel Association (DRV) and the Federal Association of Consumer Centers had sharply criticized this.
As many hotels are affected, will be agreed on Friday with the insolvent travel provider, said the insurance spokesman. According to data from Thursday, 70,000 Thomas Cook package holidaymakers from Germany were still on the way. Zurich Germany has secured holiday and return trip of the Thomas Cook customers.
Insolvency administrators want to try to continue the three Thomas Cook companies in Germany and find a future solution.
However, the payments to hotels now announced by Zurich Insurance only help the travellers who are currently still on the road. For Thomas Cook customers, who still want to fly on holiday, it looks bad. Late Thursday evening, the company announced that all trips until 31 October inclusive would be cancelled. This also applies to such bookings that are already paid.
As for travel starting from 1 November 2019, the company left open. In consultation with insolvency insurance, the further procedure is being examined. In principle, Zurich insurance is also responsible for these cases. The sale of new travel is stopped. dpa
The company refers to the insurer Zurich, which can be represented by the company Kaera. Customers can check the Kaera website for information on ways of refunding the travel price and make their claims via a web form.
Prince Harry destroys explosive mine in Angola
Prince Harry has been continuing Lady Diana’s engagement for a long time. In Africa, he is now walking directly in the footsteps of his mother.
Clothed with a blue splinter protection vest, British Prince Harry has ignited and destroyed an explosive mine in Angola.
Near a camp of the British Halo Trust near the town of Dirico, he set up the ignition circuit in front of current TV cameras on Friday morning. At a safe distance, the explosive exploded in the savannah landscape without causing any damage. Although the Halo Trust alone has destroyed more than 100,000 relics of the decades of bloody conflict in the African country, there are still more than 1000 populations
On the fifth day of his African journey, Harry wanted to walk in the city of Huambo directly in the footsteps of his mother Diana (1961-1997). With the same detonator who once accompanied his mother, he wanted to go back the way she was then. The pictures on which Princess Diana went through a cleared minefield in 1997 had gone around the world. She had also demonstrated support for the Halo Trust.
Harry, 35, and his wife Meghan, 38, have been on a ten-day Africa trip since Monday, which began in the South African tourist metropolis of Cape Town.
Stopping Brexit negotiations: The danger of a no-deal remains acute
In fact, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had clearly agreed: With him there will be a third delay of Brexit negotiations guaranteed not. But what statements are in the polarizing British already of perpetual duration. The latest ruling of the Supreme Court in the UK floats like a Damocles sword over the blond head. Its suspension of the parliament, however, was obliged to a week to carry out its Brexit course by the start date of this law.
Boris Johnson believes a deal is possible
Meanwhile, while visiting a hospital, Johnson made hints that in the event of a disagreement, he would support an extension of the negotiations until the end of October:
You know, we're gonna stick to the law.
At the same time, however, we are confident that we will leave the EU on 31 October.
I'm cautiously optimistic that this will work.
And time is running away from the Brexit negotiators in Brussels. Still around six weeks the EU and the British negotiators have time to prevent Britain from leaving the European Union without an agreement. But even the recent talks have not made a breakthrough again. An agreement until the end of October seems currently rather difficult to conceive. If the British Prime Minister does not break the law, however, a further postponement of the Brexit date could not come into force in the words. The opposition.
U.S. authorities: More deaths from e-cigarettes
The number of deaths related to the use of e-cigarettes in the U.S. has risen to twelve. In addition, there are now 805 confirmed and likely injuries in this context, the U.S. Health Authority CDC reported. According to a study in the "New England Journal of Medicine". There have already been more than 900 users affected, about 500 of which are confirmed. The cause of lung damage is still unclear in Europe.
Fear of new protests in Egypt is growing
Mohammed Ali's videos have been shared millions of times on online networks. The Spanish-based contractor and actor calls for a "people's revolution". For Friday, he called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military, accused by critics of corruption and mismanagement. Ali hopes to host mass rallies with one million attendees in central squares of the country.
The security authorities are alarmed. In the centre of Cairo there was already an increased police presence. Several subway stations remained closed, streets around the central Tahrir Square were closed. Already in recent days, the police had reinforced their street controls and partially searched the cell phones of pedestrians for messages and photos related to the protests.
On September 20, the protesters also gathered around Tahrir Square.
Last weekend, protests took place in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura with hundreds of participants. There had been no such open protest in Egypt for years. According to the Human Rights Watch (HRW), security forces responded harshly. Nearly 2,000 people have been detained since last week. Many of them have been arbitrarily arrested under occupation - just because they had been "wrong time at the wrong place"
The organization also criticized the censorship in the North African country. According to the government in Cairo blocks websites and online services to stop further protests against al-Sisi. The general has ruled the country since 2013 after overthrowing democratically elected Islamist President Mohammed Morsi. Thousands of Islamists, government opponents, bloggers and activists have been convicted in recent years.
"Ocean Change": Arved fox of Greenland expedition back
Polar explorer Arved Fuchs returned from his Greenland expedition on Friday and was greeted by skipper Boris Herrmann, who brought climate activist Greta Thunberg across the Atlantic with the racing yacht "Malizia".
With a team of scientists in recent months, Fuchs had investigated and documented the consequences of global warming on his sailing ship "Dagmar Aaen" on the coasts of Iceland and Greenland.
The Fridays for Future movement is a blessing, the polar explorer said. He had waited for years for the young generation to speak up. It has been known for decades that the earth is warming. Nevertheless, many acted as if there was a planet B.
"What happens on the sea often takes place under the exclusion of the public," said Fuchs. He and his team wanted to inform people about the effects of global warming and the littering of the seas. Among other things, the expedition measured Greenland's glacier ice with a drone and fished with nets for microplastics, it was said.
For his "fight for a sustainable and respectful use of the world's oceans," the polar explorer from Bad Bramstedt was awarded the "Seadevcon Maritime Award" as part of the Hamburg Climate Week. "For all of us who care about the survival of the oceans, Arved Fuchs is a great role model," said skipper Boris Herrmann at the award ceremony. "He is a witness to the changes in the last decade."
Expensive Spaghetti in Rome: Tourists paid 430 euros for pasta
430 euros for two plates of spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant not far from the Castel Sant'Angelo in Rome: This seemed too much for two Japanese tourists. The bill with 80 euros tip included was paid by the two women, but they posted the receipt on Facebook, which triggered heated reactions.
"Such cases are damaging to the reputation of Rome, and we are calling on the police to investigate whether this is a fraud," a spokesman for Federagit, the Federation of Travel Guides in Rome, said in a statement.
The owners of the restaurant responded promptly. The Japanese women had not only ordered spaghetti, but also fresh fish, the local owner justified. However, this cannot be taken from the bill. Also a tip of up to 20 percent of the bill is normal, said the innkeeper.
After the turbulent revelations of the past few days, US President Donald Trump could actually be faced with impeachment proceedings, the Democrats now want to check that with their investigation in the House of Representatives as soon as possible - the talk is of weeks before a decision would be made.
At the beginning of the scandal is supposedly the telephone call with the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyj. The accusation of the whistleblower, who ultimately brought the conversation to the public out of concern for national security and for the democracy of the US with his complaint, is monstruous: the president has used the power of his office to misuse the government of another country so to instrumental to an influence on the election 2020.
The core of this project can also be seen in the now published transcript of the conversation with Zelenskyj, although it does not reflect the full wording. The July 25 phone call is only one episode of a much larger story, in which Trump is mainly centered alongside his personal lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
The story begins from the public's point of view in May 2019, when the New York Times reports of Rudy Giuliani's travel plans to Ukraine. He wants to meet in Kiev with just-elected President Zelensky, and the lawyer himself knows very well that his intentions are delicate. "We do not interfere in an election, we interfere in an investigation of what we have the right to do," he says to my newspaper.
The lawyer and former New York mayor seems to have been infected with right-wing conspiracy fantasies, which are fixed on Trump’s opponent in the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton had conspired with actors in Ukraine, critics said at the time, to construct an occasion for the Russia investigations in the US, but this accusation was never taken seriously.
This is precisely about the investigations that Trump will speak so prominently on the phone with Selenskyj in July. The version of Giuliani and the president is: the former vice president and currently promising candidate for the Democratic presidential candidacy, Joe Biden, has been working to stop the bid to the senior Ukraine commissioner of the Obama administration to the dismissal of the then Ukrainian General Prosecutor's son, Andktor Schokin.
In fact, the process was slightly different. When Joe Biden demanded that the Ukrainian Attorney General leave, the investigation against the gas company was already closed, Hunter Biden was never directly affected. Schokin himself was accused of profoundly corrupt gestures, the US government was by far not the only Western partner to push for his dismissal. Incidentally, the company even explicitly supported the investigation against the Obama administration.
Disruptions on Instagram Facebook and Whatsapp: Social Media Down
Users worldwide report massive disturbances on Instagram and Facebook. According to this, Germany, the UK and Spain are mainly affected. On the website allestörungen.de users report that Facebook has not loaded since about 3.30 pm again. Also Instagram issues the error message that content could not be loaded. Also WhatsApp seems affected by the disturbance, although so far not to the same extent.
Instagram and Co. more often affected by disturbances
It’s not the first massive incident this year. As early as March and July, the services had been down for several hours. And, as in the previous cases, this time users mainly resort to Twitter to air their anger.
Polish scientists rescued in Antarctica
Three Polish scientists have been rescued by the Chilean Air Force from the ice of Antarctica. They were traveling on an inflatable boat and several miles from their base when their engine failed. They were lucky in the accident - less than an hour took the Chilean rescue helicopter to salvage.
Eduardo Mosquera, commander of the 4th Chilean Air Brigade:
"At 9:30 a.m. we received the message, just before ten we started, and a good 20 minutes later we were above the inflatable boat".
Poland has been operating the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station on King George Island since 1977, with 19 scientists working there. The frozen researchers were safely brought back to their research station.
Warning: Smartphone NEVER charge wirelessly
Practical but harmful
Inductive technology via Qi standard is extremely practical, but should nevertheless not be used.
Since several new smartphones have recently arrived on the market that support wireless charging and sell very well - especially the new iPhone 11 models, we would like to recall a study from the beginning of July. Wireless charging of mobile devices is extremely convenient, but not necessarily recommended.
Higher temperature turns on battery
Researchers warn against wireless charging of smartphones. According to the findings of the University of Warwick, this is extremely harmful for the devices. The reason for this is the significantly greater heat development. If you charge a mobile phone normally by cable, the battery heats up to 27 degrees within three hours. When charging wirelessly, the researchers have the power even with a perfect alignment of the smartphone on the charging pad always increases the temperature.
Capacity and Lifetime
According to the researchers, the temperature is a decisive factor for the durability of batteries. Since every single degree plays a role. When charging with higher temperatures, the battery not only loses capacity, but it also does not last so long overall. The life is therefore less. The researchers therefore advise to always charge the smartphone by cable. Since a battery replacement is always associated with high costs with modern smartphones, that should be a helpful cost for the iPhone.
Practical
The technology is extremely convenient: Simply place the device on a corresponding charging pad - these are now already installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery is charged without an annoying cable mess and laborious plug-in fumbling. Since Qi ( stands for inductive energy transmission ) a worldwide standard is prevailed.
Everest Dam Photographer: 13 Eight Thousands in Six Months
A Nepalese mountaineer has climbed 13 of the 14 highest mountains in the world in just six months. Nirmal Purja (36) has reached the top of the Manaslu in Nepal and thus set a record, his expedition organizer said.
The former soldier wants to climb all 14 eight-thousands in seven months. Purja calls his project "Mission Possible". He once made international headlines: From him came a viral photo of mountaineers standing in line on Mount Everest in the spring.
The image of the crowd sparked a debate over stronger security measures on the 8848-metre-high mountain and highest peak in the world. In May, eleven climbers had died in the ascent within a few days.
A problem for Purja could be the ascent of the 14th eight-thousand-metre: Chinese authorities are currently blocking the Xixabangma mountain in Tibet. Among other things, the reason for this is bad weather. At the beginning of the week, Purja wrote on Twitter that Nepal's government wants to talk to China to enable it to rise.
Four dead elephants discovered in Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals is also a pregnant elephant cow, a police spokesman said on Friday. "We suspect that the elephants were poisoned."
The four carcasses were found in a protected area near the famous and frequented by many tourists former rock fortress Sigiriya. According to the police spokesman, the animals were probably between 15 and 25 years old. An autopsy was ordered to determine the cause of death.
In Sri Lanka, nearly 200 elephants are killed each year. The perpetrators are often farmers on whose land the animals had previously kept harmless. At the same time, around 50 people are killed annually by elephants. This usually happens when the animals move through villages built near their habitat.
Sri Lanka is estimated to have only about 7,000 elephants left, and the death penalty is theorized for their killing.
British oil tanker detained leaves Iran
The British oil tanker Stena Impero left the port city of Bandar Abbas more than two months after it was captured by Iran, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards announced on July 19 that it had been arrested on charges of violating maritime law in the Persian Gulf.
Management of Thomas Cook in Criticism
The House of Commons’ responsible economic committee wants to investigate the bankruptcy of travel giant Thomas Cook extensively, covering the board’s salary packages as well as the question of why the British government would not want to contribute financially to the company struggling for survival. “Our interest is in oversight in the company as well as in control by external auditors”, we told a board chairman, Rachel Reeves, in London.
According to experts, genes are overestimated in colorectal cancer risk
The role of genes in the familially increased risk of colorectal cancer has so far been overestimated. Researchers from the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) Heidelberg conclude this in a recent study. Other risk factors such as family dietary habits are therefore likely to weigh more heavily than previously assumed. This has consequences for calculations of the individual colorectal cancer risk, the DKFZ scientists emphasize.
Elon Musk to raise Tesla shares
Musk wrote this in an email to Tesla employees on Thursday (local time) from the industry blog "Electrek." The demand is strong, so Tesla could post 110,000 orders, it continued in Musk's newsletter.
The challenge is to bring the cars to customers quickly, with Tesla having to provide as many resources as possible by the end of the quarter.
Investors liked the information: Tesla's shares went out of business with an increase of more than six percent. The price hasn't increased so much in almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla delivered more than 95'000 cars, reaching its previous best value.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360'000 to 400,000 cars. For this, six-digit figures must be obtained in the current and next quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there were losses recently.
Does the UK government want to circumvent Brexit law? Johnson reserved
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has kept his eyes on whether he is looking for ways to circumvent the law against an unregulated Brexit, which has recently been passed by Parliament, but on a similar question he said on Friday in front of journalists that his government will abide by applicable law.
The law requires the government to request a postponement of the withdrawal date if no agreement with the EU has been reached by mid-October. Johnson criticizes this as a "capitulation law", which complicates negotiations with the EU.
Former British Prime Minister John Major said on Thursday that Johnson could try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law, and that Johnson could use a procedural trick that would postpone the law's entry into force to the period after the EU's exit.
Johnson said he is striving for a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident to leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is with an agreement."
Iran increases uranium enrichment
Iran's President Hassan Rouhani has increased pressure on European contractors in the dispute over the rescue of the historic nuclear deal. "Unfortunately, European states are showing inability or lack of willingness when it comes to concrete actions," Rouhani said Thursday at a press conference on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York. In the event that they fail to meet their promises of the 2015 agreement, he made "further steps away from the deal"
In the meantime, the background is the conflict around the international agreement to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb, which in return included the promise to Tehran to normalize economic relations. The U.S. stepped out of the agreement in 2018 alone to force Iran with "maximum pressure" to a change of course in the Middle East policy deemed aggressive. The government of Donald Trump wants to reinstate a new agreement with Te
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic has now used or at least prepared for use the centrifuges installed at the beginning of September. Iran is also preparing to build more than 300 other centrifuges.
Perhaps the Europeans are not willing to bear their share of the deal and therefore leave the Iranians alone with the cost and the burden of pressing US sanctions, Rouhani suspected, but there will still be further talks that hopefully bring a solution.
Rohani continues to deny Iran's involvement in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, the situation has changed after an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia in mid-September: Germany, France and the UK followed on Monday the US assessment that Tehran was responsible for the attack. Initially, the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen had confessed to the attack, which was deemed a false statement by the US on Wednesday. "We have nothing to do with it," Rohani said.
"Those who make such accusations must provide evidence of this," Rouhani said. However, the European leaders would not have been able to do so in the talks with him during the UN General Debate. Instead, they would have relied solely on the rebels in Yemen not being able to carry out an attack like this. Rouhani had met in recent days with British Prime Minister Angela Merkel and France's President Emmanuel.
Before possible talks with US President Trump, Rouhani demanded that the far-reaching sanctions imposed by the US administration be lifted, calling on the government in Washington to switch to a policy of “dialogue and reason.”
Comet crossed by another star Solar System
Astronomers are currently observing a comet from the depths of space, and this has only been done before. The comet can be traced to other solar systems.
What was initially just a conjecture is now confirmed: an interstellar guest is crossing our solar system. The comet from the depths of space was named 2I/Borisov after its explorer and has aroused the interest of astronomers around the world.
The comet was discovered on August 30 by amateur astronomer Gennadi Borissov at the Margo Observatory in Crimea - with a self-built telescope of 65 centimeters in diameter. Observations from various observatories not only confirmed that it was an unknown comet, but also showed that it was not from our solar system.
2I/Borisov is only the second interstellar object seen during a flight through our solar system after 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017.
2I/Borisov offers astronomers a rare chance to get up close insights into an alien solar system before disappearing on never-before-seen. Initial observations show that the interstellar comet is similar to that of our own system, as reported by the Canary Astrophysical Institute.
The comet has been discovered on a so-called hyperbel orbit, which leads it out of our system - and clearly of interstellar origin, as the International Astronomical Union (IAU) announced. It is also responsible for the naming and categorization of celestial bodies. In honor of our discoverer, the interstellar tail star, which was initially called the interstellar star, was initially named under the catalog number C/2019 Q4.
The astronomers are lucky: unlike 1I/'Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov has already been spotted approaching, leaving the researchers with many months to study. "The object will reach its greatest brightness in mid-December and will be visible with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," Farnocchia explained. "After that, it will only be visible with larger, professional telescopes until October 2020."
A team led by Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii, who had already led the characterization of 1I/'Oumuamua, determined in an initial study the diameter of the celestial object at 2 to 16 kilometers. Images from the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii show a distinct tail of the comet.
Researchers at the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands (IAC) have already obtained a first so-called spectrum of the interstellar tail star, which provides a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object is similar to that of comets in our solar system, and this indicates that their composition must be similar to our systems," said IAC researcher Julia de León.
The discovery of two interstellar visitors within just two years suggests that these objects could open up a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems. However, it is still difficult to estimate the frequency of such interstellar visits. One of the next interstellar visitors could potentially intercept a planned satellite mission from the European space agency Esa.
The agency aims to station the three-part spacecraft "Comet Interceptor" (for example, comet interceptor) at a waiting position 1.5 million kilometers from Earth by 2028. According to Esa science director Günther Hasinger, it should be lurking either on a still unspoiled, fresh comet from our own solar system, or on an interstellar visitor such as 1Iu'am.
First landing at Beijing's new Mega Airport Daxing
Just in time for the 70th birthday of the People’s Republic, the time has come: at the new Mega-Airport in the south of the Chinese capital, a first passenger aircraft of China United Airlines has landed, a special honor for captain and crew.
By 2022, around 45 million passengers are expected to be handled annually at the new airport, and 72 million by 2025. China's President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion-dollar project. China's latest prestige project is also called "sea star" because of its six-armed building structure.
The complex has four runways, which will later be expanded to seven, and is equipped with the world’s largest automated air traffic management system. A new subway will transport passengers to downtown Beijing in just 20 minutes.
During construction, the Chinese had repeatedly said that Berlin could learn from Beijing. The opening of the capital airport in Germany, which has been under construction since 2006, and is considerably smaller, has been postponed so far. In Beijing, on the other hand, a first passenger aircraft landed after four years.
New supersonic plane to fly in 2030: in four and a half hours from London to Sydney
From London to Sydney in just four and a half hours - that's what the UK space agency dreams of. It is intended to make possible this special propulsion (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre) planned for the 2030s flight at supersonic pace. In 2030, the company's Reaction Engines from Oxfordshire could be speaking, the U.S. broadcaster CNN quoted the agency. "This is definitely the technology for the Graham
In order to advance the project, the British space agency plans to develop such a plan with the U.S.A. more closely. A flight from the British capital to the Australian metropolis currently takes about 20 hours. As the only supersonic aircraft for passenger transport to date, the Concorde had covered the New York-Paris route from 1976 until the cessation of its operation in 2003. It took three to three and a half hours to develop such plans. In 2000 there was an accident at the launch of a Charles airport.
"Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transport," writes Reaction Engines on its homepage. The Sabre drive could be used for efficient travel at a speed of Mach 5 - which means five times as fast as the sound. In addition, such aircraft are also deployable outside the Earth's atmosphere and thus enabled the "next generation of truly travelling again".
Washington riot: Trump wants to track down anonymous tippers in Ukraine affair
In the Ukraine affair about possible abuse of power by the US president, Donald Trump wants to detect possible leaks in the White House.
"I want to know who gave the information to the whistleblower," Trump said on Thursday in front of staff of the U.S. embassy in New York, saying that the person concerned was almost "a spy" and that they were treated "a little differently" in the past than they are today.
This was seen as an attempt to intimidate typists. The event was actually not public. However, several U.S. media distributed audio recordings of the speech on Friday. Democrats reacted outragedly to the statement of the president.
The Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives had announced on Tuesday preparations for a impeachment trial against Trump. Their allegations are mainly based on the written complaint of an anonymous intelligence official, who is making serious accusations against Trump and his government headquarters. Following heavy public pressure, the reports of the whistleblower had been made public on Thursday.
As part of his work, the whistleblower wants to get information from several government officials that the US president is “using the power of his office” to get another country to interfere in his favor in the 2020 U.S. election.
At the heart of the allegations is a controversial phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyj at the end of July, in which Trump encouraged his counterparts to investigate what could harm his political rival Joe Biden, covering earlier business of Biden’s son Hunter in Ukraine and alleged efforts to protect his progeny from the Ukrainian presidential justice.
The whistleblower also accused the White House of covering up the Ukraine telephone: Leading government officials had tried to keep the exact wording of the conversation under cover. As usual, an electronic wording protocol had been created. This was especially protected after the conversation was conducted by lawyers from the White House, but only a system was removed from a normally intended database.
The identity of the whistleblower is not publicly known. The New York Times reported that it was an employee of the foreign intelligence agency CIA.
Trump once again questioned the source's credibility on Friday. In a series of tweets on the subject, the president wrote, among other things, that the "so-called whistleblower" had disseminated second-hand information that had turned out to be inaccurate. Therefore, there may not be any tippers or spies at all.
Trump’s comments in New York about those allegedly leaking information to the whistleblower provoked outrage, and U.S. House House Chairman Nancy Pelosi was alarmed and complained that Trump’s statement undermined the government’s integrity once again.
In the House of Representatives, various investigations against Trump and his surroundings have been underway in various committees for months. In view of the Ukraine allegations, the Democrats are now advancing investigations with new force in order to initiate a possible impeachment process against Trump.
"The whistleblower has given us a roadmap for our investigation," said the head of the House Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff. Trump attacked Schiff sharply, accusing him of misrepresenting things and again demanding the chairman of the committee to resign. Trump regularly insults Schiff and had already demanded his withdrawal months ago.
More than 300 former U.S. security and foreign policy officials, working mostly under Democratic but also under Republican presidents, in a statement released on Friday, backed the Democrats' investigation for a possible impeachment procedure, which would be "a ruthless abuse of power" by Trump, it said.
There is no precise timetable for the further procedure. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could try a so-called impeachment procedure. However, the decision about an actual impeachment was taken in the Senate, where Trump’s Republicans have the majority. The prospects of such a procedure are therefore low. So far, no US president has been impeached by an impeachment procedure.
VW Works Council: Workplaces are being "sliding down"
The VW brand’s plans to further reduce production costs could be at the expense of production in Germany and Europe. This concern drives the company’s works council. The brand aims to reduce its annual factory costs by two billion euros by 2023, of which 500 million euros are to be saved this year.
The "Future Pact", which was negotiated between the company and the works council in 2016, provides for the reduction of 14,000 jobs in Germany alone by 2020. In principle, a job can only be cut at the car manufacturer if it is virtually proven that the related activities are no longer necessary. In addition, a job guarantee applies until 2029.
However, as our newspaper now learned from works council circles, jobs in production, which are not actually available, are being reduced "slaughtily" by another way - i.e. bypassing the official course. Thus, vacant regular jobs are often not re-occupied.
In these cases, the works council has no way of enforcing the re-occupation. Meanwhile, there is a lack of personnel in many places, the labour density increases, the concerns about a gradual bleeding out of the vehicle plants become greater. This also increases the fear that the vehicle production could be gradually withdrawn from Germany and Europe, because it is more favorable in other parts of the world.
The VW brand wants to standardise production worldwide even more and control new projects centrally. This also reduces costs and also accelerates decisions - the goal is to increase productivity and thus competitiveness. Production CEO Andreas Tostmann said at a managerial conference in Berlin: "Especially in uncertain times from Brexit to the threatening trade war between the US and China, we are well advised, make us firm".
For example, this year, for the first time since 2013, the production costs per vehicle would decrease compared to the previous year. Tostmann told journalists that the production time for the Golf 8, which will be presented in Wolfsburg on 24 October, will be shortened by 1.1 hours. Exact figures on the production duration do not mention VW, according to information from our newspaper, it is around the Golf 7
Twenty hours.
In our region, the Wolfsburg plant is the only VW factory in which vehicles are produced. The plants in Braunschweig and Salzgitter manufacture components. The rule of thumb for VW in Wolfsburg is that 800,000 cars must be built annually in order for the plant to be satisfactorily profitable.
As production board Tostmann announced last year, however, one million cars are expected to roll off the line in Wolfsburg in a "perspective" manner. This is to make it possible to bundle the Golf production in the main plant - because the Zwickau plant, due to the conversion to the location for e-car production, will hand over the Golf production.
In addition, the SUVs Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are produced in Wolfsburg. However, the sales figures of Golf and Tiguan have recently declined. Therefore, expectations now rest on the Golf 8. It should remain the bread and butter car of Wolfsburg for the time being, despite all efforts to build e-mobility.
Voodoo forced into prostitution: human trafficker convicted
Young women from Nigeria have been sworn in, smuggled into the Ruhr area and forced into prostitution. Six suspected human traffickers have to go to jail for this.
Six alleged Nigerian traffickers have been sentenced on Friday in Bochum to probation and imprisonment of up to eight years and three months. The defendants had smuggled young women from Nigeria into the Ruhr area and forced them into prostitution. To enforce their obedience, the Nigerian women willing to leave had still in the home in front of a voodoo priest a ritual shrine.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years old. They were brought across the Mediterranean with the help of Libyan smugglers in inflatable boats. However, the dream of a better future did not come true. Once in Germany, they were distributed to various brothels to deal with the alleged smuggler costs of an average of 25,000 euros. The wage was therefore completely reduced to them.
The defendants - four men and two women - had admitted the intrusion and subsequent distribution of the young Nigerian women on brothels in the process. "The work made the women physically and mentally difficult," Judge Isabel Hoffmann said in the verdict. "Some were right disgusted."
The sentences are based on commercial and gang-based intrusion of foreigners, trafficking in human beings, pimping and severe forced prostitution.
UFO calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
In the ongoing dispute with the Lufthansa Group, the flight attendants union Ufo has once again threatened with strikes.
If the company does not return to the negotiating table, the trade union will "inform on 14 October about the labour struggle measures in the LH Group," said UFO tariff board member Daniel Flohr on Friday. Lufthansa and its daughter Eurowings have been refusing to conduct collective bargaining with the UFO for months. The question is also whether the trade union has legally terminated collective agreements with Lufthansa.
On this point, Ufo now feels strengthened after a decision of the Frankfurt Labour Court. Lufthansa wanted to be determined that the collective agreements were not terminated. The court rejected the requests. The company confirmed the decision and is considering appealing against it. "I think that a second court sees the matter completely differently," said Ufo board member Flohr.
In August, Lufthansa also filed an application with the Frankfurt State Labour Court to have the status of the UFO as a trade union reviewed by the courts.The company argues that the trade union has not appointed a representative board for months and is thus unable to fill its role as a tariff partner.
This was preceded by a fierce leadership dispute in the trade union, during which numerous members of the Executive Board and the Advisory Board resigned, including long-standing union leader Nicoley Baublies. The UFO had suspended an initial vote already begun on strikes by the cabin crew at Eurowings at the end of July due to doubts about its leadership.
Facilitated entry: Saudi Arabia announces new visa system
So far, Saudi Arabia was not exactly known as an international tourist magnet. But that is now to change. The country on the Persian Gulf wants to introduce new visa regulations.
With a new visa system, Saudi Arabia wants to attract more international tourists in the future. By 2030, the number of international and domestic visitors to 100 million per year, the Tourism Commission said.
"The opening of Saudi Arabia to international tourists is a historic moment for our country," said the chairman of the tourism commission, Ahmad Al-Chatib.
Saudi Arabia is hardly accessible to tourists so far. Visas are usually only granted for short business trips, religious pilgrimages or visitors with relatives in the desert state. With the new rules, the arch-conservative kingdom hopes to increase revenue from the tourism business. According to its own statement, Riad wants to reduce its dependence on the oil trade.
In mid-September, several rockets and drones hit two of the most important oil plants in eastern Saudi Arabia: the country’s largest oil refinery in Abkaik and the Churais oil field. As a result, national oil production fell drastically, oil prices skyrocketed, and it is expected that it will take several weeks for the kingdom’s oil production to return to its old levels.
Justin and Hailey Bieber Are Preparing for Wedding
Singer Justin Bieber, 25, and his wife Hailey, 22, are preparing for their wedding. The model posted several party photos on their Instagram Stories on Thursday (local time) showing her in a white wedding look. Reality star Kendall Jenner, 23, and others had organized a bachelor party in Los Angeles, according to People magazine.
Justin posted several colorful, banana-printed suits on Instagram and asked his followers, "Help me choose my tuxedo for the wedding." According to media reports, the celebrity couple plans to get married churchly next weekend.
The Biebers said yes to each other a year ago in a New York registry office. There was no bigger party at the time.
In an interview with Australian Vogue, Hailey recently stated that the two had found a common level after initial problems: “If you don’t want to compromise, you can’t have a relationship.”
Two dead in plane crash in Czech Republic
Two people were killed in the crash of a small airplane in the west of the Czech Republic. The wreckage was discovered on Friday in a forest area near the city of Mecin (Mechin), police said. The dead are a 38-year-old woman and a 64-year-old man.
The authorities had been searching for the aircraft since Thursday evening, after the crew gave an emergency signal via GPS. In the search was also a military helicopter in use. The cause of the accident still has to be determined. The crash site is about 30 kilometers south of Pilsen (Plzen) and 100 kilometers northeast of Regensburg.
Half of European tree species are threatened with extinction
In addition to pests, diseases, alien species, unsustainable logging and the growth of cities are also the causes of the threat, the World Conservation Union IUCN reported on Friday in Brussels. It examined the stocks of all 454 species of trees known in Europe. 265 of these are not found on any other continent. Of these 265, 58 percent are at risk. 66 are already at the highest level of extinction and thus are at risk.
The IUCN classifies endangered species into six categories: from "potentially endangered" to "endangered", "highly endangered", "endangered by extinction" and "extinct" to "extinct", and lists more than 28,000 species of animals and plants worldwide as endangered.
Deer and wild horse chestnut threatened
In Germany, most of the Ebereschen (Sorbus) are threatened, said one of the authors, David Allen, the German press Agency. "Most are threatened because the populations are small anyway or by the transformation or weakening of their habitats."
It also looks bad for the wild Common horse chestnuts. They have been considered "endangered", stage two of the IUCN scale since 2017. The biggest threat besides a mushroom is the Balkan mining moth. It has spread from southeastern Europe to 10,000 trees all over the continent since the 1980s and has hardly considered natural enemies. IUCN estimates the number of wild horse chestnuts in Europe.
shrubs and mosses are also at risk
The IUCN scientists simultaneously created new European Red Lists for molluscs, shrubs and mosses. More than one-fifth of the molluscs and mosses and almost half of all shrub species are threatened, according to the IUCN. This is mainly due to the destruction of wildlife, important birds, farming practices and climate change. Molluscs such as snails and snails played a key role in destroyers.
"This report shows that the situation is precarious for many overlooked and underestimated species, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet," said Luc Bas, IUCN Director of the European Office.
Earthquake in Istanbul: 34 Injured
Dozens of people had to leave their homes, 14 schools in Istanbul had been closed for security reasons, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said on Friday.
Hundreds of buildings have been damaged, with nearly 200 aftershocks since the earthquake the day before. The magnitude 5.8 earthquake on Thursday had shaken the Marmara region off Istanbul and triggered panic in the million-dollar metropolis.
In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes, Istanbul’s mayor Ekrem Imamoglu said.
Under the Marmara Sea lies a section of the so-called North Anatolian disturbance, which marks the border between the Eurasian and Anatolian plates.
One of the most severe earthquakes was one of the magnitude 7.6 in 1999 near Istanbul. The epicentre was then located in Gölcük southeast of Istanbul. More than 17,000 people were killed.
On Tuesday, a 4.6-strong earthquake shook the region around Istanbul, calling on residents to stay away from damaged buildings.
Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (JLo) and Shakira perform in the halftime show
Latin pop singers Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will lead the half-time show of the next American football final Super Bowl. The singers announced on Twitter. "It's not going to get bigger," Shakira wrote to a photo of herself and Lopez. She's insanely excited to be on the Super Bowl stage. On February 2, 2020, it will be in Miami.
Jennifer Lopez said she had been dreaming of performing at the Super Bowl since 1996, when she saw Diana Ross flying into the sky at the halftime show. "Now it's even more special because the NFL has been around for 100 years and I'm going to perform with another Latina." She couldn't wait to "show what we girls can do on the biggest stage in the world."
Shakira pointed out in a statement that she is honored to be standing alongside another artist on one of the largest stages in the world, representing Latinos and Latinas from the U.S. and around the world. "And on my birthday!" The main sponsor of the event tweeted that it was the first time the two "queens" were on a stage together.
Shakira is from Colombia. Jennifer Lopez was born in New York, her parents are from Puerto Rico.
Fight against declining viewership
The Super Bowl is the highlight of the American football season. The game and the half-time show are among the most watched TV broadcasts in the US. Even though your viewing numbers have fallen recently, this February attracted the fewest viewers in the US in more than a decade. Still, there were almost a hundred million people on average.
Around the halftime show of the past Super Bowl there had been a riot in the run-up: In the dispute over the handling of quarterback Colin Kaepernick last February, according to media reports, top stars like Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B did not want to perform. Finally, the pop group Maroon 5 led the halftime show - the reviews were not friendly.
Kaepernick, then quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, went to the national anthem in the 2016/17 season before NFL games in protest against police violence and racism. With his protest, Kaepernick triggered a movement, numerous players took over the gesture. This caused great excitement, US President Donald Trump attacked the mostly African American football clubs in March and has no more.
Cook pledge: hotels get money from insurance
Some banks are likely to face the bankruptcy of travel provider Thomas Cook according to a press report. High depreciation on outstanding bonds and loans threaten, which also affects Credit Suisse, writes the "Financial Times" in its issue on Friday.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit or Credit Suisse would probably have to write off a total of up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.8 billion (about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2 billion) on their books, according to the report, according to estimates by consulting firm AlixPartners.
The creditors of bonds would have to take depreciation from <0xC2><0xA3>900 million to <0xC2><0xA3>1 billion and lenders between <0xC2><0xA3>550 million and <0xC2><0xA3>825 million, while the amounts actually to be depreciated are more likely to be at the top of the bandwidths, an expert told the paper.
A person close to the insolvency process did not give much hope. For example, the approximately 40 aircraft from Thomas Cook in the UK are "old" and many of the properties are in bad conditions. The most money can be drawn from the sale of the airport slots as well as the Thomas Cook brand, said the company.
Rackete reportedly brought suspected murderers to Italy
Sea Watch captain Carola Rackete may have brought men to Italy who are said to have tortured and killed people in Libya. "We can't rule this out, but we ourselves have no secure information about it," said the spokesman for the refugee organization Sea-Watch, Ruben Neugebauer, to the dpa news agency.
Other migrants had recognized the three men in Italy. They are accused of raping, torturing and killing people in Libya. The alleged perpetrators were arrested in the reception camp in Messina, Italy. Neugebauer stressed that the refugee organizations could not check who they let on their ships. "They come without passports."
Carola Rackete had illegally brought migrants to the port of Lampedusa on June 29, ramming a ship of the Italian financial police. On that day, the three suspects also arrived there. The captain is under investigation for aiding illegal immigration.
U.S. warns federal government against Huawei
The head of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, has warned the German government not to trust the Chinese network provider Huawei.
We believe the risks are too great," Pai told the "Handelsblatt" with a view to building the new 5G mobile network.
China has a “national security law” that obliges any company “under Chinese jurisdiction” to follow instructions from security bodies.
The current law also prohibits companies from informing third parties about such requests," the FCC chief added, making it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
In the meantime, the German government has agreed to demand a “declaration of trust” from suppliers.
Berlin first wants to try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, reports the "Handelsblatt" citing its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. The 5G technology does not consist only of the hardware:
The software in particular is important to keep the devices up-to-date. This software consists of billions of lines of program code that change over time," Pai said.
It would be “very hard to imagine” that a government agency, “no matter where, would be able to check every single update in real time to track security risks,” the FCC chief continued.
He accuses the Chinese company Huawei of having close contacts with the Chinese state apparatus:
The ownership relationships are opaque, and the employee company that allegedly owns the company is not necessarily independent of the government," Pai told the "Handelsblatt".
Pai was recently in Berlin for talks in order to promote the US position, and he said that he was looking for a position in the US.
Chemical factory in northern France burns: schools closed
At night, local residents hear explosions. A gigantic firewall illuminates the sky over a chemical factory in northern France. The fire is extinguished after hours - but the cleaning work could now take days.
After a fire in a chemical factory in the northern French city of Rouen on Thursday, the schools and nurseries in the region remain closed.
In 12 municipalities, the prefecture said the facilities would not open as a precautionary measure on Friday. The Interior Ministry had asked citizens to stay as far as possible in buildings and not to be exposed to smoke. There were no injured. Farmers and breeders were called on to bring their animals inside, protect their food and stop harvesting for the time being.
The fire was completely extinguished on Thursday evening, according to the prefecture. There is still a risk that the odour will spread after the extinguishing, according to the prefecture on Twitter. According to the prefecture 240 firefighters as well as 90 police officers and gendarmes were on duty at the site of the fire.
A gigantic black smoke column had previously emerged from the chemical factory. French media reported huge flames and explosions in the Lubrizol factory, which produces additives for oils. The production plant is located a few kilometers from the city center.
The factory in Normandy belongs, according to the authorities, to the so-called Seveso category of dangerous sites, which are specially monitored. In 1976, a devastating chemical accident occurred in Seveso, Italy near Milan.
The prefect of the Normandy region, Pierre-André Durand, told the news channel BFMTV that there was initially no "high toxicity" in samples, but pollution of the nearby Seine could not be ruled out. In the river dams have been built against the pollution, the prefecture said.
The fire broke out early in the morning at 2:40 a.m., the authorities reported. The cause initially remained unclear. Rouen is a regional metropolis and is located on the Seine between Paris and the port city of Le Havre.
French Finance Minister: “Germany needs to invest now”
French Minister of Economic Affairs and Finance Bruno Le Maire has called on Germany to make greater investments to boost economic growth in the eurozone.
Germany needs to invest now, the sooner the better," Le Maire said on Thursday evening at the presentation of the French budget for the coming year.
The economy in the eurozone is weakening, the minister warned.
We must not wait until the economic situation worsens to make the necessary decisions."
Action would have to be taken by those states that have budgetary leeway for more investment, Le Maire said, among other things, with a view to Germany.
France does not have this scope, the minister added, referring to the high national debt of its country, which is more than 98 percent of the gross domestic product. The French national debt must be "stabilized" and "sented", Le Maire said.
In recent years, France has repeatedly called on Germany to make more public investment in order to stimulate the European economy, and in return, German politicians have repeatedly called on France to tackle its budget deficit.
The French budget for 2020, presented on Thursday, provides tax reliefs of more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>9 billion for households.
The French government is responding to the protests of the yellow vest movement, which is expected to reduce the new debt to 2.2 percent, after anticipating 3.1 percent this year.
Is he still trying to trick?: Johnson evades question on Brexit tactics
British Prime Minister Johnson strongly criticizes the "Capitulation Act" passed by Parliament.
Parliament is back, a law requires the British Prime Minister to avoid a chaos Brexit. Critics fear, however, that Boris Johnson could still use a loophole. However, addressed this possibility, the Tory politician avoids.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been concealed about whether he wants to enforce an unregulated Brexit - despite the recent bill passed by Parliament, which is exactly what should prevent that.On a similar question, Johnson said in front of journalists only that his government will abide by applicable law.
The law requires the government to request a postponement of the withdrawal date if no agreement with the EU is reached by mid-October. Johnson criticizes this as a "capitulation law", which complicates negotiations with the EU.
Former British Prime Minister John Major had expressed on Thursday the suspicion that Johnson could try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law. The prime minister could use a procedural trick that would postpone the law's entry into force to the time after the EU exit. Johnson said he aimed for a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident that the best way is to leave the EU on October 31st".
Johnson's chief advisor Dominic Cummings, meanwhile, stated that he felt the political disputes about Brexit were a "walk in the park" and expressed confidence that the EU's intended exit would still come about: "We enjoy this, we'll win, we'll leave the EU ahead, don't worry," Buchmmings told a British newspaper.
Cummings, who led the Brexit campaign "Vote Leave" during the campaign ahead of the EU referendum in 2016, is now acting as chief strategist in the UK government headquarters Downing Street, behind the uncompromising policy that has led the prime minister into a virtually hopeless situation.
The Polaroid Diaries by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they all stood in front of the camera of Linda McCartney, who has become one of the great rock photographers. But it does not always have to be the great glamour. The photo book "The Polaroid Diaries" (bags) immerses deeply in the very private world of the McCartney family.
Paul McCartney, who was married to her from 1969 until Linda's death in 1998, was visibly proud and moved when he presented the picture book "The Polaroid Diaries" at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London in mid-September, including Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison and Pretenders front-woman Chrissie Hynde.
Following the launch event, McCartney wrote on Instagram: “#ThePolaroidDiaries is a fleeting glimpse into the life of an extraordinary family from the pre-Instagram era, a celebration of LindaMcCartney’s legacy as a dedicated artist, and the instant magic of the Polaroid film.”
With Linda McCartney, who had studied art history at the University of Aizona until she found photography, the camera was always with her. Thousands of Polaroids she made, some hundreds of which are now being published in "The Polaroid Diaries" for the first time.
They are portraits, still lifes, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 70s to the late 90s. "She wanted real moments", writes art critic Ekow Eshun in his foreword. And of course, one is always at the center: her husband Paul - like you may have never seen him before.
Then he was dancing with his daughter Mary on his shoulders, calling on the phone in a bathrobe with a bag on his head or wearing non-shape moonboots. Sure, the McCartneys were an extraordinary family but who had been on the spotlight on their farm in southern England or in Scotland also led a very normal life. So Mary McCartney has always said to the BBC that she had slept out of a baby in a bed with her father.
Like hardly any other medium, the Poloraid camera captures the immediate moment. The shots of Linda McCartney are certainly a kind of family diary, but they are much more than mere snapshots.
It's about the deciding click: you have to recognize when a great photo happens in front of you. And then you have to snap it at the right moment," Paul McCartney said. "If you snap two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it can be a completely different photo." And Linda would have had the gift of always capturing just the right moment. "She just knew she had it," Paul said in the Eshun essay.
The light, the composition, the image detail and the colors are right, which makes "The Polaroid Diaries" not only an entertaining picture book for Beatles fans, but besides all the anecdotals is also a great aesthetic pleasure, where landscapes also sometimes seem like abstract paintings. The perfect complement to the newly released Beatles album "Abbey Road" is exactly the same.
“We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran.”
Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said in an interview published on Friday that Turkey could not stop imports of oil and gas from Iran.
We will continue to buy our natural gas from there," Erdogan said in New York, where he attended the UN General Assembly.
But Erdogan admitted that Turkey is having problems importing Iranian oil, as some companies have withdrawn “because of US threats.”
Nevertheless, Turkey "will continue our relations with Iran, especially on this issue and on many other issues," the Turkish president said, who has repeatedly criticized US sanctions against Iran in the past.
The U.S. has been pursuing a policy of "maximum pressure" against the Islamic Republic since its withdrawal from the international nuclear agreement with Iran. According to the U.S., Iran is pursuing a nuclear program in secret and does not adhere to the agreement.
Their sanctions have led to the collapse of Iran’s oil exports and a severe economic crisis in Iran, and tensions in the Gulf region have intensified considerably in recent months.
U.S. government wants to restrict admission of refugees
The U.S. Department of State said on Thursday that the annual ceiling for a resettlement program should be lowered from currently 30,000 to 18,000 refugees, equivalent to a 40 percent cut.
The State Department said the U.S. would continue to be committed to supporting refugees, but the most important task was to protect and serve U.S. citizens. Currently, the U.S. immigration system is overburdened.
The U.S. government wants to focus on the reception of two refugee groups in the future: people who are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the U.S. military in the country and are thus in danger, according to the State Department's statement.
The program, launched in 1980, selects refugees from UN camps around the world and resettles them in the US. The limit of 18,000 refugees for the 2020 budget year would be the lowest in the program’s history. Even the current limit of 30,000 is a low. When U.S. President Donald Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama, left the White House, the number was just under 85,000.
Relief organizations were horrified at the announced lowering of the upper limit. "This is a very sad day for America," said David Miliband, the head of the International Rescue Committee. The US would further damage its leadership in protecting the world's most vulnerable people.
Trump is trying to strictly limit immigration to the U.S., both legally and illegally. The U.S. government expects 350,000 asylum applications for the coming budget year. These figures are separate from the resettlement program.
Donald Trump: “Come Close to a Spy”
U.S. President Donald Trump has accused whistleblowers of espionage in the whistleblower affair. Whoever has shredded the information to the informant who accuses him of abuse of power, "comes close to a spy," Trump said according to a record of a private event on Thursday in New York.
According to this, Trump spoke to American UN mission officials. When asked about the person who informed the whistleblower about controversial events in the White House, he replied, "That comes close to a spy." Then Trump added, "Do you know what we did in the old days when we were smart? Right now. The spies and betrayal, we used to do it a little differently."
Observers rated the latter comment as a possible allusion to the death penalty. The Democrats harshly criticized Trump’s statements and accused him of intimidating witnesses. It was also an attempt to impede a congressional investigation into a possible impeachment process against him, wrote the chairmen of the Committees on Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Supervision at the House.
The whistleblower accuses the president in a now-publicized complaint of abusing his office to request an interference from another country in the US election 2020. Specifically, it is about his controversial phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky in the summer: In the conversation, Trump urged him to conduct an investigation against his possible son Joeerford in the US election.
It is still unclear who the whistleblower himself and his informants are, but as the New York Times reports, the whistleblower is said to be an analyst of the foreign intelligence CIA.
Refugee boat capsized: baby and toddler drowning in Aegean Sea
People are constantly trying to cross the Aegean Sea from Turkey to Greece, where boats are often too small. Seven migrants have now been killed in the sinking of an inflatable boat, including five children.
Seven migrants were killed in the sinking of an inflatable boat off the Greek island of Chios, with one baby and four other children among the victims, the Greek Coast Guard reported. Four children, three women and five men were rescued from the floods by the crew of a passing ferry.
Among the victims is also a smuggler, reported the local news portal of Chios, Alithia.gr. The migrants had left Turkey in the morning. They had tried to reach the small island group of Inousses in the northeast of the island of Chios. Inousses is located between Chios and the Turkish mainland.
There are currently hundreds of migrants from Turkey to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean Sea, mostly in too small boats. Last year, according to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), 174 people were killed on this route.
The Who cancel concert
A U.S. concert by rock band The Who came to an abrupt end due to an awkwardness of lead singer Roger Daltrey. In the middle of the performance on Wednesday evening (local time) in Houston, his voice failed to serve. On the eighth song, Daltrey told the audience, "I think I should let it go as long as it's still running".
Lead guitarist Pete Townsend asked for an apology and added that Daltrey could "not really speak now". The audience promised Townsend to get his money's worth at a reparation concert, but an appointment has not yet been determined.
The Who cancelled shows scheduled for Friday in Dallas and Sunday in Denver. They are to be picked up at a later date. 75-year-old Daltrey and his 74-year-old bandmate Townsend are the only remaining founding members. The British cult band formed 55 years ago.
Renting suddenly stopped: WeWork makes real estate markets tremble
In New York, WeWork has become the largest office tenant.
Within a few years, WeWork is moving from a small startup to a driving force in the world’s most expensive real estate markets. But now the company is in crisis. Landlords have to fear billions of dollars in revenue.
The crisis of the office landlord WeWork threatens to disrupt the balance in the world’s largest real estate markets. The company had just deposed founder Adam Neumann as chief executive, postponed the planned IPO and suddenly started selling subsidiaries and assets such as the private jet for the executives. In order to gain financial leeway for the coming weeks and months. In addition, the UK’s “Financial Times” reports, among other, that WeWork immediately closed the new
WeWork now leases large office space in the long term and leases them in short term in part small units to members. This can be individual freelancers, small startups or whole departments of large corporations. So far, WeWork is burning money at a stunning speed with this business. Last year, the company is expected to have a loss of $1.6 billion, with a turnover of $1.8 billion. This year alone, its rental costs are expected to increase to the large
According to the Financial Times, WeWork has now entered into leases of up to 15 years, resulting in commitments of more than $40 billion. These huge liabilities could become a problem not only for the company itself and its investors, but for entire real estate markets.
According to calculations by economist Dan Alpert of Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork in Manhattan, one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world, has rented nearly 300,000 square meters of office space in the past 24 months. In the meantime, WeWork’s new contracts have ensured that the demand for offices in New York has grown larger than the newly launched spaces in that time.
Also in the British capital, the balance in the real estate market could shift noticeably without a further expansion of the aggressive start-up. Among other things, WeWork is the main tenant, in an office building bought last year by the savings bank fund provider Deka for almost 100 million euros in the center of the financial metropolis.
Many landlords have converted their properties to meet the requirements of WeWork with high investments. If WeWork fails to make its business model profitable soon, the property owners would probably have to write off part of the hoped billions in revenue. Access to the - anyway scarce - reserves of WeWork have not been established, despite the long-term lease agreements. Because the hiring of the individual locations of WeWork Pur is usually done by the special subsidiary
Russia again detains many North Korean fishermen
In the past few days, a total of 262 poachers have been arrested, according to the Russian domestic intelligence service FSB, according to the agency Interfax.
Just ten days ago, 161 North Korean fishermen were arrested. Previously, the border guards had been shot and three of them injured. This time there were no injuries, it said. Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages.
According to the report, 8,000 North Korean fishermen were sailing in Russian territorial waters, where the Russian Coast Guard conducts patrols to protect their marine biological resources. During the renewed inspections, 30,000 squids were discovered. In addition, according to the data, three fishing boats and two motor boats were seized and coasts were taken to Nachodka and Posjet near Vladivostok.
The Russian Fisheries Authority had not issued fishing licences to North Koreans this year, even after complaints by local entrepreneurs. According to media, thousands of fishermen from North Korea were detained there in 2019.
The head of the Association of Russian Fisheries Companies in the Far Eastern region of Primorye, Georgi Martynov, recently also complained of high ecological damage by the North Korean fishermen. They fished with narrow mesh synthetic nets banned in Russia. With these would also small living creatures from the sea. In addition, the nets would be simply disposed of in the sea, where they would take 200 years to be dismanted.
Three members of the Russian Coast Guard were injured in the arrests last week, according to Moscow's Coast Guard. A North Korean, also wounded, died later from his injuries, according to the FSB. On that September 17, Russian border guards first arrested a North Korean boat and then a second after it opened fire.
US bans ex-President Castro on entry
The U.S. has banned Cuba’s former president Raúl Castro and his children from entering the country, and the U.S. State Department said in a statement on Thursday that Castro was involved in “gross human rights violations.” As head of the Caribbean State Communist Party, he presides over a system where thousands of Cubans are arbitrarily detained and there are more than 100 political prisoners.
"The violations of human rights and the use of force by the Cuban regime to support the former Maduro regime are responsible for the ongoing crises in Cuba and in Venezuela," the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted.
President Donald Trump on Wednesday ruled out entry bans, among others, against members of the Venezuelan government and the military. In Venezuela, a fierce power struggle has been raging for months between the government and the opposition. The US has imposed a whole series of sanctions against Maduro’s government to put him to his knees and help the opposition leader and self-proclaimed interim president Juan Guaidó to take power.
Cuba is regarded as one of Maduro’s closest allies. The socialist Caribbean island receives oil from Venezuela in exchange for the services of dispatched doctors. According to the US and the Venezuelan opposition, Cuba has also sent numerous intelligence agents to Venezuela to help the government in the repression of government opponents.
New Fridays for Future Climate Protests
One week after the largest international climate protests to date, thousands of people want to take to the streets again today for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement is planning another action and rallies in dozens of countries around the world. The start is likely to be due to the time shift in New Zealand and Australia before the protests spread across Europe to North America. There climate activist Greta Thunberg wanted to participate in a large rallies in Montreal, Canada. Protesters also wanted to gather in front of the White House in Washington.
It is relatively unclear how big the global pledge will be this Friday after the record participation of the previous week. Thunberg herself was good things. "Last Friday, over four million people have striked for the climate. This Friday, we will do it again!" she wrote on Twitter. So far, there have been 6383 actions in 170 countries as part of the strike week, she added.
Especially in Germany, the influx last Friday was very large. A good third of all global protesters - around 1.4 million - had participated in the protests in 575 German cities according to estimates by Fridays for Future. This time according to a list of the movement rallies are planned in at least 65 cities. Among them in metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne.
At the age of 15, Thunberg had taken a stand before the Swedish parliament in August 2018 in order to call on the politicians of her country to make a stronger commitment to climate protection. This gave rise to the Fridays for Future movement within a short time. The climate protests mainly involve students and students, but increasingly also scientists and other adults.
Together, they call for greater ambition from policymakers in the fight against global warming and the imminent climate catastrophe, and above all, according to the Paris Climate Agreement, global warming must be reduced to below 1.5 degrees Celsius compared to the pre-industrial era.
Thunberg had arrived in New York just a month ago after a two-week transatlantic tour with a high-sea race yacht. There she had last participated in climate protests and UN summits. On Monday, she gave an emotional speech at the UN, in which she spoke to the world's heads of state and government in an enthusiastic way to protect the climate. In her home Stockholm, the Right was more for Wednesday
Russia bans smoking on balcony
People in Russia are no longer allowed to smoke on the balcony in the future. This provides for a change in fire protection. "This also applies to smoking," a spokesman for the emergency ministry said Thursday in Moscow according to the agency Tass. The ban should come into effect on October 1.
If you smoke, a fine of 3,000 rubles (42.46 euros) is to be expected. If the cigarette should ignite a fire, the penalty will be higher. According to the Ministry, the ban also includes burning candles. Also grilling meat skewers on the balcony is no longer allowed.
Slap Against Cybercriminals - Investigators Raise Servers
In the fight against crimes on the Internet, German investigators have excavated for the first time a large server provider for illegal business on the darknet.
A total of 13 perpetrators are suspected as operators of a data center in a former NATO bunker in Traben-Trarbach an der Mosel to have hosted numerous websites about the internationally acting criminals operated their machinations.
Seven suspects were arrested on Thursday night during a major action. The darknet is a shielded part of the internet.
According to the prosecutor's office, the attack on 1.25 million telecom routers at the end of November 2016 was controlled via a server in the cyberbunker, and the suspects' customers were the operators of the world's second-largest darknet drug marketplace, "Wall Street Market", which investigators had smashed in the spring.
A hoster of this type was excavated for the first time in Germany, it was said. A web hoster provides the infrastructure for an Internet presence.
In the access action with the support of special forces such as the GSG9, there were searches in Germany and in neighboring countries. It was the result of almost five years of investigation. At noon, the investigators want to inform about further details.
New global climate protests from Fridays for Future
One week after the largest international climate protests to date, thousands of people want to take to the streets again today for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement again planned actions and rallies in dozens of countries worldwide.
In Germany, protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including in metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller municipalities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt. Climate activist Greta Thunberg wants to participate in a large rally in Montreal, Canada.
Climate protests <0xC7><0x80> Who are Thunberg’s backers?
Sense of justice and courage are high virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoke factories that warm the climate. All the more amazing that a 16-year-old girl is holding the mirror in front of the power people of this time. But what is behind it? Is it helpfulness or smart marketing of a climate activist? Historical masterpiece or manipulative tactics for its own sake?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg sets the masses in motion and causes young people to rise up for a better climate-friendly world. Historically, it is not the first time in Europe that a young person manages to win a collection of children and young people for himself. Already in 1212, a child named Nicholas from Cologne felt chosen to win over the young people can also advocate for a more just world.
But is there a shadow side in this regard? Why does it take a good share called "We don't have time" to save the world? In addition, Greta Thunberg has rich PR managers at her side. By the way, her mother has published a book that has sold far, thanks to the in the spotlight daughter.
Is it morally right to enrich yourself financially in saving the world? Is it still authentic when certain groups of people work with stockbrokers during the world rescue campaign? No matter what position is ultimately taken, a critical and reflected point of view is increasingly important in a democratic society.
Comet Discovered: Interstellar Guest Crosses Our Solar System
A strange comet is currently intersecting our solar system.
The assumptions of the astronomers have been confirmed: A foreign comet is currently crossing our solar system - it is only the second of its kind.
Garching/Washington - For a long time, the researchers only suspected it, but now they have certainty: A comet from another star is currently intersecting our solar system. It was christened after its discoverer 2I/Borisov and currently employs astronomers worldwide.
2I/Borisov: Comet discovered by amateur astronomers in Crimea
The body was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennadi Borissov in Crimea, who looked up to the sky with a self-built telescope, and further follow-ups confirmed his first suspicion. In fact, it is an unknown comet that does not originate from our solar system. It is only the second of its kind to be spotted while flying through.
The great opportunity for astronomers is now to get insights into an alien solar system from close by. Apparently, the comet is similar to our own system, as reported by the Canary Astrophysical Institute. The comet is clearly of interstellar origin according to the International Astronomical Union (IAC) and is currently moving on a so-called hyperbel orbit that leads it out of our system.
Comet has already been spotted before approach - and can be observed for several months
But before it is done, astronomers can observe it in depth, because unlike its predecessor, 2I/Borisov has already been spotted in its approach, which means that it can be studied from Earth for many months. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and then will still be visible with medium-sized telescopes by April 2020," explains Davide Farnocchia.
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I/2017 U1 "Oumuamua".
First insights into comet 2I/Borisov awaken hopes in science
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated to be between 2 and 16 kilometres in diameter. At the same time, the celestial body appears to be similar to our comets - because, as IAC researcher Julia de León puts it, the spectrum of the tail star is similar to ours. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form through similar processes as in ours, added de León's colleague Javier Licandro.
The fact that two such objects have already been discovered within just two years may allow a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems.
Recently, a giant asteroid crashed past the Earth and came dangerously close to it.
'Absolutely Reprehensible': Rachel Johnson appalled by brother
Boris Johnson's younger brother leaves the Cabinet, but now his sister whips the Premier's belligerent language with clear words as "flavorless". It's not the brother she knows.
"Capitulation", "fraud", contract": Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and is constantly upgrading - at least verbally. At the questioning hour in the House of Commons this Wednesday, this met with massive outrage from the opposition, and meanwhile, more critics have spoken out: dozens of bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The well-known journalist and author told Sky News that her brother used words such as surrender, as if the opponents of an EU exit should be "hung, stretched, quartered, tarted and feathered". She considers this to be extremely reprehensible. She does not recognize her brother's version, said Rachel Johnsons, who joined the UK's anti-Parliamentary party in the elections.
In particular, she stumbled upon the fact that her brother Jo Cox, an EU-friendly MEP, had come up with a very unpleasant way of saying that Johnson had been murdered by a neo-Nazi a few days before the 2016 exit referendum. Their memory could best be honored by passing through Brexit, Boris Johnson had said in the House of Commons.
Cox's widow also harshly criticized the prime minister. "It makes me sick when Jos's name is used that way," he tweeted. The best way to honor it is to stand up passionately and resolutely for what you believe in - no matter what your viewpoint is. But you should never "demonize the other side". He also complained that an atmosphere had arisen, in which attackers were likely to become.
Just a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson's younger brother Jo resigned his post as Secretary of State and his mandate as a Tory MP. "I've been torn between loyalty to the family and national interest over the past few months - it's an insoluble tension," Johnson said in a statement.
Johnson’s language has also faced harsh criticism in the Church. As the Times reports, all 118 bishops and archbishops of the Church of England criticize the language that “is not worthy of this country”. In a joint statement, they stated, “In recent days, the language has been unacceptable, both in debates and outside parliament. We should talk to each other with respect.”
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez at the Super Bowl
In the year of its 100th anniversary, the NFL is sending a strong signal: In the half-time show of the upcoming Super Bowl, two women with Latino roots appear, promising "an explosion of fun and energy".
Super Bowl latina power: Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will deliver the half-time show at the upcoming final of the US football league NFL, the organizers announced on Thursday (local time).
"I feel incredibly honored and humbled to represent the Latino community alongside JLo, because it has incredible strength in the US," Shakira said in a video.
The final of the American Football League, which celebrates its 100th birthday next year, will take place in Miami on February 2nd. In the metropolis on the southern tip of Florida, many people live with Latin American roots. Shakira ("Waka Waka") comes from Colombia, Lopez ("On the Floor") is of Puerto Rican origin.
"I love the fact that this time the Super Bowl puts two women on stage - and two Latinas," Lopez said. This sends an important message to all Americans and the world. It promises for the show "an explosion of fun and energy."
The 50-year-old was born in New York after her parents emigrated from Puerto Rico. In the 2000s, she landed with songs such as "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud" major hits and later also released songs in Spanish. Lopez also works as an actress and can be seen in the drama "Hustlers" in German cinemas from November.
Shakira became known in Colombia as the star of a telenovela and singer. She made her worldwide breakthrough in 2001 with her first bilingual album and single "Whenever, Whereever".
The announcement of the mid-term guests is every time anticipated in the US. This year, many also rate the selection as a political gesture. After all, the country is deeply divided, not least due to President Donald Trump’s immigration policy.
The Super Bowl is the biggest U.S. sports event and a gigantic advertising spectacle. Musicians like Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and the Rolling Stones caused a sensation there. In general, more than 100 million television viewers watch the NFL Final, it is also very popular in Germany by now.
Last year, there was political controversy in the run-up. The reason was the dispute over quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who, in protest of police violence against blacks, had refused to rise while playing the national anthem and had been harshly addressed for this, among other things, by US President Donald Trump. In solidarity with Kaepernick, some musicians had finally been rejected a Super Bowl appearance by many - including the Rocktra 5 Mar.
An actor and Youtuber attacks Egypt’s ruler: For the time being, Mohamed Ali prefers to stay abroad.
The two men who have influence on whether in the streets of Egypt blood flows again. He said the two of them spent the past week in foreign countries. One of them hovered at the airport of Cairo on Friday. President Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly. The ex-General, who had welcomed the Muslim brother Mohammed Morsi, the first freely elected head of state of the country, to protest at the U.S.
Mislead - that, according to the president, the other man, who currently determines what is happening in the streets, tries to mislead. Mohamed Ali, of course, remained abroad, where he escaped the access of the security forces, who would immediately arrest him, if he tried to enter Egyptian soil. Weeks ago, the 45-year-old was known as an actor only to a minority of the Egyptians. Today, he is the most famous in the country.
He addresses the head of state directly and in a quite rustic language. While the people are starving, the president revels in luxury and lets himself build magnificent new palaces, it is said. The army leadership on which Sisi bases his rule accuses Ali of corruption and enrichment. Because in his second profession as a contractor, he has just been doing business with exactly these gentlemen for 15 years, at least he seems to know quite exactly what he is talking about.
After last week's first protests since Sisi's grip on the power had demonstrated thousands against his rule and almost 2000 citizens, among them prominent figures of civil society, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, had been arrested, Ali called for this Friday to protest a "million march". That really so many people would dare to go to the streets, video shows was unlikely. But there came to be a few examples in the smaller protests,
From the city of Mansura in the Nile delta, where protesters last week wanted to prevent the demolition of the banners with the portrait of the president, a massive police presence was reported on Friday. Security forces erected checkpoints in the city and on the roads. In Cairo, several subway stations in the city center were closed because of "maintenance works", most of the streets around the Tahrir Square, the heart were closed.
Mohamed Ali said: "Our goal doesn't have to be Tahrir Square," he said in Barcelona, "Let's not clash with police officers," but as a withdrawal, "All Egypt is Tahrir Square."
If the provider promises too much performance
If the Internet connection always seems to be much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various testing options.
If you sign an internet contract, you do not need to blindly trust the speed data of the providers. Customers can verify for themselves how much of it is actually achieved if there are abnormalities.
After all, the previously promised transfer rates are part of the contract and should therefore also be achieved, explains the Bavarian Consumer Centre.
If the connection always seems to be much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various testing options. The measurement tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure the actual data transmission rates and compare them with the rate agreed in the contract.
"However, the tests of the providers are carried out according to provider-specific specifications and are therefore not uniformly and objectively calculated," the consumer center Bavaria on its side warns.
If the connection is much slower than announced, customers can set a reasonable period of 14 days for the provider to perform the promised service.
If this does not have any effect even after multiple requests, customers can terminate and, under certain circumstances, also claim damages. However, in the absence of success, only the course of action will help.
First ranked Republican to investigate
“I think the investigation is important, yes, and where that leads from here is determined by the facts that are established,” said Phil Scott at a press conference on Thursday. He wanted to know more about the whistleblower affair before action can lead to an impeachment.
Scott said he was not surprised by revelations that Trump repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyj in a phone call to investigate interventions by Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine, because Trump has been watching Biden "for years."
So far, Republicans have been reluctant to criticize Trump for the whistleblower affair; few have expressed discomfort as a result. Scott’s comments are a first indication of this in Trump’s party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has repeatedly opposed Trump’s policies, such as the loosening of environmental regulations and the tightening of immigration regulations.
Spider-Man Remains in the MCU: Another Marvel Movie Planned
It was a shock to all Spider-Man fans: at the end of August, it was announced that Sony and Marvel would go separate ways in the future. Tom Holland's Spider-Man would no longer be part of the "Avengers" universe. It was completely unclear how to proceed with the films around Tom Holland.
After "Spider-Man: Homecoming" and "Spider-Man: Far From Home", Spider-Man gets another final third film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). This is reported by several U.S. media. According to this, the cinema launch is already to be determined: In the United States, the film will start from July 16, 2021.
Marvel boss Kevin Feige is quoted in Screenrant magazine as saying, “I’m delighted that Spidey’s path continues in the MCU. I and everyone at Marvel Studios are delighted to continue working on it... He’s the only superhero with the ability to play in different universes as Sony continues to work on his Spidey verse. You never know what the future will bring”.
But how does it come to the sudden good news? Sony Marvel allegedly made an offer. According to industry magazines, the Disney group, which also includes Marvel, would take part with 30 percent of the revenue of upcoming Spider-Man movies. However, the news is not confirmed.
Duchess Meghan and Prince Harry appear in the "Suits" final
After nine seasons, the series "Suits" has now reached the big finale in the US. In the last episode, there were many happy endings and as many cameo appearances. And also the royal couple Prince Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who participated in the series for many years, were paid a charming tribute. Attention, the following sections contain spoilers to the series finale.
First of all, Duchess Meghan did not return in the final for a last farewell as Rachel Zane, at least not for new scenes. Instead, some reminiscences showed the most memorable scenes with today’s Duchess, such as the moments of the failed and successful wedding with Mike or how she greeted him after his imprisonment.
But her real husband, Prince Harry, was also casually mentioned in the "Suits" finale, of course in a wedding scene England. As Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 49) steps straight towards the altar to marry his fiancée Sheila (Rachael Harris, 51), then Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht, 47) makes a promising remark about the fact that he has gone over the suit.
Aegean: Baby and four other children drown in boat crash
A refugee boat in the Aegean Sea drowned a baby and four other children. A total of seven people died in the accident, the Greek coast guard said on Friday. The nationalities are still unclear.
The boat sank near the Greek island of Inousses, which lies between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland. Four children, three women and five men were rescued.
Hundreds of migrants from Turkey are currently transferring to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean Sea. Last year, according to data from the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), 174 people were killed on this route. Federal Interior Minister Horst Seehofer has now announced that he wants to visit both countries.
Together with his French colleague and the responsible EU Commissioner, he wants to inform Turkey about the refugee situation," Seehofer said on Friday, and then in Athens he wants to learn more about the "administrative problems of the Greeks" in order to be able to help with the management.
A spokeswoman for the European Commission confirmed on Friday the planned trip of Seehofer with EU Interior Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and France’s Interior Minister Christophe Castaner.
On Tuesday, the Greek Ministry of Civil Protection said that there were 654 migrants on the islands of Greece, according to the Greek Ministry of Civil Protection.
Does the Turkey deal still work?
The increase in the numbers recently raised doubts about the functioning of the EU-Turkey agreement concluded in 2016. This provides that the EU can send back all refugees and migrants who come illegally via Turkey to the Greek islands. In return, the EU wanted to accept a Syrian refugee from Turkey for every deported Syrian.
However, due to a shortage of personnel, the process of processing asylum applications is difficult on the Greek side. According to the Ministry of Civil Protection, Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos are waiting for almost 29,400 people. The worst situation is in Lesbos: 5,200 migrants are currently housed in a camp with capacity for 650 people.
There have never been so many since the EU-Turkey Refugee Pact came into force in March 2016, the state radio reported.
Climate change: Heat leads to more heart attacks
According to physicians, climate change will put the health system to the test in the future. The climate change is "very safe" one of the biggest challenges for the health system in the next 20 to 50 years, said Andreas Zeiher, President of the German Society of Cardiology. Especially the cardiovascular system caused high temperatures and large temperature jumps within a short time.
Green politician has to answer for embarrassing photo breakdown
The head of the Canadian Greens, Elizabeth May, in the election campaign - was the cup manipulated for this reason?
The Canadian Green leader holds a reusable cup in a photo, but now it came out: the cup was manipulated.
Ottawa/Canada - It has remained unnoticed for quite a long time - and finally noticed. The reusable coffee cup with metal straw Elizabeth May, the head of the Canadian Greens, never held in hand. On the party's website, she was shown in a photo with this cup, in conversation with citizens. However, the photo had already been published and also distributed to the media - and there was a beacher
Greens chief has to answer for photo breakdown
The National Post then accused May of manipulation and that the party is producing fake news in order to appear more credible on the topic of "environmental protection", and this in the middle of a campaign for the House of Commons election, in which Trudeau is also having an increasingly difficult time due to a bribery scandal.
The photo went viral on social media and encouraged the discussion about fake news. One user shares a juxtaposition of the photos and writes: "The Greens are manipulating a photo of their chairman to hide their disposable cup".
May was shocked and declared on her blog that she knew nothing about this action. To underline this, she posted the original: she, in conversation with citizens, had a cup in her hand. However, he, she correctly put it, was made of bamboo. She always had him with her. A spokeswoman of the party said it was only about putting the party logo on the picture.
"I don't want to call him stupid, but there was nothing to hide," she told the Guardian, and at the same time asked her over-engaged team: "If they want to edit a picture again, can't they do something with my face so that I look younger?"
The German Greens have also gotten into shitstorms because of their use of disposable plastic or because of air travel - but their pictures were not photoshopped. So the head of the Bavarian Greens, Katharina Schulze, ate ice cream with plastic spoons on holiday, as merkur.de reported *.
Influencer wants free upgrade: lifelong ban on Cathay
Jacqueline Ng is said to have received an upgrade from Cathay Pacific via email, but when she asked for it at check-in, she was not allowed to board - and she should never be allowed to fly with Cathay again.
Getting an upgrade to Business Class spontaneously - this is what many passengers dream of, sometimes lucky, and the staff at check-in offer a change from Economy Class for free.
However, this case shows how not to do it: A self-declared influencer has actively asked the airline Cathay Pacific for a free upgrade. On Instagram, Jaqueline Ng follows more than 65,000 users. On 30 May, she flew from Taiwan to New York and on 7 June, she flew back to New York.
On the outbound flight, employees refused to upgrade Jaqueline, although she showed an email in which Cathay Pacific allegedly offered an upgrade. The letter is believed to have been received by the influencer from an airline’s marketing staff, while the airline accused Jaqueline of falsifying the mail.
On the return flight, Jaqueline tried again to get an upgrade for the long-haul flight. This time, the woman is said to have shown the same mail, but with a different reference number. The employees at JFK airport were skeptical: They hacked at the headquarters. And in fact, the employee from whom the mail allegedly comes, deny the mail contact with Jaqueline. This also confirmed the mail system, which did not appear in the mailta.
The airline staff at the airport cancelled Jaqueline’s ticket and imposed a lifelong ban on Cathay Pacific, forcing her to buy a new ticket to Taiwan for $1,400.
With her case, the influencer turned to Elliot Advocacy, a company that represents consumer interests, because while Cathay had refunded her the price for her original ticket, Jaqueline also claimed the cost of the new ticket.
But until Jacqueline submits the metadata of the mail, the case remains clear: For Cathay, the influencer has committed fraud, she remains blocked for future flights. The airline's terms and conditions also state that she does not have to pay for the new flight. Jacqueline does not want to be satisfied with this - and now turns in a lawyer.
Oil prices decline after report on ceasefire in Yemen
Oil prices fell by more than a dollar in the shortest period of time on Friday afternoon. Recently, a barrel (159 liters) of North Sea Brent cost US$61.83 - around 1.4 percent less than the day before. The price of a barrel of the American West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell 1.3 percent to US$55.77.
A Wall Street Journal report on a ceasefire in Yemen said Saudi Arabia had agreed to a ceasefire in four territories.
A drone attack on Saudi Arabia’s oil facilities had halted five percent of the world’s oil production in mid-September. The Houthi rebels in the civil war country of Yemen, allied with Iran, had complained of the attacks. Saudi Arabia, like the US government, blames Iran. A ceasefire would ease the political tension in the region.
If an agreement is reached, one can focus on growth and demand concerns, said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank to Bloomberg.
A week ago, a barrel of WTI oil cost nearly $59, while Brent cost nearly $65, and the oil price was down.
Recently, Bloomberg reported, citing insiders, that repairs to oil facilities in Saudi Arabia are progressing faster than expected after the attack in mid-September, bringing production back to a volume of eight million barrels per day and moving back toward the original amount.
Recently, there have been several press releases citing insiders reporting rapid progress by the state oil company Saudi Aramco in the repair work, but commodity experts pointed out that Saudi Aramco currently wants to plan an IPO and avoid negative headlines.
At the same time, some relaxation in the conflict between Iran and Western countries indicated: The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" is on its way to leave the port more than two months after Iran's arrest and the recently granted clearance. The crew is now preparing to depart while the ship continues to anchor, Erik H<0xC3><0xA5>nell told a Swedish broadcaster on Friday.
The fear of an escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom has pushed oil prices up significantly in recent weeks.
Accusations against Trump are getting worse
In the case of possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump, cover-up allegations against the White House have become loud. Several leading government officials had made intensive efforts to prevent access to the wording of the conversation after a controversial phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyj at the end of July. Democrat said, "This was an anonymous whistleblower, the House spokesperson said.
North Korea considers Trump and Kim’s third summit questionable
North Korea has raised doubts that a third summit of power Kim Jong-un and U.S. President Donald Trump will soon take place in the nuclear dispute. The sense and the prospects of such a meeting are questionable due to the lack of progress in implementing agreements at the first summit in Singapore, top diplomat Kim Kye-gwan said on Friday, according to the agency KCNA.
The U.S. has not yet done anything to implement the resolutions of the summit last year, said the adviser to the North Korean Foreign Ministry. He also criticized tightened U.S. sanctions and the joint military maneuvers of the U.S. and South Korea, but he hopes for a "wise" and "courageous" decision by Trump to make a rapprochement again.
Trump said on Monday that he wanted to know what a third summit with Kim would bring before he agreed to do so. The negotiations on disarmament of the North Korean nuclear and missile program have stalled since the failed second summit of Trump and Kim in Hanoi in February. In June, however, the two agreed to meet again in the demilitarized zone without any success.
Prince Harry: Arms manufacturers to help mine clearance
Clothed with a blue splinter-protection vest, the British Prince Harry symbolically ignited and destroyed an explosive mine in Angola. Near a camp of the British Halo Trust near the town of Dirico, he made the ignition circuit. At a safe distance, the explosives exploded. With a view to the goal of getting Angola mine-free by 2025, but he did not have to ask all the countries to help the running TV cameras:
Pounds under pressure - interest rate cut expected
British pound under pressure
In the face of a swift interest rate cut, the pound will lose its value against the euro.
The Bank of England’s (BoE) interest rate cut is expected to hit the pound sterling on Friday, with the British currency dropping by up to 0.4 percent to $1,2269.
The sales were triggered by statements by central banker Michael Saunders, who talked about a cut in interest rates even if a chaotic Brexit could be averted, as the uncertainty will affect the British economy in the foreseeable future. This statement is surprising, as Saunders was considered an advocate of restrictive monetary policy.
Last week, the Bank of England had already pointed out the burden on the economy due to the Brexit-hickhack, without directly signaling a cut in interest rates. Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to lead his country out of the EU if necessary even without a divorce agreement on 31 October.
More: With his provocations, the British Prime Minister has taken a high risk, but it could pay off for him, says Handelsblatt editor Kerstin Leitel.
Doping: More Russian Manipulations Proven
Material from the Moscow analytical lab is being manipulated – this is confirmed by David Howman, former director of the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) and current head of integrity of the World Athletics Federation.
In January 2019, the Moscow Doping Laboratory finally delivered the required samples from the years 2012 to 2015 to the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada). Now, they have come to the fore. (Wada)
In December 2014, a systematic scam in Russian sports was revealed. The WADA held the Russian anti-doping agency (Rusada) for three years. During this time, Russian athletes were not completely banned from the world stage. The International Olympic Committee allowed the Russians after an individual examination at the 2016 Summer Games in Rio. They were around 270 athletes of the country competed in sports under neutral flag at the February
Positive findings are missing
The following September, the Wada lifted the Rusada ban again, but demanded access to the laboratory and the said samples. The data was intended to shed light on the extent of the cover-up of doping cases in state doping. They were intended to help subsequently punish athletes. Three months later, they were finally delivered.
The chairman of the Independent Integrity Commission (AIU) of the Athletics World Federation (IAAF) has been mentioned in January, however, have now confirmed that the doping data from the Moscow analytical laboratory have been manipulated. "Yes. We received the data nine months ago. We should check whether the task force has received the correct data," said David Howman in an interview with the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung" by Mc.
The World Cup is not affected
This confirms the position of the IAAF: the athletics federation is the only organization that holds onto Russia’s spell. At the Doha World Cup, 30 Russian athletes start under a neutral flag and have to prove that they are training and undergoing tests outside the Russian system.
At the beginning of this week, the Wada had already put in the room manipulations and asked Russia to respond to the allegations within three weeks. Russia now threatens the renewed blocking of the Rusada and in the worst case also the exclusion from the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.
