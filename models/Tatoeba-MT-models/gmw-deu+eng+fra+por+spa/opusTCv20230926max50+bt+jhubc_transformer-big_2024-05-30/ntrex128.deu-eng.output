Members of the National Assembly for Wales fear confusion with the Muppets
Some members of the National Assembly are dismayed by the proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This is due to plans to change the name of the National Assembly to "Welsh Parliament".
Members of the National Assembly of all political directions fear becoming the target of ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party’s National Assembly said his group was concerned because the name “rhymes with ‘Twp’ and ‘Pwp’.”
For non-Walese readers: in Welsh, "twp" stands for "doof" and "pwp" for "Aa".
A member of the National Assembly of the party Plaid Cymru stated that the whole group was "not happy" and proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his group was open to the name change, but pointed out the great similarity between "MWP" and "Muppet".
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced similar to the letter u in Yorkshire-speaking English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting a bill for name changes, said: "The final decision on names for the members of the National Assembly is, of course, up to the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 authorized the Welsh National Assembly to change its name.
In June, the panel published the results of a public hearing on the proposals that resulted in widespread support for the name "Welsh Parliament" for the National Assembly.
As regards the title of the members of the National Assembly, the body preferred 'Welsh Parliament Members' or 'WMPs', while the option 'MWP' received the greatest support during a public hearing.
Members of the National Assembly seem to propose alternative options, but striving for a consensus could be a problem for Chairman Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a bill within weeks.
The Reform Act will include further amendments to the functioning of the National Assembly, including rules for disqualifying members of the National Assembly and shaping the committee system.
Members of the National Assembly can finally vote on their name during their debate on the law.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on a change of country name
Voters will decide on Sunday whether to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum was set to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has a province with the similar name Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor means this claim to the Greek territory, and has repeatedly opposed its admission into the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the name change, said he would not accept the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is the price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
The Bells of St. Martin's Silence Given the Difficulties of the Churches in Harlem
“The old people I spoke to said there was a bar and a church on every corner in the past,” Adams said.
“Today there are no more both.”
He said the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
“People’s social life today is different,” he said.
“Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood where people regularly find themselves.”
In the churches, he fears that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the church leaders assume, and that sooner or later they will “begin again.”
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums where people live who do not support the remaining refuges.
“The overwhelming majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white,” he said, “and thus accelerate the complete closure of these churches, as it is unlikely that most of the people who move into these condominiums will become members of these churches.”
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis: Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist community moved out in the 1930s.
A black church that held its services nearby became the owner of the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black community under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers in 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem that refused to hire or support blacks.
In a fire in 1939, the building was severely damaged, but when Father Johnson's parishioners planned to rebuild it, they commissioned the carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin's, proudly described the carillon as "the bells of the poor."
The expert, who toned the carillon in July, used other words: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the world’s first carillon played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who had moved to the larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said he wasn't replaced by St. Martin's.
What has happened in St. Martin’s in recent months is a complicated story with architects and contractors, who have been attracted in part by the lay leaders of the church and in part by the bishops’ diocese.
In July, the council – the community’s leadership body consisting of lay leaders – expressed written concerns to the diocese that the diocese would try to pass on the costs to the council, even though it had not been involved in appointing the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Hai Injures 13-Year-Old in California in Lobster Diving
In California on Saturday, the first day of the lobster season, according to official statements, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy while diving for lobster.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
As Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego, he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy’s cry for help and paddled to the boy with several others to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought the boy was happy to have caught a lobster, but then he realized that the boy was screaming “I’ve been bitten!
I have been bitten!”
When Hammel arrived at the boy, he found that his entire collarbone had been torn open.
“I shouted that everyone should come out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’”
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is in critical condition.
The type of shark responsible for the attack was not known.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles told the media that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was concluded that it was not a dangerous species of shark.
Giles added that the victim had suffered traumatic upper body injuries.
Officials blocked access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Encinitas for 48 hours for investigative and security reasons.
According to Giles, there are over 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to push into the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's attacks boots, superdrugs and Debenhams with department store-like cosmetic departments staffed with specialized assistants.
As part of a large-scale push into the UK’s <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion cosmetics market, which continues to grow as fashion and household goods sales decline, the larger cosmetics divisions will be tested in eleven stores across the country, and if successful, they will expand to more stores next year.
The investment in cosmetics coincides with the search of supermarkets for ways to use store space previously used for televisions, microwaves and household goods.
According to Sainsbury's, the range of its cosmetics offering doubles for the first time to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing series of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also get more space and brand areas similar to those in stores like Boots.
In addition, the supermarket is relaunching its “Boutique” makeup series, making most of the products vegan-friendly – an aspect increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In addition, the perfume retailer Fragrance Shop will be testing in two Sainsbury's outlets, the first one opened in Croydon in southern London last week, and a second one will open later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Online shopping and the transition to the daily purchase of small amounts of food in local grocery stores mean that supermarkets need to do more to get customers to visit them.
According to Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, the retail outlets will increasingly look like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to fight discounters Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food items.
Sainsbury's has established Argos and Habitat chains in hundreds of Argos outlets and a number of Habitat outlets since it bought Argos and Habitat two years ago, boosting food sales and the profitability of the acquisitions.
The supermarket’s previous attempt to reorganize its cosmetics and pharmaceutical departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but it ended after a dispute over the distribution of revenue from the drugstore's stores in the supermarkets.
The new strategy follows Sainsbury's sale of its 281-store pharmaceutical business to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
The company said Lloyds will play a role in the plan by adding an expanded range of luxury skincare brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director at Sainsbury’s, said: “We have redesigned the appearance of our cosmetics departments to create a more attractive environment for our customers.
In addition, we have invested in specially trained colleagues who are available as consultants.
Our range of brands is tailored to meet all needs. Due to the enticing environment and convenient locations, we are now an attractive destination for cosmetic shopping, which challenges the previous way of shopping."
Peter Jones 'enraged' after Holly Willoughby's withdrawal from a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million business
"Dragons' Den" star Peter Jones is "angry" after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million business with his lifestyle brand company to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for the joint homewear and accessory brand Truly.
The business of the two was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s brand Goop.
The 37-year-old "This Morning" host announced her retirement on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby angered "Dragons' Den" star Peter Jones with her very short-term withdrawal from her lucrative lifestyle brand company to focus on her own new connecting contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Jones is said to have been "enraged" when television's "Golden Girl" admitted at a tense meeting at the headquarters of its business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, Tuesday, not being able to devote enough time to Truly's joint homewear and accessories brand due to their new businesses worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s brand Goop and would have likely doubled Willoughby’s estimated assets of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
While Willoughby, 37, announced her withdrawal from Truly on Instagram, Jones left the UK on his way to one of his vacation homes.
A source said: “Truly was by far the highest priority for Holly.
It should secure their future over the next few decades.
Their decision to withdraw came as a complete surprise to everyone involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, just before the launch.
At the headquarters in Marlow, a warehouse full of goods is waiting to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of “This Morning” host, one of the UK’s most promising stars, could cost the company millions due to high investments in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear and potential further delays in launching.
In addition, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends for ten years with Jones and his wife Tara Capp.
Willoughby founded Truly in 2016 with Capp, and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couples spend the holidays together, and Jones holds a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will be M&S's brand ambassador, replacing Ant McPartlin as the host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, “We’re not commenting on his business affairs.”
Hard words "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he expected from the news media for a comment that some would consider “non-presidential” and for such positive statements about the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said, imitating the voice of a news presenter:
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting, as the first meeting in Singapore in June was praised by Trump as a big step towards North Korea’s denuclearization.
However, denuclearization negotiations have stalled.
Over three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told leaders from around the world at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North is not seeing a "corresponding response" from the US to North Korea's first disarmament measures.
Instead, he noted, the U.S. was sticking to sanctions to maintain the pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
“We are very successful with North Korea,” he said.
“We were facing a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim showed positive results: end of missile tests, support in the release of hostages, and repatriation of the remains of American military personnel.
He also defended his unusual way of talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to be presidential, but instead of 10,000 people standing outside trying to get into this crowded arena, about 200 people would be standing here," Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake devastate an island in Indonesia and cost hundreds of lives
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Although over 10 percent of the population of Lombok was displaced, no national emergency was declared, a prerequisite for mobilizing international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they are not requesting international support, so that is a bit difficult," Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain whether foreign employees can work on-site.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the civil protection agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu on whether international bodies were likely to participate in the relief efforts.
Given the earthquakes that Indonesia is constantly struggling with, the country is still unfortunately poorly prepared for natural forces.
While tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, they are not a common sight on other coastlines.
The apparent lack of tsunami warning sirens in Palu, despite a warning that came into effect, probably contributed to the deaths.
Travelling between Indonesia’s numerous islands is an optimal challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok for the treatment of earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but will not reach the site of the new disaster in three days at the earliest.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of the weakened Indonesian infrastructure at the heart of his election campaign, spending ample money on roads and railways.
However, the government of Joko, who is seeking re-election next year, is suffering from funding deficits.
Joko is also under pressure from ongoing religious tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority practice a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands expelled from their homes and homes when gangs of Christians and Muslims fought on the streets with machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
View: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge scores a deep tie against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool on Saturday at London’s Stamford Bridge stadium with a hit in the 89th minute before a Premier League loss to Chelsea.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri at a 0-1 defeat of his team at about 27 meters from Chelsea's goal.
He aimed the ball to the left and then shot it towards the rear post.
The shot sailed high over the penalty area and drifted into the upper right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball fell over the jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and then into the net.
“I was just trying to get into this position and get to the ball, and players like Shaq always play forward as much as possible, so I was just trying to make as much time as possible for myself,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Edge coming and had a contact with the ball, I didn’t think too much about it and just took the shot.”
Chelsea led after a hit in the 25th minute by Belgian star Eden Hazard in the half-time with 1:0.
The blues striker gave a pass with the heel back to Mateo, then turned off near the midfield and sprinted into the Liverpool half.
Kovacic played a quick double pass in the midfield.
He then shot a good steep pass, so Hazard got into the penalty area.
Hazard left the defenders behind and closed off with a left-handed shot at Liverpool's Alisson Becker past the back of the net.
Liverpool will play in the group stage of the Champions League on Wednesday at 15:00 at Stadio San Paolo in Naples.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
Tsunami death toll in Indonesia rises to 832
The number of deaths from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the disaster protection agency said on Sunday morning.
Many people are said to have been trapped in the rubble of buildings that had collapsed due to Friday’s 7.5-strong earthquake, which triggered waves up to six meters high, authorities spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho reported in a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was littered with the ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest man, 32, suspected of murder after a woman was stabbed
After the discovery of a woman's body this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside, a murder investigation has been initiated.
The 44-year-old was found stabbed at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are asking residents to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is at an early stage, but I ask all those who have stayed near John Street in Birkenhead and have seen or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also ask all people, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something with a dashcam, to contact us and they may have information that is of the utmost importance to our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found lived in Birkenhead and was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman arrived at the scene to inquire where she was found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing, and police said they are in the process of informing the victim’s closest relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews was just trying to get into his apartment, but was informed by the police that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he learned what had happened.
Residents are now informed that it will take hours before they can enter the building again.
It was heard as a police officer told a man that now the entire area is being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears dissolved at the scene of the event.
She repeats over and over again, "That's so terrible."
At 2:00 p.m., two police vehicles were inside the barrier and another vehicle was in front of the barrier.
Within the barrier were several police officers overseeing the block.
Persons with information are asked to send a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101, or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 and refer to log entry 247 dated September 30.
The Cromwell statue in front of Parliament is the newest monument to be the subject of the dispute over rewriting history
Their banishment would be poetic justice for his Taliban-reminiscent destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious art products by his fanatical Puritan followers.
The Cromwell Society, however, described Crick's proposal as "stupidity" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, Chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in the current debate on removal of statues that the statue of Oliver Cromwell became the target in front of the Palace of Westminster.
The Pictorial Storm in the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the deeds of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent portrayal of Cromwell is evidence of the 19th-century opinion prevailing and part of the historiography of a figure that many still think is worth celebrating.
Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more than today at the end of the 19th century, as someone who defended Parliament against outside pressure, in his case, of course, by the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate representation is the subject of ongoing historical debates.
It is certain that the conflict in the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a single recognizable figure representing one side of this gap.
His achievements as a Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and remembering."
Killer pig bites Chinese farmers dead
According to local media reports, a farmer in a market in southwest China was attacked and killed by a pig.
The man, for whom only the surname “Yuan” was named, was found dead with a severed artery blood flowing near a pigsty in the market in Liupanshui province of Guizhou, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a swine farmer in Xining, Qinghai Province, China, prepares to inject swine vaccines.
He was reportedly travelling with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and saw that a door to a neighboring pighouse was open.
He said there was a big male pig with blood on his snout.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that the 250-kilo pig had killed the farmers.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and mutilated," the cousin, to whom the surname "Wu" was given, was quoted by the Guiyang Evening News.
Shots of a security camera showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been imprisoned to prevent attacks on more people while police gathered evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
While it is rare for pigs to attack people, such cases are known.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on her farm in Massachusetts, and the man suffered serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a pig weighing 290 kilograms trapped a Welsh farmer in between it and a tractor, until the farmer’s wife could scare away the animal.
After a farmer was eaten by his pigs in Oregon in 2012, a Manitoba-based farmer told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood could act as a “trigger.”
“They are just playful.
They like to twist and are very curious ... they are not out to hurt anyone.
You just have to treat them with the right level of respect," he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa bring widespread heavy rain to the southwest of the United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakens on the way over the colder waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, pink will bring floods causing rainfall in northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
On Sunday at 5:00 p.m. East Coast time, Pink had wind speeds of 136 km/h, equivalent to a Category 1 hurricane, and was located 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a trough begins to form over the Pacific Ocean, moving east to the west coast of the United States.When Rosa reaches the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, high tropical humidity is transported northwards to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will trigger up to 25 centimeters of rainfall in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, in the coming days, the tropical moisture creates widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest through interactions with the drawing trough.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation can cause dangerous flooding, water-driving debris, and potential landslides in the desert.
High tropical humidity sometimes leads to precipitation rates of almost 5 to 7.5 centimeters per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwest, especially in much of Arizona, precipitation is expected to be up to 5 to 10 centimeters.
Due to the scattering of tropical rainfall, there is the possibility of flood-like flooding with rapidly deteriorating conditions.
Given the threat of tropical rainfall, it is strongly advised not to walk into the desert.
Heavy rainfall can lead to ripping currents from canyons, and thunderstorms bring local gusts of wind as well as wind that carries dust.
The approaching trough brings locally heavy rain to parts of the coast of Southern California.
Total precipitation amounts of over one centimeter are possible, which can lead to small amounts of debris floating in the water and to smooth roadways.
This would be the first rainfall of the rainy season in this region.
The first isolated tropical rain showers reach Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning. On Monday evening and Tuesday it rains widely.
On Tuesday, heavy rain spreads into the Four-Corners region and continues on Wednesday.
In October, strong temperature fluctuations are possible throughout the U.S. as the Arctic cools down, while the tropics remain relatively warm.
This sometimes leads to drastic temperature differences over short distances.
On Sunday, there is a good example of drastic temperature differences in the middle of the United States.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, there is a temperature difference of almost 12 oC.
In the coming days, the persistent summer heat is trying to develop and expand again.
For a large part of the center and east of the United States, a warm beginning of October with widespread temperatures around 27 oC is expected from the Southern Plains to parts of the northeast.
New York City could reach 27 oC on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high probability of above-average temperatures in the first half of October in the eastern United States.
Over 20 million viewers watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
Over 20 million viewers watched the compelling statements of Supreme Court nominated Brett Kavanaugh and wife Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s, on Thursday on six television networks.
TV stations suspended their regular program on Friday because of a last-minute turn: an agreement negotiated by Arizona senator Jeff Flake, according to which the FBI should conduct a one-week investigation of the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100% sure that Kavanaugh had been drunk at a high school party, harassed her and tried to remove her clothes.
Kavanaugh said in a passionate statement that he was 100% sure that this had not happened.
It is likely that more than the 20.4 million viewers reported by Nielsen saw the hearing.
The company determined the average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
For other networks such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network that had broadcast the hearing, the numbers were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen usually has problems measuring viewership in offices.
To put this in perspective: this corresponds roughly to the number of viewers at a play-off football game or at the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion-driven presenters strongly support Kavanaugh’s nomination, recorded the highest numbers of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the full-day hearing, according to Nielsen.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the main character in Friday’s drama.
After the moderate Republican's office released a statement stating that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was filmed on Friday morning by cameras from CNN and CBS as protesters loudly pressed him in the elevator on the way to a hearing of the Justice Committee.
He stood with his eyes down for minutes while he was being bullied, and the scene was broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm standing right here in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
“They have power, while so many women are powerless,” said one woman.
Flake said his office had published a statement and added before the elevator concluded that he would have more to say at the hearing before the committee.
All cable and broadcasting networks broadcast live hours later, when the Judiciary Committee was due to vote on the forwarding of Kavanaugh’s nomination to the entire Senate.
However, Flake said he would only do so on the condition that the FBI investigate the accusations against the candidate next week, as demanded by the Democratic minority.
Flake was partially persuaded by conversations with a friend, Democrat Senator Chris Coons.
After an interview with Coons and subsequently several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake’s decision was of great importance, as it was obvious that without the investigation, Republicans would not have enough votes to support Kavanaugh.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of using Brexit for political purposes
Prime Minister Theresa May, in an interview with Sunday Times newspaper, accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of using Britain’s future for political purposes and undermining the nation’s interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Congress in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In an interview with her published on the front page of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson intensified his attack on her so-called “Chequers plan” for Brexit by calling a proposal to impose tariffs on Britain and the EU “completely absurd.”
Deadly shots at Wayde Sims: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in connection with death of LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in connection with the deadly shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University (LSU).
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and detained for homicide, according to Baton Rouge police.
According to the police, Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
As CBS partner station WAFB reports, police secured the glasses at the scene and said Simpson's DNA was found on the glasses.
According to a Simpsons interview, police said he confessed to the deadly shots at Wayde.
The lawyer reports that the bail has been set at $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released a preliminary report on Friday, according to which the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the throat.
The police thanked the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the Federal Police Criminal Laboratory, the Southern University Police, and the citizens in the area for their support in the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the regional law enforcement agency for “their care and their pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1.98m winger grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
Last season, he scored an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "deeply shaken" by Wayde's death and "stands in shock."
“You’re always afraid of something like that,” Wade said.
Volcano spits ashes on Mexico City.
Ash ejected from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern quarters of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Saturday warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater increased and 183 eruptions of gas and ash were recorded within 24 hours.
The agency monitored numerous cases of grunts and shocks.
Images on social media showed thin ash layers on the windshields of cars in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted increased activity at the volcano, located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Clashes between police and Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
In Barcelona, six people were arrested on Saturday following clashes between the stand-by police and pro-independence protesters, and thousands attended other demonstrations to commemorate the first anniversary of the polarizing independence referendum in Catalonia.
A group of masked pro-separatists held back by the waiting police threw eggs on them and also threw paint powder, creating dark dust clouds in the streets usually populated by tourists.
In the course of the day, there was also a clash with the police, who used their batons to contain the fighting.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted “No Forget, No Forgive,” while Unionists were facing them shouting “Long live Spain.”
According to the local press, fourteen people were treated for minor injuries suffered during the protests.
A year after the October 1 referendum, which was considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans, the situation in the independent region is still very tense.
The voters had voted for independence by an overwhelming majority, although the turnout was low, as the opponents of the secession largely boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when the police tried to prevent the vote in violent clashes in front of the polling stations.
Pro-independence groups had camped outdoors overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration for the national police.
The demonstration took place, but was forced to take a different path.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer sees the prospects of Catalonia gaining independence with hope.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry for joy because they could vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite an important, albeit scarce, victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan pro-independence parties had difficulty maintaining the momentum this year, with many of their best-known leaders either in self-imposed exile or in detention, where they are awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in favor of the police on his phone, said the conflict had been fueled by politicians on both sides.
“The situation is getting more and more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in custody since the end of last year, announced his candidacy for next year’s European Parliament elections.
“Contending as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the degradation of democratic values and the oppression by the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men Arrested After House Was Rammed by Car
Three men aged 33, 34, and 39 were arrested after a house in Londonderry was hit by a car several times.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m. after British summer time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building itself were damaged.
In addition, a crossbow may have been shot at the car.
Menga score means 1-0 victory over Rangers for Livingston
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the victory.
Livingston FC surprised the Rangers and led to the first second defeat for Steven Gerrard in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's hit proved crucial for Gary Holt's team to equalize with Hibernian in the second half.
Gerrard’s team will remain in the Premiership this season without a away victory and will face the Hearts on Sunday, which is eight points behind.
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the Europa League.
In the meantime, Livingston can increase his winning streak in the division to six games, meaning head coach Holt has not suffered a defeat since taking over Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses chances against open-minded guests
Holt’s team should have been in the lead long before the hit, as his directness put the Rangers before a variety of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through, but slowed down in front of the goal, then Alan Lithgow could only shoot far after he slipped in to hit Craig Halkett's headshot past the goal.
The hosts were content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could hinder the guests in standard situations.
This is how the decisive gate came about.
The Rangers allowed a free kick, and Livingston prepared a chance in which Declan Gallagher and Robinson put Menga in the shot position together, who shot the goal with a ball contact from the middle of the penalty area.
At this stage, the Rangers had dominated possession of the ball, but were unable to overcome the hosts' defenses, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly remained largely unaffected.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos once forced Kelly to defend.
Scott Pittman was kicked off by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow swung the ball past another Livingston standard situation.
Flanks repeatedly entered Livingston’s penalty area and were regularly removed from the danger zone, while two required penalty kicks – one from Halkett against the substitute Glenn Middleton and one for handplay – were denied.
“Phänomenal” by Livingston – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and a strong result for Livingston.
They were outstanding without exception and exceeded expectations for this upward trend again.
Their way of playing and their team have hardly changed since they returned to the top teams, but Holt deserves great praise for the way he has woken up the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great and led an excellently organized defense, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall kept on track throughout the game.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
As good as they were under Gerrard at times, they could not achieve this standard.
Their last ball was insufficient – only once they were able to penetrate the hosts’ team – and that’s something like a wake-up call for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan received mixed reactions in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29), smiling faces and blue skies prevailed as the heads of government of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin for breakfast.
It was the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany to repair relations between NATO allies.
There had been disputes over issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Erdogan then traveled to Cologne to open a large new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police cited security reasons for preventing a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters – many Kurds – also made themselves heard, condemning Erdogan’s policies as well as the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The opposing protests reflect the polarizing effect of the visitor, who is praised as a hero by some German Turks and slandered by others as an autocrat.
Traffic accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in collision with car
A car crash killed a cyclist in London.
The collision occurred at about 10:15 a.m. British summer time near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped, and paramedics took care of the man, who died at the scene of the accident.
Months before the accident, another cyclist had died in an accident involving drivers’ escape in Childers Street, about 1.6 kilometers from Saturday’s accident.
According to the Metropolitan Police, officials were working to identify the man and notify his closest relatives.
Road closures and detours for buses have been established, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long-Lartin Prison: Six Officers Injured in Unrest
According to the Prison Office, six prison officials were injured in riots in a high-security prison for men.
The unrest erupted at around 9:30 a.m. on Sunday at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and continues.
Specialized “tornado” officials were called in to end the unrest involving eight inmates and confined to one wing.
The officers were treated on the spot for minor injuries to the face.
A Prison Service spokesperson said: “Specially trained prison personnel have been deployed to remedy a still ongoing incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and would like to make it clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and possibly spend longer behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin is home to more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous offenders.
In June, it was reported that the prison leader was being treated at the hospital after an attack by a prisoner.
In October last year, emergency officers were summoned to the prison to deal with serious riots in which staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa Threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with Flood-like Floods (Drought Areas May Benefit)
It’s rare for a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but that’s what’s likely to happen early next week, when the remains of Hurricane Rosa are pulling across desert-shaped southwest and risk flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings of flooding on Monday and Tuesday from west of Arizona to south and east of Nevada as well as southeastern California and Utah including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will approach with rain on Monday evening and move directly over Phoenix on Tuesday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have come close to 320 kilometers as a tropical storm or tropical depression Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was found as a hurricane within 64 kilometers of the Arizona border."
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation, with occasionally up to 15 centimeters in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
In other areas of the desert-shaped southwest, including the central Rockies and the Great Basin, 2.5 to 5 centimeters are likely and, in some cases, up to 10 centimeters possible.
For those who are not at risk of flooding, the rainfall associated with pink can be a blessing due to the drought in the region.
Although flooding is a major concern, this rain will probably be useful in part, as there is currently drought in the southwest.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, at least 40 percent of Arizona's population experiences extreme drought, the second-highest category," weather.com reported.
First, the path of the hurricane means that Rosa will hit land on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa will still have hurricane strength with maximum winds of 136 kilometers per hour, located 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and then the hurricane will move north at 19 kilometers per hour.
In the Pacific Ocean, the storm will meet colder waters and thus weaken itself.
Therefore, Pink is expected to hit land on Monday afternoon or evening in Mexico with the strength of a tropical storm.
Precipitation can be severe in parts of Mexico, so there is a significant flood risk.
“From Baja California to the northwest of the Sonora Desert, rainfall sums of 7.5 to 15 centimeters are expected, with up to 25 centimeters possible,” said weather.com.
Subsequently, Rosa will move north across Mexico as a tropical storm, reach the border with Arizona as a tropical depression early Tuesday morning, and then move up through Arizona to the south of Utah until late Tuesday evening.
“As a major threat, very heavy rainfall is expected in Baja California, the northwest of the Sonora Desert and the desert-shaped southwest of the United States in connection with pink or its remains,” the National Hurricane Center said.
As a result of these precipitations, life-threatening floods and water-driving debris, as well as landslides in mountainous areas, are expected in the desert.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrests for Attempted Murder
After finding a 16-year-old with stab wounds in Somerset, three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton around 4:00 a.m. on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital and his condition is “stable.”
According to Avon and Somerset police, a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area.
The officials asked all those who have records of what happened on a mobile phone to report.
Trump said Kavanaugh suffered “because of the vileness, the rage” of the Democrats.
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the unscrupulous and unheard-of tactics of the Democrats,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh suffered during the nomination process “from the viciousness, anger” of the Democrats.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, rejecting the accusation made by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually harassed her decades ago when they were both teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on her accusation.
The president said on Saturday that the American people had seen the brilliance, quality and courage of Kavanaugh on that day.
"A vote for the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for the confirmation of one of the most experienced legal heads of our time, a lawyer with an outstanding record in the service of the general public," he told the crowd of his supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh’s nomination when he spoke about the importance of the involvement of Republican voters in the midterm elections.
“Five weeks before one of the most important elections of our lives.
I'm not running, but in reality I'm running," he said.
“That’s why I’m fighting for great candidates everywhere.”
Trump argued that the Democrats see their mission as “resisting and blocking.”
The first major procedural vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected to take place in the Senate by Friday at the latest, a senior GOP leadership official told CNN.
Hundreds killed in earthquake in Indonesia, number of victims rises
According to authorities on Saturday, at least 384 people were killed, many of whom were floated away when gigantic waves hit the beaches on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi due to a strong earthquake and tsunami.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday at a festival on the beach of the city of Palu when at dusk up to six meters high waves hit the beach, ripping many people to death and destroying everything that stood in their way.
The tsunami was preceded by an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
“When the threat of the tsunami came up yesterday, people were still pursuing their activities on the beach and did not immediately run away, and they fell victim to it,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia’s BNPB at a conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it swam cars, trunks and houses, it hit everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed trees on the run from the tsunami and survived, he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated and housed in 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the Civil Protection Agency showed numerous destroyed buildings and shops, bent and collapsed bridges, and a water-surrounded mosque.
On Saturday, the coastal town was shaken by further aftershocks.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian agency BPPT (Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology) said in a statement that the energy released in Friday’s massive quake corresponded to 200 times the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
Due to the location of the city at the end of a long, narrow bay, the tsunami could have grown larger, the authority said.
Nugroho described the damage as "comprehensive" and stated that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
According to him, the bodies of some victims were found among the rubble of collapsed buildings, 540 people were injured, and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said the number of casualties and damage along the coastline could have been higher 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the quake's epicenter.
According to Nugrohos, communication with Donggala was completely paralyzed, and there was no information.
According to a statement by the Red Cross, more than 300,000 people live there, and its employees and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse," the statement said.
On Saturday, the agency was often criticized for not informing that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the waves arrived at the time of the warning, according to official data.
Amateur footage posted on social media shows a man on the upper floor of a building desperately warning people in the streets below him about the approaching tsunami.
Within minutes, a water wall crashed onto the shore and floated buildings and cars away.
Reuters could not immediately verify the authenticity of the recordings.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a massive power outage that interrupted communication around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue operations.
According to the authorities, the military has started sending cargo planes with support from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated still urgently need food and other essentials.
The city’s airport will remain closed until October and will only be reopened for relief measures.
A visit by President Joko Widodo to evacuation centers in Palu was planned for Sunday.
The number of tsunami victims has risen to more than 800.
The location is very bad.
World Vision employees from Donggala have safely reached the city of Palu, where the employees are housed in tents in the courtyard of their office, but, according to Doseba, they passed scenes of devastation along the way.
“They said they saw a lot of destroyed houses,” he said.
The location is very bad.
Even as the relief groups began the hard task of launching disaster relief, some moaned that skilled foreign aid workers would be prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, financial aid, supplies and personnel from abroad are only possible if the place of an accident has been declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
“At the moment it is still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“Once the government says, ‘okay, this is a national disaster,’ we can accept international support, but so far this status does not apply.”
As the second night since Friday’s earthquake and tsunami descended over Palu, friends and family of the missing were hoping for one of the wonders that lightened up the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a young boy was pulled out of a sewer.
On Sunday, rescue workers freed a woman who had been trapped under rubble for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other prisoners at the Roa Roa Hotel were, Mandagi added, his students.
“As a senior in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden to bear,” he said.
Gendon told how, in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel among the paragliders made the round, he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the contestants from Palu who were attending the beach festival.
However, instead of checking blue ticks, his messages only resulted in gray question marks.
"I think that means the messages were not delivered," he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 while filling an ATM in Newport on the Levee
According to a press release from Newport police, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink’s employee while filling an ATM in Newport on the Levee on Friday morning.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied an ATM in the entertainment complex and wanted to lay down more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, “a man ran behind Brink’s employee” and stole a bag full of money intended for the vending machine.
According to the press release, witnesses saw several suspects flee the scene, but police did not say how many people were involved in the incident.
Persons who have information on the identity of the suspects are asked to contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper Changes Name to Ye
Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
In announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “The being formally known as Kanye West.”
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and has used it as the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change precedes his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where the release of his new album "Yandhi" is expected.
He appears on the show as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the producer, has cancelled for "emotional reasons".
The word is not only an abbreviation of its current professional name, but it has a religious meaning for the West, according to its own statement.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,” West said in a talk about his album this year with radio presenter Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us, it is us.
Kanye, which means ‘the only one’, became just ‘yes’ – simply a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, of everything.
The album is more of a reflection of what we are."
He is one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, with whom West worked earlier, has already written his name with and without hyphen and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use the military against civilians
Elected Mexican President Andres Manuel López Obrador vowed to never use military force against the civilian population as the 50th anniversary of bloody repression against students in his country draws near.
López Obrador pledged on Saturday at the Tlatelolco Plaza, “never use the military to oppress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, soldiers fired at a peaceful demonstration on the square, killing 300 people. At that time, leftist student movements were establishing themselves throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador pledged to support young Mexicans through monthly student grants and the opening of further free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities led young people to criminal gangs.
U.S. doubles funding for artificial intelligence
Given China’s increased activity in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double its spending on research in that field, says investor and AI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked at Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
The comments follow AI announcements from various areas of the U.S. government, even though the U.S. generally lacks a formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: The country intends to become the No. 1 in the field of AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, given that all the other countries are so far behind the US, and we’re looking for the next AI breakthrough,” Lee said.
The doubling of funds could double the chances of the next major AI success in the US, Lee said this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that defeated the highest-ranked American Othello player, and later served as a senior executive at Microsoft Research and president of the Google branch in China.
Lee paid tribute to previous U.S. government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotics Challenge (DARPA) and asked about the timing of the next competition as he wanted to help identify the next visionaries.
According to Lee, researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to get government subsidies.
“It’s not China that is taking away the top academics, it’s the companies,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired tycoons from universities to work on AI.
In Lee’s view, a changed U.S. immigration policy could also be conducive to U.S. AI efforts.
“I think that people with a doctorate in the field of AI should automatically be offered green cards,” he said.
In July 2017, China’s State Council unveiled its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan (AI).
According to Lee, the National Natural Science Foundation of China funds individuals at academic institutions similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organizations allocating funds to U.S. researchers, however, the quality of academic work in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, in which partners from industry and science will be involved, and the White House announced the formation of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in the AI Next initiative this month.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) is currently investing more than $100 million annually in AI research.
In the meantime, U.S. laws regarding the formation of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence have not changed in months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on change of country name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia", which would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that had blocked Macedonia's requests for admission to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor means that this claim to the Greek territory, so Greece has vetoed the admission of Macedonia to NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and a boycott campaign doubts that the turnout will reach the 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the ballot was: "Do you support membership of NATO and the EU by accepting the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, which includes Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, inclusion in organizations such as the EU and NATO is worth the price.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because this means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legally binding, enough members of Parliament have said they would stick to the result so that it is decisive.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The state election commission said there were no reports of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, in which 66 percent of registered voters had cast their votes.
"I'm here because of my children to vote, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonia’s Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko cast their vote on 30 September 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia, in the referendum on changing the name of the country that would open the way for Macedonia to join NATO and the European Union.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of tents set up by people who wanted to boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join raised heads, not through the back entrance,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the integration between Europe and Asia.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will result in much-needed investment for Macedonia, whose unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
"I believe that a large majority will be in favour, as more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after his vote.
In his words, a ‘yes’ result would be a ‘confirmation of our future’.
According to a poll published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of the voters would participate in the referendum, which is below the required turnout.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian broadcaster Telma TV found that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent of them said they would say yes.
In order for the referendum to be successful, voter turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
Failure to hold the referendum would be the first major blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since it took power in May last year.
View: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City maneuvers through the entire Brighton defence to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated Manchester City in the 2-0 victory at Etihad Stadium in Manchester on Saturday.
Aguero made his hit look ridiculously easy in the 65th minute.
The Argentine attacker received a pass in the midfield at the beginning of the sequence.
He raced between three Brighton defenders and then ran into the open field.
Aguero then saw himself surrounded by four green jerseys.
He played around a defender and then overtook several more defenders on the edge of the Brighton penalty area.
He then shot a pass to Sterling.
The English attacker used his first ball contact in the penalty area to play the ball back to Aguero, who overcame Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with his right shoe and shot into the right side of the net.
"Aguero is struggling with problems in his feet," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We talked about him playing for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at that moment."
However, it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League duel.
This goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball on this move far on the side of Brighton.
He shot a good steep pass along the left flank to Leroy Sané.
Sané needed a few moves to drive Sterling to the long corner.
The Sky Blues attacker aimed the ball into the net just before it slipped into the out.
City will play in the Champions League group game on Tuesday at 12:55 pm in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim against Hoffenheim.
Scherzer wants the Rockies to spoil the game
Since the Nationals were eliminated from the playoff competition, there was little reason to force a further stake.
However, the ever-performing joke hopes to be on the hill against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if this is relevant to the playoffs for the Rockies, who have a game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies scored at least one wildcard with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but still want to secure their first division title.
“Although we don’t play for anything, we can at least throw because we know the atmosphere among the spectators here in Denver and the other team would probably play at the highest level I would encounter this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to participate in this competition?”
The Nationals have not yet announced a starting player for Sunday, but are inclined to have Scherzer thrown in such a situation, according to reports.
Scherzer, for whom this would be the 34th stake as a starting player, practiced in bullpen on Thursday and would throw on his normal rest day on Sunday.
The Washington right-hander has an 18-7 statistic this season, showing an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump holds rally in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation related to Brett Kavanaugh, whom he selected for the Supreme Court, when he spoke about the importance of the involvement of Republican voters in the midterm elections.
“Everything we have done is at stake in November.
Five weeks before one of the most important elections of our lives.
That’s one of the big, big ones – I’m not running, but in reality I’m running, which is why I’m fighting for great candidates everywhere,” he said.
Trump continued, “You see this horrific, horrific radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to take power again by all means, you see the vileness, the abomination.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, we’re not going to give them.”
The Democrats, he said, see their mission as “resisting and blocking.”
“And you see that in the last four days,” he said, describing the Democrats as “angry and mean and disgusting and dishonest.”
He named the highest-ranking Democrat in the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Dianne Feinstein, which caused loud buhrufs among the public.
“Remember your answer?
Did you let the document go outside?
Uh, uh, what.
No, no, I’m waiting for you—that was a really bad body language—the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Labour no longer accepts all opinions.
The party is intolerant of those who express their opinions.
When the momentum activists in my local party voted to blame me, this was not surprising.
After all, I am the last in a series of Labour MEPs to be told that they are not welcome – just because we say our opinion.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan was treated similarly because she had stood up vigorously against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized with the reprimand for having a different opinion than Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically, on similar issues on which Jeremy disagreed with former top politicians.
The announcement of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday stated that “the meetings should involve all and be productive.”
Most of the Friday evening GC sessions during my eight years as a local Labour MP were just that.
Today, unfortunately, most meetings are not marked by this tone, and the promised "more friendly, more cautious" policy has long been forgotten, if it ever started.
It is becoming increasingly clear that dissenting views in the Labour Party are not tolerated and that each opinion is judged by whether it is accepted by the party’s leaders.
This began shortly after Jeremy became party leader, and colleagues with whom I previously believed to share similar political views were now expecting me to turn around and take positions that I would otherwise never have agreed with – whether it was in terms of national security or the European single market.
Whenever I speak publicly – no matter what I say – there follows a social media mockery that calls for my disapproval, denounces the political center, and says that I should not be a member of the Labour Party.
And with this experience, I am not alone.
In fact, I know that I am better off than some of my colleagues, as the comments addressed to me are mostly political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a flood of sexist or racist insults every day and never give in.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political age is that insults have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn called on the Labour Party to promote a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we no longer allow all opinions to apply, and with every motion of censure and every change in the electoral rules, the party becomes more narrow-minded.
In the last two years, I have often been advised to withdraw my head and not express my opinion so clearly, so that I would "have no problems".
But I did not go into politics for that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, driven by the neglect of the Thatcher government, which literally made my classroom in the entire school fall apart, I have fought for better public services for those who need them most – as a councillor as well as a cabinet minister.
I never hid my political views, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be unclear in any way about my political positions and areas in which I disagree with the current leadership.
To the supporters of Friday’s motion, I would just like to say the following: Given that the country is rushing towards a Brexit that will harm households, businesses and our public service, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
In fact, I am not sending this one message to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that so many abstention threats or political purpose thinking will not stop me from acting in my opinion in the best interest of all of you.

Ayr vs. Melrose 38:17: Unbeaten Ayr team rises to the top
Two late attempts may have slightly distorted the final result, but there is no doubt Ayr deserved the victory in this extremely entertaining game of the day in Tennent's Premiership.
They are now the only one of the ten teams to be unbeaten at the top of the table.
Ultimately, the success of the home team was due to their superior defense as well as their better utilization of opportunities, and coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be satisfied.
“We’ve been tested in our games so far, and we’re still unbeaten, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “Recognition for Ayr, they’ve made better use of their chances than we do.”
Grant Anderson's 14-minute attempt, increased by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in the lead, but Melrose was able to make the numbers speak for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who had been exempted for the game by the Warriors, and Jason Baggot caught a non-increased attempt.
Climo expanded Ayr's lead with a penalty kick before scoring a hit right in the half and then scoring an increased attempt on his own, so that it stood for Ayr at the break of 17:5.
Melrose started the second half well, however, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was increased by Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
After a prolonged interruption due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, Ayr expanded his lead through a Climo-increased attempt by Stafford McDowall.
Then, as captain of Ayr, Blair Macpherson received a yellow card, and once again, at the end of a phase of enormous pressure, Melrose had the additional man pay by a non-increased attempt by Bruce Colvine.
However, the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for tackling without a ball against Climo, MacPherson scored a touchdown from the penalty kickway behind the advancing Ayr package.
Climo increased as almost since the interruption, after Kyle Rowe intercepted David Armstrong's box kick and sent flank player Gregor Henry to the home team for the fifth attempt.
"Still Game" star seems ready for new career in gastronomy
"Still Game" star Ford Kieran appears to be ready to move into the hospitality industry after it turned out that he was named as the CEO of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, whose scripts he writes and in which he plays one of the leading roles together with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last of the show, and Kiernan seems to be planning a life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is managing director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, though a source from the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan was interested in entering Glasgow’s “flourishing restaurant business.”
“The sea belongs to us”: Bolivia, enclosed by land, hopes that a court will open its way to the Pacific
Sailors patrol in front of the rope-decorated naval headquarters in La Paz.
There is a blue flag on public buildings.
Fleet bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon have the motto: “The sea is our legitimate property.
Getting it back is a duty.”
Everywhere in the country-enclosed Bolivia, the memory of the stretch of coastline lost to Chile in a bloody conflict for resources in the 19th century is as alive as the desire to cross the Pacific again.
These hopes may be as strong as they have been for decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling by the International Court of Justice to be given on October 1 after five-year deliberations.
“Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and expects the result, of course, with a positive attitude,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Across the country, many Bolivians will follow the ICC’s ruling on large screens in the hope that the Hague court will decide in favour of Bolivia’s demand, which Chile, after decades of sporadic talks, is obliged to negotiate Bolivia’s sovereign access to the sea.
For Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president, who is facing a controversial battle for his re-election next year, the verdict on Monday is also at stake.
“We are on the verge of returning to the Pacific,” he pledged at the end of August.
However, some analysts consider it unlikely that the court will decide in favour of Bolivia, and believe that little would change as well.
The UN body, based in the Netherlands, is not authorized to allocate Chilean territory, and has determined that it will not decide on the outcome of possible talks.
According to Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law, the ICJ’s ruling has already been handed down six months after the final plea, concluding that the case was “not complicated”.
Far from supporting the Bolivian case, the past four years could also be a setback.
"The current Bolivian government has raised the issue of access to the sea," Zárate said.
It suggested that Morales' warlike rhetoric had stifled any remaining goodwill of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their talks at some point, but after these events, this will be extremely difficult.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the view that the court’s decision was abnormally fast.
On Monday, Bolivia has “an extraordinary opportunity to usher in a new era of relations with Chile” and an opportunity to “end the 139 years of mutually beneficial disputes,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – used the issue of the sea as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific,” he added.
“The verdict is an opportunity to realize that we have to overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will only take place if it can trust the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his nation would never disarm its nuclear weapons first if it could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to turn the promises made during a summit between the heads of state of the rivals in Singapore into action.
His remarks come at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, more than three months after the summit with North Korean head of state Kim Jong-un in Singapore, seems on the verge of resuming the stuck nuclear diplomacy.
Ri described the notion that further sanctions and the U.S. resistance to a declaration to end the Korean War would ever bring the North to its knees as a “brain-spin.”
Washington is skeptical and does not want to endorse the declaration without Pyongyang first taking substantial steps to disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
There is widespread skepticism, however, that Pyongyang is serious about renouncing an arsenal in which the country sees probably the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris showcase the latest collections of giant headgear that will soon be available in the shopping streets in your area
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely shield the sun, you no longer have to look.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne showed a range of crazy oversized headwear on the catwalk for their 2019 summer collection, which fascinated the fashion world at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats have flooded Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their eye-catching creations across the catwalk.
The most outstanding piece by Valentino was an extravagant beige hat with a feather-like wide edge that almost crushed the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included jewel-set watermelons, a wizarding hat and even a pineapple, but they are not meant to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also unveiled a series of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks were sewn with lips and had more resemblance to Hannibal Lecter than to Haute Couture.
One creation resembled a diving gear, including snorkeling and diving goggles, while another looked like a melted ice pack.
And if you want to put another huge fashion statement, you’re lucky.
Fashion watchers predict that the giant headgear could find its way into shopping streets near you.
The oversized hats follow directly to “La Bomba”, the straw hat with 60 centimeters wide rim, which everyone wears from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the extremely impractical hat that hit big waves on social media sent another big creation across the catwalk: a beach bag made of straw that was almost the size of the swimsuit-wearing model who held the bag.
The reddish orange bast bag with bast fringes and a white leather handle was the outstanding piece of Jacquemus' summer 2019 collection "La Riviera" at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I anticipate that big hats and beach bags will be available in the shopping streets for next summer. The designer has stirred so much attention that the demand for oversized accessories will be hard to ignore.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential for world citizens
Scotland’s independent schools continue to stand out for academic excellence, which continued in 2018 with further outstanding exam results and is only underpinned by individual and joint achievements in the fields of sports, arts, music and other community ventures.
With more than 30,000 students from all over Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to provide the highest possible level of care for their students and their parents.
Independent schools pursue the goal of preparing their students for further education and higher education, the profession of their choice and their place as world citizens.
As an education sector that can design and put into practice a tailor-made curriculum, we see that modern languages are still popular and sought after in schools as electives.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to someone in a language he understands, you reach his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will reach his heart."
This is an impressive reminder that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the current exam results of this year, we can see that languages with the highest pass rate are at the top of the rankings of independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who learned foreign languages scored A in the higher exams.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students in Mandarin scored A in the higher exams, while 72 percent of students studying German, 69 percent of students studying French, and 63 percent of students studying Spanish also scored A.
This illustrates that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as an important knowledge that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now considered elective subjects as well as STEM subjects (science, engineering, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere.
According to a 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills, 17 percent of the reasons employers cited for the problems of filling vacancies were related to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly essential when it comes to preparing young people for their future profession.
As more and more vacancies require languages, this knowledge is essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the chosen profession, young people who have learned a second language will have a real advantage in the future through such a lifelong ability.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give multilingual people an edge over competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage (15 percent).
For this reason, it is important for today’s children that we invest in language lessons now.
Children who speak multiple languages, especially languages from developing countries, will have better chances of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, different languages are taught in all schools.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while other will teach languages that are considered the most important for the UK with a view to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Wherever your child’s interests lie, independent schools will always have a range of languages with appropriately specialized teachers to choose from.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment that prepares the children and equips them with the skills necessary for their success, whatever the future looks like.
At this point in a global economic environment, it cannot be denied that languages are still of fundamental importance for the future of the country. Therefore, this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should actually be regarded as “international communication skills.”
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this choice, diversity and excellence.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron ahead of Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego
For fans who want to see LeBron James compete for the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time, the wait will soon come to an end.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday in the opening game of the pre-season.
How many minutes he will play, however, has not yet been determined.
“It will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play for just a few minutes.
Earlier this week, after training, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers’ six-game pre-season schedule.
“I don’t need pre-season games to prepare at this stage of my career,” he said.
Time for Trump’s rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump’s five rallies scheduled for next week, including in him-minded locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Given the pending vote on confirming his election to the vacancy at the Supreme Court, Trump wants to build support for the upcoming mid-term elections in November as Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress in the process.
When will Trump’s rally in West Virginia take place tonight, and how can you watch it online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for today, Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 19:00 (East Coast time).
You can watch Trump’s rally in West Virginia below as a live stream on YouTube online.
Trump is likely to address the hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh on allegations of sexual misconduct conducted in a tense atmosphere this week. The expected Senate vote on confirmation remains suspended for up to a week as the FBI conducts investigations.
However, the main goal of this rallies series is to support Republicans facing a November difficult election.
As a result, President Trump’s campaign team told Reuters that these five rallies next week will serve to “mobilize volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to maintain and expand their majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives.”
“Control over Congress is so important for his plans that the president will travel to as many states as possible as the busy campaign season draws near,” a Trump campaign spokesman who did not want to mention his name told Reuters.
According to the West Virginia Metro News, the rally, scheduled for tonight at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, could include “Ohio and Pennsylvania supporters and report media from Pittsburgh.”
The visit on Saturday is Trump’s second visit this month to West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to support West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to try to boost him in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. Team Shows Readiness to Fight to Maintain Hope for Individuals on Sunday
After three one-sided rounds, the four-match Saturday afternoon might have been exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of momentum as a sports concept is a pure invention, but one that players really believe in, and especially in competitions like this.
Where do you think the momentum is now?
"They were in the lead with six points, and now they are four, so I think that means a little momentum for us," Spieth said when he left the venue.
Europe, of course, has an advantage and is four points ahead, while twelve others follow.
However, according to Spieth, the Americans feel some wind in their sails and have reason to feel encouraged, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and can show three out of four points each.
Spieth was incredibly strong from the tee to the green and is leading by example.
The guttural enthusiasm screams got louder in the further course of his lap as he sank an important putt to decide the fourth match with four points for both after he and Thomas were back after two holes with two points.
His putt, which decided on the 15th hole match for her, triggered a similar cry, suggesting that the American team is not out of the game yet.
"I really need to kneel down and take care of my own game," Spieth said.
That’s all that remains for the individual players.
18 holes to set a sign.
Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood have been the only players to have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days, undoubtedly writing the history of the Ryder Cup.
Europe’s unequal but sympathetic duo is at four out of four points and can do nothing wrong.
“Moliwood” wasn’t the only pair that didn’t hit a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the back nine holes on Friday morning.
This series and the seemingly flowing energy between them and the buzzing crowd underpins that they are the players to beat on Sunday. Fleetwood and Molinari would be the most popular players sealing a possible European victory at the sunset over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time at different holes.
However, speaking of European fame would be premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a brief trial with Sergio Garcia, the morning four-man hero who played alongside Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles at the front nine holes put the Spaniard and the Swedes in a jam they couldn’t nearly overcome.
On Sunday, however, no one can help them out.
The fours and fours pairs are so fascinating to look at up close due to the interactions between the couples, the advice they give or don’t give, and the way a strategy can change at lightning speed.
The Europeans have played better as a team so far and are clearly in the lead on the last day, but this four-round has also shown that the US team is ready to fight, which some, especially in the US, had doubted.
Europe takes the lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup with 10:6
Europe is ahead of the US by 10-6 after Saturday’s fours and fours, with a solid lead in the final day of the Ryder Cup.
The brilliantly playing duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari advanced with two wins over the difficult Tiger Woods and was able to score four points in Le Golf National.
The European team led by Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, who wants to win back the trophy lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the fours in the morning against the faulty American team and won the series by 3:1.
In the four games, the US made more resistance and won two matches, but was unable to catch up with the backlog.
Jim Furyk’s team needed eight points in the twelve singles played on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first European newcomer to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, christened "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, won four points in their four opening matches as the second duo in Ryder Cup history.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fours, they harmonized superbly and beat the disenchanted Woods and the American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau with an even stronger 5&4.
Woods, who had been dragged through two matches on Saturday, occasionally flashed his brilliance, but has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in fours and fours and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested during the fours in the morning, returned and played the fours as Henrik Stenson's partner, winning 2&1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, number one and three in the world.
For Europe, however, on this pleasant windy day southwest of Paris, not everything went according to their expectations.
Three-time Major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They scored a tough 2&1 win in the fours over Spain’s Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter, beating Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the fours 4&3 after losing the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, it has only happened twice that a team came back after going into the singles with a four-point backlog, but as a title holder, a draw is enough for Furyk's team to keep the trophy.
After being second only for two days, it doesn’t look like they could start a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea rejects unilateral disarmament without confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister said on Saturday before the United Nations that continued sanctions deepened its distrust of the United States and that under these circumstances the country would not give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the World Organization that North Korea "has taken essential measures last year out of good will," including stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site, and committing itself not to multiplying nuclear weapons and technologies.
"We don't see a response from the United States," he said.
“Without trust in the US, there is no trust in our national security, and under these circumstances we will not unilaterally disarm ourselves first.”
While Ri repeated trusted North Korean complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “phased” denuclearization approach where North Korea would be rewarded for successive steps, his statement seemed significant in that it did not reject unilateral denuclearization from the outset, as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri pointed to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit meeting between an incumbent US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim had pledged to work towards “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,” while Trump pledged guarantees for North Korea’s security.
North Korea is striving for an official end to the 1950-1953 Korean war, while the United States has said that Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
In addition, Washington opposes demands for a relaxation of the stringent international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'first denuclearization' and increases the pressure from sanctions to achieve its goal by coercion, and is even against the 'declaration of the end of the war,'" Ri said.
“The assumption that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a brainstorming of people who don’t know anything about us.
The problem, however, is that the continued sanctions deepen our distrust.”
Ri did not respond to plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. head of state had highlighted earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, the minister pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korean head of state Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If South Korea were the other party on the denuclearization issue instead of the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come to a standstill.”
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri’s speech was tremendously different from last year’s speech when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to use North Korea’s missiles to target the mainland of the United States after “evil president” Trump described Kim as a “missile man” on suicide missions.
This year, Trump, who threatened last year with the "complete destruction" of North Korea, praised Kim at the United Nations for his courage to take steps toward disarmament, but said there was still a lot of work to be done and the sanctions would have to remain in place until North Korea was denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for it: “Whether it takes two years, three years or five months – it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council must reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: “In any case, the enforcement of the Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously until we have reached complete, final and verified denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously stepped up sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to financially dry out Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and subsequently said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was unsuccessful.
In July, he said on his departure from Pyongyang that progress had been made, only to be accused hours later by North Korea of making “gangster-like demands.”
North Korea pledged at a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a rocket base and a nuclear complex if the United States took "corresponding measures."
He said Kim told him that the intended "corresponding measures" were security guarantees given by Trump in Singapore, as well as steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard Students Learn to Sleep Enough in a Course
A new course at Harvard University ensures that all undergraduate students get more sleep this year, a measure against the spreading macho culture of keeping up with caffeine and learning all night long.
A scientist has found that students at the world’s leading university are often unnecessary when it comes to taking care of themselves.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and is in his opinion the first such course in the United States.
He was inspired to launch the course after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
“At the end, a girl came to me and asked, ‘Why am I only learning about this now, in my last year?’
After all, no one had ever told her how important sleep is, and that surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
This year’s first-ever course taught students how the basics of good sleep habits contribute to academic and athletic performance and also improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and managing director of the university’s health services, said the university chose to launch the course after finding that students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a range of interactive tasks.
In one section, students see the picture of a room in a dormitory and click on coffee cups, curtains, training shoes and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the effects of lack of sleep on athletic performance and the importance of a sleep routine.
In another section, participants learn that long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and cancer.
They are then encouraged to reflect on their daily routine by using a map of the university campus with interactive symbols.
“We know that it won’t change students’ behavior immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know this, just as you have the right to know how smoking affects your health," Czeisler added.
The pride of “shushing a night shift” is still widespread, he said, adding that modern technologies and the ever-growing pressure on students made sleep deprivation a growing problem.
Ensuring adequate sleep should be the “secret weapon” of all students against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, and weight gain could be avoided as sleep deprivation puts the brain into hunger mode so that they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California who is studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, having taken one of his courses in his first year at Harvard last year.
He said the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to push for a university-wide course.
He hopes that in the next step, all postgraduate students will be asked to complete a similar study program before starting their studies at the competitive university.
According to Professor Czeisler's recommendation, students should set an alarm clock for bedtime and wake-up time, and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emanating from electronic screens and LED lighting that can get the circadian rhythm off the beat, which leads to problems falling asleep.
Livingston vs. Rangers 1:0: Menga goal defeats Gerrard's player
The Rangers lost another away game when Dolly Menga's hit meant a 0-1 defeat to Livingston for Steven Gerrard's disagreeing team.
The Ibrox team wanted to make their first away win since the 4-1 triumph at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team added Gerrard the first second defeat in 18 games as manager, leaving his team eight points behind the Ladbrokes Premiership-leading Hearts by far.
Menga hit seven minutes before the halftime, and the low-inspired Rangers seemed to have no chance of balancing.
While the Rangers now fall to the sixth place, Livingston rises to the third place and is only behind Hibernian at the goal difference.
The Rangers are also threatened with further trouble after line judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound by an apparently thrown object from the guest block.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, overtaking Ayr and reaching the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, stayed with the same eleven Livingston players who took the Hearts one point last week, and would be thrilled to see his well-trained team keep their opponents under pressure every step of the way.
The Rangers dominated possession of the ball, but Livingston achieved more when they had the ball.
They should have scored a goal in just two minutes when Menga's first hand led Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed his chance and missed it.
Then a long free kick from Keaghan Jacobs reached captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow could only shoot past the rear post.
The Rangers took control, but their game seemed hopeful rather than convinced in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos was obviously of the opinion that he should have received a penalty kick after a quarter-hour clash between him and Steven Lawless, but referee Steven Thomson did not approve of the Colombian's complaints.
The Rangers only scored two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little trouble with Lassana Coulibaly's header and a tame shot from Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingston's hit in the 34th minute may not have matched the game's course, there is no denying that they had earned him alone for their hard work.
Once again, the Rangers could not handle a ball shot by Jacobs for a long time in a standard situation.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher shot the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept quiet and chose Menga for an easy finish.
Gerrard traded at halftime, swapping Coulibaly against Ryan Kent. The change was almost immediate when the winger put Morelos in position, but the impressive Kelly rushed off his line to block the ball.
Livingston, however, continued to get the guests to play exactly the game they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett receiving one long ball after another.
Holt's team could have expanded their lead in the final stage, but McGregor stood up well and fended off Jacobs before Lithgow shot a headball from the corner.
Rangers exchange player Glenn Middleton also demanded a late penalty kick after a mix with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanach: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning"-Almanach: On September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter, which has since become the standard element of science, has also become a standard element of pop culture, for example in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" with the seemingly unusual cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What in the world is this?”
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter used to search for radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can hear the effects of radioactive radiation in the minerals."
Evans: “Actually, I hear a crack!”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the invention, which bears his name, lives on.
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach the Immune System to “See” Degenerate Cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” and destroy degenerate cells.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to detect degenerate cells as part of the treatment.
The method is used to remove immune cells from a patient, which are altered in the laboratory.
These cells can “see” a common protein of many cancers and are then injected again.
A test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different cancers.
The ovarian cancer of a woman who was treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to detect degenerate cells disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method takes immune cells from a patient, which are modified in the laboratory so that they can “see” the many cancers common protein HER2 and then inject the cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our findings suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “promotes the growth of various types of cancer,” including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer, as Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar method of taking immune cells from patients and teaching them to attack cancer cells has helped in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West released a pro-Trump tirade after his performance at SNL, wearing a MAGA cap ("Make America Great Again").
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was booed at the studio on Saturday Night Live after praising US President Donald Trump and saying he wanted to run for president in 2020.
After singing his third title of the evening, “Ghost Town,” while wearing a make-America great-again cap, he continued with a blasphemous cannonade against the Democrats, once again stressing his support for Trump.
“I’m so often asked by whites, ‘How can you like Trump? He’s racist.’
So if I were worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh’s statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee on the allegations of sexual harassment raised by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the recording of West's chimney was not broadcast, it was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is not clear whether Rock wanted to make fun of West with the release.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had had trouble behind the stage because of his head covering.
“They harassed me behind the scenes.
They said, ‘Don’t go out with your cap.’
You harassed me!
And then they say I’m in a submerged area,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the sunken area?" He said, "He's going to put on my supermancape, because that means you can't tell me what to do. You want it to go ahead with the world?
Try it with love.”
His remarks triggered buh calls from the audience at least twice, and SNL contributors seemed embarrassed, Variety reported. One person told the magazine: “It was deadly silent in the studio.”
West had been hired late as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West confused many with a talk entitled "I Love It," in which he was dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West received support from Candace Turner, the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, who tweeted: “To one of the bravest ghosts: THANK YOU FOR DISPLAYING THE MASS.”
However, talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply himself and that was absolutely wonderful.
“But I don’t want to reward someone who, in my opinion, adopts and adopts an ideology that is harmful to my community (by buying his music or his clothes or by supporting his ‘art’).
He's free.
The same applies to us,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and is now “The Being Formally Known as Kanye West.”
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rapper colleague Snoop Dogg was named Snoop Lion, and of course Prince, the late music legend, changed his name to a symbol and then to "The Artist Formerly Known As Prince".
Indictment for attempted murder in connection with stabbing injury in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was injured with a knife at a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, according to police.
The defendant is scheduled to appear before the Belfast Arbitration Court on Monday.
The allegations are being reviewed by the prosecutor.
"Game of Thrones" star Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as sword-swinging Jon Snow in HBO’s violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor has attacked the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such roles on screen would often make boys feel like they have to be strong to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Harington said he believes something went wrong, asking how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Harington, who recently married Rose Leslie, also a 31-year-old member of Game of Thrones, admitted that the solution to the problem was “very important.”
“Personally, I find the question very important right now, what went wrong with masculinity,” he said.
“What have we taught growing men about the problem we are now observing?”
Harington believes that television may be partly responsible for the increasing toxic masculinity due to its very masculine characters.
He continued: “What is innate, and what is learned?
What is being taught on TV and on the streets that makes boys feel like they have to embody that particular side of a man?
I think that’s really one of the big questions of our time: how do we change that?
“Something went wrong with the young men.”
He also admitted in the interview that after the end of the series next summer, he would not be participating in prequels or sequels to Game of Thrones.
As of November, Harington will be featured in a reissue of Sam Shepard's "True West," the story of a film producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing about "Game of Thrones" for him was that he met his wife Rose.
"I met my wife on this show, so this is how I have preserved my future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose Leslie starred in the numerous Emmy award-winning fantasy series Ygritte, the mistress of Harington's character Jon Snow.
The two married in June 2018 at Leslie’s family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced an increase of 14 percent in the number of people living with HIV or AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people in the country are affected.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
In contrast to the past, transmission occurred in the vast majority of new cases through sexual intercourse.
So far, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 year-on-year.
HIV transmission through sexual intercourse is an acute problem in China’s LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against members of the LGBT community is said to be widespread.
Based on the country’s conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sexual intercourse with men ultimately marry women.
Many of the disease transmissions are due to insufficient protection during sexual intercourse in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised, among other things, general access to HIV drugs to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that employees leaked data from GOP senators, criticizes “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
Maxine Waters, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, denied allegations on Saturday that a member of her staff had published the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the deputies' Wikipedia pages.
The Democrat from Los Angeles believed that the claims were being disseminated by “ultra-right” experts and websites.
"Lies, lies and even more heinous lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information is supposed to include the private addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday during a Senate committee hearing on Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh's allegations of sexual misconduct by an unknown person in the government district.
The release took place after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the posts was assigned to Waters’ office, and published the information of a member of Waters’ staff, The Hill reported.
“This unfounded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“The member of my staff – whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised by these fraudulent and false allegations – was in no way responsible for leaking this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie."
Waters’s statement quickly sparked criticism online, including that of Ari Fleischer, a former White House press spokesman.
"This denial is angry," Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests she doesn’t have the right temperament to be a congressman.
People who are accused of something they haven’t done shouldn’t be angry.
You must not be defiant.
You must not question the motives of the prosecutor.
You have to be calm and serene."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters’ reaction to Democrats’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of acting too angry during Thursday’s hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is running in the midterm elections to replace Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
“Great thing, if that’s true,” he tweeted.
Waters said in her statement that her office had informed the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies of these fraudulent claims.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed,” she continued, “and that they are held accountable for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all members of my staff.”
“Johnny English – You only live three times” – weak spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is now a tradition to look for references to Brexit in every British-colored new film. This also seems to apply to this revival of the action-comedy parody franchise "Johnny English", which began in 2003 with "Johnny English - The Spy who spoiled it" and resurrected in 2011 with "Johnny English - Now rather" stuttering.
Will an ironic self-parody on the topic of how obviously stupid we are become the new export opportunity for the nation?
In any case, the license of the glossy, grimacing and incompetent Johnny English has been renewed for the second time, signaling more than anything else that he is a general comic creation for cinema visitors in non-English-speaking countries.
Of course, he’s again the crazy secret agent who bizarrely thinks he’s cool and worldly, while in reality he’s made up of something like Clouseau, a pinch of Mr. Bean, and a clack of this guy who contributed a single note to the title melody of “The Hour of the Winner” at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympics in London.
In addition, the character was originally based on the chaos left behind travelers and international secret agents that Atkinson played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials.
The last adventure of Johnny English has one or two nice moments.
I liked how Johnny English approached a helicopter in a medieval armor and the rotor blades briefly tied to his helmet.
Atkinson's abilities for physical comic comedy come to light, but the humor seems rather weak and strangely superfluous, especially because even the "serious" film series such as "007" and "Mission Impossible" now confidently offer comedic elements.
The humor seems to be more directed at children than adults, and for me, Johnny English’s crazy misfortunes aren’t as imaginative and focused as Atkinson’s silent movie gag in the role of Bean.
The ever-present premise now is that Britain is in great danger.
A cyberhacker has infiltrated the super-secret British espionage network and revealed the identities of all British agents in action, much to the displeasure of the agent on duty, a unfortunately small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for the Prime Minister, an inflated and distressed figure already facing complete collapse due to her political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best with this quasi-Teresa May character, but the script doesn’t give her much to work with
Her intelligence advisers inform her that all active spies have been uncovered and that she has to take someone out of retirement.
This includes the toll-packed Johnny English himself, who now works as a teacher at a chic institution, but informally teaches working as an undercover agent. There are a few gags, because English offers a school of espionage reminiscent of "School of Rock".
English is taken back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunited with his former heavily tested buddy Bough, who is being played by Ben Miller again.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, an annoying woman of higher society in whose role Vicki Pepperdine is somewhat wasted.
So Batman and Robin, who always do everything horribly wrong in Her Majesty's secret service, are back in action, meeting Olga Kurylenko's beautiful Femme Fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously captivated by a charismatic tech billionaire, Jason Volta, who claims to be able to solve Britain’s computer problems.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of grotesque jokes: as waiters disguised, they set fire to a chic French restaurant, they create chaos as they smuggle themselves aboard Volta’s luxury yacht, and English triggers pure anarchy as he tries to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta’s house using a virtual reality headset.
In this last sequence, all the registers are drawn, but as sympathetic and funny as it is, the topic is already dealt with in detail on children's television.
Pretty moderate fabric.
As with the other Johnny English films, I had to ask myself, “Can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really lives up to his talent?”
Labour denies working on a plan according to which the British should work four days a week but be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is to consider a radical plan that provides that the British work four days a week but are paid for five days.
The party reportedly wants business leaders to pass on the savings achieved through the AI (artificial intelligence) revolution to employees in the form of an additional day off.
This would give the employees a three-day weekend, but would still receive the same pay.
According to sources, the idea "fits" the party's economic agenda and its plans to shift the balance in the country for the benefit of workers.
The transition to a four-day week was endorsed by the Trades Union Congress as an opportunity for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told the Sunday Times: “A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
“A change will not occur overnight, but a four-day working week is an endeavour consistent with the Party’s approach to restoring economic balance for the benefit of workers, as well as the Party’s general industrial policy strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first party to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised to introduce a 4-day week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the approach is currently not endorsed by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “A four-day week is not a party policy and is not being considered by the party.”
At the Labour Conference last week, shadow chancellor John McDonnell concretized his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain the power of “anonymous directors” and “profitmakers” in public utilities.
The shadow chancellor’s plans also mean that the current shareholders of the water utilities may not get their full share back, as a Labour government could make “deductions” due to alleged misconduct.
He also confirmed the corresponding plans to appoint employees to the boards of directors of companies and set up Inclusive Ownership Funds to hand over 10% of the equity of private companies to employees who collect annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy comment in 60 Minutes news magazine on whether the FBI investigation in Kavanaugh case could change their minds
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court judge by at least a week, raising the question of whether the agency’s findings could influence Republican senators to win their support.
In an interview on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could uncover something that could ultimately change their minds.
Kennedy seemed to be more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“I told you at the hearing that I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him afterwards, this claim was made, and asked if he did.
He was determined, determined and unmistakable."
Graham's voice, however, seems to be carved in stone.
"My opinion is firm as to Brett Kavanaugh, and there would have to be a bomb exploding," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett vehemently denied this," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all those whom she named could not confirm it."
It is now 36 years.
And I can't see any changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it helped reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York hosts the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music festival with an impressive lineup of stars and an equally impressive mission – to fight poverty in the world.
Tens of thousands will attend the Global Citizen Festival, which will take place this year for the 7th time, not only to witness the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event’s real goal: to combat extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which took place for the first time in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project. As part of this project, an international stakeholder group is trying to fight poverty by encouraging more and more people to actively participate in the fight against poverty.
To get a free ticket for the event (the other option would be to buy a VIP ticket), you will have to complete a number of tasks, such as volunteering, communicating with a world leader (by email or phone) or similar measures to raise awareness of the goal – the fight against poverty.
How successful is the project, considering that Global Citizen still has 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of offering a cool free concert a meaningful way to convince others that it’s time to act, or just another case of so-called clicktivism – if you think you can make a difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen said the project has recorded more than 19 million actions from its supporters since 2011 and achieved various goals.
These actions are said to have helped inspire world leaders to announce commitments and strategies worth more than $37 billion that will impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the Group cited 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, at least $10 billion of which have already been disbursed or raised through fundraising.
According to the group’s estimates, the funds secured so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition project, a partnership of UK-based investors and implementers committed to supporting children in their optimal development, and who promised to help Rwanda fight malnutrition in the country with $35 million after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history,” Tracey Ullman, ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, told the audience during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve the nutritional situation of mothers and children, the government announced funding for the The Power of Nutrition project, which aims to reach 5 million women and children and provide nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, namely, what are the reasons why Global Citizen can fight extreme poverty,
They said, “It will be a long and strenuous journey with highs and lows.
But similar to the major civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed because together we are stronger and more influential.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe and Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will host this year’s event in New York.
The US could use the Navy for blockade purposes to hinder Russian energy exports – Ministry of the Interior
According to Washington Examine, if needed, Washington can resort to the Navy to prevent energy from Russia from reaching markets including the Middle East, U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s deployment in Syria is a pretext for exploring new energy markets. Russia is currently operating in these areas at the invitation of the legitimate government.
“I think the real reason for Russia’s deployment in the Middle East is the negotiation of new energy markets, just like in Eastern Europe,” he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to address this.
"The United States, together with the Navy, can ensure that the sea routes remain open and block them if necessary, so as to ensure that the energy from Russia does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the Consumer Energy Alliance event, a non-profit group that sees itself as the “voice of electricity consumers” in the United States.
He drew a comparison between Washington’s approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are virtually identical.
“The use and replacement of fuels is more or less the economic option in Iran and Russia,” he said, referring to Russia as a “one trick pony” with a fossil fuel-dependent economy.
The statements were made when the Trump administration was on the verge of expanding liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, the far less costly option for consumers in Europe.
To this end, government officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin the “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the US$11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s massive resistance to the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we all believe that energy should not be used as a means of exerting pressure, and that consumers can choose suppliers themselves," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US has received headwinds from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industry organisation, the Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie (BDI), has urged the US to stay out of EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“It’s a big problem when a third country interferes in our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, chairman of the BDI, after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren wants to “examine closely” a 2020 presidential candidacy, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would “examine closely” one’s post-election presidential candidacy.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering a candidacy.
According to The Hill, Warren said it was time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that includes women at the top.
Warren plans to “examine” a presidential candidacy after November 6th.
Warren said during the meeting that President Trump is driving this country in the wrong direction.
"I'm extremely concerned about how Donald Trump deals with our democracy," she said.
Warren has not taken a leaf out of her mouth when criticizing Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court candidate.
In a tweet on Friday, she announced that, of course, an FBI investigation is required before the vote.
However, a poll published Thursday showed that the majority of Warren’s voters do not believe they should run for 2020.
According to the survey by the Suffolk University Political Research Center and Boston Globe, 58 percent of potential voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run.
32% of the voters supported such a candidacy.
The poll showed more support for a candidacy of former governor Deval Patrick; with 38 percent advocating a potential candidacy, and 48 percent opposed.
Other names of prominent Democrats eligible for a possible 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said he would officially decide by January.
Sarah Palin comments on Donald Trump rally on post-traumatic stress disorder that track Palin suffers from
Track Palin, 26, was in Iraq for a year.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
“What my son is going through, what he is going through when he comes back, all of this can be felt by other families who feel the impact of PTSD and some of the wounds our soldiers are returning with,” she told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin described his arrest as an “elephant in the room” and said about her son and other war veterans that they are coming back changed, that they are coming back more brutally, that they are coming back and wondering if there is that respect for what other soldiers and pilots and every other member of the military has given to the country.
He was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska on Monday and charged with domestic violence against a woman, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and D.C. support a legal remedy for the new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia support a remedy to the new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims of gang activities or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and the district filed a court expert statement in Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker questioning the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy in August has not been disclosed.
She said her partner "and his violent gang sons" abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The prosecutors who support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where many people apply for asylum in the US, as nations facing major problems with criminal gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy repealed a 2014 Board of Immigrant Appeals decision that allowed illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of legislation at the state, federal and international level.”
"The federal law stipulates that all asylum applications are judged based on the respective facts and circumstances of the application, and this court violates this principle," the court's expert statement said.
The lawyers further argued in the statement that the policy of denying immigrants access to the country has an unfavourable effect on the U.S. economy, as immigrants may be more likely to work as entrepreneurs and provide the necessary workforce.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered in June that immigration judges stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and the violence of criminal gangs.
“Asylum is available to anyone who leaves their home country because they are being persecuted or for fear of race, religion, nationality or affiliation to a particular social group or political belief,” Sessions said in his June 11 policy announcement.
It has never been the plan to defuse all the problems, even all the serious problems that people are struggling with every day around the world, by granting asylum.
Desperate rescue attempts in Palu as the death toll in the race doubles over time
For the survivors, the situation got worse.
“It’s all very tense,” says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, reassuring her little feverish son in a rescue center in the destroyed downtown of Palu.
“Every minute a new ambulance comes with dead.
Clean drinking water is scarce."
Residents returned to their ruined homes to collect their wet belongings, retrieving everything they could find.
Hundreds were injured, and the staff at the hospitals damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake were completely overloaded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who contracted vertebral fractures and a broken shoulder, remained outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were treated outside for the ongoing strong aftershocks.
With tears in his eyes, he told how the violent earthquake shook the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
“Everything went way too fast.
I think I was trapped under the collapsed walls," he reported to the Associated Press, adding that the reason for staying in the city was a wedding.
“I heard my wife’s calls for help, but then there was calm.
I don't know what happened to my wife and my child.
I can only hope that they are in a safe place."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of tyranny with “propaganda ads”
A week after an official Chinese newspaper posted a four-page ad in an American daily announcing the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused the state capital, Beijing, of exploiting the American press for propaganda purposes.
US Donald Trump referred to the paid supplement to the China Daily last Wednesday in the Des Moines Register, Iowa’s best-selling magazine, after accusing China of interfering in the U.S. congressional elections on November 6, an accusation China denies.
Trump’s accusations that Beijing has tried to interfere in the US elections are in line with the announcement by US officials to Reuters; a new phase of an escalating campaign triggered by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to advertise to promote the economy, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a rampant trade war, with tariffs on imports for both countries.
Chinese retaliatory tariffs at the beginning of the trade war should hit exporters in states like Iowa that supported Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, who exports large-scale agricultural products to China, said Beijing has damaged workers, farm owners and businesses.
China, according to Branstad in a statement in Des Moines Register on Sunday, is now doubling this tyranny by placing propaganda ads in its own free press in the United States.
“By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is claiming the American tradition of free speech and independent press by turning paid advertising on the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, at the newspaper kiosks here in Beijing, you will find only a limited number of votes against, and you will not find a real reflection of the differences of opinion that the Chinese might have about China’s disturbing economic development, given the fact that the media is firmly in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that one of China’s best-known newspapers did not accept the offer to publish his article, but did not mention the name of the newspaper.
Republicans crush voters ahead of midterm elections with the debacle around Kavanaugh, observers warn
With many of the most influential Republicans supporting and defending the Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, in the face of multiple sexual violence allegations, observers have warned of a counter-reaction during the upcoming midterm elections, which could come from women in particular.
The mood in this context was extremely tense, and most Republicans have already reported that they will continue with a vote.
“Such things can’t be reversed,” said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School, in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake’s last-minute push for an FBI investigation would be enough to appease angry voters.
"Women don't forget what was yesterday, they don't forget it tomorrow or in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, first advisor and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, according to the Washington, D.C. daily.
On Friday morning, protesters in the Senate corridor shouted “November is coming!” when Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee decided to hold on to Kavanaugh’s nomination despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s statement, Mic reported.
Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are an extremely important issue, Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political observer, told the news site.
“People say it’s already high, that’s true.
But it could be higher, especially among voters in the suburbs and among younger voters, people between 18 to 29 who, although they don't like the president, often don't vote."
Even before Ford’s public statement, detailing her accusations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court candidate, observers suggested that a counter-reaction could be the result if Republicans advance the confirmation.
"This situation is a confusing mess for the GOP," said earlier last week Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the body voting, the final vote, or Kavanaugh’s review; it’s also about the way Republicans handled it and how they treated it,” Guy Cecil, director at Priorities USA, a group that supports the election of Democrats, told the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to disagree on who to believe on the basis of the statements of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a slightly larger share on the side of the latter.
A new survey by YouGov showed that 41% of respondents were definitely or probably convinced of Ford’s statement, while 35% stated that they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh.
Furthermore, 38% said they believe Kavanaugh lied likely or definitively in his statement, while 30% said the same about Ford.
Following Flake’s pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford made an affidavit before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that she was attacked by drunken Kavanaugh at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate had uncovered his genitals to her when she was at a party while studying in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to counter Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is currently launching a startup with the aim of establishing a competition with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the open source platform Solid by Berners-Lee.
With Solid, users can choose where their data is stored and who gets access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee stated that the intention behind Inrupt was “world domination”.
“We need to take action now,” he said on the topic of startups.
“It’s a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid’s technology, allowing users to create their own personal online data store or POD.
It can include contact lists, task lists, a calendar, a music library, and other tools for the home and business.
Similar to Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify, all content is available in one browser and at the same time.
The special thing about the personal online data store is that the user can decide who can access which data.
The company refers to this concept as personal reinforcement and development through data.
According to the company’s CEO John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is that the company uses resources, processes, and skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, some developers hired to work on this project, a community of voluntary programmers, and a security platform acquired by IBM.
As of this week, technology developers worldwide will be able to build their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team will not talk to Facebook and Google about whether to make a major change that will completely reshape their entire business models overnight.
“We don’t ask for your permission.”
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt is tasked with providing commercial energy generation and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new solid-based web.
In 1994, Berners-Lee redesigned the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been instrumental in the debate on net neutrality.
Even with the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I am extremely confident about this new era of the web,” he added.
Priest Bernard Vann, carrier of the Victoria Cross in World War I, was honored
The only clergyman of the Church of England who was awarded the Victoria Cross as a fighter during World War I was honored 100 years later in his hometown.
Lieutenant Colonel and priest Bernard Vann won the award for his dedication to the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, he was killed four days later by a sniper and never learned that he had won the highest British war award.
His two grandchildren unveiled a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Sunday.
One of the grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that this act was full of symbolism, as the memorial stone was unveiled exactly 100 years after the heroic act for which his grandfather was awarded.
According to The London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin; through dense fog and under fierce firing of field guns and machine guns.
Later, he advanced to the fire line and led the line forward with the "greatest bravery" before proceeding alone with a field weapon and eliminating three of the military units.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was shot by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather’s deeds were something he could never do justice to, and at the same time something that makes one humble.
Together with his brother Dr. James Vann, he laid down a wreath after the parade under the direction of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann stated that he is very honored to be able to participate in the parade, adding that the bravery of a real hero becomes visible primarily through the support of many people.
MMA fans stayed awake all night to watch Bellator 206, instead there was Peppa Pig
Imagine you’ve been awake all night watching an exciting Bellator 206, and then you can’t watch the main event.
The bill of San Jose included 13 fights, including 6 on the main map, and was broadcast live throughout the UK all night on Channel 5.
At 6 o’clock, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for their fight, the audience in the United Kingdom was not badly surprised when suddenly Peppa Pig was seen.
Some remained untouched after staying awake until the early hours of the morning to specifically see the fight.
A fan on Twitter described the switch to the cartoon character as a kind of bad joke.
“Due to a government regulation, this content is classified as adult-free, so it had to be switched to a children’s show at 6 a.m.,” said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communication at Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa, the pig, exactly."
Bellator’s Chief Executive Officer, Scott Coker, said the company will edit the schedule to take into account UK viewers in the future.
“I think the problem could be solved even in the replay game,” he said.
“But it’s 6 a.m. on a Sunday with viewers in the UK and we won’t resolve the incident until Sunday our time, Monday local time there.
But we'll stick to it.
There was quite a lot of communication during the change, there was quite a mess and it wasn't always nice.
We tried to solve the problem and assumed that it was a technical failure.
What was not the case, it was a problem on the part of the government.
I promise, that won't happen again.
We're going to reduce the whole thing to 5 instead of 6 fights, as usual, and we've been trying to give fans the best possible experiences.
The whole situation is quite regrettable."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels ‘Lower’ on Sexuality
Tom Daley, who has participated in various Olympic Games as a water jumper, says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality, but that feeling motivated him to become so successful.
The 24-year-old said that he had only realized in secondary school that he was different from others.
In the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out on gay rights to encourage others.
He also said that since he became a father, the Olympics wins are no longer so important to him.
The actual moderator of the long-term show, Kirsty Young, pauses for several months due to illness.
In Laverne's first show, he said that he used to consider himself inferior to others, as the love for boys and girls was socially completely unacceptable.
He said: “Until today, the feeling of being inferior to others and different from others is the reason for my power and strength and ultimately for my success.”
He wanted to prove that he is a very special personality, not to disappoint anyone when his sexual orientation became known.
The two-time bronze medalist at the Olympics is now a prominent LGBT activist and used his appearance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to advance the decriminalization of homosexuality in more countries.
He said he spoke on this issue because, fortunately, he can live without restrictions and without discrimination and wants to encourage others.
The three-time world champion fell in love with the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, and the realization of falling in love with a man was an absolute surprise for him.
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but he shared that the age difference had never been an issue.
He thinks that if you had to go through so much as a child and adolescent – he took part in the Olympics for the first time at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later, it’s hard to find someone at the same age with similar experiences.
The couple has had a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley since June, and Daley believes that his entire view has changed since then.
Last year it was all about gold medals.
But for him there is now more important than Olympic gold medals.
His son Robbie is now his main prize.
He bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain tumor.
Daley said his father did not accept the impending death, and one of the last things he asked for was the tickets for London 2012, as he wanted to be at the forefront.
“I couldn’t tell him he wouldn’t be there anymore,” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it was only after that that that I finally realized that he was not invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley won the bronze medal at the 2012 Olympics.
“I only knew that it was always my dream to dive in front of home audiences at the Olympic Games – that was madness,” he said.
His first song selection – Proud of Heather Small – was also influenced by the song, which he heard in the run-up to the Olympics and still caused goosebumps.

Mickelson, who is not currently in shape, will be on the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record at his 47th Ryder Cup game on Sunday, but he has to work hard not to make it a debacle.
Mickelson, who will play for the 12th time at the event, was sent to the replacement bench by Captain Jim Furyk for the Fourballs and Foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being the center of the action as usual, the five-time major winner spent his day cheering others and working on his game, hoping to fix the problems that burden him.
Even at the height of his career, 48-year-old Mickelson was never the most direct golfer and therefore not an ideal occupation for the narrow Le Golf National golf course, where misguided balls are regularly punished.
And as if the pitch itself wasn’t daunting enough, Mickelson meets perfectionist British Open champion Francesco Molinari in the ninth game on Sunday, who teamed up with Tommy Fleetwood, a newcomer to these tournaments, to win all four games this week.
If the Americans lag four points behind in the 12 singles games a hot start, Mickelson’s game could prove to be absolutely decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in Mickelson and could not add much to that either.
"He was completely aware of his role today, hit me on the back and put his arm around me, saying he was ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He has a lot of self-confidence.
He is one of the world’s best known personalities and has done so much for these teams in the past and also this week.
I didn’t think he would be in two games.
I had imagined more, but that’s how it went and that’s what we expected.
He wants to be there like everyone else.”
Mickelson will reach Nick Faldo’s record for most of the Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
It could mean the end of a Ryder Cup career that never quite matched the peaks of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven halves, although Furyk said his presence alone enriched the team.
“He’s funny and sarcastic, original and likes to have some fun, and he’s a great person who’s popular with the whole team,” he said.
“I think the younger players were happy to get to know him a little bit this week and it was fun to watch them.
He’s a really interesting person who gives a lot of impulses.”
Captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn knows that with the lead it may soon be over
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a big lead leading to the last singles in the Ryder Cup can quickly become an unpleasant situation.
The Danish made his debut in Valderrama in 1997, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but came just over the finish line and took the lead with the smallest possible lead, earning a win of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2–131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“The thought remains that we had a big lead in Valderrama, we had a big lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but that just barely,” said Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn (pictured in the photo), after seeing the win 5-3 of the Class of 2018 both on Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The experience shows me and all team members that it is not over.
Tomorrow it starts right.
Put yourself in the stuff and do exactly the right thing.
The whole thing is only over when the points are on the scoreboard.
We have a goal. We want to win this trophy, and that's where our focus is.
I’ve always said it, I’m focused on the 12 players on our side, but we’re fully aware of what’s facing us on the other side: the best players in the world.”
Rejoicing at the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn continued: “I would never rush this.
Tomorrow will be a different caliber.
Tomorrow the individual achievements are in the foreground and that is a completely different thing.
It’s great to work with a partner when things are going well, but when you’re out there alone, you’re being tested to the limits of your abilities as a golfer.
You have to make it clear to the players: get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind you and he has to get the best out of himself, too.”
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent Jim Furyk will make sure that his players perform better individually than on the team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have won three out of four points.
Furyk himself was on both sides of those big turns on the last day of the tournament, and he was on the winning side in Brookline before he was on the losers side after Europe's "miracle of Medinah".
"I remember every damn word," he replied to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, motivated his players before the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you’d like to take off the quick start you saw in Brookline and Medinah.
When the momentum hits in one direction, it puts the middle games under a lot of pressure.
We put our team up accordingly and send our guys out as we feel, you know, we're trying to spell tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of catching up, he has to compete in the top game against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as other Europeans in the top half of the ranking.
"I chose the guys in this order because I think it covers everything," said Bjorn about his selection for the individual matches.
Germany's new warship delayed again
The newest frigate of the German Navy should have been put into service in 2014 to replace decade-old warships from the Cold War period. However, according to local media, it will not be delivered until next year at the earliest due to faulty systems and rapidly growing costs.
The commissioning of the "Rhineland-Palatinate", the lead ship of the brand new frigates of the "Baden-Württemberg" class, was now postponed to the first half of 2019 according to the time that relied on a military spokesman.
The ship should have been put into service as early as 2014, but the ambitious project was plagued by worrying problems after extradition.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg-class, which were ordered by the Navy in 2007, are to replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
They will include a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft missiles and sea missiles, as well as camouflage technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic reflection.
Another important feature is longer maintenance periods. It should be possible that the latest frigates do not have to return to their home ports for up to two years.
However, the ongoing delays may lead to the state-of-the-art warships, which are supposed to represent Germany as a naval power, being already outdated at the time of their commissioning, according to Die Zeit.
The frigate F125, which was chased by the accident, made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship off and returned it to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the Navy returned a ship to the shipyard after it was delivered.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media called a number of significant "software and hardware faults" that would have made the new ship unusable in a battle situation.
Software problems are particularly serious, as ships of the Baden-Württemberg-class are operated by a crew of only 120 sailors, only about half as many as on the older Bremen-class frigates.
It also became known that the ship is far too heavy, resulting in performance losses and preventing the Navy from being able to carry out upgrades in the future.
The 7000-tonne "Rhineland-Palatinate" was apparently twice as heavy as ships of a similar class used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project, including the crew's training costs, also became a problem.
Apparently, the cost rose to a stunning <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion, compared to the originally planned <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates are particularly significant given the recent warnings that Germany’s naval power is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, Defence Commissioner of the German Bundestag, confirmed that the navy was “out of service”.
Bartels said the problem grew with time, as old ships were taken out of service but no replacement ships were provided.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg-class could be taken from the navy.
National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
New research is being conducted at a property in the Scottish Highlands to show how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that the results will provide further insights into the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland, will track dwarf and mosquito bats as well as brown long-ear and water bats in Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices are placed at key locations on the property to record the activities of the bats throughout the season.
Employees of the NHS and volunteers will also conduct mobile examinations with portable detectors.
A sound analysis of all images by experts determines the frequency of bat calls and determines which species does what.
Subsequently, a map and a report of the habitat is created to create a detailed picture of their behavior at the landscape level.
Rob Dewar, conservation consultant for the NTS, hopes that the results will show which areas of the habitat are most important for bats and how these are used by each species.
These data will help determine the benefits of measures to manage the habitat, such as creating meadows, and show how to preserve forest areas for bats and other related species.
The bat populations in Scotland and the whole of the UK have declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects sleeping places and leads to the loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as can flycatchers and the chemical treatment of building materials or attacks by domestic cats.
Bats are not really blind.
However, due to their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echolocation to detect insects and obstacles in their trajectory.
Responsible for the maintenance of over 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across Scotland, NTS takes the bat theme very seriously.
He has 10 trained experts who regularly conduct investigations, sleepplace inspections and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization has even set up Scotland’s first and only bat reserve at Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland’s 10 bat species.
Estate administrator David Thompson explains that the property is the ideal habitat for them.
“Here in Threave we have a great area for bats,” he explains.
“We have the old buildings, many old trees and an excellent habitat.
But there’s a lot we don’t know about bats, so we’re doing this work here and on other things that will help us learn more about what bats need to feel comfortable.”
He stresses the importance of first excluding the presence of bats before maintenance work in the goods, as it is possible that the involuntary destruction of a single nesting site could kill up to 400 females and young animals and wipe out the entire population on site.
Bats are under protection and it is illegal to kill, harass or destroy them or their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish official of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the population to help.
She explains: “We still have a lot to learn about bats, and with many of our species, we don’t know about their populations.”
Ronaldo denies rape allegations while his lawyers try to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called rape allegations against him “fake news” and said people want to “be famous” by using his name.
His lawyers plan to sue the news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The forward of the national team of Portugal and Juventus Turin was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to buy her silence on the incident, according to Der Spiegel on Friday.
In an Instagram live video to his 142 million followers, 33-year-old Ronaldo called the reports “fake news” just hours after they were released.
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they reported today: fake news," the five-time winner of the Ballon d'Or told the camera.
“You want to stand out by using my name.
That's normal.
You want to be famous by my name, but that's part of the job.
I am a lucky man and everything is good," the player added smilingly.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue the Mirror on the grounds of the allegations, which they described as "unlawful coverage of privacy-related suspicions," according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player demanded compensation for "moral damages at a level that corresponds to the severity of the legal violation, which is believed to be one of the most serious personality rights violations in recent years."
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in 2009 in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's room, where he allegedly raped them anal, according to documents filed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her he was "99 percent a good guy" who succumbed to "one percent."
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had sex, but said it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had photos taken of her injuries in a hospital, but later entered into an out-of-court settlement because she was "fearful of retaliation" and worried about being "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old said she is now trying to cancel the agreement, as she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of switching from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged incident and switched to the Italian giant Juve this summer in a $100 million deal.
Brexit: The UK would ‘eternally regret’ the loss of car manufacturers
The United Kingdom would “eternally regret” losing its status as a world’s leading car manufacturer after Brexit, according to Economics Minister Greg Clark.
He said it was “worrying” that Toyota UK told the BBC that it would temporarily interrupt production at the Burnaston plant near Derby should Britain leave the EU.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer stated that the impact of delays at the border in a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota’s Auris and Avensis product lines, produced nearly 150,000 vehicles last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I am convinced that in the event of an uncontrolled Brexit, we will see production stops at our plant at the end of March,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s Managing Director in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also raised concerns about a hard EU exit without an agreement and its impact on cross-border trade.
For example, BMW says it will close its mini-factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns, according to the car manufacturers, are related to risks within the supply chain in a hard Brexit.
Toyota’s manufacturing facility operates on a “just-in-time” basis, which means that the parts are delivered every 37 minutes by suppliers from both the UK and the EU to make the cars to order.
Should the UK leave the EU on 29 March without an agreement, there could be interruptions at the borders, which the industry says could lead to delays and bottlenecks in the parts.
It is impossible for Toyota to maintain a stock that lasts longer than a day at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, explaining why production needs to be interrupted.
Theresa May’s Chequers plan on future relations with the EU is “precisely designed to avoid such checks at the border.”
“We need a deal, we want the best deal that, as I said, allows us not only to enjoy the current success, but also to seize that opportunity,” he said in a statement on BBC Radio 4.
“The findings not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers show that we need to be able to continue the highly successful supply chains so far.”
Toyota could not specify how long production would have to be interrupted, but warned in the long run that additional costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been employed in Burnaston for 24 years and is the highest official of the Unite union at the plant, explained that his members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, these jobs never come back once they are gone.
A government spokesman said: “We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump's scheduled meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to White House
Donald Trump’s important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “postponed for another week” as the dispute over Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein has been overseeing the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who is investigating election interference by Russia, links between Trump’s advisers and Russia, as well as a possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The question of whether Trump would fire the Deputy Secretary of Justice and thus endanger Mueller’s independence has been the subject of rumors in Washington for a month.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein addressed the possibility of secretly recording his talks with Trump, as well as impeaching the president using the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
However, he went to the White House last Monday as new reports of his alleged resignation became known.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at the time at the UN General Assembly in New York, was announced for next Thursday,
Trump said he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was then postponed to avoid it colliding with the hearing before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, in which both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate’s full vote.
Trump’s press spokeswoman Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “It may be this week, but I can also imagine that it will be postponed by another week, given all the things that are happening right now with the Supreme Court.
That will show, but I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some reporters would probably disagree with this claim: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
Moderator Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders stated that the low frequency of the press conferences did not indicate an aversion to the TV reporters' "effects" but admitted: "I would not deny that they are doing effect-hashing."
She then claimed that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
The president makes more question-and-answer rounds than any president before him," she said, without providing accurate evidence: "We looked at those numbers."
Sanders said there will still be press conferences, “when the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, but far better than talking to me.
We try to do this often, and you have seen that we have done this many times in the last few weeks, and that will take the place of the press conference if you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York, the president may have shown why this is the case when he gave a runaway and sometimes bizarre appearance in front of assembled reporters.
Health Minister writes to EU workers of the Scottish NHS over Brexit concerns
The Minister of Health addresses people from outside the EU who work in Scotland’s National Health Service (NHS) to express the country’s gratitude and wish that they remain in the country even after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, Member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish government has already agreed to cover the costs of applications for residence permits for EU citizens working in Scotland’s decentralised public service.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer, the UK-EU exit negotiations continued and decisions are expected this fall.
However, the UK government has also stepped up preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I am aware of the disturbing times this must be for all of you.
That is why I wanted to express once again how much I value the contribution of each and every employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and thus benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is fully your home and we would be very happy if you would stay here."
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after a head injury
The linebacker of the Tennessee State Tigers Christion Abercrombie was undergoing emergency surgery, according to Mike Organ of Tennessee State, after a head injury he suffered on Saturday in the 31-27 defeat against the Vanderbilt Commodores.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the mid-term break.
"He came to the sideline and just collapsed there," says Reed.
Trainers and medical staff provided Abercrombie with oxygen on the sideline before he was placed on a stretcher and transported for further examinations.
A spokesman for Tennessee State told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie left the surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "no details of the nature or extent of the injury are yet known" and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a so-called redshirt, plays in his first season at Tennessee State after switching from Illinois.
Before leaving on Saturday, he recorded a total of 5 tackles, increasing his total in the season to 18 tackles.
Foreign investors will have to pay higher stamp tax on property purchase in the UK
Investors from abroad will have to pay a higher stamp tax to buy property in the UK in the future. The additional revenue is expected to benefit the homeless according to the Conservative Party’s new plans
This move aims to curb the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign for young voters
The increase in the stamp fee will affect all who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury anticipates additional revenue of up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year to help homeless people
Theresa May will announce today that foreign investors will have to pay a higher stamp fee when buying properties in the UK, with the surplus revenue to benefit homeless people.
This move represents an attempt to curb Jeremy Corbyn’s success among young voters, promising to provide more affordable housing and target top earners.
The increase in the stamp tax will be levied on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom and the additional revenue will be used for the government campaign against homelessness.
The surcharge, which is charged in addition to the current stamp tax and including the increase introduced two years ago on second homes and leased residential properties, could be up to three percent.
The Treasury expects the move to increase revenues of up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built properties in London are bought by non-UK investors, which drives prices up and makes it harder for first-time buyers to get a foothold in the real estate business.
Many affluent areas of the country, especially in the capital, became “ghost cities” due to the high number of foreign buyers spending most of their time outside the UK.
The new strategy follows only a few weeks after Boris Johnson voted in favour of a reduction in the stamp tax to allow more young people to have their first home.
He accused construction companies of upholding real estate prices by buying up land without using it, and urged Theresa May to give up quotas on affordable housing to end Britain’s “home shame.”
Opposition leader Corbyn announced a striking series of housing reform proposals, ranging from leases to banning evictions for no good reason.
He also wants to give city councils more powers in the construction of new apartments.
“Last year I said that I would devote my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream of making life better from generation to generation.
And that means repairing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who live and work here and want to build a life.
However, it may not be right that it is as easy for individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as for companies based abroad, to buy real estate as it is for hard-working British citizens.
The dream of home has become too far for too many people and the unworthiness of homelessness continues to be a too big problem."
Jack Ross: 'My biggest goal is to manage Scotland'
Jack Ross, the head of Sunderland, says that his 'biggest goal' is to become the manager of the Scottish team at some point.
The 42-year-old Scotsman enjoys the challenge of breathing new life into the club from the north-east of England, which is currently in third place in League One and lacks three points to the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St. Mirren back to the first Scottish league last season.
“I wanted to play for my country.
I made it to the bench and that’s it,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportsound.
“But as a child, I’ve often seen Scotland play with my father in Hampden and that’s something that always draws me back.
However, this possibility would only come if I were successful in club management."
Ross’ predecessors in the role as managers of Sunderland include Dock Lawyer, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O’Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic said he was not afraid to follow in the footsteps of such established names at such a club after he had previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
My success will be measured by whether I can bring the club back to the Premier League.
Given the structure and possibilities in this club, he is undoubtedly part of the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not an easy task to get him there, but I would probably only see my time here as a success if I brought the club back there.”
Ross has a three-year management career, following a period as Deputy Chief Executive Officer at Dumbarton and a 15-month tenure as a coach at Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa recover from the relegation to the third league and helped St. Mirren from the edge of the relegation to win the championship the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable than ever in his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“That was probably a real crossroads,” he recalls when he took over Alloa’s responsibility.
“I really think management was the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds weird, as I didn’t work badly, could live well from it and experienced some very pleasant high phases.
But playing can be tough.
There are many things you have to go through every week.
I’m still going through this in terms of stress and pressure in my job, but management feels right.
I’ve always wanted to manage and now I’m doing it. I’ve never felt so comfortable in my skin in my whole life as an adult.”
You can listen to the entire interview on Sunday 30 September between 12:00 and 13:00 BST at Sportsound on Radio Scotland.
The perfect time for a glass of beer is Saturday at 5:30 p.m., according to a study
The summer heatwave has given a boost to the revenue of Britain’s crippling pubs, while restaurant chains were under greater pressure.
Pub and bar companies recorded revenue growth of 2.7 percent in July, but restaurants revenues fell by 4.8 percent, according to statistics.
Peter Martin of CGA, who compiled the figures, said: “Continuing sunshine and England’s longer-than-expected World Cup participation meant that July followed a pattern similar to the previous June, where pubs saw revenue increases of 2.8 percent, but restaurant hit it even harder.
The 1.8 percent decline recorded by the restaurant industry in June continued to increase in July.
Pubs and bars focused on beverages showed by far the best performance, with area-adjusted revenue growth rising higher than it did in restaurants.
Pubs focused on food also suffered in the sun, but not as drastic as the restaurant operators.
It looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In the administered pubs and bars, beverage sales increased 6.6 percent a month, while food sales declined by three percent.”
Paul Newman, of RSM’s leisure and hospitality analysts, said: “These results continue the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of important social or sporting events remain the biggest factors for sales in the out-of-home market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle with problems, but revenue losses of 4.8 percent compared to the previous year will be particularly painful in addition to the ongoing cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for operators of companies focusing on food, and it remains to be seen whether the temperate temperatures in August will provide the much-needed breathing pause."
Revenue growth for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the decline in brand rollouts.

One in Five Kids Has Secret Social Media Accounts That They Hide From Their Parents
One study shows that one in five children, some even 11 years old, have secret social media accounts that keep them secret from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 students in secondary schools has found an increase in so-called “fake Insta” sites
The news fuels fears that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of students said they had a “main account” to show it to their parents
One in five children, some just 11 years old, creates accounts on social media that they can keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 students in secondary schools showed a rapid increase in so-called “fake Insta” accounts, a reference to the photo-sharing website Instagram.
The news fuels fears that sexual content will be shared.
Twenty percent of students said they had a clean “main account” that they could show their parents, but they also had private accounts.
A mother who came across the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who asked others to “rape me.”
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds had two profiles, with half admitting to owning private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, chairman of the HMC, said: “It’s disturbing that so many teenagers are being tricked into creating online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle to be the ‘Voice of Athletes’ in the Scottish Sports Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected as a non-executive member of the council of Scottish Athletics at its annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland’s most frequently awarded athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described the election as a great opportunity for sports officials to benefit from their far-reaching international experience over the last decade.
"Eilidh is respected in the athletics community of Scotland, Great Britain and the world and we are confident that athletics in Scotland would benefit greatly from their election to the council," Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I look forward to acting as the voice of athletes and hope that I can make a real contribution and lead the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won the distance over 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, named a total of four Olympic gold medals his own and now often appears as a BBC expert, was unable to walk after a temporary circulatory disorder.
He wrote on Twitter: “I suffered a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk anymore.
Doctors say no one can tell if or how far I will recover.
It was hard work, but I fully recovered, learned to walk again and do exercises today!
Thank you for the encouraging news!"
An advertising for breast pumps that compares mothers to cows creates excitement on the net
A manufacturer of breast pumps caused excitement on the net with a promotional clip in which breastfeeding mothers are compared to milking cows.
To launch the "world's first low-noise portable breast pump", the manufacturer of consumer technology Elvie published a not very serious music video to emphasize the freedom that the pump gives breastfeeding mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a hay-filled barn with cows in the background to a song that contains lyrics like: “Yes, I milk myself, but you don’t see a dick in me” or “if you didn’t notice, these are not udders but my breasts.”
“Pump it out, pump it out, I feed the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies.”
However, the advertising posted on the company’s Facebook page has sparked controversy on the net.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video encountered mixed reactions among viewers, many of whom say it trivialized the dairy industry’s “terrors.”
“It was a very bad decision to promote this product with cows.
Like us, they must become pregnant and give birth to a calf to produce milk, with the difference that their young will be taken away from them within a few days of giving birth," it said in a comment.
Elvie's breast pump fits discreetly in a breast bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment was: “Comprehensibly traumatic for mother and baby.
But hey, why don't we use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?"
Another person added: “This is such a non-realistic advertisement.”
Others defended the advertisement and a woman admitted that she found the song "urkomisch".
“I think that’s a brilliant idea.
I would have bought one if I was still breastfeeding.
When I was pumping, I felt like a cow.
The clip is a little crazy, but I'm not trying to overinterpret it.
This is a great product,” one person wrote.
Another person commented: “This is a funny advertisement aimed at mothers who use breast pumps (often at work or in toilets) and feel like ‘cows’.
This is not advertising for or against the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the group of women reveals that they all danced with the discreet pumps in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the realization that many women who use breast pumps claim to feel like dairy cows.
However, Elvie’s pump is completely silent, has no wires or hoses, and discreetly fits into a breastfeeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies, or even go out during the pumping process.
Ana Balarin, Partner and ECD at Mother, said: “Elvie’s pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By comparing breastfeeding mothers with dairy cows, we wanted to focus on breast pumps and all the challenges associated with them, while presenting in a fun and comprehensible way the incredible feeling of freedom that the new pump enables.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, designer Marta Jakubowski had a double mom on the catwalk while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children were quietly taken to a tent town on the Texas border
The number of interned migrant children is more high than ever before, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively the same, among other things as intensified rhetoric and Trump administration measures have made it more difficult to accommodate children with caregivers.
Traditionally, most caregivers were themselves illegal immigrants and are now afraid to become the target of expulsion themselves when they report to accept a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential caregivers and other adult members of their household would have to give their fingerprints and share that data with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, declared before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who applied for the care of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the detainees had no previous criminal records.
“Almost 80 percent of people who are either caregivers themselves or a member of a caregiver’s household are illegally staying in the country and a large proportion of them are criminal foreigners.
That is why we will continue to persecute these people," Albence said.
In order to process the children’s cases more quickly, the officials introduced new rules that, according to accommodation staff, require some children to appear in court within one month instead of 60 days of detention, which was previously the standard.
Many will appear via video and not in person to stand up for their legal status before an immigration judge.
In the case of negative decisions, the person is quickly deported.
The longer these children remain in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious and depressed, which can lead to violent outbreaks or attempts to break out, according to accommodation staff, as well as reports known from the system in the last month.
Defenders say these concerns are intensified in a larger facility like Tornillo, as there are signs that a child is having problems that are easier to overlook due to size.
They also explained that it could amplify trauma that many of the children are already suffering from if they were taken to a tent town without emotional preparation or enough time to say goodbye to friends.
Syria Calls on American, French and Turkish ‘Occupying Forces’ to Withdraw Immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the civil war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, stated that the foreign armed forces are illegally on Syrian soil with the pretext of fighting terrorism and are “treated accordingly.”
"You must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been displaced from their homes.
He said Damascus “will continue to fight this sacred battle until all Syrian territories are cleansed” of both terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has stationed some 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mainly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs hired against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 ground troops in the war-torn country.
Regarding the refugees, Moualem explained that the conditions for their return are given and he accused “some Western countries” of “spreading irrational fears” that prevent refugees from returning home.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to make it possible to return home," he said.
“They are politicizing a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union warned that no aid will be granted to Syria as long as there is no political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats stated that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib provides an opportunity for the advancement of political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey targeted a broad-based offensive by Russia-backed Syrian forces against the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement has “clear deadlines” and expressed his hope that military action will be carried out against jihadists, including fighters of the al-Qaeda-allied Nusra Front, who “will be wiped out.”
UN Representative Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon be able to convene first meetings of a new committee consisting of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem cited the Syrian government's conditions for participation in the committee and stated that its work should be limited to "revising the articles of the current constitution" and warned of interference.
Why Trump Will Win His Reelection
With this logic, Trump would win his re-election in 2020, should not, as many liberal viewers presumably hope, a impeachment or scandal terminate his presidency prematurely.
This would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic final of a presidency of all time.”
So far, there is no indication that the audience is tired.
Since 2014, CNN’s best-time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million and almost tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News averages 2.4 million viewers at the best time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago. MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" led the ratings with up to 3.5 million viewers on evenings with important news.
“It’s like a fire that magically attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Bear, showrunner of the ABC drama series “Designated Survivor” about a cabinet member who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an old-time comedy writer and author of the book “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys’ Club,” has a different theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Trump.
She asked him why.
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh,’” Scovell told me.
The chaos is entertaining.
Of course, the stories from Washington, unlike anything on television, can determine the future of the Roe v. Wade abortion policy, the possible unification of families, and the health of the global economy.
Turning off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes beyond being an informed citizen when one becomes aware of having already watched six hours of an expert round about Bob Woodward’s use of sources from the so-called “deep background” for his book “Fear,” Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich bomber jacket (according to the Washington Post discussing a “clothes piece rich in self-esteem”), or the effects of Stormy’s description of Daniel.
I will never see Super Mario again with the same eyes.
“Some of what he’s doing makes it feel like a reality show that he puts in front of one every night,” says Brent Montgomery, Wheelhouse Entertainment’s chief executive and creator of the series The Three of the Pawnhouse, about Trump’s rotating cast and daily turns of action (breaking a fight with the NFL football league, praising Kim Jong-un).

When I reached Fleiss this week, it was sunny 27 degrees in front of his house on the north coast of the Hawaiian island of Kauai, but he hid inside and watched MSNBC while recording CNN at the same time.
He simply couldn’t get off the screen when Judge Candidate Brett Kavanaugh was on the verge of testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
"I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was kind of a joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Donations flood the closest races for seats in Congress in the midterm elections
It’s not surprising that Pennsylvania’s 17th electoral district is flooded with donations, thanks to the newly drawn boundaries of electoral districts that led to two incumbents running for the same seat.
The recently redesignated suburban district in Pittsburg has Democrat Conor Lamb running, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is competing against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which overlaps heavily with the new 17th district.
The maps were re-drawn after the state of Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts violated the Constitution and were manipulated in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district sparked a sweep of campaign funding between the parties' major financial arms, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a much-noted special election in March around the state's 18th electoral district.
This seat was held by a Republican for over a decade and Trump won by 20 percentage points.
Political experts give the Democrats a slight lead.
The U.S. reviewed El Salvador’s punishment for its support for China, but then turned back
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing without encountering major opposition from Washington.
Trump held a friendly meeting with Panama’s President Juan Carlos Valero in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until partners threw out the management team of the Trump Organization.
U.S. State Department officials have decided to withdraw the heads of all U.S. foreign missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to "recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the ministry's spokeswoman in a statement earlier this month.
However, only in the case of El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including for drug control, development, and economic assistance, were sanctions considered.
The proposed punitive measures, including cuts in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which was to follow a similar meeting last year, representing a step forward in efforts to stop migrants from moving towards the United States.
However, in mid-September, senior government officials made clear that they wanted the conference to take place, effectively ending the consideration of punitive measures for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to be a spokesman at the conference scheduled for mid-October to signal the importance that the government is giving to the Assembly, according to diplomats.
The three U.S. diplomatic representatives have quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without new harsh communications or sanctions from Washington.
A government spokesman for John Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to comment on the internal meetings on condition of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an external analyst close to the government, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Learning from history
The next big surprise could be the report by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller on Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, for which there is now sufficient evidence in the public eye.
Mueller is now purportedly also investigating whether Trump’s campaign team conspired with Russia in its attack on the American elections.
If the Congressional majority were to change, Trump would face an organ that would force him to account for it, precisely at the time when he would pass by to step back in front of the voters; and possibly before a jury.
That’s a lot of ‘if’ and I don’t want to say that the case of Donald Trump, or that of his European counterparts, is inevitable.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we have to make decisions that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a coup d'état against Hitler if only the West had resisted him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We have failed, and missed a way to avoid the years of barbarism that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and the unstoppable march of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are facing several such turning points.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who decides the future of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in the kitchen of the devil since this newspaper reported last year that he suggested secretly recording the president, speculating that he was unsuitable for office.
Rosenstein denies the New York Times.
“How will we respond if Brett Kavanaugh’s newly ordered FBI investigation is not complete or fair, or is confirmed despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and misrepresentation in office?
And most importantly, will we vote for a Congress that will force Trump to account for it in the midterm elections?
If we fail in these tests, we have a long winter ahead of us.
But I don’t think we will fail because of what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same regime that once occupied my embassy home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and sent me off 60 years later to light Sabbath candles on the table with the swastika.

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers optimistic before the game against Vienna
The Rangers welcome Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win against the Austrians after the impressive draw against Villareal in Spain earlier this month will put them in a good position for the qualifying of Group G of the Europa League.
Due to a knee injury, Graham Dorrans was unable to appear until the 2-2 tie against Villareal, but he believes the Rangers can use this result as a springboard for bigger ones.
“That was an important point for us, because Villareal is very good,” said the 31-year-old.
We went into the game with the conviction that we could make something out of it and we drove home with one point.
Maybe we could have won in the end, but overall a draw was probably a fair result.
They probably dominated in the first half, but we struggled in the second half and were the better team.
Thursday will be another big European evening.
Hopefully we will get three points, but this will be a tough game, as they scored a good result in the last game, but I am sure that we can continue with the audience behind us and achieve a positive result.
Last year was definitely difficult, with everything that happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there’s a kind of feel-good factor.
The team is good and the guys are really good; the training is good.
Hopefully we can now look forward, leave the last season behind and be successful.”
Fear of retirement pensions leads to sleepless nights in women.
Although the survey participants knew exactly how to care for them, few spoke to their family members about it.
Approximately half of the participants in the Nationwide study reported talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they were talking to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but don’t take the necessary steps to have the conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance business.
You should start with this.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to care for you if you don’t express your wishes in time.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how you want to be cared for, as these decisions can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Bring your financial advisor on board: Your advisor can also help you find a way to finance these expenses.
Your financial decisions for long-term care can include traditional nursing insurance, hybrid capital-forming life insurance to help cover those costs, or self-insurance with your own assets – as long as they own the money.
Work out your legal documents: Settle last-minute litigation.
Establish a preventive power of attorney so that you instruct a trusted person to monitor your medical care and ensure that the healthcare professionals meet your wishes should you be unable to express them yourself.
Also consider a power of attorney for your finances.
You choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid if you are unable to do so.
Don’t forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on their way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medication intake or allergies?
Write down these details in a written plan so that you are ready.
"Not only the financial issues play a role. Who are the doctors?" asked Martin.

Man in Ilfracombe fired several times with an air rifle
A man was shot several times with an air rifle when he went home after working among friends.
The victim, a man in his forties, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen, and hand.
Officials described the shootings that took place around 2:30 a.m. as an "arbitrary act."
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries were not life-threatening and police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a strong earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities said, and the number of deaths is expected to increase.
Due to the failed communication systems, aid workers were unable to obtain information from the Donggala government district, an area north of Palu that is closer to the 7.5 magnitude epicentre of the earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was just celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is an administrative district that stretches northwest of the island of Sulawesi over a stretch of coastline of over 300 km (180 miles) in length.
In the administrative district, an administrative unit below the province, an estimated 299,200 people lived in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main sources of revenue for the Central Sulawesi economy, especially the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it focuses mainly on Morovali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been victims of earthquakes and tsunamis several times over the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Civil Protection Agency.
In 1938, over 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
West Donggala was hit by a tsunami in 1996, in which nine people died.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific ring of fire, and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami on December 26, which hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people in the coastal areas of the Indian Ocean, almost half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes shook the west coast of Sumatra between the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people died on the Nias Islands off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of magnitude 6.8 shook the south of Java, Indonesia’s most populous island, triggering a tsunami that hit the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of magnitude 7.6 struck the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake of magnitude 7.5 shook one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 meters in height, destroying dozens of villages and killing about 300 people.
2016: A slight earthquake shook the Pidie Jaya administrative district in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people died from collapsed buildings.
2018: Severe earthquakes hit the Indonesian island of Lombok, popular with tourists, killing over 500 people, especially on the north side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded on the island.
Sarah Palin's Son Arrested for Domestic Violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of former Alaska governor and former candidate for vice president, has been arrested for allegations of assault.
29-year-old Palin, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstructing domestic violence reporting, and resisting state violence, according to a report published Saturday by Alaska Police.
According to the police report, he picked up the phone from an acquaintance when she wanted to notify the police.
Palin is in custody at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and has received a $500 bail, according to KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he replied, when asked about his plea, "Not guilty, certainly," according to the network.
Palin is accused of committing three Class A offences, which can be punished with up to one year in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B offence, which can be punished with a day in prison and a fine of 2,000 dollars.
This is not the first time that Palin has been charged with criminal charges.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently being tried in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, obstruction of reporting a crime and possession of weapons under the influence of narcotics in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of slapping her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran organizations in 2016 after she attributed her son’s behavior to a post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of his time in Iraq.
Tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake that shook the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-strong earthquake triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been interrupted and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred just off the coast of central Sulawesi, northeast of Indonesia’s capital Jakarta.
On social networks, videos circulate from the time the wave hit the country.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutor calls for rare death penalty for suspects in New York terrorist attack
The federal prosecutor’s office in New York is calling for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the defendant in the New York City terror attack that cost eight lives. This is a rare punishment that has not been imposed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
30-year-old Saipov is accused of using a rented pickup from Home Depot for a terrorist attack in October, during which he rushed onto a bicycle lane along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, driving over pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov “targeted” the eight ofers and “consciously” inflicted serious bodily harm, according to the declaration of intent for the death penalty claim filed in the southern district of New York.
Both charges could be punished with death, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a Saipov Federal Inquiry Court filed a 22-point indictment that includes eight charges of murder against the background of organized crime normally used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, as well as an indictment of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack requires “fundamental planning and intent,” the prosecutors described the manner in which Saipov carried out the act as “abominable, cruel and depraved.”
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov inflicted damage, pain and losses on the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the statement said.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
For more than a decade, the southern district of New York has not been prosecuting a case with the aim of demanding the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of the murder of two drug suppliers and finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in New York City for a federal offense was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple convicted two years earlier of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union.
Both Rosenbergs were executed with the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, witnessed a lack of remorse in the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators that he felt good about what he did, police said.
Saipov explained to the authorities that he was inspired to act after watching videos of ISIS on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also called for the flag of ISIS to be hanged in his hospital room.
He declared himself not guilty in all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said that they were "obviously disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty, instead of accepting a confession of guilt in exchange for a life imprisonment without the possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma that all involved suffer," Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked the prosecution not to demand the death penalty.
A Conservative Party MP calls for NIGEL FARAGE to transfer Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage swore to mobilize “the power of the people” today during a protest campaign at the Tories Conference.
Ukip’s former party leader stated that politicians “have to feel the pressure” of Euroskeptics, while an MP from Theresa May’s party suggested that Farage should lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative back-banner Peter Bone told protesters in Birmingham that the UK would be “already out” if Farage were Brexit minister.
The challenge May faces in reconciling her deeply divided party has been exacerbated by members of your party who are for staying in the EU taking part in a separate demonstration against Brexit that took place in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep her Chequers compromise plan on track despite attacks by Brexit supporters, Brexit opponents and the EU.
Allies insisted that, despite the counter-reactions, they should continue to try to negotiate a deal with Brussels and thus force Euroskeptics and the opposition Labour Party to choose between their package and the “chaos”.
Bone stated at the ‘Leave Means Leave’ demonstration in Solihull that ‘Chequers belongs to the garbage.’
He suggested that Farage should have been appointed a peer and should have been given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was responsible for it, we'd already be outside," he said.
Wellingborough MP added: “I will stand up for Brexit, but Chequers belongs to the garbage.”
He stressed his opposition to the EU: “We did not fight in world wars to be submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone rejected allegations that public opinion had changed since the 2016 referendum: “The idea that the British people have changed their minds and now want to stay in the EU is completely wrong.”
Conservative Brexit advocate Andrea Jenkyns was also at the demonstration, telling reporters: “I’m just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The compromise is unpopular in the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular in our own party and among our activists who are actually going through the streets and making sure we are elected.
Please give up Chequers and start listening.”
In a sharp message to May, she continued, “Prime Ministers keep their jobs if you keep their promises.”
Farage stated in a speech that politicians must “feel the pressure” should they be in the process of defrauding the decision of the 2016 referendum.
“This is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” Farage said.
“They’re trying to cheat on Brexit and that’s why we’re here today to tell them, ‘You can’t get away with that.’
In front of an enthusiastic crowd, he continued, “I want you to let our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, feel the pressure.
“We are mobilizing the power of the people of this country that helped us win the referendum and will never rest until we are an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.”
At the same time, Brexit opponents marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A few activists waved banners of the Tories Against Brexit group, a group of Brexit opponents within May’s party, which was launched on the weekend.
Lord Adonis, Labour Party peer, made fun of the Tories who had security issues with a party app at the opening of the conference.
“These are the people who tell us that they can make sure that the IT systems, as well as all the technology for Canada Plus Plus, are there for the smooth border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” said Adonis.
“This is a farce.
There is simply no good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to ‘examine’ presidential candidacy
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would “examine the presidential candidacy closely” after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke on Saturday at a meeting with voters in western Massachusetts about her future.
Warren, an outspoken critic of President Donald Trump, is currently in the race for re-election to the Senate against the Republican MP in Massachusetts parliament Geoff Diehl, who was vice-chairman of Trump’s campaign team in Massachusetts in 2016.
It was the center of speculation that it could challenge Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke has been since Trump took office its 36th meeting with voters in the so-called Town Hall format.
One of the people present asked her if she wanted to run for the presidency.
Warren replied that it was time for women to “go to Washington and fix our broken government and that includes women at the top.”
Arrest after shooting dead on LSU player Sims
Baton Rouge, Louisiana police announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested in the case of Friday's deadly shooting of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced at a press conference that it had arrested 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11 a.m. Eastern Time.
They had posted a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help in identifying the man seen on the footage.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot on Friday morning near Southern University campus.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot injury to the head and died as a result of this injury," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, according to the sports media portal 247sports.
Wayde wanted to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to having been at the scene and possession of a gun and to having shot at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without further incident and taken into custody in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The two-meter Sims grew up in Baton Rouge and played in 32 games with 10 start lineups last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches world championship after his team gave him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas landed ahead of Lewis Hamilton in qualifying on Saturday, it was clear that Mercedes stable orders would play a major role in the race.
Bottas made a good start from pole position and it was almost as if he was showing Hamilton when he defended his position in the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went into the pits first, pushing Hamilton into traffic at the end of the driver’s field, a decision that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went into the pits one lap later and landed behind Vettel, but Hamilton overtook him after a narrow wheel-on-wheel maneuver in which the Ferrari pilot reluctantly released the inside, with the risk of holding out after two movements to defend the third corner.
Max Verstappen started in one of the back seats of the field and finished seventh on his 21st birthday after the end of the first lap.
He was then the fastest for much of the race, as he held on to his tyres to finish quickly and overtake Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He finally went into the box in the 44th round and failed to gain a step in the remaining eight rounds, while Raikkonen finished fourth.
It was a tough day as Valtteri did an excellent job all weekend and acted like a real gentleman when he was supposed to let me pass.
The team has done an excellent job of achieving a double victory," said Hamilton.
A case of really bad body language
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Dianne Feinstein at a campaign event on Saturday, who insisted that she did not pass on Christine Blasey Ford’s letter accusing the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse to the press.
At the event in West Virginia, President Ford did not directly address his statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate was showing that people were “bad, malicious, and dishonest.”
"One thing that could happen and the wonderful thing that has happened in the Senate in the last few days is when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and malicious and dishonest," he said.
“If you look at the leaks and then say, ‘Oh, that wasn’t me.
It wasn't me."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, were you responsible for the leak?
Think about your answer... Published the document – “Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, no, no.
I didn't publish it."
Okay, just a moment, please.
Did we... No, we didn't publish it," he added, imitating the Senator's voice.
Feinstein received the letter with Ford's accusations against Kavanaugh in July and it was released in early September, however Feinstein denies that the leak came from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't publish your story," Feinstein told the committee.
"She asked me to keep the letter a secret, and I answered her request for secrecy."
Her denial didn’t seem to fit well with the president, who said on Saturday night at the campaign event: “I tell you one thing, that was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but that was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
In his continuous defense of the judge candidate accused of sexual assault by three women, Democrats claimed the accusations would be used for their own purposes.
“They are determined to take back power by all means.
You see the vileness, the wickedness, they don't care who they hurt when they get under the wheels to get power and control," the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made up for Friday's defeat in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by a 5-3 win in the back game in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants went early with two goals in the lead, after hits by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie compensated for the home team before Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard offset for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the win with two goals.
This was for the men of Adam Keefe, who unexpectedly beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night, the third defeat in the Elite League in the season.
This was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the Giant winning the three previous matches.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute after 3:35 minutes after a submission by Kendall McFaull. Four minutes later, David Rutherford provided the submission as Beauvillier extended the lead.
In this exciting opening phase, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game after 13:10 minutes, before Matt Marquardt helped Cownie reach his goal after 15:16 minutes.
Dwyer secured the Giants’ lead before the half-time break when he scored his second goal of the evening just before the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard again balanced with a power play hit in the 28th minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game late in the second half. Nielsen then secured his team's victory with a fifth goal after just under half the second half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play at home at Milton Keynes Stadium next Friday.
Air traffic controller died after making sure that hundreds of people escaped the earthquake in an airplane
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is celebrated as a hero after he found the death to safely launch an airplane with hundreds of people on board.
More than 800 people died and many are missing after the island of Sulawesi was shaken by a devastating earthquake that triggered a tsunami on Friday.
Strong aftershocks are still felt in the region and many people are trapped under rubble in the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save your lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the heavily fluctuating control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed to make sure that Flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was on the runway at the time, could safely take off.
He then jumped out of the tower when he thought he was going to collapse.
Agung later died in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesman for Indonesia’s aviation security service, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australia’s ABC News reported.
“We have provided a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter could arrive in Palu.
We are deeply concerned about this news," he added.
At the same time, the authorities fear that the number of deaths could rise to several thousand, and the country’s Civil Protection Agency stated that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The number is expected to increase as many bodies are still under the rubble, while others cannot be reached," said the spokesman for the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho authority.
Waves of up to 6 meters have devastated Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring relief and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute comes a new ambulance with dead.
Clean drinking water is scarce.
Supermarkets are being looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross hastens to help survivors, but we don’t know what they’ll find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday, declaring in a speech to the country’s military: “I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks associated with the evacuation.
Are you ready?" said CNN.
Indonesia has already been shaken by an earthquake in Lombok this year, in which over 550 people died.
Air Niugini now reports missing after plane crash in lagoon in Micronesia
The airline that carried out the flight, which crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, is now reporting a missing person after initially claiming that all 47 passengers and the crew had been safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that they cannot say anything about the whereabouts of a passenger until Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, but were in a stable condition.
The cause and the exact course of the accident remained unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both declared that the plane landed in the lagoon just before the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane was flying over the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane flew very flat.
"That's a very good thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes explained that he and others could wade through hip-deep water to the emergency exits on the sides of the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants panicked and shouted and he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that sailors working nearby to improve a pier rushed to help with an inflatable boat to bring people to the coast before the plane sank into about 30 meters (100 feet) deep water.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people were killed in crashes of airline registered in Papua New Guinea, but none of them affected Air Niugini.
Analyst reconstructs the course of the night a woman was burned alive
The indictment concluded its evidence on Saturday in the re-negotiation of a case in which a man is accused of banishing a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in the field of information evaluation.
He explained to the jury how he used cell phone calls to reconstruct the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on their death night.
Rowlett said she received location data from various cell phones that showed Tellis was dating Chambers on the night of her death, contradicting his previous statements, according to the Clarion Ledger newspaper.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers during the period he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford went to the witness stand on Saturday and testified that he had not been to the city that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis had said the truth when he stated that he was at Sanford's pickup that night, Sandford said he had lied "because my pickup was in Nashville."
Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for two weeks at the time of her death.
Cell phone records, however, indicated that they knew each other for a week.
Rowlett explained that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted their messages, calls, and contact information from his cell phone.
“He took them out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense is expected to begin its pleas on Sunday.
The judge assumes that the trial will subsequently go before the jury on that day.
The High Breed: What is Conscious Hip Hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol claim that hip hop has moved away from its roots of political message and social engagement.
They want to return to his roots and make socially conscious hip hop again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently experienced a renaissance in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?!
New York nanny sues couple for dismissal after "racist" text
A New York nanny sues a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misguided message from the mother complaining that she was "another black woman."
The couple denied being racist and compared the legal dispute to an "extortion".
Two-time mother Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed her dismay when she found out that the new daycare mother, Giselle Maurice, was black when she started her first working day in 2016.
“NEEEEEEEEEEEIN, ANOTHER BLACK,” Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent the message to Maurice twice.
After recognizing her fake pass, the “embarrassed” Plasco-Flaxman dismissed Maurice, claiming that the open-minded African-American daycare mother had done a bad job and expected her to be a Filipino instead, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for her working day and then sent home with an Uber.
Now, Maurice sues the couple for redundancy, claiming compensation for the $350 a day they spent over six months that the job she was originally scheduled for, but without a contract, and for which she would have lived with the couple.
"I want to show them, look, you don't do that," she told the newspaper on Friday, "I know that's discrimination."
The couple rejected the racism allegations, arguing that dismissing them was the reasonable step, as they feared Maurice, after insulting them, would no longer be able to trust them.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists," Joel Plasco told the Post.
But would you entrust your children to a person who was rude to them, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Plasco compared the lawsuit to an "extortion" and explained that his wife is expecting a baby in just two months and is "in a difficult situation."
“You want to defend such a person?
That’s not very nice,” the investment banker added.
As the legal dispute continues, the couple was quickly convicted in public and denounced on social media, where they were criticized for their behavior and logic.
Paddington publishers feared readers would not identify with a talking bear, a new letter reveals
Karen Jankel, daughter of author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: “It’s hard to get into someone who reads it for the first time before it was published.
Today, it’s very funny with our knowledge of Paddington’s huge success.”
She said that her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired by a little toy bear to write the children's book, had had no problem with it, his work had been rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of the release was "bitter sweet" after his death last year.
She explained that her father was secretly proud of Paddington's success, whom she described as a "very important family member."
"He was a very quiet man and didn't brag," Jankel said.
“Because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child doing something special: you’re proud, even if it wasn’t really your own performance.
I think he's seen Paddington's success that way.
Although he invented and created him, he always gave Paddington himself to be responsible for his success."
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone
After landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say that it looks really bad and that doctors gave her little chance," said Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I received the call from Nad telling me that she would die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And that's what I did.
I said to her, "Tashi, I love you so much, my darling."
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that the doctors gave her to keep her heart pumping slowly vanished and left her body.
She had died shortly before and this was the moment when everything went down.
I could do nothing but wait while I knew what was going on.
I couldn’t cry or howl because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and other people.
I really had to pull myself together.”
Eventually, Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with the other passengers, who did not know what she was going through.
“No one knew,” she said.
I had lowered my head and tears were running over my cheeks all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but it was during the flight when I felt this overwhelming sense of sympathy for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Grieving women hang cards to prevent suicides on bridges
Two women who have lost loved ones due to suicide are trying to stop others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelley Humphreys hung on a bridge in Wales cards with inspiring messages and phone numbers for counseling centers.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and was just 18 when he committed suicide.
“I don’t want parents to feel the way I feel every day,” she said.
45-year-old Davis, who lives in Lydney, explained that her son was about to have a promising career as a chef and he had a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
Everyone said that his smile could brighten a room."
However, he quit his job before his death, as he was "in a really dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's body was found by his then 11-year-old brother after the suicide.
Davis said: “I always fear that this could have a consequence.”
Davis designed the cards “to show people that there are people you can go to and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Don't be quiet: you have to talk about it."
Humphreys, who has been friends with Davies for years, lost her partner Mark, with whom she was dating for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
“He didn’t say he felt down or depressed,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas Day, he was at his lowest point, and when the kids unpacked their gifts, he didn't look them in the eye or anything."
She said his death was a big trauma for her, but that had to go through: “There’s a huge hole ripping into the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we all have to keep going and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's Future Suspended While FBI Begins Investigation
"I thought that if we could actually get something like what he asked for, a time and scope limited investigation, then maybe we could get a little bit of harmony," Flake said on Saturday, fearing that the committee would "break up" in the party political standstill.
Why didn’t Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want FBI investigations?
Your reluctance can only be traced back to the timing.
The November 6 midterm elections are only five weeks away, and if the Republicans perform poorly as expected, they would be significantly weakened in their attempts to elect their husband to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush grabbed the phone to call senators and convince them to support Kavanaugh, who had worked for Bush at the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI presents its report?
There is a Senate vote that currently seats 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can win at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to decide on equal votes, and confirm him for the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean surrogates ‘sinks’ under Kim
The number of North Korean surrogates to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean politician.
Park Byeong-seug, who relies on data from the South Korean Reunification Ministry, stated that 1,127 overruns were registered last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park cited tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher prices of human smugglers as main factors.
Pyongyang did not speak out publicly.
After all, the vast majority of the translators from the North are offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul reports that over 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee via China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the heavily protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Korean states.
China considers the deserters to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often carries them back by force.
Relations between the North and the South, which are technically still in a state of war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the two heads of state met in Pyongyang for talks about the discontinued denuclearization negotiations.
This came as a result of the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, where they generally agreed to work towards a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress.
"Without being able to rely on the United States, we have no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to disarm ourselves unilaterally first," said Mir Ri in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and says he’s not fit for Supreme Court office
The minority leader in the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi called judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and said he was characterlessly unfit for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t resist the impression that a woman who acted like that would have been described as ‘hysterical,’” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied all accusations of sexually abusing Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and about to burst into tears as he talked about his family and his high school time.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling the accusations against him a “grotesque and coordinated reputation killing” organized by liberals who were angry about Hillary Clinton’s losing presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said she believes that Kavanaugh’s statement proves he can’t serve in the Supreme Court as it shows he’s biased toward Democrats.
“I believe that with these statements and the way he was pulling over the Clintons and the Democrats, he himself declared himself unfit,” she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to remove Kavanaugh from office should he be confirmed and the Democrats win the majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’ll say so much: if he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he’s not only unsuitable for the Supreme Court, he’s unsuitable for his current judgeship,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Federal Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi further said that as a Democrat, she is concerned about Kavanaugh’s possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade abortion principle ruling, as he is rated as a conservative judge.
In his hearings, Kavanaugh evaded questions about whether he would revise certain Supreme Court decisions.
"Now we don't need a hysterical, biased person who goes to this court and expects us to say, 'Oh, that's not wonderful,'" Pelosi said.
Women need to use it as a weapon.
It’s a sincere hate speech, months and years of overcooking rage and she can’t get it out without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's rare, and you?"
She continued: “I was helped a lot by a woman who was a manager somewhere and said that she also cries when she gets angry but has developed a technique. When she gets angry and starts crying, she tells the person she spoke to: “You might think that she’s sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just keeps talking.
I thought it was awesome.”
Tears are allowed as a valve for anger, in part because they are completely misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories is of a former job, in a male-dominated office, where one day I cried because of an indescribable rage and was caught by an elderly woman, an undercooled manager I was always a little afraid of, packed by the collar and pulled into a staircase.
“Never let her see you cry,” she told me.
"They don't know you're stinky.
They believe that you are sad and will be satisfied with themselves because they believe you have gone to the substance."
Patricia Schroeder, then a congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Hart was caught aboard a ship called Monkey Business in an extramarital affair and subsequently withdrew his candidacy, deeply frustrated Schroeder thought that there was no reason not to consider the idea of the presidential candidacy herself.
“That wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she told me 30 years later with a laugh.
There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the situation ‘Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs’.
As the election campaign had already progressed, she was lagging behind in raising funds, and she swore not to run if she did not get $2 million together.
It was a hopeless fight.
She found that some of her supporters, who donated $1,000 to men, only supported her campaign with $250.
“Do they think I’ll get a discount?” she asked.
In the speech in which she announced not to launch an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by her emotions, gratitude for her supporters, frustration about the system that made fundraising and direct addressing of voters so difficult instead of delegates, as well as anger over sexism, so close to tears.
"You could have assumed that I was having a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalls the press reactions.
“You could have believed that the handkerchief manufacturer Kleenex was my sponsor.
I still remember wondering what they would write on my tombstone.
“She was crying?”
Why Beijing Could Benefit From US-China Trade War
The opening salves of the trade war between the US and China were deafening. Although the battle is far from over, Beijing could benefit from a long-term trench between the countries, my experts say.
US President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year when he imposed punitive tariffs on important Chinese export goods, including solar cells, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week with new $200 billion in penalty duties on goods, effectively affecting half of all goods imported from China to the US.
Each time, Beijing struck back in the same way and recently imposed penalty duties of five to ten percent on US goods worth $60 billion.
China vowed to reply to any U.S. action and it is unlikely that the world’s second largest economic power will soon stumble.
It would be too shameful for China’s President Xi Jinping to give in to Washington’s indulgence, but it would be too shameful for China’s President Xi Jinping to give in to the public’s indulgence in the US.
Nevertheless, experts believe that if Beijing plays its cards well, China could benefit from the effects of the trade war in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for economic turmoil in both countries is actually much more dangerous than many observers have previously recognized," said Abigail Grace, a research associate at the Center for New American Security in Asia.
Syria is “ready” for the return of refugees, the foreign minister said.
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help for the reconstruction of the country devastated by the seven-year war.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country is improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safe thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government is rebuilding the territories destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normality.
All conditions are now in place for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that over 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government welcomes assistance in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he stressed that it would not accept conditional aid from countries that had supported the uprising.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europa won the 2018 Ryder Cup and defeated Team USA with a 16.5 to 10.5 finish at Le Golf National near Paris.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown after the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points it needed to defeat the US.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had problems over much of the tournament, sank his tee on the 16th lane (Par 3) in the water and lost to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari was able to shine in all his rounds and became one of 4 players who scored a 5-0-0 since the tournament began in its current format in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5:4 by the player with the lowest ranking in Team Europe, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The player with the world's best ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 to 1 against the Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
Spaniard Sergio Garcia, veteran of eight Ryder Cups, became the best European Ryder Cup player of all time with 25.5 career points.
“Normally I don’t cry, but today I couldn’t hold back.
It was a difficult year.
I am so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I am so infinitely happy to win the cup back.
It's about the team and I'm happy to have made a contribution," said the emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He passes the torch on to his compatriot John Rahm, who won against American golf legend Tiger Woods on Sunday 2-1 in the individual matches.
"I'm so incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods, whom I've been watching on TV since I was a child," Rahm said.
Woods lost all of his four matches in France and now has a Ryder Cup score of 13-21-3.
A strange statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles and is only surpassed by Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA has been struggling to find the fairways all weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have performed well throughout the tournament.
American captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance by his team: “I’m proud of the guys, they fought.
There was a time this morning when we had put pressure on Europe.
We didn't make anything out of it.
Hat off to Thomas.
He is a great captain.
All of his 12 players made a good performance.
We’re going to regroup, I’m going to talk to the PGA America and our Ryder Cup committee, and we’re going to look forward.
I love these 12 guys and I am proud to be their captain.
You have to take off your hat.
We were defeated.”
