Members of the National Assembly of Wales concerned that they will be “compared to Muppets”
There is a stir among the Members of the National Assembly of Wales by a proposal that their title would be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal is a result of plans to change the current name ‘Welsh Assembly’ to ‘Welsh Parliament’.
Members of the National Assembly of various political parties are concerned that the new name seems ridiculous.
A member of the Labour Party’s National Assembly of Wales said that MWP ‘rhymes with Twp and Pwp’.
For readers outside Wales: twp is Welsh for crazy and pwp is Welsh for poop.
A member of the National Assembly of Wales of the Plaid Party said the group as a whole is “unsatisfied” and has proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his party was “open” to the name change, but noted that the words MWP and Muppet are very similar.
In this context, the Welsh letter W is pronounced as a short u.
The Committee of the National Assembly of Wales, which is currently drafting legislation to implement the name change, said: “Obviously it is the members of the National Assembly of Wales themselves who are taking the final decision on their new title.”
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave members of the National Assembly of Wales the right to change the name of the Assembly.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which showed that most people felt that the National Assembly should be renamed Parliament.
As regards the title of the members of the National Assembly, the Commission proposed ‘Welsh Parliament Members’ or WMPs, but the MWP option received the most support in the public consultation.
At the moment, the members of the National Assembly would propose alternatives, but President Elin Jones will have a hard time reaching a consensus and she will have to submit a bill on the changes in a few weeks.
The legislation on the reforms also includes other changes to the way the National Assembly works, including rules on the suspension of members of the National Assembly and the structure of the system of committees.
Members of the National Assembly will be able to vote definitively on their new title when they debate the legislation.
Residents of Macedonia vote in a referendum on changing the name of their country
On Sunday, voters voted to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia."
The popular referendum was organized in an attempt to resolve a protracted dispute with neighboring Greece, which itself has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbor means that the country would claim on its territory and has repeatedly objected to applications from Macedonia to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who is opposed to the referendum on the name change, has said that he will not take into account the outcome of the referendum.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to be paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The bells of Saint Martin's silence, those of Harlem have it difficult
"The older people I spoke to said that there used to be a cafe and a church on every corner here," Adams said.
Today there is neither a cafe nor a church.”
He said it's understandable that cafes have disappeared.
“People now have social contact in a different way,” he said.
‘Cafés are no longer the living room of the neighborhood, where people regularly visit.’
However, he is concerned that the proceeds from the sale of the assets of the churches will last less than the leaders expect, “and sooner or later they will be back at the beginning.”
Churches, he adds, could be replaced by apartment buildings with flats where the kind of people would live that won’t help in the neighborhood’s remaining sanctuaries.
“The vast majority of people who will buy flats in such buildings will be white,” he says, “which will lead to these churches being closed even faster, because it is unlikely that the people who move to these flats will become members of the church community.”
Both churches were once built by a white parish, before Harlem became a black metropolis: the metropolitan community in 1870, Saint Martin's 10 years later.
The original congregation of white methodists left in the 1930s.
A black church in the neighbourhood took over the building.
Saint Martin's was taken over by a black parish led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the shopkeepers at 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, where blacks rarely could get a job or be promoted.
In 1939, the building was severely damaged by fire, but when the parishioners of Reverend Johnson made plans to rebuild the church, they also bought a carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Reverend Johnson and his successor at Saint Martin's, proudly called the carillon "the bells of the poor."
The expert who played the carillon in July referred to the instrument in a different way: ‘a cultural treasure’ and ‘an irreplaceable historical instrument’.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first carillon in the world ever played by a black musician, namely Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger carillon of the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said Saint Martin's hadn't replaced him.
The events of the last months in Saint Martin's are a complicated story of architects and contractors, some hired by the lay leaders of the church, others by the diocese.
The consistory (the governing body of the parish, consisting of lay leaders) wrote to the diocese in July to express its concern that the diocese would want to "transfer the costs" to the consistory, although the consistory had not been involved in hiring the architects and contractors that the diocese had sent.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old who dives into lobster in California
Saturday, on the first day of the lobster season, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy who was diving into lobster in California. The boy suffered injuries, it says.
The attack took place just before 7 o'clock in the morning near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday when he heard the boy screaming for help. Together with some others, he paddled to the boy to pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought the boy was crying because he had caught a lobster, but then he realized “that the boy was crying: ‘I’ve been bitten!
I've been bitten!"
His clavicle was completely open," Hammel saw as he approached the boy.
“I screamed that everyone had to get out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’”
The boy was taken by helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is reportedly in danger of death.
It is not known which species of shark is responsible for the attack.
Strandwacht Captain Larry Giles said in a press conference that a shark had been spotted nearby a few weeks earlier, but that it was then concluded that it was not a dangerous species of shark.
Giles added that the victim was seriously injured in the upper body.
The authorities closed access to the beach of Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and safety.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks living in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's wants to break through in the UK beauty market
Sainsbury’s competes with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, setting up beauty departments where specialized assistants work, such as in wholesale stores.
The initiative is part of a strategy to conquer the UK beauty market, which is worth <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion and continues to grow, while sales of fashion and household items continue to decline. The larger beauty departments are being tested at 11 stores across the country. If they prove to be a success, they will be introduced to even more stores next year.
The investment in the beauty market is also a consequence of the fact that supermarkets want to fill the shelves where TVs, microwaves and interior items once stood with other products.
Sainsbury's aims to double its beauty offering and offer 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have more space, with showrooms per brand, such as in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is also re-launching its Boutique makeup, as most products are vegan-friendly, something younger shoppers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, perfumery the Fragrance Shop will test out concessions in two of Sainsbury’s stores, the former opened in Croydon, south London, and the second in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
As more and more people shop online and increasingly buy small amounts of food in local supermarkets on a daily basis, supermarkets need to put more effort into convincing people to shop at them.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, says the stores will increasingly look like wholesale stores, as the supermarket chain is competing against discounters Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food.
Sainsbury's has integrated Argos points of sale in hundreds of stores and has also opened a number of Habitats since both chains were acquired two years ago. According to the company, food sales have increased and the acquisitions have yielded more returns.
The last time the supermarket tried to give its Beauty and Pharmacy departments a makeover, that was a flop.
Sainsbury's tested a collaboration with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration ended when a conflict arose over distributing the pharmacy department's revenue into supermarkets.
This is a new strategy since Sainsbury's sold its 281 pharmacy departments in stores three years ago for an amount of <0xC2><0xA3>125 million to Celesio, owner of the chain Lloyds Pharmacy.
Lloyds would also play a role in the plan, adding an extensive range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury’s, said: “We have completely changed the design of our beauty department to make it more enjoyable for our customers.
We have also invested in the specialized training of our employees, who will be ready to give advice.
With our range of brands, we offer something for everyone, and thanks to the attractive environment and convenient locations, we ensure that our customers like to buy their beauty products from us, and no longer shop in the old way.
Peter Jones 'furious' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Peter Jones, one of the stars of Dragons Den, is 'angry' because TV presenter Holly Willoughby has withdrawn from an 11 million pound deal with his lifestyle company. She wants to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for Truly, their brand for homewear and accessories.
Jones and Willoughby’s company is sometimes compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand.
The 37-year-old host of This Morning announced on Instagram that she is leaving.
Peter Jones of Dragons Den is furious about Holly Willoughby, as she retired at the last minute from their profitable lifestyle business to focus on her contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was “furious” when Willoughby announced Tuesday during a difficult meeting at the company’s headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts (valued at <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million) would not leave her enough time for Truly, their homewear and accessories brand.
The company is sometimes compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and is expected to double Willoughby’s fortune by an estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones left for one of his vacation rentals abroad.
A source said: “Truly was one of Holly’s top priorities.
It would ensure its long-term future, and yield enough for the next decades.
Everyone was stunned when she decided to withdraw.
No one could believe his ears last Tuesday, because the launch was scheduled for soon.
The headquarters warehouse in Marlow is full of products that are ready for sale.”
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter, one of Britain’s most profitable stars, could cost the company millions, due to the large investments in products from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear, and because the launch could now face further delays.
And that could mean the end of a long-standing friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, who have three children, have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started Truly in 2016 along with Capp, and Jones, 52, became President of the company in March.
The two couples often go on vacation together and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin’s television production company.
Willoughby will soon be M&S's brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as the presenter of the I'm A Celebrity show on ITV.
A source from Jones’s entourage said last night, “We have no comment on his business affairs.”
Hard language “and then it was love between us”
He joked about the criticism he would receive in the media for a remark he made that some people would find “inappropriate for a president,” and for his positive view of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump imitated a news anchor when he said:
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He added that Kim is interested in a second meeting. Trump described their first meeting in June in Singapore as a major step towards the dismantling of nuclear weapons in North Korea.
But the negotiations on the removal of nuclear weapons have stalled.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told leaders of the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea sees no "corresponding response" by the United States after North Korea's first disarmament initiatives.
The United States, meanwhile, continues with its sanctions to keep the pressure on the boiler, he says.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech during the election rally.
“We are doing very well in North Korea,” he said.
“We were close to a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a fantastic relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have led to positive results: the missile tests have ended, hostages have been liberated, and the remains of U.S. military personnel have returned to their home country.
He also defended his unusual approach to his relationship with Kim.
“It’s as easy to behave like a president, but instead of 10,000 people trying to access this busy arena, about 200 people would be standing here,” Trump said, pointing to the audience in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastate an island, killing hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok’s population had no housing, no national disaster was declared, which is a prerequisite for launching international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, it is clear that they are not requesting international aid, which is difficult for us," Mrs Sumbung said.
Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, but it is not certain that the relief workers from abroad will be able to work on the spot.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Relief Agency, said Indonesian officials were still evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international organizations would get permission to help.
Although Indonesia is constantly plagued by earthquakes, the country is still particularly poorly prepared for the wrath of nature.
In Aceh, shelters were built to shelter from tsunamis, but you rarely see them along other shores.
The fact that there was no tsunami warning siren in Palu, even though a warning was in effect, probably contributed to the number of deaths.
Even in ideal conditions it can be difficult to travel from one Indonesian island to another.
National disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that was moored in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days for the ship to reach the site of the disaster.
The improvement of Indonesia’s ruthless infrastructure was one of the key points of President Joko Widodo’s election campaign, and he has already spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But President Joko’s government is facing a shortage of funding, and he hopes to be re-elected next year.
President Joko is also under pressure from ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority today follow a rather conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to leave their homes because Christian and Islamic gangs are fighting on the streets, with machetes, bow and arrow and other primitive weapons.
Look at: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool makes an impressive tie against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League last Saturday, with a goal in the 89th minute, during a match at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when he was at a distance of about 30 meters from Chelsea's goal, at the time his team was 1-0 behind.
He tapped the ball to the left and then kicked in the direction of the farthest pole.
The ball flew high above the penalty area, towards the top right corner of the net.
He avoided the jump from Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"It was very difficult to reach that position, to reach the ball, and players like Shaq always play forward as much as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
‘I saw Kante approaching and dared to try. I didn’t really think about it, I just kicked the ball.’
Chelsea were 1-0 ahead of the rest, after a goal by Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues forward kicked the ball with his heel to Mateo Kovacic, after which he rushed through the midfield to Liverpool's playing half.
Kovacic did a quick one-two in the midfield.
Then he gave a nice pass, allowing Hazard to reach the penalty area.
Hazard was faster than the defense and kicked the ball with his left foot past Liverpool's Alisson Becker in the net, next to the back pole.
Liverpool will play in the Champions League group stage against Napoli at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy, on Wednesday at 3 p.m.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. in London on Thursday.
Tsunami death toll in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the national disaster relief agency said on Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped in the rubble of buildings that had collapsed as a result of last Friday’s 7.5-stroke earthquake, which also created waves 6 meters high, spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said during a news conference.
The city of Palu, where more than 380,000 people live, is full of rubble from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after woman was stabbed to death
This morning, a woman's body was found in Birkenhead in Merseyside, after which a murder investigation was opened.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. at Grayson Mews on John Street, the body showed stab wounds, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police ask the locals to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Police Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation has just begun, but I would like to ask anyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and who has seen or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, to contact us if they may have filmed something via a dashcam, because they can have information that is essential for our research.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a local resident of Birkenhead and that she was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman came to the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and police have confirmed that they are currently informing the victim's family.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has tried to enter his apartment but was told by police that no one is allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what happened.
The residents are now told that it will take hours before they can return home.
A police officer would have told someone that the area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared crying on the spot.
She keeps repeating, “What a shame!”
At 2 p.m., two police cars were inside the depot and a third was just outside.
Within the settlement, a number of police officers were monitoring the apartment building.
If you have any information, please send a message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, stating log 247 of September 30.
Cromwell's statue to the British Parliament is the latest victim of the 'rewriting history' riot
The banishment of the statue would be a poetic justice for the Taliban-like destruction of the many cultural and religious artifacts carried out by its fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestion as "foolish" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable that the current debate on the removal of statues would lead to the targeting of Oliver Cromwell’s figure just outside the Houses of Parliament.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the last century.
The magnificent statue of Cromwell, created by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, bears witness to the opinion that prevailed in the 19th century and is part of the historiography of a figure that many believe must still be recognized today.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.
Whether that is a completely correct presentation is still being debated.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure representing one side of that gap.
His achievements as Lord Protector must also be acknowledged and commemorated."
A pig kills a Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwest China, according to reports in local media.
The man, whose surname is only known as “Yuan”, was found dead at a stall in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, his artery was pierced and he was covered in blood, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to vaccinate pigs at a pig stable, on May 30, 2005, in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly travelled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his nephew found him dead and a door to a neighboring pig shed appeared to be open.
According to the cousin, a large male pig with blood on his mouth was in the pig cage.
A forensic investigation revealed that the 250 kg pig had killed the farmer, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and mutilated,” said the cousin with the surname “Wu,” according to the Guiyang Evening News newspaper.
On footage from surveillance cameras it can be seen that Yuan arrived on the market Thursday at 4.40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not from Yuan or his cousin.
A market official told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking others, while police gathered evidence on the spot.
Yuan’s family and market authorities are currently negotiating compensation for his death.
It rarely happens, but there have been cases of pigs attacking humans before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing the man to be seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig pushed a farmer from Wales against his tractor until his wife threw the animal away.
When a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba testified to CBC News that pigs are normally not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can provoke aggression.
“They are just playful.
They're like kids, very curious... they're not out to hurt people.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect," he said.
The tail of Hurricane Rosa brings heavy rain to the southwest of the US
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it reaches the cooler waters of Mexico’s north coast.
However, Rosa will bring heavy rains to the north and southwest of Mexico in the coming days.
With a wind speed of 135 km/h, Rosa was a Category 1 hurricane at 5 a.m. local time on Sunday morning and was located 620 km from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough begins to form above the Pacific Ocean, moving east towards the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, tropical humidity is pushed northward, to the southwest of the US.
Rosa will bring 10 centimeters of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Subsequently, tropical moisture that reacts with the approaching trough will cause widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest in the coming days.
Locally, 2 to 10 cm of rain will cause dangerous flooding, rubble flows and potential landslides in the desert.
Tropical moisture will cause rainfall of 5 to 8 cm per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
5 to 10 cm of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially above most of Arizona.
There are sudden floods possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions, as the tropical rain can fall very scattered.
It is strongly discouraged to enter the desert on foot when tropical rainfall threatens.
The heavy rainfall can turn ravines into wild rivers, and thunderstorms will produce local wind gusts and dust.
The approaching trough brings some heavy rain locally to parts of the southern California coastline.
Rain of 1.5 cm is possible, which could lead to small rubble streams and smooth roads.
This would be the region’s first rainfall during the rainy season.
Spread tropical rains will approach Arizona from Sunday evening to Monday morning, after which the rain will spread more at the end of the day on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will spread across the Four Corners on Tuesday and will continue to fall until Wednesday.
In October, the temperature in the US can fluctuate sharply, as the North Pole gets cooler, but the tropics stay quite warm.
This sometimes leads to large differences in temperature over short distances.
There is a good example of impressive temperature differences in the middle of the US on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, is nearly 20 degrees.
In the coming days, the persistent summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
In much of the center and east of the US, October is expected to start warm, with temperatures everywhere fluctuating around 30°C, from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
In New York, it can be 27 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees warmer than the average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows that the probability of above-average temperatures in the eastern United States is high until mid-October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people watched the poignant testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, a U.S. Supreme Court candidate, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of an assault allegedly taking place in the 1980s, on one of the six television networks on Thursday.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continued as broadcasters interrupted regular programming for Friday’s surprise: an agreement arranged by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to investigate the indictment for a week.
Ford told the Senate Justice Commission that she is 100 percent sure that a drunk Kavanaugh touched her and tried to take off her clothes during a high school party.
Kavanaugh stated in an animated testimony that he was 100 percent sure this had not happened.
Probably more than the 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen watched on Friday.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were not immediately numbers available for the other networks broadcasting the hearing, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people looking in an office.
For comparison: that’s roughly like a playoff of a football game or for the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, which supports Kavanaugh’s appointment, had the most viewers during the day of the hearing: an average of 5.69 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
ABC followed with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million viewers, MSNBC had 2.89 million viewers and CNN had 2.52 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
Even after the hearing, the public remained very interested.
Flake was the central figure of Friday’s events.
After the moderate Republican’s office issued a statement that he would support Kavanaugh with his vote, CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning recorded protesters screaming at him as he tried to take the elevator to a Justice Commission hearing.
He stood with his eyes down for a few minutes while he was being insulted, live on CNN.
“I’m standing right here in front of you,” said one woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the people the truth?
Someone said, “You have power, while so many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and just before the elevator closed, he added that he would say more during the hearing.
The various channels broadcast everything live when the judicial committee had to vote hours later on Kavanaugh’s appointment to the Senate.
But Flake said he would only vote for it on the understanding that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the nominee by next week, something that minority Democrats are insisting on.
Flake was convinced, among other things, by his friend Chris Coons, Senator and Democrat.
Flake made his decision after a conversation with Coons and several senators.
Flake’s choice was important because it was clear that Republicans would not have the necessary votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'a political game' around Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May accused politicians who criticized her plans to leave the European Union of “a political game” with Britain’s future and undermining national interests.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview, on the same front page of the paper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson stressed his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying her proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other’s levies was “absurd”.
Wayde Sims shooting: police arrest Dyteon Simpson as suspect in the death of LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect for the shooting in which Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU, was shot dead.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and is in prison on suspicion of manslaughter, Baton Rouge police said.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the crime scene and found Simpson's DNA on the glasses, reports WAFB, a CBS television station.
The police questioned Simpson and later stated that he had confessed that he had shot Wayde with the result of death.
His bail is set at $350,000, the lawyer reports.
The coroner of the community in East Baton Rouge published a preliminary report Friday stating that the cause of death is a gunshot wound in the neck.
The report states that the Louisiana State Police’s Fugitive Task Force, the state police crime lab, Southern University police, and local residents all contributed to the investigation that led to an arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the local police for his “devotion and pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
He was 198 cm tall and grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He scored an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was “capped” and “in shock” by Waydes’ death.
“This is an event that you always hope will never happen,” says Wade.
Volcano spits ashes on Mexico City
The ashes spouted by the Popocatepetl volcano have reached the southern districts of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans last Saturday to stay away from the volcano, after activity in the crater had been picked up and 183 emissions of gas and ash had been recorded in a 24-hour period.
The center detected noise and vibration several times.
On social media, photos of a thin layer of ash appeared on car windows in neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicians have observed an increase in activity in the volcano, which is located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, for the first time since September 2017, when a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico on the Richter scale.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the vote for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence activists clashed with riot police, while thousands participated in rival demonstrations on the occasion of the first anniversary of the vote on independence in Catalonia that split the region into two groups.
A group of masked pro-separatists stopped by riot police blasted the agents with eggs and powder paint, creating dark dust clouds in the streets usually filled with tourists.
Later in the day, skirmishes broke out with the police, and the officers pulled up their bat to stop the fighting.
For more than an hour, pro-independence groups sang: ‘Don’t forget, don’t forgive’, while their opponents shouted ‘Long live Spain’.
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries they sustained during the protests, the local press reported.
Tensions continue to rise in the independence-minded region, one year after the October 1 referendum, which is considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The voters overwhelmingly expressed themselves to become independent, although the turnout was low and the people who oppose separation boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the vote in the voting booths in the region, resulting in violent skirmishes.
Pro-independence groups had camped on site the night of Friday to Saturday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but they were forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife, said he was no longer hopeful about Catalonia’s prospects of independence.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy because they could vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Although the Catalan pro-independence parties achieved an essential victory in the regional elections in December, even if it was close, it was difficult for them this year to build on their success, after all, many of their most famous leaders are absent, either in self-imposed exile or in captivity pending a lawsuit over their role in organizing the referendum and proclaiming the on.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed the protest in support of the police on his phone, said the conflict had been fueled by politicians on both sides.
“The tensions are getting higher and higher,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in custody since the end of last year, announced that he would be taking part in the European Parliament elections next year.
"A candidacy for the European elections is the best way to denounce the deterioration of the democratic values and repression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men Arrested After House Was Rammed with a Car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after a car was repeatedly rammed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred Thursday at around 7.30 p.m. local time in Ballynagard Crescent.
Police Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building itself had been damaged.
A crossbow may also have been fired at the car at some point.
Livingston wins 1-0 against Rangers thanks to goal from Menga
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston gave them the victory
The promoted Livingston surprised the Rangers and secured Steven Gerrard his second defeat in a series of 18 matches since he became manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal made the difference and Gary Holt's team came on par with Hibernian.
Gerrard's team failed to win a away match during the Premiership this season. They have to face leader Hearts on Sunday, who is eight points ahead of them.
But first, the Rangers Rapid Vienna will receive Thursday in the Europa League.
The team has already won six games in a row in his department, and coach Holt has not suffered a single defeat since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses opportunities against strong visitors
The team of Holt could have achieved a lead long before the first goal, because their direct way of playing caused all kinds of problems with the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but failed to finish with a goal. Then Alan Lithgow, who picked up Craig Halkett's header, kicked the ball over the goal.
The home team allowed the Rangers to play with great pleasure, and waited for his chances quietly and confidently.
And that ultimately led to the crucial goal.
The Rangers allowed a free kick and Livingston provided an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to create a chance for Menga, who scored from the penalty area.
At that time, the Rangers had had ball possessions for a long time, but the home team's defenses were relentless and goaltender Liam Kelly hadn't had much to do yet.
That pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos made sure Kelly avoided a goal.
Scott Pittman kicked the ball at the feet of Rangers goaltender Allan McGregor and Lithgow missed the goal after a move from his Livingston colleagues.
They continued to reach the Livingston penalty area, but were denied each time. Two penalty shots were denied, one after Halkett's attack on substitute Glenn Middleton and one for handball.
'Phenomenal' by Livingston - Analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal achievement and result for Livingston.
They played excellently without exception and continue to exceed expectations in their race to the top.
Their playing style and the composition of their team has barely changed since their return to the highest regions, but especially Holt deserves a lot of recognition for the way he has whipped up the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was fantastic, with an excellently organized defense, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall walked on the tips of their toes throughout the game.
The Rangers, however, did not break through.
Although they have often played very well under Gerrard, this time they did not reach their usual level.
Their final stage wasn’t good enough (they only managed to squeeze the home team once) and the Rangers will now realize they need to play better because they are somewhere in the middle of the classification.
Erdogan is welcomed with mixed feelings in Cologne
Under a bright blue sky and with a wide smile, the leaders of Turkey and Germany went to breakfast together in Berlin on Saturday (September 29).
It was the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
They disagree on issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan left for Cologne to open a giant new mosque.
Cologne is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police appealed for security reasons when they prevented the crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many sympathizers approached to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters, many of them Kurds, also voiced their voices, condemning both Erdogan’s policy and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The rival protests reflect the division over a visitor who is praised by some German Turks as a hero and accused by others as an autocrat.
Traffic accident in Deptford: cyclist dies after collision with car
In London, a cyclist was killed in a collision involving a car.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city, at about 10:15 a.m. local time.
The driver of the car stopped and the ambulance personnel were present, but the man died on the spot.
A few months ago, another cyclist died in a flight crime accident on Childers Street, about a mile and a half from Saturday’s accident.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and will notify his closest family.
The road is closed in several places, buses are diverted and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Guards Injured in Disturbance
Six guards have been injured in a disturbance in a heavily-secured men's prison, according to the prison office.
The riots broke out on Sunday at around 9.30 a.m. local time in HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and are still ongoing.
Specialized “Tornado” ciphers have been deployed to solve a situation involving eight prisoners in one department.
The guards were treated there for minor injuries to the face.
A prison spokesman said: “Specially trained prison personnel have been deployed for a current incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and those responsible will at least be referred to the police and may have to stay behind bars for longer.”
HMP Long Lartin houses more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the director of the prison had been treated in the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, riot police were summoned to jail for a serious disorder in which personnel were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (with potentially positive effects on drought areas)
It rarely happens that a tropical depression reaches Arizona, but that's exactly what's likely to happen early next week because the remaining energy from Hurricane Rosa is moving across the southwest of the desert area, which poses flood risks.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings for sudden floods for Monday and Tuesday for the west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, and southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to hang just above Phoenix on Tuesday, and it will rain on Monday night.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or depression in the 200-mile area of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation, with isolated amounts of up to 15 centimeters in Arizona’s Mogollon Rim.
Other parts of the southwest of the desert area, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, will likely receive 3 to 5 cm of rain, and here and there 10 cm is possible.
For those areas that are not at risk of flooding, the rain of Rosa can be a blessing, as the region is hit by drought.
Although flooding is very worrying, some of this rainfall is likely to be beneficial, as the southwest is currently going through a drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, the map that identifies current drought areas, just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second-highest category," weather.com reported.
Hurricane Rosa reaches the mainland via the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa is still at hurricane strength on Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 140 km per hour, located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moving north at a speed of 20 km per hour.
The storm hits cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean, weakening it.
Therefore, it is expected to arrive in Mexico on Monday in the afternoon or evening with the force of a tropical storm.
Heavy rain may fall in parts of Mexico, which entails a significant flood risk.
“Precipitation of a total of 8 to 15 cm is expected from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with up to 25 cm possible,” said weather.com.
Rosa moves north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the border with Arizona on Tuesday in the early morning hours as a tropical depression, which will then leave for Arizona and southern Utah on Tuesday night.
“The biggest danger expected from Rosa or her tail is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest of Sonora, and southwest of the desert area,” the National Hurricane Center said.
This rain is expected to lead to life-threatening sudden floods and debris streams in the deserts and landslides on mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrests on suspicion of attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace neighborhood in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at about 4 a.m. local time.
He was taken to the hospital and his condition is “stable”.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested at night in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset police said.
The police ask anyone who may have filmed something of what happened to report.
Trump Says Kavanaugh 'Has Suffered Under The Cruelty, The Anger' Of The Democratic Party
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party’s ruthless and outrageous tactics,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh throughout his appointment process has continually “suffered under the meanness, anger” of the Democratic Party
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford's allegation that he had sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on her allegation.
The president said on Saturday that the "American people" saw "the brilliant and incredible character, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
“A vote to recognize Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that recognizes one of the most accomplished legal opinions of our time, a lawyer with an excellent track record,” he told the crowd in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's appointment when he spoke about the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
“In five weeks, one of the most important elections in our lives will take place.
I don’t participate, but I actually participate,” he said.
“That’s why I stand up for great candidates everywhere.”
Trump said the Democrats are on a mission to “resist and obstruct us.”
The first major procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh’s appointment is expected to take place by Friday, a senior GOP leadership official told CNN.
Hundreds killed by Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, and the toll is rising
At least 384 people were killed in a major earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, with many being wiped out of the ground when giant waves crashed on the beach, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered on Friday for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu, as waves of up to six meters high hit land at the time it began to dusk. Many people collapsed and the waves destroyed everything on their way.
The tsunami was the result of an earthquake with a force of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
“When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, there were still people on the beach who didn’t immediately walk away and were the victims of the tsunami,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian BNPB Natural Disaster Relief Agency during a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami also led to other dangers: it dragged cars, logs, houses, he hit everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had traveled over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coastline.
Some people climbed into a tree to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the Agency for Natural Disaster Relief show that many buildings and shops have been destroyed, bridges distorted and collapsed, and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city was shaken by aftershock.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (the BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday’s massive earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima in World War II.
It is possible that the geography of the city, which lies at the end of a long, narrow bay, has enlarged the tsunami even further, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "significant" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, malls and hotels had collapsed.
Some of the dead were trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, and some 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the number of casualties and damage could be even greater along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicentre of the earthquake.
Communication with Donggala “is completely flat, we have no information at all,” Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross said in a statement. The Red Cross staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse," the Red Cross said.
The organization received a lot of criticism on Saturday for not saying a tsunami had hit Palu, although staff said the waves had reached the country within the time the warning was given.
In amateur footage shared on social media, you can hear a man on the top floor of a building screaming in panic at people downstairs to warn them that a tsunami is on the way.
Minutes later, a wall of water collapses on the coast and buildings and cars are dragged along.
Reuters was unable to verify the images immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power failure that cut off communications around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military is currently sending cargo planes with relief supplies from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the evacuated still urgently need food and other basic needs.
The city’s airport has been reopened only for relief and remains closed to the public until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
Death toll from tsunami rises above 800.
It's very bad.
While World Vision employees from Donggala arrived safely in the city of Palu, where workers in the courtyard of their office are looking for shelter in tarpaulin tents, they passed scenes of devastation along the way, Doseba said.
“They told me that they saw many houses that had been destroyed,” he said.
It's very bad.
Even when relief groups began the difficult task of launching emergency aid, some complained that certain foreign relief workers with great expertise could not travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, financing, goods and personnel from abroad can only be admitted if the location of a disaster is declared as a national natural disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“Once the government says, ‘OK, this is a national disaster,’ we can provide international assistance, but that status has still not been declared.”
When the second night after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami fell on Palu, friends and family of the missing continued to hope that they would find their loved ones alive, as in the miracles that people so fondly hear of terrible natural disasters like this.
A boy was taken out of a sewer on Saturday.
On Sunday, relief workers rescued a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which had taken place in Indonesia earlier this month.
His students were also trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi.
“As a veteran in the paragliding world, I carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon said that the news that the Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed had spread to the paragliding community and that in the hours afterwards he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the athletes in Palu, who were participating in the beach festival.
However, only one grey checkmark appeared in his messages instead of two blue checkmarks.
“I think that means the messages have not been delivered,” he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 while supplying ATM in Newport on the Levee
Friday morning thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was filling an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport police press release.
The driver had just emptied an ATM in the entertainment complex and wanted to fill it with money, Inspector Dennis McCarthy wrote in the message.
While he was busy, another man ran from behind Brink’s employee and stole a bag of money that was ready to deliver.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing, according to the press release, but police did not say how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information on the identity of the perpetrators is requested to contact Newport police on the number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper Changes His Name to Ye
Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
Last Saturday, he announced the change on Twitter with the words: “The creature formally known as Kanye West”.
The 41-year-old West has been called Ye for a while and used this nickname as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The name change was announced in the run-up to his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album Yandhi.
He replaced singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled her performance during the show for “emotional reasons,” the show’s creator said.
Ye is not just an abbreviation of his current artist name, West said earlier that the word has a religious meaning for him.
I think “ye” is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means “you,” West said earlier this year, when he told radio presenter Big Boy about the title of his album.
“So I’m you, I’m us, it’s us.
I have switched from Kanye, which means “the only one,” to simply Ye, a reflection of the good in us, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is a reflection of who we are.”
He's not the only famous rapper to change his name.
Sean Combs was formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who used to work with West, has already worked with and without the hyphen and the capital letters.
Mexican President Promises No Use of Armed Forces Against Civilians
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the elected president of Mexico, has promised never to use military power against civilians. The country is on the eve of the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador pledged on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would “never use military force to oppress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, military forces fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing up to 300 people. During this period, leftist student movements emerged throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to help young Mexicans by giving monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities.
He said that young people often join criminal gangs due to unemployment and a lack of opportunities to study.
U.S. needs to double A.I. funding
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States must double the amount they spend on AI research, says investor and AI specialist Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for all Google, Microsoft and Apple.
He says this in response to announcements about A.I. that come from various departments of the U.S. government, despite the fact that the U.S. does not have a formal strategy for A.I.
Meanwhile, China announced its plan last year: by 2030, the country wants to be the number 1 in the field of AI innovations.
“Duplicating the budget for research on A.I. would already be a good start, given that all other countries are so far behind the US, and we’re looking for the next A.I. breakthrough,” Lee said.
A doubling of funding could lead to a doubling of the likelihood of the next major achievement for AI taking place in the US, Lee said this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of China’s leading AI companies.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that defeated American Othello's best player, and later was manager at Microsoft Research and president of Google's Chinese division.
Lee expressed his appreciation for technology contests organized by the U.S. government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next contest would take place, as it would help discover the next visionaries.
In the US, researchers often have to work hard to get government subsidies, Lee said.
"China doesn't pick up our best academics, the companies do," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited the best universities to work on A.I. in recent years.
Lee said U.S. A.I. efforts would also benefit from a change in immigration policy.
“Those who do doctorate in the field of A.I. should automatically be offered a green card,” he said.
The Chinese National Council released its next-generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
The Chinese Foundation for Natural Sciences provides financial support to employees of academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations are giving money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, intended to involve industry and academia partners in the initiative, and the White House announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced that $2 billion would be invested in the AI Next initiative.
The NSF is currently investing more than $100 million in research into A.I.
However, the U.S. legislation that would lead to the establishment of a national artificial intelligence security committee has been in the loop for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on possible name change of country
On Sunday, the Macedonian people voted in a referendum on the possible change of the name of their country to “Republic of North Macedonia”, resolving a dispute with Greece that has been dragging on for decades and would no longer impede the Macedonian application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province also called Macedonia, and says that the name of its northern neighbour means that the country is claiming Greek territory. Consequently, Greece vetoed the inclusion of Macedonia in the European Union and NATO.
The two governments signed an agreement based on the proposed new name in June, but nationalists believe the name change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he will not vote in the referendum and through a boycott campaign it is not certain that the required turnout of at least 50 percent will be met, so the referendum may not be valid.
The question on the ballot is as follows: “Do you support membership of NATO and the EU with acceptance of the agreement with Greece?”
“Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the price to be paid is worth trying to join agencies like the EU and NATO. Macedonia is one of the countries that emerged when the former Yugoslavia broke up.
"I am here today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because that will lead to a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, enough MPs have indicated that they will respect the outcome, making it decisive.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The National Election Commission said there had been no reports of irregularities by 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 percent at the time, compared to 34 percent in the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters came to vote.
“I’m here to vote because it’s important for my children. Our place is in Europe,” said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted on 30 September 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia, during the referendum on the country's name change that would open the way for membership of NATO and the European Union.
For the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov set up a small stage and placed chairs for tents that had been set up by people boycotting the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to participate as a full member, not through a backstop," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of the European-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says membership of NATO will provide much-needed investment for Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I am convinced that the vast majority is in favour, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
He said a “yes” as a result would be “a confirmation of our future.”
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research found that between 30 and 43 percent of the voters would participate in the referendum, less than the required turnout.
Another poll, conducted by hot Macedonian TV station Telma TV, concluded that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
70% of them would vote yes.
If the referendum is successful, the vote must be 50% plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since it came to power in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passes full defense of Brighton and scores
Last Saturday, Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling shortened the defense of Brighton at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, and Manchester City won the match 2-0.
It seemed like a whistle of a penny, as Aguero scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker first got the ball played in the midfield.
He raced through between three Brighton defenders, straight into the open field.
There, Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He managed to pass a defender and was too quick for some others on the edge of the Brighton penalty area.
Then he gave a pass to the left, where Sterling waited.
The English attacker used his first action in the penalty area to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right shoe to defeat goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot in the right side of the net.
"Aguero has problems with his feet," Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola told the press.
"We decided to let him play for 55 to 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the first advantage in the Premier League.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball when he was standing deep in the playing field of Brighton.
He sent a beautiful crossing along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane kept the ball with him for a moment and then sent Sterling to the second pole.
The Sky Blues player tipped the ball into the net just before he was too far.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage on Tuesday at 12.55 pm. The match will take place in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play and not make it easy for the Rockies to reach the playoffs
Now that the Washington Nationals have been eliminated for the playoffs, there wasn’t much reason to force a new start.
However, the ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to play Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still consequences for the participation of the Rockies in the playoffs. They currently have one match ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have earned at least a wildcard for the playoffs thanks to their 5-2 win against the Nationals last Friday, but now want to do everything in their power to secure their first division title.
“While there is nothing left for us, at least we can pitch with the knowledge that the atmosphere here in Denver with this audience will be optimal and the other team will probably play at the highest level that I would encounter this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to play in that?”
The Nationals have yet to announce who will be on the move on Sunday, but are reportedly inclined to pitch Scherzer as a pitcher in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, was in the throw-in field on Thursday and would still pitch next Sunday, although that is normally his rest day.
Washington's right-handed pitcher stands at 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holds meeting in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the Supreme Court, while talking about the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve accomplished is at stake in November.
In five weeks, one of the most important elections in our lives will take place.
This is one of the really big elections. I'm not participating, but actually I'm participating. That's why I stand up for great candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump said: “We’re seeing a terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, we’re seeing it happen right now.
And they are determined to take power back, no matter what they have to do for it. You see the vileness, the awfulness.
It doesn't matter who they hurt, who they have to push away to get power and control. That's what they want: power and control, but we won't give that to them."
The Democrats, he said, are on a mission to “resist and obstruct us.”
“And we’ve seen that over the past four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “angry and mean and false and lying.”
He mentioned the name of Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who sits on the Senate Justice Committee, which led to loud booing from the public.
“Do you remember what she answered?
Did you leak the document?
Eh, eh, what.
No, no, I'm waiting for one... that was really bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a broad church.
The party is intolerant of people who say what they think
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, that was no surprise.
After all, I'm the latest in a whole series of Labour MEPs who got to say we're not welcome just because we say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she resolutely opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was punished with the censorship motion because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policies, on national security, on Europe, ironically, similar issues to those where Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
In the announcement of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday, it was stated: “We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
And that was also the case during most GC meetings on Friday night during the eight years I have been a local Labour Member of Parliament.
Unfortunately, that is not the tone of many meetings today, and the promise of a “kinder, softer” policy has long been forgotten, if it had ever begun.
It is becoming increasingly clear that a dissenting opinion is not tolerated in the Labour Party and every opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, and colleagues who, as far as I knew, had a political view similar to my own, suddenly expected me to make a turnaround and take a position that I would otherwise never have agreed to, from issues such as national security to the European single market.
Every time I speak in front of an audience, whatever I say, social media slander follows calling for my candidacy as a member of parliament to be rejected in the next elections, exposing the centre's politics and telling me that I should not be a member of Labour.
And that's just what I'm going through.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments to my address are generally political.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a flood of sexist or racist reactions every day, but do not allow themselves to be intimidated.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this age of politics is that severe slander is apparently considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church, and with every “moment of distrust” or change of selection rules, the party becomes more petty.
Over the past two years, I have often been advised to keep my head low, not just to express my opinion loudly and then I would ‘not get in trouble’.
But I didn't go into politics for that.
Since I joined Labour as a schoolchild 32 years ago, provoked by the neglect of the Thatcher government that literally collapsed my classroom, I have always advocated better public services for those who need them most, both in my role as a councillor and in my role as a minister.
I have never kept my politics hidden, not even in the last elections.
Everyone in Nottingham East had clarity about my policy stances and my arguments with the current leadership.
To those who advocated the motion on Friday, I can only say one thing: when the country drags on to a Brexit that will harm families, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But actually I have only one message, and it is not addressed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, whether they are members of Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that threats of rejecting my candidacy as a Member of Parliament for the next election or political opportunities will not stop me from acting according to what I believe is in your best interest.
Chris Leslie is Member of Parliament for Nottingham East.
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: unbeaten Ayr on the way to the top
Two late try's may have skewed the end result somewhat, but there's no doubt Ayr is rightly triumphing in this delicious game of the day in the Tennent's Premiership.
They are now at the top of the rankings, the only undefeated team of the ten.
Ultimately, it was both their superior defense and their better odds that gave the home team the victory, and coach Peter Murchie was allowed to be satisfied.
“We’ve had a hard time in our games so far and we’re still undefeated, so I’m a happy man,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose: “All honour to Ayr, they took their chances better than we did.”
Grant Anderson's try in the 14th minute, finished by Frazier Climo, led to a lead for Ayr, but by a yellow card from Rory Hughes of the Scottish national team (which he got during the Warriors game) Melrose could have the numbers speak and Jason Baggot managed to break down a try.
Climo took an extra lead for Ayr with a penalty and scored a conversion after a solotry just before the rest. So it was 17-5 for Ayr after the first half.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's try, followed by a conversion from Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
The match was stalled for a long time for a serious injury from Ruaridh Knott, which was discharged on a stretcher, and once the match was restarted, Ayr could continue to run out by a try from Stafford McDowall followed by a conversion from Climo.
Then captain Blair Macpherson of Ayr got a yellow card, and once again Melrose dealt with the extra man when no conversion followed on a try by Bruce Colvine at the end of a match where the pressure was very high.
However, the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for tackling Climo without the ball, MacPherson provided a touchdown to the penalty line-out behind the advancing Ayr mouth.
Climo took care of the conversion, and did so again almost immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe picked up the box kick from David Armstrong and sent halfback Gregor Henry away for the fifth try of the home team.
Star of Still Game is ready for a new career in the restaurant world
Looks like actor Ford Kieran from Still Game is going into the hospitality industry, apparently he's been appointed director of a restaurant business.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and in which he himself acts alongside his comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the last in the series, and it seems Kiernan is already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official data, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment on the story, but a source from the Scottish Sun hinted that Kiernan was looking for a way to participate in the “blooming restaurant business” in Glasgow.
'The sea is ours': land-locked Bolivia hopes the court will reopen the path to the Pacific
Sailors patrol a rigging naval office in La Paz.
Public buildings are covered with an ocean blue flag.
On all naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the motto is: “The sea is ours.
It is a duty to win them back.”
In all of Bolivia, the memory of the coastline that the country had to give to Chile after a bloody nineteenth-century commodity conflict is still alive, as is the desire to re-enter the Pacific Ocean.
That hope may have reached its highest point in recent decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling from the International Court of Justice, which should fall on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
“Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity, and of course looks forward to the result with positive prospects,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians across the country will watch the court’s ruling on big screens, hoping that the Hague court will advocate in favor of Bolivia that Chile, after decades of intense talks, is obliged to give Bolivia sovereign access to the sea.
Also for Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who is facing a controversial fight for re-election next year, there is a lot at stake with Monday’s ruling.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he swore at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to decide in favor of Bolivia, and even if it did, little would change.
The UN body based in the Netherlands has no authority to allocate the Chilean territory and has indicated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice’s ruling falls only six months after the final hearings indicates that the case was “not complicated,” says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And the prospects of a positive outcome for Bolivia have certainly not improved, on the contrary, the situation may have worsened in the past four years.
“The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian government,” Zárate said.
The warlike rhetoric of Morales has completely undermined all the goodwill that Chile may have still had, she claimed.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their talks at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to continue afterwards.
The two countries have not had an ambassador to each other since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who represents Bolivia in The Hague, denies that the court’s decision was taken unusually quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will have “an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of international relations with Chile” and an opportunity to “end 139 years of disagreements, with mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, uses the maritime issue as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific,” he added.
“The statement is an opportunity to see that we have to leave the past behind.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament is only possible if it can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never remove its nuclear weapons if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made at a summit between the leaders of the rivals in Singapore.
He said this at the time when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to restart stalled nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after the summit meeting in Singapore with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is an "utopia" that the lasting sanctions and the U.S. objection to a declaration ending the Korean war will someday get North Korea on its knees.
Washington is not inclined to agree to the statement without Pyongyang first taking important steps in the area of disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is skepticism and doubt that Pyongyang is serious when he says he would renounce an arsenal that the country probably sees as his only way to guarantee his safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest collection of huge headgear, soon to be sold near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or keep the sun out of your eyes completely, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a range of crazy oversized headwear for their SS19 collection on the catwalk, a striking move during Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats were a must-have of Instagram this summer and these designers have sent their dazzling creations on the catwalk.
The striking piece of Valentino was a giant beige hat decorated with a feathery wide edge, which hung over the eyes of the models.
Other oversized accessories included watermelons set with gems, a wizard’s hat, and even a pineapple, but those aren’t designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also unveiled a selection of bizarre masks just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had their lips sewn together and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than like haute couture.
One creation looked like diving gear, complete with snorkel and glasses, while another looked like a melted ice cream.
And if you want to follow this bold fashion, you are lucky.
Style watchers predict that the huge hats will find their way to the clothing stores near you.
The gigantic hats may have been inspired by 'La Bomba', the straw hat with a two meter wide edge that everyone wears, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the very impractical hat that popped up everywhere on social media also created another big creation on the catwalk: a straw beach bag that was almost as big as the model in a swimsuit that carried the bag.
The red-orange raffia bag, trimmed with raffia fringes and finished with a white leather handle, was the most striking piece in the La Riviera SS19 collection by Jacquemus during Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags in stores next summer. Since the designer has made such a huge impact, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for extra large accessories."
John Edward: Language skills essential for global citizens
The independent schools in Scotland have an excellent track record of academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with another series of excellent exam results, plus individual and collective success in sports, arts, music and other initiatives of the entire community.
With more than 30,000 pupils in Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best service to their pupils and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their place as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a customized school curriculum, we see that modern languages remain popular and desirable subjects of choice within schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you talk to someone in a language he understands, you reach his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, you reach his heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that we can’t just rely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year’s recent exam results, we can conclude that languages are at the top of the rankings, with the highest pass rates within independent schools.
In total, 68% of students who studied foreign languages achieved a high score.
The data, collected from 74 schools affiliated with SCIS, shows that 72 percent of students achieved a high score (“A”) in Mandarin, while 72 percent of students German, 69 percent of students French and 63 percent of students Spanish also achieved an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now valued as a subject choice as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school programs and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission found that 17 percent of the stumbling blocks to fill vacancies were attributed to a lack of language skills, according to employers.
Language skills are therefore becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future careers.
With more and more vacancies requiring language skills, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career a person chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future with such a skill for life.
Communicating directly with people from abroad automatically gives a multilingual person an advantage over the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation. French was the only language that stood out above 10 percent, with a total of 15 percent.
This is why investing in language learning is now important for today’s children.
Being able to speak multiple languages, particularly those of emerging economies, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, schools choose which languages they teach.
Some schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while other schools will teach languages that are most important to the UK when looking ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest, there will always be different languages to choose from in independent schools, with teachers specializing in this area.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and gives them the skills needed to succeed, regardless of the future.
Currently, it cannot be denied that languages in a global business environment remain vital for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should actually be considered “international communication skills.”
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron makes his debut at the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
Fans waiting for LeBron James’ first match at the Los Angeles Lakers, the wait is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the opening game before the season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
It remains to be determined how many minutes he will play.
“There will be more than one, and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said in a tweet that James is likely to play for a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' schedule for the six matches ahead of the season.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need any pre-season matches to prepare," he said.
Period of Trump's election rallies in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump Begins a Long Series of Election Rally Tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia
It is Trump’s first of five planned rallies in the coming week, including stops in places he likes, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the vote on the appointment of the candidate he elects for the vacancy in the Supreme Court has been suspended, Trump wants to build support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress when votes take place in November.
What time does Trump’s rally in West Virginia start tonight and how do you look online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, starts tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7 p.m.
You can watch Trump’s rally in West Virginia online via the livestream on YouTube.
Trump will probably be talking about this week’s hearings for nominee Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh. These were extra charged as Kavanaugh is accused of sexual misconduct and the Senate may wait a week to vote on his appointment while the FBI is investigating the case.
But the main goal of this series of rallies is to help the Republicans who are running for the November elections get more vigour.
President Trump’s campaign leadership said these five rallies next week were meant to “encourage volunteers and supporters, while Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives,” Reuters said.
“Control over Congress is so important for his program that the president is travelling to as many states as possible as the busy campaign season begins,” a Trump campaign spokesperson said.
The rally tonight at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and be discussed in the Pittsburgh media, West Virginia Metro News said.
Saturday is the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is lagging behind in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president needs to come to give him a boost in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA ready to fight to keep hope alive in the run-up to Sunday's singles
After three one-sided sessions, the foursomes of Saturday afternoon were perhaps just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of odds is a fully invented sports concept, but one that players really believe in, and especially in competitions like this.
So who gets the best chances right now?
“They had a six-point lead at first, and now that’s just four more, so we’re pretty much finding that luck is on our side right now,” Spieth said before leaving at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has the advantage of standing for four points, while there are still twelve at stake.
The Americans find, as Spieth said, that they have a little wind in their sails, and there are many things that give courage, not least the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and each scored three points out of four.
Spieth has been a feared opponent from tee to green and he sets a good example.
The typical throat sounds he makes when he plays well became louder as his lap progressed and he achieved a crucial putt that made game four a success when he and Thomas were two points behind after two games.
His putt with which they won the match at 15 was followed by a similar scream, the kind from which you can deduce that he believes the American team has not yet been defeated.
“You have to dig deep and worry only about your own game,” Spieth said.
That’s all these players can do now.
18 holes to make your mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
This strange but delicious European duo has four in four and can do nothing wrong.
'Moliwood' was the only duo that didn't play bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the back nine on Friday morning they avoided bogeys.
As a result of that series, and the way they seem to exchange energy with their noisy audience, they are the players to be defeated on Sunday. If Fleetwood or Molinari wins, he will be the most popular player ever to win a European victory when the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
It is, however, premature to speak of a European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson broke up with Sergio Garcia, the fourball hero that morning, when he formed a duo with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine led to a delay for the Spaniard and the Swede that they could not overcome.
On Sunday, however, there is no one who can help you catch up.
The four-balls and foursomes are so fascinating to see through the interactions between the duos, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give, and the way a strategy can change in an instant.
The European team has already played the best so far and has a nice lead in the run-up to the last day, but this foursome session has also shown Team USA is willing to take on the fight, something some, especially in the US, doubted.
Europe takes the lead with 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe starts with a nice lead to the last day of the Ryder Cup. After the four-balls and foursomes of Saturday, they are 10-6 ahead of the United States.
The animated duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led their team with two wins more than Tiger Woods, who was struggling, so they now have a four-point lead in Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who wants the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, was stronger than the blundering Americans in the four-balls in the morning, with a score of 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes, where it won two matches, but was unable to catch up.
Jim Furyk's team must score eight points during Sunday's 12 singles matches to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed ‘Molliwood’, are only the second duo in Ryder Cup history to win four points in their four opening matches after a sensational weekend.
After capturing Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-balls, they were beautifully matched and defeated a disappointing Woods and American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau with a powerful 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two matches on Saturday, occasionally showed a brilliant move, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in four-balls and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, equipped for the morning four-balls, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and together they defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the world’s number one and three, with 2&1.
Yet it did not run from a slate roof for Europe on this pleasant day with a breeze southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, who won the Major three times, and Justin Thomas set the standard for the Americans on Saturday with three points.
They won after a tough match with 2&1 of the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-balls and later defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4&3 in the foursomes, after losing the first four holes.
It has only happened twice before in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team has been able to catch up on a four-point defeat at the start of the singles, although Furyk's team has had enough of a draw, as they currently have the trophy in their hands.
But now that they have been in second place for two days, a counter-attack on Sunday seems too high.
North Korea says it will not unilaterally disarm without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the ongoing sanctions lead to increasing mistrust in the United States and that under such circumstances, the country would in no way be able to unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN’s annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken “important goodwill measures” over the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the site for nuclear tests, and pledging not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“We don’t see a similar response from the United States,” he said.
“Without any trust in the US, there will be no trust in our national security and under such circumstances we will not unilaterally disarm ourselves.”
Although Ri repeated the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's opposition to a "phased" approach to denuclearization, where North Korea would be rewarded as it takes further steps, it was striking that he did not disapprove of unilateral denuclearization a priori, as Pyongyang used to do.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between an active U.S. president and a North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore, when Kim pledged to work towards “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,” while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea’s security.
North Korea is striving for a formal end to the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also opposed calls to ease the harsh international sanctions against North Korea.
“The U.S. is urging ‘denuclearization first’ and increasing the pressure through sanctions to achieve their goal in a compelling way and even by objecting to the ‘declaration of the end of war’,” Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is an aerial castle of the people who are ignorant about us.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions only strengthen our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, something the US leader suggested earlier this week at the United Nations.
The minister instead highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If the other party to this issue of denuclearization was South Korea and not the US, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have come to such an impasse.”
Yet the tone of Ri’s speech was significantly different from last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korean missiles were aimed at the U.S. mainland so after ‘Mr. Evil President’ Trump called Kim a ‘missile man’ on a suicide mission.
Trump, who threatened to completely destroy North Korea last year, praised Kim this year at the United Nations for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said much still needs to be done and that sanctions must continue until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn’t have a timetable for this: “Whether it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The enforcement of the sanctions of the Security Council must be continued vigorously and firmly until we have realized the full, definitive, verified denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea since 2006 to significantly reduce funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo had a meeting with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and said he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
Just hours after he left Pyongyang in July and said progress had been made, North Korea accused him of making “gangster-like demands.”
North Korea pledged to dismantle a rocket site and a nuclear complex if the United States took “correspondent measures” during a meeting with Moon this month.
He said Kim had told him that the “corresponding measures” he wanted were security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore, and steps toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take course on the importance of adequate rest
A new course at Harvard University this year ensures that all students get more sleep, in an effort to combat the growing macho culture in which it seems cool to study all night long and drink a lot of caffeine.
A professor noted that the students of the world’s largest university often have no idea of the basics of taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, Professor of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School, a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, drafted the course. As far as he knows, it is unique in the US.
He was given the idea to start the course after giving a speech on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“At the end of my speech, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why am I only hearing this now, in my last year?’
She said no one had ever told her how important sleep is, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, organised for the first time this year, explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits help improve academic and athletic performance and how they also promote their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the university decided to organize the course when it was determined that students had severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The course lasts one hour and includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one of the sections, the students see an image of a dormitory, where they click on coffee cups, curtains, exercise equipment and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and the way sports performance is affected by sleep deprivation, and the importance of a routine at bedtime.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Using a campus map, with interactive icons, participants are encouraged to reflect on their daily routine.
“We know that we will not immediately change the behavior of the students.
But we find that they have the right to know all of this, just as people have the right to know what effects the choice of cigarettes has on their health, Czeisler added.
The culture of pride in studying at night still exists, he says, and due to modern technology and the increasing pressure on students, sleep deprivation is an increasing problem.
Ensuring adequate sleep, of good quality, should be the student’s “secret weapon” to combat stress, fatigue, and anxiety, he said, and even to avoid weight gain, because sleep deprivation causes the brain to give them a constant feeling of hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from Calfornia who is studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler set up the course because he had been teaching with the professor last year when he was studying at Harvard in his first year.
He said the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to make the course available to everyone on campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all students to follow a similar study program before coming to the competitive setting.
Professor Czeisler advises students to set an alarm before their bedtime, not just an alarm to get up. They should also be aware of the harmful effects of the “blue light” of electronic screens and LED lighting, which can disrupt your circadian rhythm, causing you to have trouble falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal destroys Gerrard's men
The Rangers saw their away game again disappointingly when Dolly scored Menga and defeated Steven Gerrard's weak team by 1-0 at Livingston.
Ibrox's team hoped for a first win in a away game since they defeated St Johnstone 4-1 in February, but Gary Holt's team caused the defeat, barely Gerrard's second as manager in 18 games. His team is now eight points behind Hearts, who continue to run at the top of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored seven minutes before the rest, and the Rangers failed to score the tie.
The Rangers now drop to sixth place, Livingston rises to third, with only a difference in number of goals compared to Hibernian.
And the Rangers could get even more trouble, as border judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after apparently an object was thrown at him by the supporters of the visiting team.
Gerrard made eight changes in his team, crossing Ayr and going to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt stayed with the same team for Livingston, who managed to cut off the Hearts a point last week. He would have been delighted at the way his well-trained team blocked the opponents in every move.
The Rangers may have had the most possession of the ball, but Livingston did more with it.
They should have scored after just two minutes, when Menga dropped the ball for the first time and Scott Pittman had Allan McGregor's goal in sight, but the midfielder could not finish it.
A deep free kick from Keaghan Jacobs reached captain Craig Halkett, but his fellow defender Alan Lithgow kicked against the back pole.
The Rangers did manage to take control, but they seemed to hope for a good outcome rather than really believe in it if they could approach the goal.
At least Alfredo Morelos felt he was entitled to a penalty kick when he and Steven Lawless collided after a fifteen-minute play, but referee Steven Thomson waved away the Colombian's request.
The Rangers could only shoot twice to the goal in the first half, but Liam Kelly, who was former goalkeeper at the Ibrox, was able to easily stop Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's tame shot.
Livingston’s opener in the 34th minute may not be in the extension of the overall gameplay, no one can deny that they deserved it, even if it was just for their hard work.
Again, the Rangers were unable to cope with Jacobs' deep game pattern.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained cold-blooded and chose Menga, who kicked the ball into the goal with ease.
Gerrard interrupted with the change Coulibaly/Ryan Kent. This move had almost immediate consequences when the winger Morelos passed, but an impressive Kelly raced away from his line to stop the ball.
But Livingston continued to force visitors to play the kind of game Livingston prefers, with Lithgow and Halkett continuing to kick long balls.
Holt's team could have increased its lead in the final stage of the match, but McGregor held out and blocked Jacobs, after which Lithgow came wide from the corner.
Incumbent Glenn Middleton of the Rangers asked for a penalty kick at the end of the game after a collision with Jacobs, but Thomson looked the other way.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from the almanac of our 'Sunday Morning': September 30, 1882, today exactly 136 years ago, for who can tell... the day on which the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm 'Hans' Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device called the Geiger counter.
Since then, the geiger counter has become an icon in pop culture, for example in Bells or Coronado, a 1950 film starring the unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What the hell is that?”
Rogers: ‘That’s a Geiger counter, which is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you hear the effect of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals.”
Evans: “It’s really popping up right now!”
'Hans' Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name remains relevant.
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach the Immune System to ‘See’ Malignant Cells
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Immune System to ‘See’ and Kill Malignant Cells
Vaccine Teaches Immune System to Recognize Malignant Cells in Treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells in a patient to modify them in a lab
They can then “see” a protein that is common in many types of cancer and are then re-injected.
A test vaccine delivers promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who was treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months
In the method, immune cells are removed in a patient, after which the cells in the lab are adjusted in such a way that they can ‘see’ the protein HER2, which is common in all types of cancer, and then the cells are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “stimulates the growth of various types of cancer,” including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, and colon cancer, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar way of removing immune cells from patients and ‘learning’ these cells to tackle cancer cells has been found to work in the treatment of a certain type of leukemia.
Kanye West is wearing pro-Trump hat and MAGA cap after his appearance on Saturday Night Live.
It didn’t go as he had hoped.
Kanye West was mocked during a Saturday Night Live broadcast after an incoherent performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would be a presidential candidate in 2020.
After bringing his third song of the evening, Ghost Town, with a cap on his head with the text Make America Great Again, he pitched a tirade against the Democrats and repeated that he supports Trump.
“Often when I talk to a white person, he asks, ‘How can you sympathize with Trump?
"If I was worried about racism, I had long left America," he said.
The Saturday Night Live broadcast began with a parody in which Hollywood star Matt Damon stabbed the dragon with Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony to the Senate Justice Commission in connection with the alleged assault Christine Blasey Ford accused him of.
The tirade of West was not broadcast, but comedian Chris Rock uploaded them on social media.
It's not clear whether Rock wants to take West to the dragon with his post.
West also complained to the public that he had been fired on backstage for his cap.
“They’ve hit me backstage.
They said, “Don’t go on stage with that hat.”
They harassed me!
And then they say I'm apathetic," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, “Do you want to see how apathetic it looks?” He said that he would put on her superman-cape, “because that means you can’t command me. Do you want the world to be better?
Give me some love."
From the audience came at least twice bow call and the cast members of SNL seemed embarrassed, according to Variety. The magazine was told by one of the present: 'The whole studio was suddenly quiet.'
West was a guest as a last-minute replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with a performance of the song I Love it while dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: “To one of our bravest minds: THANK YOU FOR TRUSTING THE MASSA.”
But talk show presenter Karen Hunter tweeted that West was “just himself, and that’s beautiful.”
“But I choose not to reward someone who supports and spits out an ideology that harms my community (by buying their music or clothing or supporting their ‘art’).
He is free to do whatever he wants.
"We too," she added.
Before the show began, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name. From now on, he is, he says, "the creature formally known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name, he was preceded by Diddy Puff, also known as Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Colleague rapper Snoop Dogg also bore the name Snoop Lion and the late music legend Prince once changed his name to a symbol and then to The artist formerly known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder after stabbing in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after a man was stabbed Friday at a restaurant in east Belfast.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before the police judge in Belfast on Monday.
The accusation will be investigated by the prosecution.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington makes it to toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as swordsman Jon Snow in HBO’s violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor pulls out to the macho hero’s stereotype, saying that young boys often think when they see such roles on screen they have to be tough to get respect.
In a conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he felt that “something went wrong” and asked himself how the problem of toxic masculinity should be addressed in the era of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married his co-star of Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, who is also 31, admitted that he strongly believes the problem needs to be addressed.
“This is a really important question for me personally right now: where did our masculinity go wrong?” he said.
“What did we learn from men when they were growing up, which now confronts us with this problem?”
Kit thinks that television could be partly responsible for the rise in toxic masculinity, due to his very masculine characters.
He continued, “What is innate and what has been learned?”
What is being taught on TV and on the streets that makes young boys think they should be a certain kind of man?
I think that’s one of today’s big questions: how do we change that?
“Something went wrong for young men.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not act in prequels or sequels to Games of Thrones when the series ends next summer, because he is “ready with battlefields and horses.”
Starting in November, Kit will play in a revival of True West by Sam Shepard, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he believes that his meeting with his wife Rose is the best result of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife during the series, so that's how I left it to my future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the great love of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the fantasy series that was awarded an Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 on the estate of Leslie’s family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China reports that the number of Chinese living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14%.
Health authorities say more than 820,000 people have been affected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018, 40,000 new cases were reported.
In the vast majority of new cases, the diseases were transmitted through sex, which was not the case before.
HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China in the past through transfusions of contaminated blood.
But the number of people contracting HIV in this way is now almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, compared to the same period last year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
The transmission of HIV through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has not been a crime in China since 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is reportedly widespread.
According to studies, 70 to 90% of men who have sex with men would eventually marry a woman.
Often the diseases are transmitted due to inadequate protection in the sexual relations in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV medication as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that staff has leaked data from Republican senators and calls it “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters opposes allegations that one of her staff members posted the personal data of three U.S. Republican senators on the legislators' Wikipedia page.
The Los Angeles-based Democrat claims the allegations are being spread by “extreme-right” lawmakers and websites.
"Lies, lies and even more vicious lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published data would include the private address and phone number of U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The data appeared online Thursday. They were posted by an unknown in Capitol Hill during a Senate committee hearing on the allegations of sexual misconduct to Brett Kavanaugh, Supreme Court candidate.
The leak came after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
According to conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, the IP address indicating the source of the posts was linked to the Waters office and contained the information of a Waters employee, the Hill said.
“This unfounded accusation is completely false and a blatant lie,” Waters said.
“My employee, whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these false allegations, was under no circumstances responsible for leaking this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and a blatant lie.”
The statement of Waters quickly encountered criticism online, among other things by former White House press officer Ari Fleischer.
“This denial sounds angry,” Fleischer wrote.
“You can see from this that she doesn’t have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
If someone is accused of something he hasn’t done, he shouldn’t get angry.
He shouldn't be rebellious.
He shouldn't question the prosecutor's motives.
He needs to be calm and serene.”
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters’s response to Democrats’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of exaggerated anger during Thursday’s hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who wants to take Waters' place in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
“If it’s true,” he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had notified the relevant services and law enforcement agencies of these false allegations.
“We will make the perpetrators known,” she said, “and they will be legally held responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to my staff.”
Johnny English Strikes Again, a weak spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
In every new film with a British impact, we are now traditionally looking for references to Brexit, and that turns out to apply to this revival of the Johnny English franchise, the comic action films starring a sluggish spy, which started in 2003 with Johnny English and was revived in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is this airy self-satire about how bad we are doing the latest export product for our country?
The incompetent Johnny English with bulging eyes and flexible facial features manages to control everything in the 100, even with his second comeback. From his name you can already deduce that he is a general comic character that was conceived for cinema goers in countries where one speaks a language other than English.
He is, of course, the silly secret agent who, despite his bizarre claim to smooth glamour, has a little Clouseau, a touch of Mr Bean and a pinch of that guy who contributed one note to the theme number of Chariots of Fire during the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
It is originally based on the traveller and the international mysterious man who once played Atkinson in the TV commercials of Barclaycard (which everyone has since forgotten) who always leaves a certain chaos behind.
His latest portrait of Johnny English contains one or two beautiful moments.
I loved how Johnny English approached a helicopter in his medieval armor and tapped the rotor blades against his helmet.
Atkinson can well show how much talent he has for physical comedy in this film, but the humor seems rather weak and crazy enough excessive, especially now that the "serious" movie series like 007 and Mission Impossible include comedy itself as an ingredient, and do well.
The humor seems more meant for children than for adults, and the mad calamity of Johnny English comes to me less original and focused than the jokes without the lyrics of the character Bean who plays Atkinson.
The constant theme now is that Britain is in great trouble.
A cyberhacker has infiltrated the super-secret spy network on the web, revealing the identity of all of Britain’s active secret agents, to the great dismay of the agent in office, a unfortunately small role of Kevin Eldon.
Emma Thompson does her utmost with this character, which is reminiscent of Teresa May, but the script does not offer much material to work with.
According to her intelligence advisers, she has to deploy a retired spy, as every active spy is compromised.
And that means the stunting Johnny English himself, who now works as a schoolteacher in a chic setting, but unofficially teaches undercover work. Here are nice jokes in the story, because the spy lessons of English are reminiscent of School of Rock.
English is quickly summoned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former pathetic buddy Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man. His wife is the captain of a submarine, a tumultuous and jovial role that lies below Vicki Pepperdine's level.
The Batman and Robin of the disastrous conditions of Her Majesty's Secret Service are thus back in action and meet Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister unfortunately falls for the charms of the charismatic technology billionaire who claims to be able to solve the British computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough embark on an odyssey of gorgeous fun: dressed as waiters, they set fire to a fancy French restaurant, kicking noise aboard Volta's luxury yacht, and English unleashes pure anarchy as he tries to use a Virtual Reality headset to familiarize himself with Volta's home interior.
For the latter, all the registers are opened, but no matter how well-intentioned and turbulent the scene is, it reminds me of children's television.
It's not all very original.
And as with the other films of Johnny English, I ask myself: can’t the British film industry really come up with a role that honors Rowan Atkinson’s talent?
Labour denies that the party is working on a plan whereby British workers work four days a week but are paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party would consider a radical plan whereby British workers work four days a week but are paid for five days.
Reportedly, the party would like companies’ bosses to pass on the savings they are making as a result of the revolution of Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) to their employees by giving them an extra day of vacation.
For example, employees can enjoy a three-day weekend, but still earn the same amount.
According to sources, the idea “fits” into the party’s economic agenda and plans to make the country’s balance shift towards the workers.
The transition to a four-day workweek was already approved by the Confederation of Trade Unions, which considers it a good way to ensure that workers can take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: “A policy revision is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen from one moment to the next, but a four-day workweek is a goal that fits within the party’s endeavour to make the balance in the economy more balanced for the benefit of the workers and that also fits within the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
Labour is not the first party to support such an idea, given that the Green Party already promised a four-day workweek in the 2017 national election campaign.
However, the effort is not yet supported by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesperson said: “A four-day workweek is not a party’s policy plan and is not being considered by the party.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour conference last week to clarify his view of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from the “faceless drivers” and the “profits” at utilities.
The Shadow Chancellor’s plans also mean that current shareholders of water companies may not get back the full value of their share, as a Labour government could apply “discounts” based on perceived misconduct.
He also confirmed that there are plans to include employees on the boards of directors of companies and to establish inclusive ownership funds that give 10 percent of the shares of private sector firms to employees who can earn up to <0xC2><0xA3>500 per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy Tell '60 Minutes' If FBI's Investigation of Kavanaugh Could Change Their Opinion
The FBI’s investigation into allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination for the Supreme Court by at least one week, raising the question of whether the FBI’s findings could cause Republican senators to withdraw their support for the candidate.
In an interview aired on Sunday on '60 Minutes', correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could discover anything that could lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open in this than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said before the hearing that I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him, after this happened, after the accusation came out, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was resolute, determined, unambiguous."
However, Graham’s voice seems to be wall-mounted.
"My opinion about Brett Kavanaugh is firm and the accusation should contain dynamite," he said.
"As far as Dr. Ford is concerned, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And no one named by her could verify it.
It's been 36 years.
I don’t see any new developments.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it contributed to reducing poverty?
This Saturday the Global Citizen Festival will be held in New York, an annual music event where a very impressive line-up of stars will perform and that has an equally impressive mission: the end of poverty in the world.
For the seventh time, tens of thousands of people will come to the Great Lawn in Central Park for the Global Citizen Festival. Not only to enjoy acts like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes but also to raise awareness for the real purpose: ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was first organized in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a group of international advocates who hope to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
Concertgoers who want to get a free ticket to the event (unless they were willing to pay for a VIP ticket) had to complete a series of tasks, or "actions," such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call, or in any other meaningful way raising awareness for the goal: an end to poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen Festival been, with 12 years left to go to achieve this goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a suitable way to convince people to demand a call to action or is this just another form of ‘clicktivism’, making people feel that they are making a real contribution by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, according to Global Citizen, more than 19 million ‘actions’ of supporters have been registered, targeting a wide range of different targets.
According to Global Citizen, these actions have helped global leaders engage and make policy proposals worth more than $37 billion that should change the lives of 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 initiatives and statements based on the actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid out or collected through sponsorship actions.
The group estimates that the funds obtained so far have had an impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of UK investors and executives aimed at “helping children realize their full potential,” has pledged $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the help of the UK government, donors, other national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can turn the social injustice that is malnutrition into a footnote in history,” Tracey Ullman, ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, told the audience at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also announced that, after sending more than 5,000 actions asking the UK government to improve the nutritional situation for mothers and children, the government has announced support for a project, the Power of Nutrition, that will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on the Global Citizen website asking "why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
the group replied, "It will be a long and difficult road, where we will sometimes fall and fail.
But, just like the civil rights and anti-apartheid movements ahead of us, we will ultimately be successful because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who will perform at this year’s New York event presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States may deploy the Navy for a "blockade" to impede Russian energy exports - Minister of the Interior
Washington may resort to the Navy “if necessary” to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East, said US Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke, as noted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s involvement in Syria, where the country acts at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
“I believe they are only in the Middle East to be able to trade in energy, just like in Eastern Europe and the southern flank of Europe,” he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to counter this.
“The United States has that ability, with the Navy, to ensure that the sailing routes remain open and, if necessary, to block them to ensure that their energy does not come to the market,” he said.
Zinke spoke to guests at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that identifies itself as the “voice of the energy consumer” in the US.
He went further and compared Washington’s approach to Russia with the approach to Iran, noting that these are not substantially different.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less using and replacing fuels," he said, referring to Russia as a country that has only one "art", with an economy that relies on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump administration is trying to boost liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, a country that by far offers the cheapest option for European consumers.
For that reason, Trump administration officials, including President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw sight of the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project that, according to Berlin’s Trum, has made Moscow’s “prisoner.”
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, worth $11 billion, which will double its current pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s strong opposition to the project is driven solely by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we agree with the view that energy should not be used to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers themselves," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position has provoked a reaction from Germany, which has reaffirmed its involvement in the project.
The Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie (BDI), the leading industry organisation in Germany, has called on the US not to interfere with the EU’s energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third power interferes with our energy supplies," Dieter Kempf, head of the Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren 'thinks seriously' to take part in 2020 presidential election, Massachusetts senator says
Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator, said on Saturday that she is “seriously thinking about” taking part in the presidential election after the midterm election.
At a local meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she is considering taking part in the election.
"It's time for women to go to Washington to repair the damaged government, and this also means a woman in the top position," she said, according to the political newspaper The Hill.
"After November 6, I will start thinking seriously about running for president."
Warren ran against President Donald Trump at the meeting in the town hall, saying he was “steering this country in the wrong direction.”
“I’m deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing in our democracy,” she said.
Warren has been frank in her criticism of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said: “Of course, we have to wait for an investigation by the FBI before we vote on this.”
However, an opinion poll published Thursday found that a majority of Warren’s own supporters feel they shouldn’t run for election in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts’s “probable” voters said the senator should not run, according to an opinion poll by Suffolk University’s Political Research Center and the Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent voted for her to run.
The study showed that there was more support for former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in favour of a possible candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other names of prominent Democrats associated with a possible participation in the 2020 presidential election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially make a decision in January, according to an Associated Press report.
Sarah Palin Speaks About Track Palin’s PTSD At Donald Trump Election Meeting
Track Palin, 26, has spent a year in Iraq after he entered service in September.
He was arrested and charged after a report of domestic violence Monday night.
“By what my own son has to go through, what he’s going through now that he’s back, I understand other families experiencing the consequences of PTSD and the injuries with which some of our soldiers return,” she told the audience attending a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of her son and other veterans "they come back a little differently, they come back and have become harder, they come back and wonder if there is any respect for what their fellow soldiers and the pilots and all the other soldiers have given for the homeland."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and has been charged with domestic violence and assault on a woman, interference in a report on domestic violence and possession of an under-influenced weapon, according to Dan Bennett, police spokesman in Wasilla.
Washington D.C. and 18 States Support Protest Against New Asylum Policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal protest against a new policy in the U.S. that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and Washington D.C. filed a statement last Friday as a “friend of the court” to the Washington court in support of an asylum seeker who challenged this policy, reports NBC News.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace versus Sessions case that the American Civil Liberties Union brought against federal policy in August has not been disclosed.
She says that her partner "and his violent sons who are members of a gang" abused her but that U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was then imprisoned in Texas.
The lawyers of the states that support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of people applying for asylum in the U.S., as countries that face major problems in terms of gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy has reversed a 2014 Board of Immigrant Appeals decision that made it possible for undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Washington, D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of state, federal and international law.”
"Federal legislation requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application and such an impediment is contrary to that principle" is stated in the statement of the "Friend of the Court."
The lawyers further argue that the policy of denying immigrants access to the U.S. is damaging to the U.S. economy, as these immigrants are likely to become new entrepreneurs and "provide the country with the necessary labor force."
In June, Justice Secretary Jeff Sessions ordered judges not to grant asylum to victims of domestic and gang-related violence.
“Asylum is available to those fleeing their country because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a specific social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in his June 11 announcement of the policy.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all problems, even if these problems are serious, which people face every day, anywhere in the world.
Desperate rescue attempts in Palu as the number of deaths doubled in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation got worse.
“It feels very tense,” said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, as she tried to comfort her feverish baby in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute new bodies arrive in ambulances.
Clean water is scarce.”
Residents came back to their ruined homes and searched in their wet belongings for valuables that they could still use.
Hundreds of people have suffered injuries and the hospitals are overcrowded, as long as they have not been damaged by the 7.5 earthquake on the Richter scale.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris who suffered a broken back and shoulder, rested outside the army hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside because of the risk of severe aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he told about his feelings when the devastating earthquake shook the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pressed against the remains of a wall," Haris told an Associated Press correspondent, adding that he and his family were in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife crying for help, and later I didn't hear anything.
I don't know what happened to her and our child.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of 'intimidation' with 'propaganda ads'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper posted a four-page ad in an American daily that praised the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump recently referred to China Daily’s paid attachment in the Des Moines Register, Iowa’s most-selling newspaper, after accusing China of interference in the November 6 U.S. congressional elections, an accusation China denies.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US election marked, according to US officials quoted by Reuters, a new stage in an escalating campaign by Washington to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in an escalating trade war, in which they have imposed increasingly higher import tariffs on each other.
China’s retaliation tariffs early in the trade war were specifically aimed at hitting exporters in states like Iowa, who support the Trump Republican Party, as Chinese and US experts have said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and previously long-time governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said China had hit American workers, farmers and businesses.
“China,” as Branstad wrote in a Sunday’s Des Moines Register opinion piece, “now doubles the harassment by publishing propaganda ads in our free press.”
"By spreading this propaganda, the government of China uses freedom of expression and a free press, a long cherished tradition in America by placing a paid advertisement in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, you will find in vain dissenting voices at a kiosk in downtown Beijing and you will not see a true reflection of the divergent opinions that the Chinese people may have about the difficult economic trajectory, as the media are firmly under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that “one of China’s most prominent newspapers has refused to publish his article,” if he did not say to which newspaper it was.
Due to the Kavanaugh debacle, Republicans alienated female voters just before the midterm election, analysts warn
With many important Republicans gathering around Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court candidate, and defending him from various allegations of sexual violence, analysts warn that this will cause them a setback, especially among women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
Emotions around this topic have risen tremendously and most Republicans have already announced that they want to continue with the vote.
“These things cannot be reversed,” Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School, told The Hill for an article that appeared Saturday.
Reeher said he is wondering if Senator Jeff Flake’s attempt at last-minute pleas for an FBI investigation will be enough to satisfy the angry voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday, they won't forget it tomorrow, and they won't forget it in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national spokeswoman for the progressive MoveOn group on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters shouted, "November is coming!" during their demonstration in the Senate hall as Republicans under control of the Justice Commission chose to approve Kavanaugh's candidacy despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation for the Democrats will reach a record high," Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, told the news site.
"People say it's already high, and that's true.
But it can go even further, especially among female voters in the suburbs and among younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who often do not vote even if they do not agree with the president.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony, in which she further clarified her accusation of sexual harassment against the candidate for the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that there could be a setback if the Republicans pushed through the nomination.
"This has become a confused mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former party chairman of the Republican Party, earlier last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the vote in the committee, or the final vote, or that Kavanaugh sits in court, but it’s also about the way Republicans handled this and how they treated her,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps Democrats get elected, told the news channel.
However, the Americans appear to be divided over who they believe after the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a small majority signing off on the side of the latter.
A new YouGov opinion poll shows that 41 percent of respondents are sure or likely to believe Ford’s testimony and 35 percent are sure or likely to believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh was certain or likely to have lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake’s advance, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations of Ford and at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Last week, Ford swore before the Senate Justice Committee that Kavanaugh had assaulted her under the influence of alcohol when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed her his genitals at a party during the time they both studied at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning a new Internet to tackle Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is starting a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the technology legend’s latest project, is a company based on Berners-Lee’s open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which persons have access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that 'world domination' is the leading thought behind Inrupt.
"We have to do this now," he said about the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid’s technology to enable people to create their own ‘personal online data storage’ or POD.
It can store contact lists, activity lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available together through one browser and all at the same time.
What makes POD unique is the fact that it depends entirely on the user who has access to which information.
The company calls this “personal empowerment through data.”
According to CEO John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is that the company provides the resources, processes and skills needed to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of voluntary programmers.
As of this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps with the tools available on Inrupt’s website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team will not have conversations with “Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete transformation that will turn all their business models completely upside down at once.”
“We don’t ask for their permission.”
In a post on Medium published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the "mission (of Inrupt) is to deliver commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new web, which is built on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even after the start of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue as founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this new era for the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: clergyman and bearer of the Victoria Cross from World War I honored
The only clergyman of the Church of England who acquired a Victoria Cross during World War I as a military officer is honored 100 years later in his birthplace.
Lieutenant-Colonel, the Reverend Bernard Vann received the award following the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, he was killed four days later by a sharpshooter, so he never knew that he had received the highest British military honor.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of the grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliantly symbolic" that the stone was unveiled exactly 100 years after the fact for which his grandfather was distinguished.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a very dense fog and under fierce fire of field guns and machine guns".
He later stormed through to the fire line and led the line forward before running alone to a field gun and eliminating three members of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I can never tick, but also something that makes me feel humble.”
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt "very honored to play a role in the parade" and added that "the bravery of a real hero is evidenced by the support he receives from a large number of people."
Fans of MMA stayed up all night to see Bellator 206 and got Peppa Pig in place
Imagine, you’ve been waking up all night to watch a tucked-in Bellator 206 and you don’t get to see the most important moment.
The poster from San Jose included 13 fights, including six in the main section, and this was broadcast all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for their fight, viewers in the UK were unpleasantly surprised when the station switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were indignant because they had stayed awake all night especially for this fight.
One fan described the transition to the children’s program on Twitter as “a bad joke.”
“According to government regulations, no content that is not suitable for children should be shown after 6:00 a.m., so we had to switch to the children’s program,” said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communication at Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the pig," yesss.
Scott Coker, chairman of Bellator’s company, said they will be adjusting their programming to ensure that viewers in the UK will also have a chance in the future.
"I think, in view of the return game, we can solve this problem," Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning here on a Sunday and we can't discuss anything until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
We're working on it.
When I made the switch, a lot of text messages went back and forth and believe me, these were not all equally friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government problem.
I can promise that this will not happen a second time.
We limit the broadcasts to five nights instead of six, as we normally did, we tried to make it even better for the fans, but we just went too far.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'inferior' because of his sexual orientation
Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he felt inferior during his childhood because of his sexual orientation, but this gave him the motivation to become successful.
The twenty-four-year-old said that until he went to secondary school, he didn’t realize that “not everyone is like me.”
In a conversation at Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 with Lauren Laverne, he said he had spoken out about gay rights to "give hope" to others.
He also said that parenting had helped him put less value on winning at the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the regular presenter of the long-running show has taken a few months off due to illness.
Appearing as a spoiler on Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "less" than others during his childhood because "it was not socially accepted to like both girls and boys."
He said, “To this day, those feelings, the feeling of being less and the feeling of being different, are really existing facts that have given me the strength to be successful.”
He wanted to prove that he was "someone" so that he would not disappoint people if they eventually found out about his orientation.
The winner of two bronze Olympic medals has become a prominent campaigner for the LGBT community and used his presence at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke out because he felt fortunate that he could live openly without further consequences and that he wanted to give others “hope.”
The three-time world champion said that the fact that he fell in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Back, whom he met in 2013, "has completely surprised me."
Daley married the Oscar winner last year, who is 20 years older than him, but said the age difference had never been a problem.
“When you’re so young,” he took part in his first Olympics at the age of fourteen and his father died of cancer three years later, it’s hard to find someone in your own age group who has experienced the same highs and lows.
The couple became parents in June of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said his "whole perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me this question last year, I would have answered that it was all about winning a gold medal," he said.
But you know what, there are more important things on earth than winning gold Olympic medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son has the same name as his father who died in 2011 at the age of 40, after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father had not accepted that he would die and one of the last things he had asked was if they had already received the tickets for London 2012 because he wanted to be on the front row.
"I couldn't get it over my heart to say, you won't be there to sit on the front row anymore, dad," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and not until his breathing actually stoked and he died, I was finally able to recognize that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"I knew I had dreamed about this all my life. To dive for a home audience during the Olympics, there is no better feeling," he said.
It was also the inspiration for his first choice of music, Proud by Heather Small, which had taken him heavily on his way to the games and which still gave him goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs can be listened to on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, not in shape, on the couch during the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but he has to find his shape back so as not to make it a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who is participating in the biennial event for the 12th time, a record, was placed on the bench by team captain Jim Furyk for the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Rather than being at the center of the action, as he has often done for the United States, the winner of five majors divides the day between supporting his teammates and practicing on the driving range, in an attempt to figure out where it is at.
Because he was never known for his straight drives even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the close fairways of Le Golf National, where the long grass of the roughs routinely punishes wandering balls.
And if the track in itself isn’t scary enough, Mickelson will face the always accurate Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, in the ninth match on Sunday, who is paired with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans who are four points behind at the start of the 12 single matches start well, Mickelson’s match can be absolutely crucial.
Furyk has shown confidence in this man, even though he honestly could hardly do otherwise.
"He fully understood the role he had today, hit me on the back, put his arm around me and said he's ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He has been inducted into the Hall of Fame and has contributed so much to these teams, in the past, but also this week.
I probably didn’t expect him to play two matches.
I expected more of it, but it is as it is and it is the way we should act.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson could improve Nick Faldo's record on Sunday for the highest number of Ryder Cup matches played.
It can also mean the end of a Ryder Cup career in which he has never quite matched the highlights of his personal career.
Mickelson has won 18 matches, lost 20 matches and 7 matches, but Furyk said his presence had an intangible influence on the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's clever, he likes to joke with people and he's a great guy to have on the team," he explained.
"I think the younger players liked to have him fooled from time to time last week, which was funny to see.
He has so much more to offer than just his game.”
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows that big lead can disappear quickly
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that the comfortable lead ahead of the single matches on the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a less comfortable situation.
The Danish made his debut in the game at Valderrama in 1997, where the team with captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead on the Americans, but eventually passed the finish line with the smallest possible margin: 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead in Valderrama; we had a big lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but just,” said Bjorn, called off here, after seeing the 2018 league win by 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, good for a 10-6 lead at Le Golf National.
So history shows me and everyone else in the team that this is not a played match yet.
Everyone will have to make a full commitment tomorrow.
Get started and execute the plan on the right one.
It's not over until the points are on the board.
We have a goal, and that’s winning this trophy, and we need to keep focusing on that.
I keep saying, I’m focusing on the 12 players we can have, but we’re also aware of the people on the other side, some of the best players in the world.”
Delighted with the performance of his players on a tough golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never anticipate things in this field.
Tomorrow a new challenge awaits.
Tomorrow the individual achievements will be discussed, and that is another very different discipline.
It’s great to be out there with a partner when things go well, but when you’re on your own, your abilities as a golfer are only really tested.
That’s the message you have to tell the players, try to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
So let your partner go now and he must also get the best out of himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Furyk, expects his players to perform individually better than as partners. The exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who won three of the four points.
Furyk himself has experience with both sides of this kind of reversal on the last day, as a member of the winning team in Brookline and as a loser when Europe realized the 'Miracle of Medinah'.
"I remember every damn word of that speech," he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had pissed his players for the last day.
“We have 12 important matches ahead of us tomorrow, but let’s try to get off to a good start, like in Brookline, or like in Medinah.
When we have the momentum, there is a lot of pressure on the matches in the middle.
We’ve tuned our line-up to this and send the men on their way in the order that we think is the best and, you know, we’re going to try to make something out of the high hat tomorrow.”
Thomas is tasked with trying to lead the counter-offensive and deploys Rory McIlroy for the first match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the remaining Europeans in the first half of the battle.
"I chose this group in this order because I think we're so constantly covered," Bjorn said of his selection of singles players.
Germany's new warship delayed again
The latest German navy frigate should have entered service in 2014, replacing the outdated warships from the Cold War era, but it will take at least another year before it is ready, due to malfunctioning systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of the 'Rheinland-Pfalz', the leading ship in the brand new Baden-Württemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quotes a military spokesman.
The vessel should have been part of the Navy in 2014, but the disturbing problems after delivery have plagued the fate of the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ordered by the navy in 2007 will replace the outdated Bremen-class frigates.
As far as we know, they have a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and some form of stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic features.
Other important features are longer maintenance cycles, it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates up to two years in a row, far from home ports.
The continuing delays mean, however, that the advanced warships, which are meant to allow Germany to project its power overseas, are already outdated by the time they are put into service, notes Die Zeit.
The fateful frigate F125 already made headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to put the vessel into operation and sent it back to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy sent a ship back to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons behind this return, but German media cited a number of crucial “software and hardware defects” that would render the warship useless if deployed on a combat mission.
Software defects were especially important because the ships of the Baden-Württemberg-class are operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, half the manpower on the frigates of the older Bremen-class.
It also became clear that the ship suffers from severe overweight, which will reduce performance and limit the ability of the Navy to carry out further upgrades.
The "Rhineland-Palatinate" weighs 7,000 tonnes, which is twice as much as ships of a similar class deployed by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the price tag for the entire project, including the training of the crew, will also become a problem.
It is said that this has reached a dizzying <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion, compared to the original <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems that the newest frigates have in their grip are becoming extra important because of recent warnings that the power of the German navy is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the parliamentary defence commission in Germany, acknowledged that the navy actually "had a shortage of deployable ships."
The official said the problem has grown over time like a snowball, as old ships were taken out of service but no replacement vessels were delivered.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg-class were yet available to be admitted to the navy.
National Trust Listens to the Secret Life of Bats
New research conducted on an estate in the Scottish Highlands seeks to reveal how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
The hope is that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and contribute to future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, follows the ordinary and the small dwarf bat, the brown large-eared bat and the water bat at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment is placed at key locations around the estate to monitor bat activities throughout the season.
Employees of the NTS and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies using handheld detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the bat’s cries and which species does what.
Then a map of the habitat and a report are produced to create a detailed image of their behavior on a landscape scale.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Advisor at the NTS, hopes that the results will show which areas of the habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as creating meadows and how best to maintain the forests for bats and similar species.
Bat populations in Scotland and the rest of the UK have declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development activities that affect sleeping places and the loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lightning can also pose a risk, just like flycatchers and certain chemical treatments of building materials and attacks by domestic cats.
Bats are not blind in reality.
However, their nightly hunting habits make their ears more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching a prey.
They use an advanced echo-location technique to determine the position of insects and obstacles in their flight path.
At the NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, bats are taken very seriously.
The NTS has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct surveys, sleep inspections and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization has even set up the first and only reserve for bats in Scotland at the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of Scotland’s ten species of bats live.
Landscape manager David Thompson says the estate is the ideal territory for bats.
"Here in Threave we have a great environment for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, many very old trees and the right habitat.
But so much is not yet known about bats, and that’s why the work we do here and in other locations will help us better understand what they need to thrive.”
He emphasizes the importance of monitoring bats before maintenance work is carried out, as the potentially unconscious destruction of a sleeping place can lead to the death of 400 female bats and their young, potentially eradicating a complete local population.
Bats are a protected species and it is illegal to kill, harass or disturb them or destroy their sleeping places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish official for the Bat Conservation Trust, has asked the public to contribute to help.
She said, “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and from many of our species, we simply don’t know how their populations are.”
Ronaldo rejects assault charges as his lawyers prepare to prosecute a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo allegations of assault qualified as “fake news” and said people want to “promote themselves” by using his name.
His lawyers are about to sue the German weekly Der Spiegel, in which the allegations have been published.
Portugal and Juventus are accused of assaulting an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is also accused of paying her $375,000 to keep silent about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Via a video for his 142 million followers on Instagram Live, Ronaldo, 33, a few hours after the allegations were reported, called the reports “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they say today, fake news," says the winner of five Golden Balls on camera.
“They want to promote themselves by mentioning my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by mentioning my name, but that's part of the profession.
I am a happy man, and by and by well," the footballer added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a lawsuit in which they want to prosecute Der Spiegel for the allegations they called "an unacceptable report of privacy suspicions," according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz, a lawyer, said the footballer wants compensation for the "moral damage for an amount corresponding to the severity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident allegedly occurred in June 2009 in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the footballer's room, where he allegedly raped her anal, as can be seen in the indictment filed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and that he told her that he was a “good guy” for “99 percent,” but that he is sometimes abandoned that “one percent.”
The documents state that Ronaldo confirms that the couple has had sex, but that this was by mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that pictures were taken of her injuries in a hospital, but that she later agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because she was "fearful of the consequences" and because she was concerned about the "public humiliation."
The 34-year-old now says she wants the scheme declared invalid because she has been permanently traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to move from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged assault and left for Italian giant Juventus this summer in a deal worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Brexit: UK 'will regret it forever' if car manufacturers leave
The UK “will forever regret” losing its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, economic minister Greg Clark said.
He added that it was “worrying” that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, the company would temporarily shut down production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said the impact of delays at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit would cost jobs.
The factory in Burnaston, where the Auris and Avensis are manufactured by Toyota, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other countries in the European Union.
“My vision is that if Britain crashes out of the EU at the end of March, we will see production shut down at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s managing director in Burnaston.
Other car products in the UK, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also expressed their fears about the consequences of leaving the EU without an agreement for the functioning of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW has already announced that it will close the Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
Car manufacturers are most concerned about the risks in the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line runs on the “just-in-time” principle, with parts arriving from suppliers in the UK and the EU every 37 minutes for cars made to order.
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without a deal, there may be unrest at the borders that the industry believes can lead to delays and shortages of parts.
Toyota cannot store more than one day of stock in the Derbyshire factory, the company said, and therefore production would be shut down in that case.
Clark said Theresa May’s Chequers plan for the future relationship with the EU is “exactly tuned to avoid those checks at the border.”
"We need to have a deal. We want to have the best deal, which will not only allow us to continue the current success, but also seize this opportunity," he told the listeners of BBC Radio 4's Today program.
“The evidence, not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers, is that we absolutely need to be able to continue with this very successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota could not say how long production would be shut down, but warned in the longer term that the additional costs would affect the company’s competitiveness and that this would eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years, and who is a representative for the Unite trade union at the factory, said that its members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, once these jobs have been lost, they will never come back.
A government spokesperson said: “We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump and Rosenstein meeting could be delayed again, White House says
The crucial meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “one more week postponed” as the fight over Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who is investigating the Russian influence on the elections, links between Trump’s assistants and Russia, and possible obstruction of the president’s justice system.
The question of whether Trump will fire the Deputy Attorney General and thereby jeopardize Mueller’s independence has been running the Washington gossip machine for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and depose the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But when he went to the White House last Monday, rumors circulated that he was about to file his resignation.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he "preferred not to fire Rosenstein," but then the meeting was moved to avoid a conflict with a Senate Justice Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, would both testify.
On Friday, Trump gave the FBI orders to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, delaying the vote in the entire Senate once again.
On Sunday, Sarah Sanders, Trump’s press chief, appeared on Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “There is no date yet, it could be this week, but it could also be postponed for another week, given all the other things that are going on with the Supreme Court.
But we will see and I always want to keep the press informed.”
Some reporters had trouble with this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
The host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said the scarcity of press conferences was not caused by an aversion to the “attention-grabbing” TV journalists, though, she added: “I will not deny that they are trying to attract attention.”
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
“The president does more question-and-answer sessions than any president before him,” she said, without providing evidence, “we looked at the numbers.”
Press conferences will still take place, Sanders said, but “if the press has a chance to ask the President of the United States questions directly, that’s infinitely better than talking to me.
“We’re trying to do that a lot and you’ve seen us do that a lot over the past few weeks and that will take the place of a press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States.”
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public sessions or at press conferences with dignitaries who are visiting.
Press conferences with only the president are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why, he made a frank and at times bizarre appearance to the assembled reporters.
Health Minister writes a letter on Brexit to NHS Scotland employees from other EU countries
The Minister of Health has written a letter to the EU staff working at the NHS Scotland to express the country’s gratitude and wish for them to continue working at the NHS after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter with less than six months to go before the UK withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish government has already expressed its willingness to bear the costs of applying for a permanent status for EU citizens working for decentralised public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU have continued, and this autumn the expected decisions will be made.
But at the same time, the UK government has also stepped up preparations for a possible scenario in which no deal is reached.
I know these are uncertain times for all of you.
That is why I would like to stress once again how much I appreciate the contribution of all staff, irrespective of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the NHS and bring benefits to the patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering head injuries
The Tennessee State Tigers linebacker, Christion Abercrombie, underwent emergency surgery yesterday after inflicting a head injury in the 31-27 losing match against the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessean's Mike Organ reported.
Rod Reed, the head coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the accident occurred shortly before rest.
"He came to the sideline and more or less collapsed there," Reed said.
The trainers and medical staff immediately gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline, before putting him on a stretcher and taking him with them for further investigation.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come out of the operating room at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "no details are yet known about the type/size of the injury" and that Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt sophomore, is in his first season at Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
He tackled a total of five times on Saturday before leaving the field, making him tackle a total of 18 times this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher fees when buying a home in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher levies when buying a home in the UK and the proceeds will be used to help the homeless according to new Conservatives plans
This action will have to neutralize Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters
The increase in the tax is levied on persons who do not pay tax in the UK
The Treasury Department expects this to raise <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year, to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher fees when buying a home in the UK and the extra proceeds will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn’s success that attracts young voters with promises to provide more affordable homes and recount this to many earners.
The increase in the levy is levied on individuals and firms that do not pay taxes in the UK, with the additional proceeds being put in an effort by the government to fight homelessness.
The surcharge, which comes on top of the current levy, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second homes and homes purchased for rental, could go up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year in this way.
An estimated 13 percent of London’s new buildings are purchased by people who do not live in the UK, which drives prices up and makes it difficult for starters to get a foot on the home ladder.
Many affluent areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become practically “ghost cities” because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson pleaded for a reduction in the fees to help young people buy their first home.
He accused major construction firms of upholding prices by buying up land and not using it, and he called on May to abolish quotas on affordable homes in order to restore Britain’s “housing disgrace.”
Corbyn has announced a striking set of housing reforms, including rental ceilings and an end to expulsion “without negligence.”
He also wants to give local governments more opportunities to build new homes.
"Last year, I said I wanted to spend my time as Prime Minister on restoring the British Dream, that life is getting better for every new generation.
And that means that our faulty housing market needs to be repaired.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it may not be that it is as easy for non-UK residents, and for foreign companies, to buy homes here as it is for hard-working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of once owning a house has become too vague a dream and the humiliation of living without a roof over the head is all too real.
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to manage Scotland'
Jack Ross, the boss of Sunderland, says his ultimate ambition is to become a manager of Scotland.
The Scotsman, 42, enjoys the challenge of reviving the club from the northeast of England, which is currently in third place in League One, at three points of first place.
He went to the Stadium of Light last summer after returning St Mirren to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“As a footballer, I wanted to play for my country.
But I was selected for the B-team and that's the end of the stockings," Ross told Sportsound on BBC Scotland.
“When I was a kid, I saw Scotland play in Hampden Park with my father and it’s something that keeps attracting me.
But that would only come if I succeeded in managing a club.”
The predecessors of Ross as managers of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic boss says he was not intimidated to become the successor to these established names at a large club, having previously refused advances from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Success for me at this moment is measured by 'can I let this club return to the Premier League?'
Because of the structure and facilities of this club, it should undoubtedly be in the Premier League," he said.
"It is not an easy task to achieve this, but I can only see myself as successful when I bring the club back there."
Ross is only three years into his career as a manager, after a period as an assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months in the coaching group of Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from third division degradation and transformed St Mirren from on the verge of degradation to winning the Championship in the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his career as a footballer at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably really a crossroads," he recalled from the moment he took over the lead at Alloa.
“I really believed that the management was the right choice for me, much more than playing.
It sounds weird, because I did pretty well, I earned pretty well and had some reasonable highlights.
But playing football can be tough.
There are many things you are confronted with every week.
I still have that, given the stress and pressure of the profession, but management just feels good.
I’ve always wanted to be a manager, and now that I’m real, I’m as good in my skin as I’ve ever felt in my adult life.”

The perfect time for a pint is 17:30 on a Saturday, research reveals
The heatwave in the summer has increased the revenue of British pubs struggling to survive, but has also put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Groups with pubs and bars saw revenue increase by 2.7 percent in July, but revenue in restaurants was 4.8 percent less, the figures show.
Peter Martin, of the business consultancy CGA, who collected the figures, said: “Continuing sunshine and the fact that England participated in the World Championships longer than expected meant that July showed a similar pattern as June, when pubs had 2.8% more turnover, with the difference that restaurants were now hit even harder.
The 1.8% drop in restaurant turnover in June only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars focused on liquor sales performed by far the best, with better LFL growth (like-for-like) than restaurants down.
Pubs that are also focused on selling food also suffer from the sun, but not as dramatic as the restaurants.
Looks like people just went out to drink.
In pubs and bars under management, beverage sales were 6.6 percent higher for the month, while food sales were 3 percent lower."
Paul Newman, RSM’s leisure and hospitality analyst, said: “These results continue the trend we’ve been seeing since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of important social or sporting events remain the biggest factors for turnover in the entertainment market.
It is therefore no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a 4.8 percent year-on-year turnover drop is particularly painful given the ongoing cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the operators who focus on food and only time will learn whether the more temperate temperatures of August can give the so necessary respite."
Total revenue growth in the pub and restaurant industry, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the decline in the introduction of new brands.
In the Coffer Peach Tracker, the UK’s pub, bar and restaurant revenue monitor, performance data is collected and analyzed from 47 operating groups, with a combined revenue of <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion. This is the industry’s established benchmark.
One in Five Kids Has a Secret Social Media Account That They Keep Hidden From Their Parents
One in five children, some not older than 11 years, has a secret social media account, which they keep hidden from parents and teachers, reveals a survey
A survey of 20,000 high school pupils revealed growth in ‘fake Insta pages’
This news has intensified the fear that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of students say they have a "main account" that they also show their parents
One in five children, some not older than 11 years, create social media accounts that they keep hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school pupils revealed rapid growth in the “false Insta accounts,” a reference to Instagram, the photo sharing site.
This news has intensified the fear that sexual content will be posted.
Twenty percent of students say they use a clean “main account” that they show to their parents, while still having personal accounts.
A mother who accidentally ended up on the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter discovered there a teenager who asked others to "rape" her.
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and HMC (Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds had two profiles and half admitted to holding personal accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HCM, said: “It’s disturbing that so many teenagers are lured to create online spaces where they’re not found by their parents and teachers.”
Eilidh Doyle to be the 'voice of the athlete' in the Scottish Council for Athletics
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of the Scottish athletics world, as non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the board.
Doyle is the most decorated athlete in Scotland on the track and in the field and chairman Ian Beattie described her election as a great opportunity for the drivers of the sport to learn from her extensive experience at an international level over the past decade.
"Eilidh enjoys great respect in the athletics community of Scotland, the UK and the world and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit tremendously from its election to the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am happy to be able to serve as a voice for the athletes and I hope that I can contribute and help govern the sport in Scotland."
The American who won the 200 metres and the 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, two of his four gold Olympic medals, and who now regularly comments on the BBC, could no longer walk after a TIA.
He wrote on Twitter: “Today a month ago I had a TIA.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors told me that only time will tell if I will recover and to what extent.
It has been terribly hard work, but I have now fully recovered, I have learned to walk again and I am doing my flexibility exercises again today!
Thank you for all your support!”
Advertisement for breast pump comparing mothers to cows divides online opinion
A company that makes breast pumps has split the online opinion with an ad comparing breastfeeding mothers to cows being milked.
To mark the introduction of what is called “the most silent portable breast pump in the world,” consumer technology producer Elvie has released an ironic music-video-inspired ad to illustrate the freedom this new pump has to offer to pumping mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a hay-filled shed on a song that contains lyrics like, “Yes, I milk myself, but you can’t see anything of it” and “In case you didn’t notice, these aren’t udders, these are my breasts.”
The chorus then continues with: 'Pumps, pumps, pumps, I feed the babies, pumps, pumps, pumps, I milk the ladies'.
However, the ad, which was published on the company’s Facebook page, immediately caused an online controversy.
The video has been viewed 77,000 times and has provoked hundreds of comments, mostly mixed responses from viewers, in which many people say it approves of the dairy industry's "horror".
"It's a bad choice to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to become pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but in their case the babies are taken away within a few days of giving birth.”
Elvie's breast pump fits discreetly in a nursing bra (Elvie/Mother).
Someone else commented, “This is of course traumatic for mother and baby.
But yes, why don’t we use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?”
Another added, “This ad is so far from reality.”
Others defended the ad and a woman admitted that she found the song "hilarious."
“I think this is a brilliant idea.
I would buy one if I was still breastfeeding.
That pumping made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little weird, but I haven't been searching too much for it.
“This is a great product,” someone wrote.
Someone else had the following comment: "This is a funny ad, aimed at moms who pump (often in the workplace or in a toilet) and then feel like they're just 'cows'.
This advertisement is not at all positive or negative about the dairy industry."
At the end of the video you can see the group of women all dancing with the pump discreetly hidden in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who pump sometimes feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no wires or hoses and fits discreetly into a nursing bra, so women have the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go out while they are on pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother says: “The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a tough and provocative introduction.
By making a comparison between pumping mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight the pumping and the associated challenges and at the same time show in an entertaining and understandable way how the new pump will create an incredible sense of freedom.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has hit the front page.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on Marta Jakubowski’s catwalk while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children tacitly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has reached a peak, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because the harsh rhetoric and harsh policies introduced by the Trump administration make it harder to accommodate children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves are undocumented immigrants and are afraid to jeopardize their own chance of staying in the country by signing up for a child.
That risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and the other adult members of their household would have to give their fingerprints and that this data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, stated in a testimony before Congress that his organization has arrested dozens of people who have signed up as sponsors for unaccompanied minors.
The organization later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested had no prior criminal record.
Almost 80 percent of those who are sponsors or relatives of the sponsors are illegal in this country and a large proportion of them are criminal aliens.
We're prosecuting these people," Mr. Albence said.
In an attempt to process the children faster, officials have introduced new rules, requiring some of them to appear in court within one month of the start of the detention, rather than within 60 days, which was rather the standard, according to the staff at the shelter.
Many of them will stand in court through a video conference, rather than in person, to advocate their application for legal status for an immigration judge.
Those who are deemed not eligible for aid will be deported quickly.
The longer the children remain in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can give rise to violent outbursts or escape attempts, according to the staff at the shelter and according to reports that have come out of the system in recent months.
Lawyers said these concerns are stronger at a larger facility, such as Tornillo, where the signs that a child is struggling are more often ignored, due to the size of the camp.
They added that moving the children to the tent camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can contribute to the trauma that many of them are already struggling with.
Syria orders US, France and Turkey 'occupying powers' to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Muallem also called on Syrian refugees to return, even now that the war in the country is in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said foreign troops are illegally on Syrian soil, under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that "this will be handled accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told the Assembly.
According to Moualem, the “war on terror” is almost over in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been uprooted and expelled from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue “this sacred battle until we have freed all Syrian territories” from terrorist groups and from any “illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly engaged in training and advising the Kurdish forces and the Syrian Arabs fighting President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
Regarding the refugees, Moualem said the conditions are favorable for their return and he blamed “some Western countries for spreading irrational fears” leaving most refugees away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate this return," he said.
“They are politicizing a case that should only be a humanitarian problem.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid for Syria will be available until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
United Nations diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major stronghold of the rebels, has created an opportunity to start political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey has averted a large-scale attack from Russia-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
Moualem stressed, however, that this agreement has “clear deadlines” and said he hoped the military action will target jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who “will be eradicated.”
Staffan de Mistura, the UN delegate, hopes to soon convene the first meeting of a new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem clarified the terms of the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be limited to "revising the articles of the current constitution," and he warned against outside interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump would win the 2020 election unless, as many “liberal” viewers probably hope, his presidency is terminated prematurely by a dismissal procedure and scandals.
In what would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic final of a presidency ever.”
At the moment, however, there are no signs of viewing fatigue.
Since 2014, prime-time viewing rates on CNN have more than doubled to 1.05 million and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during prime-time, compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, and MSNBC’s ‘The Rachel Maddow Show’ is at the top of the ratings for cable shows with 3.5 million viewers on evenings with important news.
"This is a fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, the man behind the ABC drama 'Designated Survivor', a series about a minister who becomes president after an attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an experienced writer of comedy and author of 'Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club' has a different theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston for the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh,'" Scovell told me.
There's entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the storylines coming from Washington can influence the future of Roe v. Wade or determine whether immigrant families can reunite or affect the status of the global economy.
Turning off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond wanting to be a well-informed citizen, when you notice that you’ve been watching a panel of experts for six hours discussing the use of sources from the ‘deep background’ by Bob Woodward in his book ‘Fear’, which talks about the jacket of peacock leather by Paul Manafort that has cost $15,000 by discussing the Storm and the Clothes full of overconfidity by The Washington, according to The Post.
I will never be able to watch Super Mario the same way again.
“What he’s doing to give you the idea that it’s a reality show is partly that he’s putting something new on you every night,” said Brent Montgomery, Wheelhouse Entertainment’s CEO and creator of ‘Pawn Stars’, about the rotating cast of the Trump show and the daily plot changes (coming into a fight with the NFL, praising Kim Jong-un).
You can’t afford to miss an episode or you feel like you’re lagging behind.
When I reached Fleiss earlier this week, it was sunny and 26 degrees outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he was sitting inside watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn’t pull himself off the screen, with Brett Kavanaugh appearing before the Senate Justice Commission and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
"I remember doing all those weird shows not so long ago, and people saying 'this is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but now it turns out they were right."

Outside money flows into the most exciting midterm elections for the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania is seeing an influx of money, thanks to a rearrangement of an electoral district that will force two sitting representatives to compete for the same seat.
The recently reclassified Pittsburg district is hit by Democratic MP Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb must face another sitting MP, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which has a lot of overlap with the new 17th district.
The maps were reclassified after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally classified ("gerrymandering") in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has led to a controversy in the field of campaign funding between the financial arms of the two major parties, the DCCC (Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee) and the NRCC (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in a well-considered special election for the 18th constituency of Pennsylvania.
This seat has been occupied by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump had conquered this district by 20 percentage points of difference.
According to political experts, the Democrats have a small advantage.
The U.S. considered punishing El Salvador for support to China and have renounced it
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing and received little negative response from Washington.
Trump had a cordial meeting with Panama’s President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and he owned a hotel in Panama until his partners kicked out the management team of the Trump Organization.
U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs officials have decided to recall U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the "recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the ministry's spokeswoman, in a statement earlier this month.
But penalties were only considered in the case of El Salvador, as the country received $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, for control of narcotics, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, including reductions in financial support and targeted visa restrictions, would have become painful for the Central American country with high unemployment and high homicide rates.
As the internal meetings continued, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference that would focus on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from leaving for the United States.
But in mid-September, some top government officials announced that they wanted the conference to continue, making all possible punitive measures against El Salvador impossible in advance.
The plan is now for Vice President Mike Pence to deliver a speech at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the government’s importance to the meeting, diplomats say.
And the three U.S. envoys have returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further fuss, without harsh messages about Washington’s punitive measures.
A White House spokesperson on behalf of Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who have agreed to discuss the internal discussion on condition of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst who is also close to the government and who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Study the history
The next step could be the report by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller on Trump’s possible opposition to the judiciary, for which heavy evidence has now become public.
Mueller is also likely to focus his research on collusion between Trump’s campaign and Russia in an attack by Russia on our elections.
If Congress changes color, Trump must answer to that institute, just as he prepares to turn to the voters again, and perhaps he must answer to a jury in a court of law.
That’s a lot, and I don’t want to suggest that Trump’s fall is inevitable, nor that of his equivalents in Europe.
There will have to be choices made by all of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, who will determine how long the battle will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a coup d'état against Hitler, but only if the West had resisted and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and therefore missed an opportunity to prevent the years of bloodshed that followed.
The course of history revolves around such bending points, and the inexorable advance of democracy is thereby accelerated or delayed.
Americans are currently facing several of these types of bending points.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man in charge of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since the moment this paper reported that he, last year, had suggested recording talks with the president in secret and that he had speculated on the president’s suitability for his office.
Rosenstein says the Times report is wrong.
“How will we react if the FBI’s newly requested investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or unfair, or if he is appointed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of assault and an unfair testimony?
And above all, are we going to vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail in these tests, democracy awaits a very long winter.
But I believe we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador’s home.
She survived, immigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me away to light candles for the Sabbath on the table depicting a swastika.
With that as my legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

Graham Dorrans of Glasgow Rangers is optimistic about the match against Rapid Wien
Rangers will visit Rapid Wien on Thursday and know that a victory over the Austrians, after the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, puts them in a strong position to qualify in Group G of the Europa League.
Due to a knee injury, midfielder Graham Dorrans was unable to play his first game of the season until the 2-2 draw at Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a springboard to better results.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal really has a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game with the idea that there was something to win and came out with a point.
Maybe we could have even won at the end, but looking at the whole game, a straight game is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half but when we came out in the second half we were the better team.
Next Thursday is a new big European evening.
Hopefully we can score three points, but it will be a tough game because they also had a good result in their last game. But if the public gets behind us, I'm sure we can push through and get a positive result.
Last year has certainly been tough, of everything that happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there is a feel-good factor on the club.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy it. The training is good.
Hopefully, we can continue now, leave the last season behind and be successful again.”

Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they would like to receive care, few people discuss this with their family members.
Approximately half of the participants in the Nationwide survey said they were talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
And only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about this.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take the steps necessary to have this conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
This is where we start.
Talk to your spouse and the children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care if you do not express your wishes well in time.
Collaborate with your advisor and your family to discuss where and how you will receive care, as these choices can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Take a financial advisor in your arm: Your advisor can also give you advice on how to pay for these expenses.
Your financing choices for long-term care can include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help cover these expenses, or using equity as insurance, as long as you have money.
Prepare your legal documents: Avoid legal battles when insurance needs to be used.
Provide a health care proxy so that you can appoint a trusted person who can oversee your medical care and ensure that the professionals comply with your needs in case you can no longer communicate.
Also consider a power of attorney for your financial affairs.
In that case, you select a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure that the invoices are paid if you can no longer do it yourself.
Remember the small details: Imagine your elderly father or mother is hitting a medical emergency and heading to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Capture these details in a written plan so that you have the information at hand.
"It's not just the financial matters that matter, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What medications are used?
Who will take care of the dog?
Make sure that plan comes to pass.”

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise further.
Because the communication devices have been disabled, official agencies have not yet received any information from the Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the 7.5 magnitude epicentre of the earthquake on the Richter scale.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster took place.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of Central Celebes Province and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Celebes, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regency that extends over 300 km along the coast of northwest Celebes.
The regency, an administrative region just below a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main activities in the economy of the Central Celebes province, particularly in the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but they are mostly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have been regularly hit by tsunamis over the past 100 years, according to the Agency for Combating Disasters of Indonesia.
In 1938, a tsunami claimed more than 200 lives and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck west of Donggala in 1996, with nine deaths.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is often hit by earthquakes.
Here is a list of some of the most severe earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh on north Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries and claimed a total of 226,000 lives along the coasts of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of major earthquakes took place on the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake on the Richter scale occurred south of Java, Indonesia’s most densely populated island, causing a tsunami that struck the southern coast and claimed nearly 700 lives.
2009: An earthquake of magnitude 7.6 on the Richter scale struck the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake of 7.5 on the Richter scale struck one of the Mentawai Islands off the coast of Sumatra, causing a tsunami of more than 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and claimed around 300 human lives.
2016: A shallow earthquake hit the regency of Pidie in Aceh and caused destruction and panic as people were reminded of the devastation of the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people were killed by falling buildings.
2018: Several earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused thousands of tourists to be stranded temporarily.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of Sarah Palin, the former governor of Alaska and candidate for vice president, has been arrested on charges of domestic violence.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference in a report of domestic violence, and providing opposition during the arrest, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a female celebrity tried to call the police to report the alleged offences, he took the phone from her.
Palin is being held in custody in the Mat-Su custody house with a $500 bail, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday and declared himself "innocent, sure" when asked, the network reported.
Palin is charged with three Class A offenses, which means he can be sentenced to one year in prison and to a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B offence, which is punishable with a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with criminal offences.
In December 2017, he was accused of abusing his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, then called the police to report the alleged abuse.
This case now serves the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic abuse, interference in a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon under the influence in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he had hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by a veteran group in 2016 after linking her son’s violent behavior to PTSD, which he allegedly retained during his service in Iraq.
Indonesia, earthquake, tsunami: hundreds dead
At least 384 have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale has caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been shut down while the death toll is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake took place just next to the center of Celebes, which is located northeast of Jakarta, the Indonesian capital.
There are videos circulating on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand a rare death penalty for suspect of terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York are demanding the death penalty for Sajfoello Sajpov, the suspect of the terror attack in New York City, killing eight people, a rare sentence that has not been executed in this state since 1953.
According to the indictment, Sappov, 30, used a rented truck from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a cycle path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, overturning pedestrians and cyclists who came in his way, in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will need to prove that Sappov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily injuries, according to the declaration of intent demanding the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
For both charges, the death penalty is possible, according to the document submitted to the court.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury approved the indictment with 22 charges, including eight counts of murder on behalf of a racket, typically a charge used by federal prosecutors against organized crime, and a charge of violentity and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “substantial planning and preparation,” according to the prosecutors, and they described the way Sappov carried out the attack as “horrible, cruel and depraved.”
"Sajfoello Habiboellajevich Sapjov has caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco."
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been more than a decade since a case in the Southern District of New York occurred that demanded the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers but was ultimately sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was enforced in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were executed after being convicted two years earlier for espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were both executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Zaypov, a native of Uzbekistan, did not show remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to the court documents.
He let the detectives know he felt good about his deed, they the police.
Sajpov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching videos of ISIS on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to hang the flag of ISIS in his room in the hospital, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Sappov, said he was “naturally disappointed” with the prosecutors’ decision.
"We think that the decision to demand the death penalty instead of accepting a confession of guilt in exchange for a life imprisonment without possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved," Patton said.
Zaypov’s defense had previously asked the prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Conservative MP says NIGEL FARAGE should lead Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage pledged to mobilize a "people's army" during a protest at the Conservative Party conference.
The former Ukip leader said the politicians should “feel the heat” of the Euroskeptics, while one of Theresa May’s own MPs proposed that he be in charge of the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told participants in the Birmingham march that the UK “would have already been out” if Mr Farage had been Brexit minister.
But the challenge facing May in reconciling the heavily divided ranks is underlined by two conservatives who are pro-Remain and are participating in a separate protest meeting against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to keep her Chequers compromise on the road as it is attacked by Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Proponents insisted that she will continue and will try to make a deal with Brussels despite the setbacks, forcing Euroskeptics and Labour to choose between her package and "chaos."
Bone said at a meeting of Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he "will throw Chequers in the trash."
He suggested that Farage should be knighted and be given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he quit the service, we'd be out now," Bone said.
Wellingborough MP added: “I will support Brexit, but we must throw Chequers into the trash.”
To clarify his opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in two world wars to be subordinate.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 referendum: “The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely untrue.”
The conservative Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the march and told reporters: "I just say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition does not vote for it, it is unpopular within our party and among our activists who go door-to-door and make sure we are elected.
Drop Chequers and listen."
In a targeted message for May, she added: “Premiers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Farage told the meeting that politicians should “feel the heat” if they want to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
“This is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to tell them ‘we won’t let you get away with this.’”
In a message to the enthusiastic masses, he added: “I want you to fire our political class, which is about to betray Brexit.
“We are mobilizing the people’s army of this country that has given us victory in the Brexit referendum and we will never rest until we have become an independent, sovereign, proud United Kingdom again.”
In the meantime, Remainers marched through Birmingham and concluded this march with a two-hour meeting in the city center.
A small group of activists waved flags on which Tories stood against Brexit, after the founding of this group over the weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of the House of Lords for Labour, made jokes about the security issues of a Conservative party app at the start of their conference.
“These are the people who tell us that they can provide IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus plus, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
It is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to “go on thinking” about candidacy for president
Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will “think about her candidacy for the presidency” after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Democrat from Massachusetts told about her future at a meeting at a town hall in west Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, wants to be re-elected in November against Geoff Diehl, Republican MP who was co-chairman of Trum’s 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She has been at the center of speculation that she might face Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in a town hall since Trump came to power.
One attendee asked her if she would run for the presidency.
Warren responded that it’s time for women to go to Washington to repair our faulty government and that includes a woman at the top.”
Arrest after shooting Wayde Sims from LSU
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said Saturday that a suspect was arrested after shooting Wayde Sims, LSU basketball player, on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at an ET press conference at 11:00 a.m.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help in identifying the man shown in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims got a gunshot wound in the head and died of the consequences," police commander Murphy J. Paul told the press on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde stepped forward to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson has been questioned and confessed to being present at the crime scene, possessing a firearm and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson has been arrested without further incidents and is being held in custody in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims was a junior player of 1.98 meters who grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 matches and started in 10 matches last season. He had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per match.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after Sebastian Vettel left him the victory after orders from team
When Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that team orders from Mercedes would play a role in the race.
Bottas had a good start from pole position and left Hamilton almost completely in the cold when he defended his position and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went into the pits and let Hamilton ride in the crowd in the tail of the group, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes entered the pits one lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came back on the head after a wheel-on-wheel action that forced the Ferrari driver to reluctantly release space on the inside after a double move in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from last place and was seventh after the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led the race for a while, because he stayed with his band choice and aimed for a fast finish so that he could overtake Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
In the end, he went to the pits in the 44th lap, after he could not increase his speed in the remaining eight laps, so Raikkonen finished fourth.
It's a tough day because Valtteri did his best all weekend, he was a real gentleman, and he let me pass.
The team has done its best for places one and two," Hamilton said.
That was not a good body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at an election meeting on Saturday over her persistence in not being the source of Christine Blasey Ford’s leaked letter, in which Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh was accused of assault.
Speaking at an election meeting in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly about the testimony given by Ford before the Senate Justice Commission, but instead said that what was taking place in the Senate showed that people can be "short, unkind, and untrue."
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful display that is taking place in the Senate in the last few days, when you see the anger, when you are the people who are angry and mean and mean and unkind and untrue," he said.
"When you look at the press releases and the leaks and they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Do you remember her answer... you leaked the document - 'oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, no, no.
I didn't leak."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we leak... No, we didn't leak," he added, in an imitation of the senator.
In July, the letter mentioning Kavanaugh's allegations was sent to Feinstein by Ford and it was leaked in September, but Feinstein has denied that her agency was the leak.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't leak her story," Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to deal with it confidentially and I handled it confidentially, as she had asked."
But the president turned out to not believe her denial and he commented at the meeting on Saturday night: “I’ll tell you something, that wasn’t good body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but that was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing with his defense of the Supreme Court candidate, accused by three women of sexual misconduct, the president suggested that the Democrats used the accusations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take back power by all means necessary.
You see the meanness, the innocence, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to drive to seize power and regain control,” the president said according to a report by Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars vs Belfast Giants: 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars have made up for Friday's loss in the Elite League against Belfast Giants by winning the return match by 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants took the lead with two goals by scores from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team along before Dwyer brought the Giants back to the lead.
Francois Bouchard made the tie for Dundee, before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the win with two goals.
It was the third loss in the Elite League this season for Adam Keefe's men, who had to make up for a lag on Friday night to then defeat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast.
It was the fourth time this season that the two teams met, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 on an assist from Kendall McFaull. David Rutherford gave the assist with which Beauvillier doubled the lead, four minutes later.
In a busy opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back into play at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt gave the lead to Cownie's equaliser at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants entered the first rest with a lead, when he made his second goal of the evening at the end of the first period.
The home team repackaged and Bouchard brought them back to a level with a power-play goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran then combined well to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game, late in the second period. He ensured victory with the fifth goal for his team, halfway in the last period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of the last five games, will play at home against Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies while allowing hundreds to escape the earthquake in an airplane
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is honored as a hero after he died for making sure that an airplane with hundreds of people on board could take off safely.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are still missing after a severe earthquake hit the island of Celebes on Friday; an earthquake that subsequently caused a tsunami.
Powerful aftershocks still plague the area and many are buried beneath the point in the city of Palu.
Despite the fact that his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wildly moving traffic tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He stayed to ensure that flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was then ready on the runway, could take off safely.
Then he jumped out of the traffic tower when he thought it was on the verge of collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News reported from Australia.
We had arranged a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning, before the helicopter had reached Palu.
“It breaks your heart when you hear that,” he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the death toll may rise to a thousand, and the country’s disaster response agency said that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is assumed that the death toll is still rising because many bodies were under the rubble and have not yet been reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves that reached a height of six meters have destroyed Palu, where a massive funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute bodies are brought in by ambulances.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-markets are being looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is engaged in a race to help survivors, but we don’t know what they will find.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the military present: “I call on all of you to work day and night so that all the tasks necessary for the evacuation are completed.
Are you ready?” reported CNN.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok earlier this year, killing more than 550 people.
Aircraft crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says one man is missing after a crash in the lagoon
The airline that operated the flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says one more man is missing, after they had previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew had safely left the sinked plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that one male passenger was missing on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said they were working with local authorities, hospitals and detectives to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to the requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the waters during the landing at the Chuuk Islands airport.
The authorities announced Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and that everyone’s condition was stable.
What caused the crash and the exact sequence of events remains unclear for the time being.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both say the plane landed in the lagoon and missed the runway.
Some witnesses believe the plane was shot over the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane was approaching the airport very low.
"That's good news," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and a few others managed to wade through the water that came to their waist to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also said that the stewardesses were panicking and screaming and that he had a non-serious head wound.
The U.S. Navy announced that sailors who were working nearby on a shipyard also helped with the rescue work by taking people to the coast by an inflatable boat, before the plane sank further into the about 30 meters deep water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that over the past 20 years, 111 people have been killed in crashes of airlines registered with the PNG, but none of which relates to Air Niugini.
Analyst captures the timeline of the night on which a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor closed off his prop on Friday in the reopening trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for a few hours as a witness expert in the field of information analysis.
He made it clear to the jury how he had used cell phone call records to record the movements of 29-year-old suspect, Quinton Tellis, and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
Rowlett said he had received location data from several cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the night of her death, which contradicted his earlier claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers during the time he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police began talking to Sanford again.
Sanford stood in the witness's bench on Saturday and said he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked Tellis if he was telling the truth when he said he was at Sanford in his truck that night, Sanford said he was "menting because my truck was in Nashville at the time."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis had told him that he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The cell phone records indicated that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said Tellis deleted the text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone some time after Chambers' death.
"He wiped her out of his life," Hale said.
The defense starts Sunday with the final arguments.
The judge said he expects the jury to begin deliberations later that day.
The High Breed: What is 'conscious hiphop'?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol argue that hip hop is alienated from its origins with political opinions and addressing social problems.
They want to return to the roots and make 'conscious hip hop' popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently had a revival in Britain by artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
A New York-based nanny takes a couple to court for a 'racist' text
A New York-based nanny is suing a couple for dismissal for discriminatory reasons after receiving a misspelled text in which the mother complained about "another such a black man."
The couple denies being racist and calls the case “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, showed her apprehension when she discovered that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, turned out to be a black woman when she met her on her first working day in 2016.
“No more black,” Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post, the "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice when she realized her mistake, stating that her previous nanny, who was African-American, had done a bad job, and that she was therefore expecting a Filipino.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for a working day and was then sent home by taxi.
Now Maurice is suing the couple in court to get a $350,-- a day compensation for the 6 months for which she was hired to work internally with the family, though without a contract.
“I want them to feel like you’re just not doing something like that,” Maurice told the New York Post last Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple bit off with regard to the claim that she is racist by saying that it was reasonable to fire Maurice after they, by insulting her, were afraid that they could no longer trust her.
"My wife sent her a message that she didn't want to send her.
She's not a racist.
"We are not racists," Joel Plasco told the New York Post.
But would you leave your children to someone who insulted you, even if it was by accident?
Your newborn baby?
Shut up, please."
Comparing the lawsuit to “extortion,” Plasco said his wife was expecting a baby in two months and was “in a very difficult situation.”
Are you going to prosecute someone like that?
That's not so sympathetic," the investment banker added.
While the lawsuit is still ongoing, public opinion is quick to capitulate the couple on social media, where they are accused of their behavior and reasoning.
Paddington publishers feared that the public would not have much interest in a talking bear, reveals newly emerging letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the authorization of the book, said of the letter: "It is difficult to be in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time, even before the first publication.
With what we now know about Paddington’s huge success, it’s very entertaining.”
She told her father, who, before being inspired to write the children's book about a little toy bear, worked as a cameraman at the British BBC, was optimistic about whether his book would be disapproved, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication felt "bitter sweet" after his death last year.
About Paddington, who she describes as "a very prominent member of the family," she said her father was secretly proud of the ultimate success.
She said, "He was a quiet, humble man."
But because Paddington was so lifelike to him, it almost looked like a child's accomplishment; you're proud when you didn't do anything for it yourself.
I think he was pretty much experiencing Paddington's success.
Although Paddington was the creation of his own imagination, he honored the bear himself for its success.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone
Immediately after landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad had called several times to say that it looked very bad and that it was expected that she would not make it," Mrs Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then Nad’s phone call came to say that she would die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
We'll be back soon.
Then I'll be with you again.
The medications the doctors gave her to keep her heart pumping slowly went out and left her body.
She had died some time before, and this process turned everything off further.
I could only sit there, knowing what was going on.
I couldn’t cry, cry or cry, because I was in the middle of all kinds of people and families.
I really had to keep myself tall.”
Eventually, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the death of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, who had no idea what trial she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
I sat down with my head down and the tears kept coming.
It’s hard to explain, but during the flight I got an overwhelming sense of sympathy for Nad.
I felt that he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Grieving women paste messages on bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who have lost loved ones by suicide are making a strong effort to stop others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys paste inspiring messages and phone numbers that can call people in need for help on a bridge in Wales
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he first became depressed and he committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I feel every day,” she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45 years old and living in Lydney in Gloucestershire, England, tells us that her son was a promising chef with a contagious grin.
“He was known for his smile.
It was always said that his smile illuminated every room.
But he stopped working before his death because he was deep in the pit.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found him after he took his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that a chain reaction is coming."
Mrs. Davis made the cards; 'to let people know that there are others you can go to and talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don’t be silent – talk about it.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark, who was her partner for 15 years, not long after his mother died.
“He didn’t say he was feeling sad or depressed or something like that,” she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was completely on the ground on Christmas Day – when the kids unpacked their presents, he didn’t look at them at all or anything.”
She said his death was a big trauma for them, but that they had to cope with it: “It’s ripping the whole family apart.
It separates us.
But we all have to keep going and keep fighting.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future uncertain as FBI investigation begins
"I thought that if we could indeed get what he is asking for, an investigation limited in time and scope, we might be able to create some more unity," Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee was falling apart amid a firmly anchored stalemate within the party.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance has everything to do with timing.
The midterm elections are already in five weeks, on November 6, and if, as expected, the Republicans are doing badly, their attempts to get their husband elected to the highest court in the country will be seriously hampered.
George W. Bush has already called members of the U.S. Senate to lobby for Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, and thus got to know his wife Ashley, who was the Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI has the report ready?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently seats 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can count on at least 50 votes in the Senate, and that would give Mike Pence, vice president, the opportunity to cast the decisive vote to confirm Kavanaugh’s appointment to the Supreme Court.
The number of survivors in North Korea 'down' under Kim
According to a South Korean legislature, the number of North Korean surrogates to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, which quotes data from the South Korean Ministry of Unification, states that there were 1,127 survivors last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park notes that tighter border controls between North Korea and China, and higher penalties for human traffickers are the main factors for the decline.
Pyongyang has not responded in public.
The vast majority of survivors from North Korea are eventually offered the South Korean nationality.
According to sources in Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled via China, which has the longest outer border with North Korea and where you can make the crossing more easily than in the heavily secured Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers the surrogates as illegal migrants rather than as refugees and often expels them by force.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still formally at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang, talking mainly about the stagnation of negotiations on denuclearization.
This meeting took place following the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they broadly agreed to work towards the nuclear dismantling of the Korean Peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the U.S. of the lack of progress in lifting U.S. sanctions since then.
“Without faith in US action, there is also a lack of confidence in our national security, and under those circumstances there is no first step of unilateral disarmament,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and finds him incapacitated to serve in the Supreme Court
President of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called U.S. Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical,” and found him unable to serve in the Supreme Court
Pelosi made the comments in an interview, Saturday during the 'Texas Tribune Festival' in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help thinking that if a woman behaved like that, they would call her ‘hysterical,’” Pelosi said of her response to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Justice Commission on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional; he sometimes almost screamed and was especially upset when he told about his family and his high school age.
He also emphatically condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him “gross and coordinated character murder,” organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi stated that she felt that Kavanaugh’s testimony showed that he was not fit to serve the Supreme Court because he was full of prejudices against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with his statements and the way he speaks about the Clintons and the Democrats," Pelosi said.
Pelosi protested when she was asked if she would try to put an impeachment procedure against Kavanaugh if he was appointed, and the Democrats would get the majority in the House of Representatives.
“If he’s not telling the truth in Congress, or to the FBI, he’s unfit not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the court where he serves now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the District of Columbia District Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned that Kavanaugh would go against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v Wade (Affordable Healthcare Act), after Kavanaugh is known as a conservative judge.
Kavanaugh circumvented questions about revising certain Supreme Court decisions during the confirmation hearings.
"Don't expect us to stand up and cheer if a hysterical, biased person is now appointed to the Supreme Court," Pelosi said.
Women just have to admit this.
It’s a just tirade of months and years of tainted anger that overflows, and she can only cry to get it out.
“We’re going to cry when we get angry,” Steinem said to me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's weird, do you?"
She continued, "I was greatly helped by a woman who was in charge somewhere and who told me that she too would cry when she got angry. She developed a method where she would cry every time she got angry. To the person she was talking to, she said, 'You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm mad."
And then she just continued crying.
I thought that was brilliant.”
Tears are partly permissible as an expression of anger, because crying is essentially misunderstood.
One of my best remembered memories from a former job, in a male-dominated office, is when I cried terribly because I was incredibly angry. An older woman, a cool business manager that everyone was a bit afraid of, grabbed me in the neck and dragged me into a stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry," she said to me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you’re sad and are happy that they got you on the closet.
Patricia Schroeder, then Democrat Congresswoman in Colorado, had worked for Gary Hart on his candidacy for the presidency.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was involved in an illegitimate affair aboard a boat called 'Monkey Business' (informally meaning 'cat evil' or 'monkey squatting') and withdrew from the race, the deeply disappointed Mrs. Schroeder felt that there was no reason why she would not apply for a candidate.
“It wasn’t an informed decision,” she told me 30 years later, laughing.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone was talking about "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because the campaign was already advanced, she was lagging behind in fundraising, so she solemnly promised not to participate if she could not raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who would give men $1,000, wanted to give her only $250.
“Maybe they think I’ll get a discount?” she asked.
When she gave her speech announcing that she would not start a formal campaign anyway, she was so overwhelmed by feelings — of gratitude for the people who had supported her, of frustration because the system made it so difficult to raise money, and reach voters instead of delegates, and of anger over sexism — that she sucked into it.
"It will have been thought that I was having a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalled about how the media responded to her.
"They will have thought Kleenex was my company sponsor.
I remember thinking, what will they put on my tombstone?
"She cried"?
How U.S.-China Trade War Could Benefit Beijing
The opening balances of the trade war between the U.S. and China were deafening, and although the battle is far from being fought, a long-term gap between the two countries could, according to experts, be beneficial for Beijing.
US President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year by raising taxes on major Chinese export products, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation became known this week when new effective, increased tax rates were unveiled for $200 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 billion) in goods; half of all goods coming from China to the US.
Beijing has taken reprisals every time in kind, most recently by raising tariffs from 5 to 10% for $60 billion in U.S. goods.
China has pledged to match the US every time, and the world’s second largest economy is unlikely to blink.
In order for Washington to bend, requests must be granted, but publicly bending to the US is far too painful for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts argue that if Beijing plays it cleverly, the trade war with the US could positively support China in the longer term, as the reciprocal dependence of the two economies decreases.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that could put either country in an economic free fall is actually far more dangerous than spectators have previously acknowledged," said Abigail Grace, a research associate of the Center for a New American Security, a think tank specializing in national security issues that focuses on Asia.
Syria 'ready' to return refugees, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country that has been devastated by more than seven years of war.
During his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in his country are improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safe, thanks to the progress made in fighting terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas devastated by terrorists and normalize the situation on the ground.
All the conditions are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they have had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that threatened their daily lives and existence.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled their country since the war began in 2011.
An estimated six million people still live in the country in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome assistance in restoring the devastated land.
However, he stressed that Syria would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that had subsidized the uprising.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the '2018 Ryder Cup' by defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 on the golf course 'Le Golf National' southwest of Paris in France.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil, and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the title when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn achieved the necessary number of 14.5 points to defeat the US.
The star of the American team, Phil Mickelson, who wrestled almost the entire tournament, dropped his long blow from the tee into the water at par 3, hole 16, and admitted his loss to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer, Molinari, shined in all his laps and became one of four players who once scored 5-0-0 since the tournament began in its current form in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was kicked out by the lowest scoring of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, with 5 holes down and 4 holes to play.
The highest-ranked player in the world rankings, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 holes down and 1 hole to play by Ian Poulter from Great Britain, who may have played his last game in the Ryder Cup.
Spaniard Segrio Garcia, veteran with eight Ryder Cups, became the best European player of all tournaments ever with 25.5 points in his career.
"I don't cry so fast, but today I can't do anything about it.
It's been a tough year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so glad we got the cup back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I was able to help," Garcia said after the European victory.
He passes the torch on to his compatriot, John Ram, who defeated American legend Tiger Woods with 2 holes down and 1 hole to go in the game for singles on Sunday.
"The tremendous pride I feel for defeating Tiger Woods, and I've always followed that guy as I grew up," Rahm said.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic from one of the greatest players ever; winner of 14 major championships, second only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The American team struggled the weekend to find the fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who played high-level throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after his team's disappointing performance: "I'm proud of these guys, they've fought.
For a short time this morning, we made Europe a little more difficult.
We offered resistance.
All respect to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players in his team played very well.
We're going to regroup. I'm going to work with the American PGA (Professional Golfers' Association) and our Ryder Cup Committee and we're looking forward.
I love these 12 boys and I am proud to be their captain.
You have to take off your hat for the opponent.
We're overplayed."
Red glow update: Concentrations decrease in the provinces of Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
