It is reported that India is also hoping for a treaty of defence cooperation between the two nations.
Karratha Police Arrested 20-Year-Old After Fast Motorcycle Hunt
A motorcycle was seized after the driver drove it at 125 km/h in a 70 km/h zone and through bushland to escape the police in Bilbara.
Traffic police in Karratha this morning tried to stop a blue motorcycle after watching it leave a gas station on Bathdate Road at 125 km/h.
Police report that the driver then ignored the stop signals and continued on Burgess Road before heading off to the bushland where the officials lost sight of it.
The motorcycle and a person who corresponded to the driver's description were later seen at a house in the Walcott Way in Bulgarra.
Karratha police accuse a 20-year-old man of disregarding a stop signal and reckless driving.
He is expected to appear in the district court in Karratha on September 23.
The motorcycle was seized and confiscated for three months.
George Webster charged with hotel rape in Naim and Pitlochry
A man is on trial for raping women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was read the indictment at a hearing of the Glasgow Supreme Court.
He is accused of raping a woman at Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry, Perthshire, on June 7, 2013.
The indictment is that Webster attacked her while she was "consciously unconscious, asleep, and unable to signal consent."
Webster is also accused of raping a second woman at the Golf View Hotel in Naim in the Scottish Highlands on 4 May 2014.
Judge Lady Rae set the trial date for November 17 at the Supreme Court in Edinburgh.
Return to the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have put forward a bill to establish the organization of trade unions as a civil right.
"As unions die, so die the middle class jobs," said Ellison, a Minnesota Democrat and Deputy Chairman of the Progressive Caucus in Congress.
That’s why I proudly present the Employee Empowerment Act together with civil rights icon John Lewis.
This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal opportunities in the case of discrimination based on the organization of unions as in other forms of discrimination - and thus stops anti-union forces.
Complementing the National Labour Code to provide a way for workers exposed to discrimination to organize a trade union representation, to sue for justice before a civil court — and to receive damages or penalties — is a sensible and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis, and the other sponsors of their bill are proposing is to link back to a very American idea.
Despite the setbacks that unions have faced in recent years—in Wisconsin, Michigan, and other states across the country—Americans have once encouraged countries around the world to recognize, expand, and uphold labor rights.
There was a time when millions of Americans still remember when this country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the right of association in one breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to pass a constitution to ensure that the militarized autocracy of Hedki Tojos was replaced by democracy.
Fully aware that the workers and their trade unions played a role in the creation of a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly recognized that "the workers' rights to union and common negotiation and action are guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff urged the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that Adolf Hitler’s fascism was replaced by a strong democracy.
In recognition of the fact that the workers would have to organize themselves and raise their voices in the new nation, the Germans added a clause explicitly stating: "The right to form associations in order to secure and improve labor and economic conditions is guaranteed to every individual and to every occupation or trade.
Agreements that restrict or aim to restrict this right are null and void; measures aimed at it are unlawful.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt presided over the International Human Rights Commission, which drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a global agreement, Roosevelt and the other authors added a guarantee that “everyone has the right to form or join unions to protect their interests.”
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that labour rights are human rights.
When this country advised other countries on how to form civilian and democratic societies, Americans declared that the right to form a trade union – and that this union could then participate in collective bargaining as an equal partner with corporations and government agencies – must be protected.
After these rights have come under attack in America, it is indeed very wise to rethink the American ideal that the working population must have the right to unite and to make themselves heard in a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the workers’ movement did not limit the strength of the nation, but enlarged it.
By raising the living standards of millions of people, labor has miraculously created a market for industry and raised the entire nation to unimaginable levels of production.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but history preserves them.
History remembers, and we should.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights as protection against discrimination in the creation of employee representations - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that have made America great in the past and fulfilled the promise of democracy.
Judge temporarily stops law that could force all abortion clinics in Louisiana to close
A U.S. federal judge temporarily halted the implementation of a law in Louisiana on Sunday, which lawyers say would have led to the closure of all five abortion clinics in the state.
This measure, which was enacted by Bobby Jindal, governor of Louisiana, in June and is due to enter into force on Sept. 1, would force doctors who perform abortions to acquire a patient admission right at a hospital within a 30-mile radius of their practice.
However, the judge’s decision means that doctors can continue to legally perform abortions for the time being while applying for such a right.
"The plaintiffs can continue to work in accordance with the law as they endeavour to obtain these rights," Federal Judge John deGravelles wrote in his verdict.
Within a month, a hearing is scheduled for the judge to bring about a more permanent decision for the law.
Abortion advocates welcomed the decision, the latest in a series of judgments against similar measures, saying doctors gained more time to gain hospital admission rights.
“Today’s decision means the women in Louisiana are escaping a subtle law that wants to take away their health and their rights,” said Nancy Northup, president and chair of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which had sued on behalf of three of the state’s five clinics to stop the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the judgment also extended to the doctors from the two clinics who had not joined the lawsuit and had also applied for the right of admission.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have passed similar laws, with courts in Alabama and Mississippi recently declaring such measures unconstitutional.
Key points of a law in Texas that would have forced most of the clinics remaining in the state to close were halted by a federal judge on Friday.
Abortion advocates and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists, as well as the American Medical Association, agree that admission rights require unnecessary restrictions from doctors.
Opponents of abortion argue that the measures are designed to protect women’s health, although some also welcomed the impact of clinic closures.
Only one doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has patient-entry rights, the Center for Reproductive Rights said.
If all the other doctors in the state were forced to stop performing abortions, this doctor, fearing for his safety, would stop performing the operation, the group said.
In their argument against the verdict, representatives of the state of Louisiana said they would not punish doctors for performing abortions while their requests for patient record rights were still pending.
Delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment options lead to higher death rates from ovarian cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James posted a video homage to her mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women in rural areas of Australia are at higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than women in cities.
Researchers analyzed the medical data of more than 1,100 Australians who were diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 25 percent were still alive five years after the diagnosis.
Research leader Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of mortality during the study was 20 percent higher than for those living in urban areas.
SMALL STUDY: New drugs could slow down lung and ovarian cancer
The researchers examined the medical care of women over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that a woman’s age at diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, existing pre-existing conditions, as well as social and economic status also influenced the chances of survival.
For older women and those whose cancer was already more advanced at the time of diagnosis, the survival rate was the lowest.
For those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of mortality was 20 percent higher during the study than for those living in urban areas.
Although the study did not investigate why women living outside the city were more likely to die of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suspects a delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centers as possible factors for this.
"This disease is best treated by gynecological oncologists, and these are most commonly found in larger cities," she said.
Despite improving telemedicine services to somewhat counter the distances, it suggested as a possible remedy a reinforcement of the service of inbound doctors to give specialists the opportunity to care for women closer to their place of residence, as well as treatment programs for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said the study found poor long-term survival rates among women in ovarian cancer regardless of geographical status, and underlined the need for better treatment and prevention strategies.
The study, funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer, is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a young 33-year-old mother from the Gold Coast, learned she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centers regret falling homeowners numbers
The decline along with an increased decline in the number of homeowners under the age of 35 could result in garden centers losing tens of thousands of pounds a year if today’s young consumers reach the “core age group for garden products,” according to a study by HTA, as reported in the Financial Times.
The report states that tenants spend an average of 55 percent of the amount that people with homes spend on their gardens.
The rise of people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popular process of paving outer gardens for park purposes, and the falling garden size are other factors that threaten the industry, in which an estimated <0xC2><0xA3>5 billion is put on sale annually.
In the Greater London area, where the share of homeowners has fallen from 61 percent to 43 percent over a six-year period, the lowest spending on garden products per household is reported.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that living for rent or small gardens do not mean that people cannot pull plants.
Guy Barter, chief garden consultant for the RHS, said, “Container gardeners, for example, are very popular with tenants because they can take their plants with them when moving.”
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of garden retail due to rising homeowner numbers and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-90s.
He also predicted an improved market situation for this year due to the better weather after unfriendly weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement in Pakistan, led by opposition politician Imran Khan and clergyman Tahirul Qadri, continues.
In the capital Islamabad, around 1,000 protesters have stormed the state television station PTV.
Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said soldiers could have pushed the protesters out of PTV buildings again.
The transmitter stopped operating for about 40 minutes, but now broadcasts again.
At the same time, some 3,000 protesters tried to reach the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
About a kilometre away, they made clashes with security forces, equipped with sticks and stones.
The police used tear gas.
The protesters demanded Sharif’s resignation, but he refused.
The country's army, meanwhile, urges a political solution to the conflict, "without wasting time and without using force."
After a meeting at the headquarters on Sunday evening, the military said: “The army remains committed to its role in ensuring the security of the state.”
The military plays an important role in Pakistan and has already been put in the military on a number of occasions.
Opposition politician Imran Khan accuses Prime Minister Sharif of cheating in the parliamentary elections in May last year.
The protests escalated over the weekend after Khan and Qadri called on their supporters to advance to Sharif’s residence.
Three people were killed.
Turkey summons U.S. diplomat for espionage report
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has summoned the country’s oldest U.S. diplomat for information on a report on U.S. and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bülent said the U.S. Embassy’s business manager and Turkish officials had discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the online magazine The Intercept reported that those of the former U.S. National Security Agency analyst, Edward Snowden, show that Turkey was a major area of activity for the U.S. and British intelligence agencies.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan downplayed the importance of the report, saying that all major countries were spying on each other.
An earlier report that also targeted Germany’s most important secret service, Ankara, caused significantly more angry reactions from the Turkish government.
Warning strike: Locomotive drivers threaten with consequences for commuters
The nationwide warning strike by locomotives on Monday evening could also affect passenger traffic in North Rhine-Westphalia.
The cancellation announced for 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. affects all transport companies nationwide, including long-distance, regional and S-Bahn traffic.
The main direction of the warning strike is freight traffic.

said the district chairman of the trade union Deutscher Lokomotivführer (GDL), Sven Schmitte, in Düsseldorf.
We expect significant outages.
There are no regional priorities.
The main direction of the warning strike is freight traffic.
Deutsche Bahn in North Rhine-Westphalia has announced that it will do everything in its power to minimise the impact.
However, the GDL did not say where it wanted to strike, so it was difficult to anticipate the consequences in concrete terms.
Magaluf Police Chief Accused of Corruption
The prosecutors presented evidence of extortion by police officers and employees of the city of Calvià to the office of the prosecutor of Mallorca on Friday.
The chief of the police of Calvià on the holiday island of Mallorca has been arrested following allegations of corruption by businessmen and bar owners in the infamous binge drinking hotspot Magaluf.
Chief Commissioner José Antonio Navarro was detained by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most of Magaluf’s bars and nightclubs are located, after corruption allegations against him.
According to the online newspaper Mallorca Diario, the prosecutors presented evidence of extortion by police officers and employees of the city of Calvià to the office of the Majorcan Anti-Corruption Prosecutor on Friday.
Two other local police officers have been arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in connection with the allegations of corruption and are being questioned by a judge together with Navarro.
The national Spanish daily ABC reported that the angry nightclub owners said the authorities’ nepotism had a serious impact on their business.
"It's no longer about making money, it's about survival," one of the businessmen told the court.
Leave our livelihoods out of the game.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made international headlines this summer due to a viral YouTube video showing an 18-year-old British tourist performing fellatio on 24 men during a drunk tour.
The island authorities have since tried to stop the improper conduct of alcoholic holidaymakers in Magaluf by minimizing the number of participants in the infamous alcohol-drunk pub tours.
The Playhouse Club, where the fellatio incident took place, was forced to shut down for a year, while Playhouse and pub tour organizer Carnage have to jointly pay a fine of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>55,000 ($73,000).
The tourist resort of Magaluf, which is especially popular with young British holidaymakers, is also known for a number of accidents under the influence of alcohol, including the trend of "balconying", where people jump from one balcony to another or from a balcony to the hotel pool.
The first spring day with wet and stormy weather conditions affecting flights from Adelaide Airport
The spring has brought South Australia a winterly surprise, with heavy showers and strong winds interfering with flights from Adelaide Airport.
In the evening until 9 pm, another 5mm rain fell on the city, after 6.6mm, which had already fallen in the night to Sunday.
The last precipitation was the result of a series of short, stormy showers, including a casting that started just before 8 p.m., causing nearly 4mm of precipitation in about 10 minutes.
After winter last week provided an early dose of spring, the city’s temperatures fell back to a maximum of just 15.8°C on Monday.
The stormy weather conditions likely led to the delayed landing of a Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane should have landed shortly after 7:30 p.m., but was hit by a shear wind - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to take off.
Wind gusts at that time reached about 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport.
The flight data showed that the aircraft also had to take off on a second landing and finally set up at about 20.40.
The flight delay subsequently resulted in some other flights delayed, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Quantas flight from Sydney.
Adelaide is predicted to have a maximum temperature of 16°C on Tuesday, with possible showers.
Matthies says: It's high time to network
Given the galloping technical progress that threatens to turn our comfortable home into high-tech switchgear, our columnist Bernd Matthies comforts himself with a highly familiar electronic accessory.
As I write this, my gaze falls on the spiral cable that connects the listener to the phone, and I think, "Boah, how retro is that?"
But there is a reason behind this: If the cable were not, all the listeners would fly around the house without a man in a very short time, and that would be much more retro.
Anyway, on the ekeltronic (ekeltronic?
No, typo: electronic) Sector the rule that today's world first is the electric scrap of tomorrow, bought - outdated.
And if, for example, you still have a tube TV in the living room today, you are simply saying that you refuse television in principle.
Why these considerations?
Because the pressing of the Ifa at the radio tower this week again shows us our absolute incompetence in electronics issues.
The layman, who used to be blind to washing machines and CD players, does not even understand the purpose of the devices, which are spread before him with incredibly vain expert speech: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies" promises us the press office.
Yeah, are you okay?
What should you talk about with people who seem to be voluntarily spreading such quark?
In fact, for about 20 years, it has been mainly about the fact that we should be pleased to connect our house.
So that the yogurt itself reorders, so that the fire alarm informs us on holiday in the Maldives that it is burning in the study.
And wouldn't it be wonderful if we could get the air conditioning from the office to our soon arrival ...?
Yes, this requires air conditioning.
But a dream will definitely come true soon: We lift our wristwatch, say it loudly "suck!" - and at home the vacuum robot starts.
Idiot.
Everything amounts to nothing less than a revolution: "The boundaries between white and brown goods are blurring", says an industry expert, you can connect the washing machine to a headphone, the steam cooker sends the weather report and the data glasses indicate how long the pizza in the oven will take, but this is of no use, because we are in traffic jam.
From daily practice, we also know: If a new-fashioned device is really urgently needed, the battery is guaranteed to be empty.
Another reason is that the spiral cable on the phone will survive the next radio exhibitions.
Israeli children return to their schools after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from areas near the Gaza Strip returned to schools on Monday after spending the summer in air shelters, while rocket and mortar fire on their communities fell during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, and schools in Gaza remained closed as the area recovered from the fighting.
The school start brought a sense of joy and expectation to the rocket-shot communities in the south of Israel, but the signs of fighting are still fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, employees of the "Pashosh" kindergarten, which was hit by a rocket, removed grenade fragments from the walls and sliding walls before the students arrived.
"We're a little scared, but we're excited," said Ronit Bart, a resident of Kibbutz Saad and an English teacher there.
Many children from our area urgently need to return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said it felt “a bit weird” to suddenly go back to school.
"These were difficult times, and we didn't leave the house at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the kibbutz near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Until a ceasefire interrupted the war last week, thousands of residents of border communities such as Saad remained in their homes or left their homes to move to safer areas further away from Gaza and escape rocket and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a community near the Gaza border where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar grenade, are still hesitant to return.
The Ministry of Education said about a dozen families had not yet returned.
Their children were temporarily placed in other schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a Gaza border town heavily affected by Palestinian shelling.
He appealed to the children to learn a lot and said "we will ensure that you acquire knowledge and provide you with security."
Israel and Hamas agreed on an indefinite ceasefire on Tuesday.
The ceasefire brought an immediate end to the fighting, but important issues remain unresolved, such as Hamas’s call for the lifting of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of Gaza’s air and sea ports.
Israel demands the disarmament of Hamas and the surrender of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the fighting.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin in Egypt later this month.
More than 2,100 Palestinians were killed in the war, three-quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children, according to estimates by the Palestinians and the UN.
Israel denies these data and estimates that at least half of the killed are fighters, but did not provide concrete evidence for this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and mortar shells during fighting on Israeli cities, most in the south of the country.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in the Gaza area and about 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools, which were converted into temporary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in shelters and the fighting continues, the education authorities postponed the beginning of the school year last week.
"I hope the school will be reopened soon so that we can continue to learn, like the children in the world and the Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who currently lives in a school in Gaza City.
After election in Saxony: CDU deputy Strobl calls into question NPD ban procedure
In view of the loss of votes by the NPD in Saxony, CDU Federal Vice President Thomas Strobl has called for an end to the NPD banning procedure before the Federal Constitutional Court.
According to CDU Federal Vice President Thomas Strobl, the ongoing prohibition proceedings against the NPD should come to an end before the Federal Constitutional Court.
"The NPD is performing worse than last time," said Strobl, who is also CDU head of state in Baden-Württemberg, the "Leipziger Volkszeitung".
This is a pleasing development in the right direction and a development that makes me more likely to come to the conclusion that you are fighting the NPD politically and not before the Constitutional Court.
The NPD failed to reach the 5% threshold in the vote on Sunday.
A first attempt to ban the right-wing extremist party failed in 2003, because the Constitutional Protection at the time also had informants in the NPD leadership.
In December 2013, after long preparations, the Federal Council submitted a new application in Karlsruhe.
The federal government and the Bundestag did not join.
Harburg: Tents for new refugees
At Neuländer Platz, refugees are now housed in tents.
The head office for refugees in Harburg bursts out of all seams.
Now the Interior Authority has ordered three Red Cross tents to be erected next to it.
The district politicians were not informed until shortly before - they are little enthusiastic.
"These Hauruck actions continue to fuel citizens' reservations and do not give district politicians a chance to constructively participate in the humane accommodation of refugees," says Britta Herrmann, group chair of the Greens in the Harburg district assembly.
Her party demands that the district administration of Harburg provide unused houses for accommodation.
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents.
The reasons for the overcrowding in the initial reception are the rush of seekers of help - and the fact that the authorities cannot provide enough places in follow-up facilities.
Many refugees stay longer than the regular three months.
House prices have experienced the strongest winter increase in seven years, according to a widely observed index.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for homes in the Australian capital rose 1.1 percent in August, according to Monday’s RP data.
As a result of this increase, the overall increase in June, July and August is 4.2 percent, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 percent, more than twice the increase in the 12 months to August 2013, but the increases were not evenly distributed across the country.
RP Data research leader Tim Lawless said Sydney and Melbourne are driving a two-tiered market.
RP Data figures show that house prices in Sydney rose by 16.1 percent last year, compared to 11.7 percent in Melbourne.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rose by an average of five and six percent.
At the other end of the scale is Canberra, which has been hit hard by government spending cuts and where prices have only risen by 1.4 percent over the year.
Mr. Lawless further said that with the start of spring, there would now be a rise in properties for sale for the next few months, which would subject the market to "a real test."
“If you look at the continuingly high rate of auction prices, a generally fast sales rate, and the continually low interest rate environment, it is likely that home prices will continue to rise in the next three months,” he said.
In a statement to the Neue Presse, he contradicts statements of the managing director Peer Medau and certifies that he poses "like a general".
This is not the style of the university, it says in the message.
The Medau family had already been informed orally in mid-June about the university’s intentions.
The statement that the plans were not announced until July is definitely wrong," Pötzl said.
At the same time, he points out that the plans are not "predeterminations or even decisions", but "preferences".
The expansion of the narrow road up to the castle, which is necessary for the access, is also less dramatic than feared by the Medaus.
There was and is no mention of a nine-metre-wide road.
It is at the current level by 5.50 meters, which is one meter wider than before," explains Pötzl.
Pötzl does not want to accept the argument of the Medau operators that their free and school-owned parking spaces will in future only be used by students of the university.
Parking is not used at all because, as with other public parking spaces, this can now be solved intelligently.
Think about the residents
The nursery Bergwichtel, which is located on the premises and would lead along the driveway to the parking deck in front of the front door, according to the university president should "not be impaired".
Rather, he points out that "this is not only about the nursery, but also about the residents at the entrance to Friedrich-Streib-Straße and the 800 pupils of the neighboring Realschule.
So it is about much more than the particular interests of Mr. Medau," says Pötzl.
Whether the criticism of the parental council of the nursery, with the expansion of the road would be one of "the few natural spots of Coburg lost" is entitled, "the reader can decide for himself."
At the beginning of October, Pötzl, together with the Bamberg State Building Office, wants to inform the city councils about the building development of the university by 2020 "and in this context address the importance of the new development".
Peer Medau had informed the parents of the nursery last week about the plans of the university.
Accordingly, the access for the new parking deck should not be via the campus and Friedrich-Streib-Straße as before, but via the Medau-Berg.
Thus, the narrow road would have to be extended to about a kilometer in length in two lanes.
According to estimates of the Medaus, the traffic in the park of Hohenfels Castle would thus increase tenfold.
There are about 2,000 vehicles per day.
On the part of the city, they did not want to comment on the project.
Glandorf resigns from handball team
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old from the Bundesliga SG Flensburg-Handewitt cited health problems for this decision.
The decision was not easy for me, it has matured over several months.
It's time for me to listen to the signals of my body and end my career in the national team," the 2007 World Champion said on his Facebook page.
With a record of 167 international matches and 576 goals for Germany, he retires internationally.
Because he wants to go on goal hunt for the Champions League winner from Flensburg for a few more years, he is now no longer available to the new Bundestrainer Dagur Sigurdsson.
With the Icelander, who announced his squad for the international matches against Switzerland on Tuesday, Glandorf had a "long and good conversation.
His ideas and approaches have inspired me just as much as they will inspire my long-standing players and my successors.
But for my club I want to be healthy in the next few years, for which longer regeneration breaks are necessary, which the current double load does not allow.
The left-handed man had even had to fear his career ending in 2012 after a heel infection.
Due to Achilles tendon problems, he had been treated by team doctors of the German Handball Federation (DHB) with a cortisone syringe, which later triggered a severe inflammation.
An emergency operation and two more interventions followed.
Glandorf then announced a lawsuit against the team doctor, the dispute ended with a settlement.
Twelve years of professional and eleven years of national team career do not pass any body without a trace.
I have some health construction sites that I can no longer ignore.
After the three infection-related foot surgeries that took place at short intervals in 2012, I never got my blood pressure properly controlled.
This includes a number of other wear-related complaints.
Already at the beginning of the year, I realized that I control my head, but I can not deceive my body," Glandorf told the magazine Handball Time in an interview.
He would only be ready for a comeback in an absolute emergency.
"When all the strings are ripped, I'm always ready to talk," the two-time family father told the magazine.
However, I can count the years in which I can still play handball on one hand.
I also have to say that after my long hospital stay in 2012, I also became quite humble in terms of my health.
After my career, I want to be able to at least somehow go straight.
In addition to winning the 2007 World Cup title and the 2014 Champions League, he won the EHF Cup in 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo).
In 2012, he also secured the European Cup of Cup Winners with Flensburg.
German economy shrunk by 0.2 percent in spring
Crises around the globe slowed down the German economy in the second quarter.
Gross domestic product decreased by 0.2 percent from April to the end of June 2014 compared to the previous quarter.
This was announced by the Federal Statistical Office, confirming preliminary calculations.
Consumption alone revived the economy in the spring, while investments declined.
Foreign trade also slowed the economy.
Thanks to the strong start of the year, the total GDP growth for the first half of the year was 0.8 percent compared to the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and the destination of the "Münsterland-Mooiste", which led through the Burgmannsstadt for the first time on Sunday.
The Burgmannstadt Horstmar experienced an invasion of Dutch "fietzenfahrer" on Sunday.
The largest cycling association in the Netherlands, NTFU, hosted the so-called "Münsterlande-Mooiste".
This is the largest cycling tour across the Münsterland, the cycling paradise near the Netherlands.
More than 1000 participants thanked Jos ter Huerne for organizing this tour of the Münsterland with their registration.
Announced in various journals, this tour was offered to interested parties.
We came from Den Helder and drove overnight to participate in this tour.
We would also like to get to know the Münsterland in this way," the cyclists were delighted with the route through the districts of Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After registering in the club home of the Schützenbruderschaft Sta.
Katharina went on a small "peace ride" through the city via the wall, where the start took place.
Furthermore, the route, which was advertised for three different categories, led towards Herrenholz via the Schöppinger Berg towards Coesfeld and via Havixbeck and Billerbeck back to Horstmar.
On routes of 95 kilometers with 1175 meters of altitude, 120 kilometers with 1475 meters of altitude and 145 kilometers with 1775 meters of altitude, the cyclists proved their good condition.
They were fed along the way in Havixbeck and Billerbeck.
Main organizer Jos ter Huerne and deputy mayor Heinz Lölfing were very pleased with the success of this cycling event.
We are satisfied and it was a nice experience for all involved.
The organization went without problems and there were no negative incidents," Heinz Lölfing draws a positive conclusion from this event.
Unfortunately, there were not as many participants as the organizer had hoped, probably due to the bad weather forecasts and the morning rain.
"We will see you again in 2015 in hopefully nice weather on 30 August or during another weekend," the cyclists promised, but nevertheless, to return to Münsterland and the organizers plan a new edition.
Konstantin Wecker's ruthlessly honest memoirs
It is actually more philosophical testimony than biography, which Konstantin Wecker, songwriter, pacifist, political activist, ex-prisoner, put on paper on 287 pages in "Monk und Krieger".
Not chronologically, but more thought snippets for thought snippets, the Munich-born on June 1, 1947 wrote down his memoirs, each chapter initiated by a suitable lyrics.
And he is ruthlessly honest: From onanism as a high school student to shoplifting and drug use, he does not leave out any human weakness.
Also to show how he himself has learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow human beings.
Wide space also occupies abstract but all the more important terms: love, soul, ego, being in the now, spirituality – all of which he tries to go to the bottom, in a very philosophical but also very personal way.
And he also explains his pacifism, his social criticism, his political commitment - and also how not only the music (the opera lover became a soul and rock musician) shaped him, but also his imprisonment.
The latter also brought the living man Konstantin Wecker closer to the ascetic monk, who is created "by subtraction", as he says, "by omitting everything unnecessary".
But there are also short anecdotes about the earth between all the high-spirited views: for example, about fights in a restaurant frequented by GIs or a crazy drive where he frontally targeted a tree.
He is also relentlessly honest.
Lenny Henry: My father never took me in his arms.
Never said "I love you"
Henry was one of seven children of a family of Jamaican immigrants living in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and their relationship was limited.
Henry rehearses for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and originated from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap, with lively melodies.
But Henry had to work his way through some difficult childhood moments.
He attended "many" therapies after his mother's death, and Henry is pondering about his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
You never saw his face, only heard his voice: "Stop the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move! Move! Move!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton — who had grown up when I was a kid — went to the pub with him and talked about things like the shape of the beer glass or the beauty of a cricket stroke.
I never had such a conversation with him.
For much of my life he was this serious guy in the corner who read the newspaper.
Recently, Henry opened a foundry in Dudley, and although the conditions were better than in his father’s day, he gained a glimpse of what life might have been like for him.
It's a little lighter now, but they're dark, smokey, deep Stygian mazes with flames and smoke and plenty of soot.
My father used to just lie down in the tub and then you could slowly hear him start singing because he could wash the foundry off.
As I walked around there, I realized that he had been doing this for years to bring the food to the table, and my respect for him grew greater.
Still, Henry grew up as a child without his parents' love testimonies.
My father never hugged me, he never said "I love you."
It wasn’t until my mother was bad at the end of her life that we started saying, “I love you, I love you, I love you.”
Through his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he was able to share the love he had missed as a child.
Could you stop with the "I love you"?
Stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
with Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
He is still friends with French, with whom he has been married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother was a diabetic.
This contributed to her death.
So when I became very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You have to be radical.
So I went through this fitness thing and also had to do a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's exhausting.
No one likes to eat carrots.
Henry's career shift may be reflected in his elegant, short-cut beard.
Since he was praised by critics for his Othello, he has been captured by the theatre.
It was followed by The Comedy of Errors, and then Fences by August Wilson.
This is a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that filled his busy working life.
He started at the age of 16 working in a factory.
A DJ spotted him on stage as he imitated people and wrote to New Faces about him.
His television career began in the mid-1970s. "I was the only black imitator/comedian on television for quite a long time."
He learned in the profession.
Not only did I have to grow up in front of the public, but from 1975 to 1985 I also had to learn how to become an efficient joke telling machine while being a star through television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
As his manager owned the stage rights at the Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program in which people "painted themselves black," Henry performed his comedy there for five years.
My family was very uncomfortable.
I wish it had never happened, but I don’t regret it.
It was a strange, unpleasant position for me, but I worked on huge projects and learned how to deal with a large audience.
But this "year-long award-winning light pillar of British television" was also a "grotesque parody of black people."
By introducing characters who both mocked and celebrated British black culture, Henry worked on an alternative comedy circle in the eighties.
The first series of the Lenny Henry Show went on air in 1984, and in the 1990s, he was known as Chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!.
Advertising, documentaries, TV series and film roles shaped his next decade, but after his 2008 BBC series LennyHenry.tv, he thought to himself, "What are you doing next, Len, because it all feels like you're just spending time or kicking a little bit on the spot."
Then came a documentary series for Radio 4 titled What's So Great About ...?
The first episode revolved around Shakespeare.
I was allergic to Shakespeare.
I had never really learned anything about him in school and thought he was predominantly a middle-class domain, white in pantyhose and a cabbage head in the front.
So I was terrified of it.
Everyone we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said, "You should try it.
Don't make it bad if you don't know what you're talking about.
Take a few of the words in your mouth, and then you will understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry performed 20 lines from Othello's last speech for the documentary, and he was thrilled.
I felt like I could do it.
It was almost as if someone had finally put my head on.
"That's what it's all about, it's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn your text, research a little bit.
The rehearsals were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we did it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car accident, and that just didn't happen.
And soon he appeared in the comedy of errors.
Suddenly I was at the National Theatre and I could hardly believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you changed."
There was a technical error and Henry instinctively felt he had to entertain the audience.
"A small voice said to me, 'You've got to bridge 10 minutes now while they're repairing the computer.'"
Instead, the stage director announced that the performance would continue as soon as the problem was solved.
I walked out of the stage and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."
I'm not responsible for that.
I can leave it to someone else.
“You play in a play, so stay in your role.”
Henry in Fences at the Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for Fences was demanding.
Panic is very good, it strengthens the tendons.
This, too, was well received, so it is like a great shield of the gods, who tell me, "This is your destiny."
He says this, of course, with a thunderous voice.
So I'll stick with it.
I really love this.
I love being in a rehearsal room.
But Henry still has the head of a comedian – our conversation is full of humorous outbursts as he repeatedly imitates people.
I decided not to do a stand-up comedy because I find that this kind of instant gratification from a room full of strangers is somehow dangerous.
If you always try to do that, you drive against a wall.
I sometimes perform live at the Apollo when I want to, but overall it doesn’t give me as much as I used to.
I ask him if he will ever do a stand-up comedy tour again.
The fun I have in a room with a director who helps shape a beginning, a middle part, and the end of a journey - I don't think I'll ever want to give it up again.
Is this his new incarnation?
I think you do.
I like to be an actor.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and that’s great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Houthi rebels block roads in Yemen's capital
In the conflict between Shiite Houthi rebels and the Yemeni government, the Houthis have called for civil disobedience in the capital Sanaa.
Houthis had occupied central streets in Sanaa on Monday, a spokesman for the Houthi party said "Ansar Allah."
Access to Parliament was also blocked.
Yemeni media reports a traffic chaos in the capital.
According to the online issue of the newspaper "Yemen Post", Houthi leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi called for the measures on Sunday evening.
According to the newspaper, Houthi threatened to escalate the conflict if his demands were not met.
The Shiite Houthis are fighting for more independence from Sunni-run Yemen and demand the resignation of the government.
The Houthi tribe has been besieging the Yemeni capital for almost two weeks.
Around 30,000 rebels have erected protest camps on the main access roads of Sanaa.
There are repeated bloody battles with the Yemeni army.
Kenya Registers Officials to Contain "Ghost Employees"
Kenya has begun to biometrically register all state officials to delete “ghost workers” from government payrolls.
Employees who do not register in the next two weeks will no longer be paid, according to a government statement.
The government suspects that thousands of people still receive salaries even after they leave the public service.
When President Uhuru Kenyatta took office in 2013, he promised to fight corruption in the public service.
An audit earlier this year found that at least $1 million (<0xC2><0xA3>700,000) a month was lost in payments for “ghost workers” and other abusive financial practices.
The government suspects that salaries will continue to be paid to accounts after a person dies or leaves public service, Wanyama Chebusiri reports for the BBC from the capital Nairobi.
All officials must now appear at identification centers over the next two weeks to ensure that their data is included via the biometric registrations, a government message was released.
All those who would not do so without a credible apology would be removed from the payroll, the message continued.
"This approach will contribute significantly to the rationalization of the public service by determining the actual number of officials and also cleaning up the payroll on both levels of government - eliminating the 'ghost employees,'" said Anne Waiguru, Cabinet Secretary at the Ministry of Decentralization and Planning.
The scandal surrounding art consultant Helge Achenbach will be tried in court for the first time on November 11.
Five heirs of Berthold Albrecht, son of the Aldi founder Theo Albrecht, in a civil proceedings at the Düsseldorf district court claim 19.4 million euros in damages from Achenbach and two of its companies, which are in insolvency proceedings.
A court spokeswoman said on Monday.
The lawsuit states that Achenbach had cheated on the purchase of works of art and classic cars and that Berthold Albrecht had calculated higher purchase prices than actually paid.
As a result, the agreed commission was also higher.
Achenbach has purchased valuable objects for Albrecht for 121 million euros.
Children need roots and wings
He was 44 years in school service, 23 of whom were headmasters.
From this time Manfred Richter knows many confessed Petershausener and Kollbacher from their time as students.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always supported by his striving to see man in the student.
The Schneekoppe is the most famous mountain in the Giant Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motif from his home.
Richter was born in 1930 in Trautenau/North Bohemia, today Trutnov.
At the age of 14, he became interested in the teacher profession after four years of high school.
A year later, the Sudeten Germans were expropriated.
Within half an hour, the family had to leave their home.
After a few months in a camp, it went to Bavaria in 1946 - in a freight wagon.
So it swept Richter into the Upper Franconian Senkendorf.
Teacher training took place in Bamberg.
To do this, Manfred Richter had to walk ten kilometers six times a week to the nearest station, take the train to Bamberg, go three kilometers across the city to school and back in the evening.
After two months, Manfred Richter was given a place to sleep in a Red Cross home in Bamberg: together with up to 15 classmates in a dormitory.
In 1951 he made the first and in 1954, after three years of teaching, the second state examination.
Since Oberfranken did not have a free teacher position for him, he applied to Upper Bavaria and came to the school in Kollbach on 1 November 1954.
The "Mrs. Room" was his first "service apartment" in the schoolhouse.
In 1958, he moved into a three-room service apartment in the newly built teacher's house next to the school.
This house was bought by Manfred Richter in 1980, after the school in Kollbach had been dissolved in 1968.
Until then, there were three classes in Kollbach in the school association Petershausen-Kollbach and five in Petershausen.
From the school year 1968/69 these were combined in Petershausen in today's town hall.
When the school association Indersdorf was founded, only the primary school remained in the village.
In order to avoid a downgrade in the now smaller school, the then rector Georg Sigl moved to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Richter became his successor.
But Petershausen grew, and so the children and their teachers were able to rely on the current building from September 1982, which was extended in 1997 after Richter’s retirement.
Manfred Richter praises the uncomplicated generosity of the then mayor Ludwig Götz, who, at the expense of the municipality, had an additional workshop and cellar rooms built during the expansion in 1997, although this was not eligible under the guidelines for school buildings.
"Mayor Götz was very school-friendly," Judge remembered gratefully.
Throughout his career, Manfred Richter has never forgotten the speech of a government official who had responded to a lecture on law and justice by a school council: "You must never forget love." Manfred Richter implemented what he had heard as a young teacher.
“You have to give the children two things: roots and wings,” says the 84-year-old.
And he had to learn, "That doesn't always succeed." Whether he means just his students or just his own six children is not entirely clear.
In any case, Richter’s actions were sometimes unconventional.
When students beat themselves up, they were not punished by him, nor were they condemned to sit back.
At the expense of the municipality, Richter had two pairs of boxing gloves purchased and had the two opponents compete against each other, even if there was a violet.
For the benefit of the school, Richter maintained a good relationship as rector with the then mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU).
This moved the partyless judge after his retirement to run for the municipal council in 1996, at least as the last on the CSU list.
However, Judge was selected in sixth place and joined the CSU.
180 km in three days
HR4-RADTOUR 700 cyclists make stops in the spa park of Bad Salzhausen and Schotten
If cyclists take a rest on their tour in Bad Salzhausen or Schotten, that in itself is nothing special.
On Friday, however, the number of stops alone made an impression: The 700 participants of the hr4 cycling tour and the accompanying bike tour enjoyed a break in the lower spa park of Bad Salzhausen and later a party in the open air in the Schottener Alteburgpark.
Under the motto "Bicycling and celebrating on newly discovered paths between Nidda and Kinzig", the participants had met on Thursday in Bad Vilbel and witnessed a concert by Van Baker & Band.
On Friday it became serious: The cyclists took the first stage, the 60 kilometers over Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and further to Scots.
In Bad Salzhausen, the athletes were welcomed by Mayor Hans-Peter Seum, who had co-started in Bad Vilbel by bicycle, and the head of the Bad Salzhausen company, Petra Schwing-Döring.
All kinds of good things had been prepared for the refreshment of body and spirit: the rural women from Ranstadt and Nieder-Mockstadt had baked 85 sheets of apple, sweat, streusel and cheese cakes, which were wonderful for the skilled cyclists.
"Such cakes can only be baked by rural women," a participant from Aulendiebach praised while ordering another piece.
Cold refreshments could be bought at the beverage stand of the gymnastics club Geiß-Nidda.
The "Duo Bravo" entertained the visitors with well-known melodies from operettas and musicals and received enthusiastic applause.
The beautiful ambience of the park seemed relaxing.
A gentleman also enjoyed a head massage from his partner: "He deserved it, after all, he has already fixed off bicycle chains again today".
Meanwhile, the mayor and the company manager still had to work: They were interviewed by reporter Rainer Janke at the well in front of the drinking cure house and took advantage of the opportunity to advertise for Bad Salzhausen on the radio.
Promotion chief Tobias Hagen, who has been a tour guide since the first hr4 cycling tour in 2004, was only able to sniff out for a short time, since he had plenty to do with the technology on site.
His pickup truck, in which he communicated with his employees and the 15-person motorcycle squadron of the police in Hesse via three phones and a radio, wrote Facebook entries and made reports, also needed a check.
"The majority of the participants come from the Rhine-Main region," he said, "but also from Giessen or Fulda, from Lauterbach or the Taunus and even from numerous cities in Westphalia.
The number of participants depends a bit on the available accommodation capacity.
In Category I, participants are accommodated in hotels, in Category II in collective accommodations.
The cyclists had a good impression of the spa when they left after an hour and a half: "Goodbye!"
"It was beautiful in Bad Salzhausen!" they waved to say goodbye.
After arriving in Scots, the group was allowed to take a short break.
But in the evening the cyclists were challenged in the idyllic Alteburgpark.
Under the direction of the Scottish Society for Tourism and Urban Marketing (GTS), the park had received a nice festive ambience and, of course, treats were prepared, such as flame cakes with well-cooled feather whitener.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS Managing Director Markus Hoßfeld and MSC Chairman Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs in his capacity as a board member of ADAC Hessen-Thüringen welcomed the visitors.
The three were visibly pleased with the "many operation in Scots".
DJ Tobias Hagen then released the dance stage.
Despite the sporting activity on the bike, the opportunity for swinging movement in the open air was zealously used.
Among the guests were increasingly mixed citizens, who were as impressed by the good mood as the large crowd of cyclists.
On the second day, the cyclists attended the Birstein, Wächtersbach and Bad Orb stations - including a concert with the Trenwalders - on the program.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometers of cycling, the athletes arrived again in Bad Vilbel.
Dozens of Turkish police officers arrested for “conspiracy” against the government
A total of 33 police officers were arrested in Turkey on suspicion of “conspiracy against the government,” local media agencies reported.
The police did not make any immediate comments.
Among the detainees are 14 high-ranking police officers, reports Hürriyet Daily News.
Some of them were involved in the corruption investigations against government officials last December, including four government ministers.
In July, a number of Turkish police officers were arrested for allegedly establishing an organized criminal organization and tapping phone numbers.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was Prime Minister at the time) described her actions as part of the activities led by the Islamist clergyman Fethulla Güllen against him and other people in positions of power.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday (1 September) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenij Yazenyuk brought his daughter to school.
There, he told waiting journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held in every school.
The sky is not peaceful all over Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful heaven.
All of Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian people’s front must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pastukhow, headmaster of the school in Slavyansk, attending Yazenyuk's daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally be restored here and that the children will receive an education that will be useful to them in their future lives.
The first school day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, with the children wearing embroidered shirts, holding balloons in their hands and giving flowers to their teachers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director she needs.
It arrives with a proud fame drag from the banking world, the media management and the inner circle of the Tory party.
And she has her own front experience.
She began her career at the global management consulting firm Bain and Co., where she joined Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and Pearson’s media world.
She was on the board of directors of the Financial Times for seven years and resigned when the top post of the parent company Pearson went to a younger male colleague.
Their compensation was allegedly nearly <0xC2><0xA3>1 million.
Their political ranking is solid as well.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne, the former chairman of BP, when he was looking for more private-sector knowledge in Whitehall: she became the cabinet adviser.
Her husband is a former Tory council member.
Already in May, I described the task of the chairman with a poisoned cup.
Not only does the BBC stand as a huge and complex entity at the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
Confidence works in two directions: inwardly on the first guard of one’s own management hierarchy in the BBC, but also outwardly as a voice of public concern and unrest when things go wrong.
This creates an almost unsustainable duopole that demands a full and comprehensive reform.
But what newly-arriving chairman would risk stepping in, struggling with everything and dismantling an institution as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while perhaps getting himself around his job?
It is a difficult task.
And as if that wasn’t enough, many are also interested in seeing the BBC downsized – power, money and status outdated.
As competition approaches and new technologies threaten old, convenient collateral, the upcoming negotiation of the license fees for the BBC is associated with particular dangers.
For the modest sum of <0xC2><0xA3>145.50 per year, the British public is buying into the world’s certainly largest media company.
The BBC tells a good story: it says it reaches 96 percent of all households and costs only 40 pence a day.
And apparently, the BBC is rising again on the popularity scale: 53 percent support it today, compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.
The viewing and usage habits for the BBC have changed: I get news headlines on my phone these days and see missed programs later on my iPlayer.
But it remains a very beloved and respectable institution.
She needs a significant chairman - I hope she found him.
Perry from Texas says derogatory tweet was not authorized
A tweet from the official user account of Texas Republican Governor Rick Perry on Sunday contained a derogatory remark about the Democratic District Attorney, which is at the center of a criminal charge against him for abusing power.
The tweet was later deleted and replaced by another from Perry’s user account that denied the previous one.
A tweet has just been sent from my account that was not authorized by me.
"I don't approve of the tweet and have deleted it," the statement said.
Perry employees did not immediately respond to requests for comments.
Although the tweets came from Perry’s official user account, it was not clear who actually served the feed.
The earlier tweet drew an unfavorable picture of Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunk driving in April 2013.
Perry vetoed financial support for her office when she refused to resign, leading to a charge against Perry — who could possibly be a 2016 presidential candidate — before a grand jury in Austin this month.
"I don't always drive drunk with three times the permissible alcohol level ... but when I do, I accuse Governor Perry when he tells it out."
I'm the most drunk Democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office was not in charge of the Grand Jury investigation against Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio who was selected by a Republican judge.
Perry pleaded not guilty and called the charge a political trick.
His top-class team of lawyers applied to the judge in charge of the case to dismiss the indictment, arguing that the law proceeding against the oldest serving governor in the history of the state of Texas is unconstitutionally diffuse.
Perry stopped $7.5 million of state funds to the state’s Public Integrity Unit — which is based in Travis County and investigated in cases of state corruption in Texas — when Lehmberg refused to resign.
This veto caused a public complaint on the part of a left-wing watchdog group.
Perry’s official user account is frequently updated – and sometimes famous.
After finishing fifth at the Iowa election assemblies during his 2012 presidential candidacy, Perry responded to speculation that he would quit by posting a tweet of a photo of himself jogging near a lake, saying "South Carolina, we're coming!"
Berkeley declares housing market “normal” again
One of London's most prominent contractors pointed out that the housing market in southeast England has "returned to normal" levels.
Homes in the capital were hotly coveted and subject to enormous price hikes, which prompted the Bank of England to set limits for mortgage loans in June due to widespread fear of a credit bubble.
Tony Pidgley, founder and CEO of the high-class construction company Berkeley, said on Monday, “Since the beginning of the current fiscal year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the peak of 2013,” adding that this provides a “stable environment for action.”
The real estate market in London was well positioned during the downturn, as foreign buyers were pushing into the capital.
According to information from the cadastral office, prices in the urban area jumped by 18.5% in the past year alone, far more than the average increase in England and Wales overall.
Average retail prices for Berkeley’s private, inexpensive, and student offerings rose by about one-fifth last year and were around <0xC2><0xA3>423,000 at the end of April.
However, a stronger pound has made London property less attractive to foreign buyers in recent months – some of them have also been deterred by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric about a possible “villa tax” ahead of the general elections in May.
London-based real estate broker Foxtons warned last week that the April mortgage market report, which introduced tighter lending arrangements, would also lead to lower market growth in both real estate sales and prices in the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England on Monday show a decline in July’s mortgage licensing, which also indicates that the real estate market is cooling.
Hamptions International, another real estate agency, adjusted its forecast for London’s rise in real estate prices down to 3 percent for 2015, based on an already weakening house price awareness.
The volume of transactions in the most expensive areas of London such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has now declined by a quarter year after year, according to the broker WA Ellis.
Still, the desire for a home in the capital is a blessing for Berkeley as the amounts due for deadline sales amount to more than <0xC2><0xA3>2.2 billion.
Mr. Pidgley added, "Demand for the right, well-planned product at the best locations has remained stable and as a result, deadline sales have also remained stable."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year by the end of April – almost a third more than at the peak of 2007 before the crisis.
Annual pre-tax earnings rose by 40 percent to <0xC2><0xA3>280 million annually, and revenues by 18 percent to <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion.
In a statement Monday before the Company’s Annual Meeting, Mr. Pidgley said that revenues for Berkeley in the current year are expected to meet current market expectations.
Analysts consistently estimate annual pre-tax earnings at <0xC2><0xA3>450 million.
Berkeley shares were fixed at <0xC2><0xA3>23.96 in London trading in the afternoon.
Naked photos of Jennifer Lawrence posted by hackers
Jennifer Lawrence performs at the 85th Oscar Ceremony.
Naked photos of Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence were posted online by a hacker who claimed to have a “master list” of images of another 100 starlets.
A representative of the star from "The Tributes of Panem" confirmed that Lawrence's photos were genuine and accused the hacker of "sincere violation of privacy."
Authorities have been notified and will prosecute all those who continue to post the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos originally posted on the photo-sharing page 4chan were allegedly sourced from a gap in Apple’s online storage system iCloud. The alleged “master list” of hacking victims includes the names of dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, BuzzFeed reported.
It’s not sure how many of the images are real, though Winstead, star of “Scott Pilgrim Against the Rest of the World” on Twitter also condemned the hack.
"To those of you who are looking at photos that my husband and I took years ago in the private environment of our house - I hope you're really happy with yourselves," Winstead wrote on Twitter.
Victoria Justice from the Nickolodeon series "iCarly" and "Victorious", however, denied that the photos were pictures of her and tweeted "These so-called nude pictures of me are FALLED, folks.
Let’s start at the beginning. *Wordplay intended*.
Buzzfeed reported late Sunday that a spokesman for pop star Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of the alleged photos of her.
Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson's highly acclaimed new novel about love and the letter "J".
They disintegrated, so it could be best described, they slowly disintegrated like a cardboard box that you left in the rain.
Occasionally, a woman told him that he was too serious, exhausting, intense, distant, and perhaps a bit scratchy.
Then he shook his hand.
Scratch-brushed he knew.
He was spiky, like a hedgehog, yes.
The last victim of this stinginess was a recent affair that had been more promising than usual to alleviate the lonely boredom of his life, and perhaps even brought him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a tremblingly delicate beauty with untamed hair and a fluttering heart from a village on the North Island that was even more remote and rougher than Port Reuben.
She had come south with an elderly companion who thought beetles were her aunt, and who had inherited a plot of land in a damp but paradisiacal valley with the fitting name Paradise Valley.
No one had lived in the house for several years.
The pipes were leaking, in the baths there were still spiders, snails had left their marks on all the windows and believed that they owned it all, and the garden was overgrown with weeds that looked like huge cabbage heads.
It was like the house from a children's fairy tale, both threatening and tempting, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the longlist for the 2014 Man Booker Prize.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern had sat with Ailinn holding hands on the broken deckchairs in the high grass and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon. Both had absconded into the service console, which provided the country with soothing music and soothing messages. When the sight of their crossed brown legs reminded him of an old song of a black rolling long forgotten
Your feet are too big.
Due to their inherent aggressiveness, songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.
Not forbidden - Nothing was so forbidden - just not played.
It has been successfully obsolete, just as the word obsolete.
The general taste created what decrees and regulations had never achieved, and as people choose from books from plate washer to millionaire memoirs, cookbooks and romance novels, so they chose the ballads in music.
In the euphoria of the day, Kevern began to play an imaginary piano and sing Ailinn’s big feet in a roughly comic serenade.
Ailinn did not understand.
"That was a well-known song by a jazz pianist named Fats Waller," he explained to her, automatically putting two fingers on his lips.
His father had always done this to stop the letter J before it came out of his mouth.
It started as a game between him and his father when he was little.
His father had played it with his own father, he had told him.
If you start a word with a J without putting two fingers over your lips, it will cost you a penny.
It hadn’t been a very funny game at the time, and it wasn’t very funny now either.
He knew that this was expected of him, that was all.
It had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard of it.
Jazz was not played, even if it was not directly forbidden.
The improvisation was no longer modern.
There was only room for a single "if" in life.
People wanted to be sure at the beginning of a melody where it would end.
Likewise the mind.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was musically expressed mind.
Although he had turned 10 years old without hearing from Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about jazz from his father's semi-secret collection of old CDs.
But at least he didn't have to explain to Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
At her age, she probably couldn't remember a time when pop singers weren't black.
Again, there were no laws or constraints.
A compliant society meant that each element of that society gratefully agreed to the principle of group gifting—thankful as those spared by fate.
People of African-Caribbean descent were suitable for entertainment and sports through temperament and physique, so they sang and ran.
People originally from the Indian subcontinent were, as if by nature, blessed with electronic talent and were cared for with the task of ensuring that no family was left without a functioning service phone.
What was left of the Polish community took care of the sewerage; what was left of the Greeks smashed plates.
Those from the Gulf States and the Levant whose grandparents hadn’t left the country quickly when what happened when it happened—for fear of being charged with fire extinguishers, even for fear that the flames would consume them next—have kept the labneh and shisha whistle-blowing restaurants open.
Everyone according to their abilities.
Since she had only heard ballads, it was difficult for Ailinn to understand how the insulting words that Beethoven had just sung to her could ever be played.
Music was an expression of love.
"They're not really offensive," Kevern said.
Except for people whose feet are too big.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved this song.
He talked too much, but the neglected garden gave him the deceptive sense of security.
Nothing could overcome the sound insulation of the huge cabbage-like leaves.
Ailinn still did not understand.
Why would your father love something like this?
He wanted to say that it was a jux, but hesitated to put two fingers on her lips again in her presence.
She thought he was a little strange anyway.
"It seemed funny to him," he said instead.
She shook her head in disbelief and blocked Kevern’s sight.
There was nothing else to see around the world but her uncombed raven-black hair.
There was nothing else he would have wanted to see.
"If you say so," she means without conviction.
But that doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
She seemed honestly worried.
Are my feet too big?
He looked again.
Not your feet so straight.
Maybe your ankles, a little bit...
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
Hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It's just that stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you," but it was too early for that.
"Your thick ankles are exactly why I like you," he tried instead.
I'm a little perverted.
That didn't sound right.
It was supposed to be weird.
When he tried to be funny, he often got himself into trouble because, like his father, he did not have the soothing charm needed to curb the cruelty inherent in jokes.
Perhaps his father wanted to be cruel.
Maybe he wanted to be, Kevern, that.
Despite his friendly eyes.
Ailinn Solomons turned red and rose from her deckchair, threw down the console and spilled the wine they had been drinking.
Elderflower wine, so drunkenness wasn't an excuse for him.
In her excitement, she seemed to tremble like palm branches in a storm.
"And your stubborn head is exactly the reason I'm perversely attracted to you," she said.
Except that I'm not.
She felt sorry for him, both for the unnecessary rudeness of his words and for the fear that appeared in her eyes when she rebelled against him.
Did she think he would beat her?
She had not told him about life on the cold northern archipelago where she had grown up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially the same as here.
The same huge and ice-cold ocean broke up here as there on the shore.
The same confused men, with even thicker skin and more sad after what had happened when it had been their ancestors as smugglers and beach robbers, moved from pub to pub, always ready to raise their hand against a woman who refused or laughed at them.
Dickhead?
They'd have shown her a big fist if she didn't watch out!
They first cuddle - cuddle was the most commonly used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, an antidote to the meaningless love ballads from the console - they first cuddle and then beat.
In Kevern’s view, this was an unnecessary refinement, as cuddling itself was already an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons gave him a sign to go through her body.
He stood up from the chair like an old man.
She also felt bleeding, but the force of his grief surprised her.
This was not the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She watched him move away, just as her companion watched him from a room on the upper floor, a man complaining about something he himself had conjured up.
Adam left the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, although some had raised their hands against her.
A man turned away from her, his back bent, ashamed, defeated, without a fighting spirit – why was this a sight she seemed to know well, when she couldn’t remember a single time she had seen something like this before today?
When she was alone again, Ailinn Solomons looked at her feet.
A few years before the incidents just mentioned, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative monitoring body for the public sentiment, worked on a brief lecture on continued low- and middle-level violence in precisely the parts of the country where its reduction, if not abolition, was most likely to be expected in terms of the energy of this.
"A lot has already been done, and much still needs to be done," she wrote, "to appease the innate aggressiveness of a people who have waged a thousand wars and won most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country, where the sweet breath of human kindness has historically been rarely felt despite the high-calling church towers between the hedges.
But some traits turn out to be indestructible.
The higher the church tower, it seems, the lesser the passion it continues to awaken.
The people cry when they hear sentimental ballads, intoxicate themselves with stories about overcome difficulties and claim to believe firmly in the virtues of marriage and family life, yet not only does the former rawness hold the rural communities as well as our urban fabric firmly in their hands, but there is also evidence of the emergence of a new and devious conflict at home, on the streets, on the workplace.
"You have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate," her mentor said after reading the whole report.
I suggest you read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum lowered her head.
I also have to ask: are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to say that," replied Esme Nussbaum.
Are you a lesbian?
Once again, Esme relied on her right to privacy and denying the statement.
- Feminist?
Silence again.
"I don't ask that," Luther Rabinowitz finally said, "because I'm against atheism, lesbianism, or feminism.
This is a prejudice-free workplace.
We serve a prejudice-free society.
But certain types of hypersensitivity, which are absolutely acceptable and commendable in themselves, can occasionally distort results as you have imagined them.
You yourself obviously have prejudices against the Church, and these things you call “backward” and “raw” could just as well be interpreted by others as an expression of a natural power and vitality.
If you continue riding around on what is happening when it is happening, as if it had happened yesterday, it means taking away the country’s essential vitality.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, an LED lettering in Flamingorosa repeated the advice given by Ofnow to the country in the last quarter of a century or more.
Smile to your neighbor, appreciate your partner, listen to ballads, visit musicals, use their phone, speak, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence, the sung word is better than the written word, but nothing is better than love.
"I absolutely understand what you are going to say," replied Esme Nussbaum in a calm voice, as she was sure that her superior had finished speaking, "and I say nothing but that we have not yet been as effectively cured as we pretend to be.
My concern is that without warning we may find ourselves repeating the mistakes that only led to what happens when it happens.
This time, however, it is not the others that we omit our anger and distrust.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his hands.
To indicate an angelic patience.
"You go too far," he said, "if you call actions "faults" that our grandparents may or may not have committed.
You’re also going too far when you talk about them omitting their “rage” and their “mistrust” of “others.”
It should not actually be necessary to remind someone in your position that in understanding the past as well as protecting the present, we are not talking about “us” and “others.”
There was no “we” and there was no “other”.
It was a time of confusion, that's all we know.
"Of that, if we are honest with ourselves," Esme dared to throw in, "no part of society can claim to have behaved well.
I'm not accusing anyone.
Whether it has been done badly or well, what has happened has happened.
That was then.
There is nothing more to be said about this - we agree.
And just as no guilt has to be assigned, no guilt has to be repaid if such repayment is appropriate and if there is a way to repaid it.
But to what does the past serve if we don't learn from it -
The past serves to make us forget it.
If I can say something about it—
Luther Rabinowitz collapsed his pyramid.
"I'll consider her report," he said, dismissing her.
The next day, as she went to work as usual, she was run over by a motorcyclist who, as passers-by described, had driven on the footpath in a kind of "brutal rage".
There are coincidences.
Lesotho military member says no coup is planned; prime minister stays in South Africa
Officials of the military in Lesotho denied having planned a coup to overthrow the government, saying they were taking action against police officers accused of arming political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country, stating that the country’s army has surrounded its official residence and occupied government buildings in the capital, Maseru.
The prime minister brought his family to neighboring South Africa after reporting threats of assassination.
Military spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said there was no coup d'état in fact, but that the military was responding to the threat of "political fanatics" whose arming was imminent by the police.
“What happened this morning was that the Lesotho Defense Forces staff acted after receiving several intelligence reports that there were some elements within the police that actually wanted to arm some of the political, party-political young fanatics who were on the verge of causing devastating damage,” he told Voice of America.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the military action gave the impression of a coup.
"Even though no one has claimed to have seized the government by force, all reports agree that the activities of the Lesotho Defence Forces so far show signs of a coup d'état," he said.
Lesotho military spokespersons said on Sunday that the soldiers were retreating to their barracks and that the situation in the capital was calm.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoya Metsing will take over the leadership during Thabane's absence.
Thabane said he believes he has become a target for his attempts to fight corruption in the country.
In Lesotho, there have been great tensions since June, after Thabane suspended parliamentary sessions due to the clashes in his unity government.
He said his actions did not undermine the government, despite accusations that say otherwise.
Eurozone production at a 13-month low
The increase in production in the eurozone slowed to the lowest point in the last 13 months in August, according to a closely monitored study.
The final Markit Purchasing Manager Index of Manufacturing (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, down from 51.8 in July.
An indication over 50 indicates an expansion.
New orders fell and factories experienced breakdowns at a time of rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures arrive before the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting on Thursday.
Markets expect the bank to have a clear plan to deal with a delayed eurozone recovery and an imminent deflation at an inflation rate of only 0.3%.
There is speculation that the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could provide further details over the course of this week on whether he is considering quantitative relief for the eurozone, in line with those made by the UK and the US during the financial crisis.
"While small growth is better than no growth at all, the slowing effects of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties have become more apparent to manufacturers," said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.
The factory PMI for Germany, Russia’s largest trading partner in the EU, fell to its lowest level in 11 months at 51.4.
Meanwhile, the PMI fell to 46.9 in the block’s second largest economic nation, France.
France remains a child of worries, as is the decline of Italy from a solid expansion to stagnation.
Evidence that growth incentives in Germany's key industrial mechanism, as well as in Spain and the Netherlands, are also not reassuring," Mr Dobson said.
The decline in the industry is likely to fuel the fire of analysts who expect further monetary or fiscal incentives.
A positive news came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economics expert at IHS Global Insight, said: “The best thing to say about the August purchasing manager index of the eurozone manufacturing industry is that after that, the sector continues to grow.”
He added: “Producers in the eurozone are obviously finding life quite difficult right now, as the current heightened geopolitical tensions – especially with regard to Russia and Ukraine – increase uncertainties in the still difficult conditions in many countries.
These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - in particular, and consumer confidence, and are likely to cause some orders to be delayed or even cancelled, especially large orders.
He said that it is “more and more likely” that the ECB will eventually have to initiate some kind of QE, “although we suspect that this will be limited.”
The decade of hell of the survivors of Beslan: Ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school, as the children entangled in it still suffer today.
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militias in a school in Beslan in southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day martyrdom that shocked the world.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death in the atrocity in the classroom.
Exactly a decade after the horrific siege of the school of Beslan, which killed 334 people, including 186 children, the heroic survivors warned last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When fanatical Islamist terrorists captured and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, the beginning of a new school year, it seemed like the worst of evil.
The tragedy united West and East in disgust, and then surprisingly turned into action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst misery.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death in the atrocities in the classroom.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, even though the memory of this terrorist hell will persecute them forever.
Your greatest hope?
That the war that is now haunting Ukraine – and in which children like them die – is now coming to an end.
The girl who was photographed trying to climb back into the shot down school gym
She was photographed and famous by Russian star photographer Dimitri Beliakov when she was only trying to climb back into the school gym after a mine exploded in her underwear.
Completely confused, Aida was looking for her mother Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both were thought to be dead, but they survived.
"A woman told me to run for my life, but I couldn't," Aida said at the time.
My legs were overflowing with blood.
I got up and climbed back in to look for my mother.
A soldier took her to safety.
After a series of operations, she thought herself completely healed, but said yesterday: "Three months ago, the pain returned.
I'm afraid I'll have to have surgery again.
Some grenade splinters are still in my knee.
Her goal now is to become a dentist to help people, as she has been helped by doctors.
“This tragedy changed my life, but it didn’t break me,” she says.
"That happened to me, and you can't change that.
Once a year, I always go to the gym to remember those who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were little and dreamed of going to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish my studies and start my career.
I’ll think of a family later.
She says that the siege will always remain a part of her, although the memory gets a little weaker every year.
I am glad that many people around the world still remember our horrors and we are so grateful for the help we have received from people in the UK and everywhere.
When I see the photo of myself climbing back to school online, I think a lot of people see it for the first time, understand our disaster, and help keep something like this from happening again.
The boy who fled through the bullet hail, thinking his mother was dead
It was his first day of school (Russians go to school at age 7) and survived the three-day siege in the arms of his mother Tamara.
When he was seven years old, he said, "Mom told me to lie down if there was an explosion and hold her hand."
After an explosion, he thought she was going to die.
She said to him, "Run."
Afraid that she might be dead, he fled and saw a weeping toddler on the way, grabbed it by the hand and fled through a hail of bullets.
His father, Vladimir, who hugged his son outside, said: "Damir told me that his mother had died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In reality, Tamara had stumbled outside and had been hospitalized with leg injuries, in turn, assuming that her son had died.
After her reunion, she said, "I cried for joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later flown to London (from the now dissolved News of the World newspaper) to receive the title of Barnardo's Children's Champion from then-Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror is chasing you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering," he said yesterday.
But I can say it's getting paler in my memory.
I remember throwing away all my toy guns right afterwards.
But now I can play computer games with shooting scenes and that is no problem for me.
“I’m not afraid to go back to the gym, but I’m not thinking about myself.
I remember those kids I played with in the yard, and they didn't make it out.
We never say they were killed or dead.
We say they stayed in the gym.
I remember very well my trip to London, especially the toy store, where I could choose anything I wanted, and the ride in an upstairs open car.
But now he is afraid of places like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of misfortune he and his friends suffered.
This horror is chasing you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I am so sorry for all those who suffer from the atrocities," said Damir, who worked as a volunteer in a monastery last week.
I want so much to help.
I want to go to the police one day and hope they take me to the training academy next year.
His mother, Tamara, 48, said, "37 children from our neighborhood were killed, can you imagine?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there were simply no children who could call and walk around, and that silence lasted for many months.
She vividly remembers her trip to London with Damir.
People in London were crying when I told our story.
At the time, I understood how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the award and the opportunity to travel to London in autumn 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and just tell her that 10 years have passed, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London, and how that helped Damir and me.
I still remember how Damir wanted to eat borscht and they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember him playing with waiters in a restaurant, and Damir shot his water gun at them, and they ran away and played with him.
And that was just a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said: “I always think that this world hasn’t gotten any better in these 10 years.
In Ukraine, the war continues now, and people die every day, and I believe that many children have been killed and are still being killed.
These are just children like ours.
I think that for many, war is part of the news they hear when they are bored or busy with something else.
I just know what these people are feeling, all the horror.
And I can't stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other and that’s so sad.
Damir grew up and is a very gentle and calm boy, he is not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he is not looking for revenge, he is not overwhelmed by the abominations of the past.
I know he doesn’t like to remember it, but he has six close friends from the class and they occasionally go to the gym and light candles there.
When he was younger, he suffered from it - I remember sometimes lying on the sofa, turning his face away from us, for hours.
He was not asleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember him throwing away all his weapons and other military toys. Damir is now 17, bigger than I am, handsome, intelligent and healthy.
I can't believe I was so sure for a few hours that he was dead and I would never see him again.
As I recovered from the explosion and got on my feet, I looked around and saw the hell around me, with body parts all around.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy could not have survived in this hell.
“I remember shouting to him, ‘Damir, run, run away,’ but I was also so sure he hadn’t heard me.
But he heard it, and he ran away.
And so life, unlike many others, continues for us.
Georgiy Ilyin, 17
The boy whose terrible image became the symbol of the abominations of Beslan after the siege
Consolation: The Beslan survivor Georgiy Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege in 2004, a picture of Georgiy on the right today
His bloody face was marked by fear as he ran for his life while Chechen terrorists shot down his classmates.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols of Beslan’s barbarism.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, had dropped him off for his first day of school before she hurried off to take her elder son Vladimir to university.
"I left the yard about two minutes before the terrorists stormed him, and so my little boy stayed there alone for three terrible days," she recalls.
Not quite alone, there was an entire family of relatives of ours, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgij managed to survive.
The closer this date gets, the harder it is to think about it and talk about it.
There is not a single day that we do not remember this tragedy.
We don’t think it’s been a long time, I mean, it would have happened yesterday, some scenes from these days keep haunting me.
No one will ever forget it, I promise.
The image of Georgy (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (right).
I remember that Georgij wanted so much to go to school that day, he said he wanted to embrace his teacher.
I didn't know he was alive until I saw him on TV.
And now there is even this statue of the crying Georgian in San Marino.
Georgij does not like to see the picture, and it is hidden in the bookshelf at our home.
I understand this, but I also mean that people all over the world feel our pain thanks to this image.
Georgij says today: "It is important that such a thing can never happen again.
"I doubt that we will ever know the truth.
People investigate such tragedies over and over again and never learn the truth.
And now they are investigating the crash of this Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever find out what caused it?
This world is becoming something terrible.
"I can't understand how this is possible, because if you ask people, nobody wants a war, so how does that happen?
Ten years is nothing with such pain.
It takes us dozens of years to forget it a little bit.
It has affected my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years I had some nightmares about the siege, but then it got better.
I went back to school later in 2004 and was scared every day.
I thought of my friends and classmates who had been killed.
That’s why I always go to the sports hall as September 1 approaches.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friend.
It’s hard for me to go to the gym, but I have to do it.
I don’t feel like a victim, this story is now part of my past.
I won't forget it, but I'm not sorry.
My life goes on.
I graduated from school this year and attend a medical college in Vladikavkaz.
I'm gonna be a heart surgeon.
My first choice was training in the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health did not allow it.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that will not happen.
Georgiy Fanyev, 20
The Boy Who Survived Though He Was Caught At The Feet Of A Murderous Terrorist
A miracle: Georgy Faniev was captured at the feet of a murderous terrorist during the siege, but he managed to survive.
During the siege, he was trapped in the gym and sat next to the bomb attached to the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It's really a miracle that he wasn't killed.
"We feel like it was yesterday," says Georgij, who wanted to go to the FSB as a intelligence officer but could not because of his health damage due to the siege.
It's still with me, it's nothing I've left behind.
I'm older now and people say kids can easily deal with bad experiences - I have to say that's not true.
“In 2006, I worked with psychologists and I actually felt a little better afterwards, but I can’t forget.
And I'd like to forget.
2005 - the year after - was the first and only time I went back to the gym.
I lost consciousness.
I will never return there again and please do not ask me to show you where I sat in this famous picture.
Survivor: Georgiy Faniev today, with a photo of himself in the hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is tremendous and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know that I don’t like to think about it or talk about it and they never asked me about school.
I'm fine physically.
I should be careful with my injured knee, but I can run well now.
But because of my health, I couldn’t study at the FSB’s intelligence academy in Saint Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent my documents, including the medical, and they replied that it was not possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I've been there for two years.
He learns the treatment of all animals "from cats to cows".
He said: “I knew I would never tell my children about my experiences.
Children should know nothing about it and of course they should not suffer it either.
His mother Marina, 42, said, "This pain never leaves me.
It's in my soul, worse as the anniversary approaches.
I will go to the celebrations to commemorate.
I know Georgy won't go.
It's got to be a lot harder for him because he was there and I wasn't.
I was waiting for him at home and could not help.
I am so thankful to God that he was given back to me.
It remains within us.
Georgij is now an adult, but this horror is still in him.
It's hard to accept that when something so unfair happens to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't participate because of his knee.
He has been operated on several times, he can run, but he can't do sports.
I would say that he has overcome the horror at 50%, but you can never completely overcome and forget that.
This terrible experience will always haunt us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed in the siege and that only exacerbates my pain.
I lost a lot of people I knew well and who were dear to me.
My Son is with me, and this is the greatest gift that God could give me, but my heart is crying for the dead.
I know of families where new children were born, but also of widows who never got married again.
It’s hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don’t want to.
I will never forget how my heart jumped in me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what is going on in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is now very close to our country and I can hardly believe it.
We used to be a friendly country, how can we fight now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure that many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many are still being killed.
If only we could grab all these rebels and throw them out as far away as possible.
Alyona Tskayeva, 10 years old
The baby so poignantly carried to safety by a special operations force
Rescued: Aljona Tskayeva is brought to safety by a Russian Special Operations Command (left).
She is now ten (right) and does not remember the atrocities at all.
The world held its breath in 2004 when the baby Aljona was carried in the arms of a Russian policeman from the siege of Beslan.
The terrorists let her go, but in their cruelty held back her 30-year-old mother, 10-year-old sister Kristina and her brother Makhar in the school gym.
Makhar, then three years old, escaped, but Aljona’s mother and sister died in the murderous slaughter.
Her father Ruslan has since remarried and has a little girl with his new wife Svetlana, whom he named after his lost daughter Kristina.
Aljona, now ten years old, does not remember the siege and has grown into an intelligent and happy girl, neighbors say.
"They are now a great happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to spare them all the memories that come up with the tenth anniversary.
You will understand why.
Man Accused of Driving Girls on Pedestrian Crossing in Fife
A 78-year-old man is on trial for driving over a three-year-old girl on a pedestrian crossing in Fife.
Gordon Steward is accused of hitting a girl on the transition in Pittenween in East Neuk.
The indictment states that Mr. Steward controlled his Audi Q3 without the necessary care and attention and injured the girl.
Stewart, 78, from Anstruther, denied the accusation before the Dundee Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC started the trial for January.
4 Tips for Better Underwater Photos and Videos
If you would like to take photos or videos underwater, there is a choice of devices.
The cheapest option is a waterproof point-and-shoot, like the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action cam like the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which are available for about $300.
I took these photos at a family party with multiple cameras, all available at a price of less than $350.
Regardless of the equipment, there are a few rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the battery compartment and other compartments are tightly sealed.
Also set your camera to the photos or videos you want to take.
Some cameras and camcorders have scene and shooting modes that optimize exposure time for damp underwater conditions.
And before you jump in, check to what depth your equipment is functional.
Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.
Look in our shopping guide and reviews for digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models.
Take multiple shots - because many won't work.
Point-and-shoot cameras have an LCD that allows you to compose images, action cams usually don’t.
Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to see this underwater, and the right image setting is a matter of luck.
So you do a lot of recordings.
If your camera has a row mode that takes a series of shots with slightly altered exposure settings, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light gets dramatically worse the further you move away from the surface.
So if possible, stay close to the surface when shooting in a pool, a lake or the sea.
This also allows you to add more color to your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Go close to the objects.
This is also a good advice on land, but it is all the more important underwater because of the poor lighting conditions.
It’s especially important when working with an action cam: these devices often have a fixed wide-angle lens, which means you need to get closer to your objects if you want them to fill out the entire picture frame.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the kind whose character changed things, even in such a gigantic organization as the NHS.
As a consultant anesthesiologist, he devoted his career to the task of saving the sick from both the agony of the disease and the agony of treatment.
Among his patients, his wife recalls, was a MI6 employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that the diagnoses and diseases are important to doctors, while those treated are mostly concerned with something completely different: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one whose path of suffering began.
"I didn't feel it," he wrote in May of this year.
I had trouble getting up.
While struggling with the flu-like symptoms, he noticed that he was impatiently blaming his wife Juliet.
"I'd rather do it immediately than later," he noted.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt quite unusually and for no reason worried.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to do an X-ray of his chest.
Only two weeks ago he had been skiing in the French Alps.
The result of the X-ray examination was available.
He suffered from mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that attacks the thoracic skin, that is, the skin that covers the lungs.
As with most cancers, the exact trigger is usually difficult to determine.
For example, while some smokers develop lung cancer, not all lung cancer sufferers have been former smokers.
But mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is an asbestos contamination - contact with the fiber building material, which was once considered a "miracle material", but has since been recognized as deadly.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a condition that can be easily ignored.
Asbestos is a product of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in the UK since the 1960s, when the industry voluntarily pledged to stop using it.
Even where it was still used, only people in certain industries worked directly with the fabric - plumbers, construction workers, carpenters and shipyard workers, for example.
As an industrial hazardous substance from another time, it seems to be scarcely worrying today.
But this self-satisfaction is inappropriate.
Britain, it seems, is experiencing the climax of a mesolthelioma epidemic today.
There are more deaths from mesothelioma here than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, twice as many people die from this disease as in road accidents.
Annual numbers of mesothelioma deaths since 1980 and expected future deaths in the UK
The reason we are experiencing the deadly effects now, even though asbestos has been illegal for years (in 1999, all types of asbestos were banned), is that mesothelioma develops only after decades.
And the scourge of mesothelioma is not limited to former workers in the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and is often still, present in the homes we live in, the offices we work in, the schools we study in, and the shops we shop in.
And therefore mesothelioma has no class barriers, financial boundaries, professions or age.
The privileged bastions, from the elegant department stores in London to private schools, are not a shelter.
Parliament buildings are asbestos-poisoned.
Even in the hospitals where we are supposed to recover, we have already been identified as the source of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He was also not a plumber.
In fact, it was difficult for him to imagine where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found out.
"It looks like there was a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I was training for six years," he wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and porters - use the tunnels.
One wonders how many of my peers will suffer from the same disease?
Unfortunately, he was able to answer this question at least in part.
“Of the four doctors trained at Guy’s Hospital who have been suffering from mesothelioma in the last five years,” he wrote in a 2010 letter, “I’m the last one still alive.”
How many of us will still get sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma at the age of 48.
When he died on February 17 this year, he was 55.
It was an unusually long survival time.
Fifty percent of all mesotheliomeric patients die within 8 months of diagnosis.
The disease always ends deadly.
Therefore, we can only repeat Lawson’s question: “How many of us will still fall ill?”
The UK’s leading expert on mesothelioma, Professor Julian Peto, assumes that between 1870 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic is expected to come to a halt in the UK, a total of 90,000 will have fallen victim to the disease.
Most of them have no idea yet that they will die like this.

A brief look at the files of the courts, to which the persons concerned often turn for claims for damages, shows how far the scourge of mesothelioma is already widespread.
In June of this year, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted to having negligently exposed Janice Allen to asbestos.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, and was in charge of the clothing department at two locations – one of the flagship stores on Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years old when she started working at M&S.
Now she has two children in her twenties.
"Before this thing," she says, "I had never heard of mesothelioma, I didn't even really know anything about asbestos.
I never thought that would affect me.
There are few people who know a lot about asbestos.
The fact is that the term asbestos refers not to a substance but to a group of six minerals.
The name derives from the word "asbestiform", a description of the fiber structure that makes the fabric resistant and flexible.
Three out of six were used in the construction industry.
Chrysotil, also known as white asbestos, is by far the most common asbestos found in buildings today.
It has been used for roof panels, floor panels, pipe insulations, boiler insulations, even for brake pads in cars.
It is less deadly than other forms of asbestos, but is still regarded by the EU and WHO as a "great health risk" with potential fatalities.
However, the more dangerous is the brown asbestos (amosite) and the blue asbestos (crokydolite).
The UK was once the world’s largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suspect that “there is clear but indirect evidence that this was a major reason for the uniquely high mesothelioma rates.”

Janice Allen may not have seen herself as a typical mesotheliom victim, but the work of Julian Peto suggests that her story is by no means unusual.
He has presented a study of those affected, which shows that "a significant proportion of mesotheliomas without known exposure to work or in-house were presumably caused by asbestos contact in the environment."
Much of these contacts are based on the "normal use and aging" of our buildings.
It looks like no one can assume to be safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which has examined the Palace of Westminster, shows how people, even in the heart of the government, may have been unknowingly exposed to the substance.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the service shafts and pipelines behind Parliament's committee rooms were contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibers could be swirled up by something as harmless as "strong air movements".
Members of parliament are often accused of caring for their own interests, but here it seems to be the opposite.
While the Directorate of Parliamentary Labour Service insisted that the Westminster Palace had received a "clean health certificate", it is now undeniable that <0xC2><0xA3>1 billion of labor has to be spent over several years to renovate the parliament, modernize the electrical installations and remove the asbestos, and that after the 2015 general elections, MPs are likely to meet at the QE in the nearest corner of the country.
The Goddard report also pointed out that "the presence of asbestos was not handled in accordance with the respective regulations."
No one can know if this mismanagement will cost lives.
All you can do now is wait.
One person who could never accurately determine contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, 50-year-old Abbott suspects he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
“I worked in a hospital where asbestos lawsuits were positively decided,” he says, “but I can’t prove it in my case.
It’s so hard to remember all the places you’ve been working on and the dates.
What he still remembers is the day at the beginning of December 2009, when he got such a kind of fever.
He was 45 years old and had an operation late at night.
Suddenly I had chills.
It came all of a sudden.
I felt terrible.
I didn't think I could make the drive home any more.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain stemmed from the chest skin, the skin around his lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect mesothelioma.
He didn’t go to work for a month.
Surprising doctors took X-rays of his chest and used pleural cats to extract fluid from the lungs and test it in the lab.
However, his complaints remained without a diagnosis.
His health gradually improved, and he returned to work.
However, from time to time the symptoms returned, often after exercise and intense breathing.
In 2011, a patient Abbotts came to his practice with similar symptoms and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But even now Abbott did not connect this with his own case.
After all, his patient was a few decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in the case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition worsened again, and his family doctor brought his CT scans and X-rays to an expert group.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott first felt ill, a camera-equipped probe was inserted into the cavity between the rib and chest skin.
I am an optimist.
I usually just keep going," he says.
Honestly, I didn’t worry so much.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy occurred in the week between Christmas and New Year: "I was told it was mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis of mesothelioma
Suddenly, Abbott had appointments with Macmillan nurses, one of whom recommended him to get a lawyer.
It was only now that he understood the extent of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings where pipes were often insulated with asbestos," he says.
The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now falling ill.
And so mesothelioma now meets younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous pipes with asbestos insulation in hospitals were underground, so patients were probably not exposed to the substance.
But many employees who moved from one building to another in pedestrian tunnels (such as Andrew Lawson) or ate in underground canteens (as Graham Abbott often did) were most likely in contact with the toxic substances.
It turns out that over several decades after the war, hospitals were potentially life-saving for the patients, but life-threatening for the attending doctors.
It is still removed today.
Students placed their Bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
And it’s not just about hospitals.
Due to its fabulous insulating and flame retardant properties, asbestos has been widely used in offices, shops, libraries and city halls.
Also schools.
In fact, many people have probably had the first asbestos contact in the classroom.
Throughout the country, in thousands of chemistry hours, students have placed their Bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
Asbestos in schools is now frequently discussed on websites.
And meanwhile, such innocent items in our homes as floor slabs or shed roofs have contained asbestos as standard.
"It's an industrial poison contained in much of our real estate," notes Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his trial against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact that occurred to a woman affected was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.
So be careful how you tear down your garden shed.
The impact of diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is incurable, is immense.
“It takes a while to process that,” says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I realized I couldn’t concentrate on what I was doing.
I was in practice for two weeks.
Then I knew I had to leave and take care of myself.
Well, I'm not going to see another Christmas.
The greatest difficulty was the change of perspective from the position of a doctor to that of a patient.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers how overwhelmed he was by all the information he had to deal with.
"It was very hard to take it all up," he says.
“I asked my doctor, ‘How long do I have?’
And they gave me about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to see another Christmas.
That's it then."
Mesothelioma is particularly insidious because it is our life support mechanism—breathing itself—that causes the deadly cancer.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbestos is made from the smallest fibers.
When the asbestos is swirled up and the fibers are inhaled, they can settle in the chest skin, the skin around the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the thoracic skin and can trigger cell mutations.
"The problem arises with the inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibers," said Professor Tom Treasure, a heart-thorax physician who moved to Guy's Hospital in 2001.
The very hospital that Andrew Lawson suspects has exposed him to asbestos is now, ironically, a leading center in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated several others who were also likely exposed to asbestos during their hospital education.
Once the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue, Treasure says, “they are pushed from the breathing process to the edge where the skin is.
It is inherently invasive from the beginning.
The usual options for other cancers do not work as well with mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of an operation, for example, is hotly disputed.
Some people think it’s worth a try.
Treasure denies that.
"You can't cut out the chest skin," he says.
You can't get around with the knife.
Meanwhile, the cancer "does not respond very well to chemotherapy," which "shows effect," but does not heal.
“Sometimes there are long-term survivors,” Treasure says.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients actually live long, much longer than expected.
Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after being diagnosed.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still struggling.
After contacting mesothelioma, Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson, who had become a one-man support and counseling office for fellow sufferers four years after his diagnosis.
"Hello, Cancer Center," he introduced himself cheerfully on calls.
"He was very positive," Abbott says.
He had received his diagnosis four years earlier and was still very active.
Initially, Abbott had been offered six chemotherapy cycles that lasted four months and were expected to extend his life by only one month.
“I was desperate,” he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, managed to "make things appear in a slightly more positive light."
After consulting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, heart-thorax specialist at Guy's.
"We had an advantage in not having to be referred, I just called and got an appointment," Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to receive a referral and wait for approval of treatment.
Money is crucial for mesothelioma patients to be able to take advantage of the best available therapies.
But when these treatments inevitably fail in the end, many sufferers are faced with another financial concern – about the future of the families they leave behind.
And so they turn to the courts in hopes of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
“It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous to health,” says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s was that they realized that even a very low level of exposure was a health risk.
And here the negligence of the companies began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually filed their case, but it wasn't what Morgan calls a "full compensation," as Lawson couldn't prove with absolute certainty that his mesothelioma was due to an asbestos contact at Guy's.
However, after the investigation into his death, a Guy's spokesman confirmed that "the asbestos fibers in the affected cellar area were removed in the 1990s."
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
In fact, for mesothelioma patients seeking compensation, it is a huge problem to assign the fatal asbestos contact to a company or workplace - usually decades after the incidents.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance documents can be lost.
And those who oppose claims know that the time is for them, but certainly not with the plaintiffs.
In response, there were significant new legislations this year that makes it easier for mesothelioma sufferers to file a claim for compensation, even if their former employers are no longer available.
The law has set up an insurance industry-funded fund of <0xC2><0xA3>350 million for anyone diagnosed after July 2012 who can prove contact but cannot sue anyone.
In these cases, the plaintiffs receive 80 percent of what a court could have awarded them in a normal damages process - about <0xC2><0xA3>120,000.
Approximately 300 successful applications to the program are expected per year.
Andrew Morgan, like so many mesothelioma sufferers, thinks that <0xC2><0xA3>350 million was a “very good job” in the insurance industry.
"This is a deal of insurers for insurers," he says, suggesting that this sum is a quarter of what insurers would have had to pay if time hadn't passed and mesothelioma sufferers could find the companies and sue them normally.
Mike Penning, then Minister of Labour and Pensions, also admitted that the law was “not perfect.”
But both Penning and Morgan admitted that in the face of seven deaths every day, quick action was needed.
"People suffer so much and need help today," Penning said during the second hearing of the Mesothelioma Act in December last year.
At that time, Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After her initial consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended surgery, which he expects to have a positive effect unlike Tom Treasure.
This was accompanied by radiation therapy and chemotherapy – a triple therapy that allows Lang-Lazdunski to present a survival rate of up to 40 percent over five years.
Abbott felt strengthened.
"That's the most important thing, of course," Abbott says.
This can be seen again and again in patients.
There's something there that's going to keep you going.
If you give up, you get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent surgery in March 2012.
At the end of August, he had completed the last of the six chemotherapy cycles.
Aftercare scans showed no signs of the disease.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer stains around my chest.
I just turned 50.
This is not life-threatening.
That's life-ending.
Once again, Abbott underwent six chemotherapy cycles.
Now no trace of the tumors is visible.
But the process is physically and mentally very strenuous.
You need to think about practical things - about the money when I am no longer, for example, or show my wife how the boiler time setting works.
If you get bad news, you become negative.
You have to look forward.
As the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, it's not always easy.
"It's hard for parents," he says.
It’s hard to know what to say and how much.
When I received my first diagnosis, I told my girls that I had a disease that I would not grow old with.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin is very sociable and impetuous.
She told her friends and we soon got a lot of calls.
Ellie was more restrained.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients have to go through.
But for mesotheliomeric patients, such conversations are not interspersed with hope, not a trail of hope for survival.
The disease brings (as in the end for Stephen Jay Gould) a grim safety.
As Andrew Morgan says, “Mesothelioma is not life-threatening.

China denies Hong Kong right to government elections, protesters swear retaliation
On Sunday, despite the increased calls for democratic reforms, the Chinese parliament voted against the nomination of candidates for the 2017 elections by the Hong Kong electorate.
This is likely to fuel the long-announced protests in Hong Kong’s business district, while activists initiated planning and mobilization within hours of the announcement.
The decision of the Chinese People’s Congress basically allows the Communist leaders to reject all non-Peking candidates.
"This doesn't come unexpectedly, but it makes us angry," said law expert Emily Lau, president of the Democratic Party.
This is not what Beijing promised.
The people of Hong Kong have been lied to.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In his defense of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, deputy general secretary of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, said admitting public nominations to the elections would be too “chaotic” for the Hong Kong government.
Since 1997, when the United Kingdom returned control of Hong Kong to the Chinese, Beijing has pledged to allow residents to elect the presidency from 2017.
The Chinese leadership presented Sunday’s decision as a democratic breakthrough because it gives Hong Kong citizens direct suffrage, but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leadership is firmly in control of the process through a Beijing-strictly controlled nomination committee.
According to a new clause, only candidates will be admitted “with love for the country and love for Hong Kong”.
The decision follows a summer in which some of Hong Kong’s largest and most popular protests in several years took place.
Behind the pro-democratic campaign in Hong Kong is the movement Occupy Central With Love and Peace, whose organizers have threatened to shut down the financial district if Beijing does not allow genuine universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, within hours of the announcement, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters had gathered in the rain in front of the government headquarters in Hong Kong.
At the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement had reached a new level of civil disobedience and they were planning waves of protest in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any further details, apparently to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online announcement, the organizers said that the movement "considered the occupation of the central district only as a last resort, an action that should only take place when all opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted and there is no other choice.
We are sorry to say that today all the opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted and the occupation of the central district will definitely take place.
Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing’s announcement for days, and tightened security measures including police forces and barricades were in place in front of the government building on Sunday.
The unrest is exacerbated by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their city.
The influx of people from the mainland increases competition for products and services.
In addition, fears are growing that Hong Kong’s values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are beginning to crumble under Beijing’s growing pressure.
Some criticized the demonstrations of the Occupy Central movement for endangering the business operation – the lifeline of Hong Kong.
“The protests they’re talking about could cause great economic damage depending on how many are involved and how long they last,” said legal expert Regine Ip, who has been criticizing the movement for a long time.
We do not want to stir fears that Hong Kong will get out of control.
This impression is bad for investments.
China’s state-controlled media also recently reported on Hong Kong’s democracy activists as Western power-controlled subversive agents.
This summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on electoral rights, in which 780,000 people participated – more than one-fifth of the voters in Hong Kong.
In July, tens of thousands of people participated in one of the largest democracy demonstrations in the region’s history.
The tradition of school graduation balls in the US is now being transferred to the universities, where freshmen are offered performances by private airplane.
We look forward to responding to this demand and offering the UK’s first luxurious travel service for students today.
In order to achieve a particularly impressive performance at the university, the company also offers transportation options such as private planes, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr Stewart also stated that the service has a security division.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have to carriage their belongings through the country in a dangerously overloaded car.
Together with our new VIF options, we look forward to ensuring that students reach the university with a minimum of effort and maximum of luxury this year.
A company spokesman said that no new bookings are yet to be made, as the service has just been launched, but added that “students will book the service in the next few weeks.”
The company also said it expects a market for this offer despite the tuition fees of <0xC2><0xA3>9,000 per year.
Students today are very different in their expectations and demands from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can do just that.
However, the National Student Union criticized the service as being outdone.
Megan Dunn, NUS Vice President of Higher Education, said: “This offer seems completely separate from the lives of the majority of students.
Many students who start studying this month are facing a crisis in the cost of living as the available grants in the form of loans and scholarships do not keep up with the sharply rising bills for the simplest means of life before they can even think of spending thousands of pounds on something as simple as arriving at the student residence.
Feminists Criticize Racial Issue and Police Behavior After Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, MO earlier this month.
Participants raised their hands in the air and sang, "Hands up, don't shoot," while waiting for the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, over the shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in online discussions of white feminists.
According to their experience, white feminist commentators put gender ahead of race when it comes to addressing reproductive rights and income inequalities.
However, while tensions were rising in the Midwest and gaining attention across the country, Perez saw that white women’s responses revolved 100% around the race.
Compared to the responses of black women shortly after the August 9 shootings, personal essays came relatively late with titles such as “Thoughts on Ferguson by a White Woman” and “Feminism isn’t just about oppression of women.”
But for Perez, that was an important change.
"I don't think there are many people in feminism who talk about being white and privileges in such a high-class way," she said.
People felt compelled to express something about the incidents.
It is characteristic of the crisis we are in and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnicized that they have to express that.
For professor of English Koritha Mitchell of Ohio State University, Ferguson revealed problems faced by black American women every day, but not considered “women’s issues” in the cultural space.
“I can post something funny on Facebook about myself and my partner and get 150 likes from anywhere,” Mitchell said.
When I post something about how people of color are under siege in their own country, the silence is deafening.
"How can it be safe for women to talk about a relationship in public, but not about public safety?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell who have studied race, gender, and sexuality in U.S. history, there is no dichotomy between race and gender issues.
For them, black women have not had the luxury of separating themes cleanly; they live in combined reality every day.
While white women now connect the issues of race and gender in the feminist mainstream circles, Angela Hattery, professor of women and gender studies at George Mason University, says her predecessors did the opposite.
“Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched and the reasoning was almost always the rape of a white woman,” Hattery said.
White women had to be involved in history to justify the lynching.
For Hattery, the split between white and black women came to the point where white women for women’s suffrage such as Susan B. Anthony analyzed the country in the late 19th century and found that the struggle for suffrage could only be successful for one group at a time: women or blacks.
"They made the decision to advocate for women's suffrage, and the suffrage for blacks should come later," Hattery said.
When you remember such things, you become powerfully aware of why colored women don’t trust white women.
We didn't do our job well.
We have never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women were granted suffrage in 1920, it took a decade for white women to organize against lynching in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group emerged nearly 40 years after the original request for help from black women, Mitchell says.
For Mitchell, the tide of white feminist reactions to Ferguson’s issues – police behavior, racial discrimination – is a mirror of the time when white feminists were playing “catches” with the problems that black women have been dealing with for generations.
"Wouldn't it be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms take the right to raise a child as seriously as they do with the right to control conception?" asked Mitchell.
Second-generation feminists, who built their careers on the struggle for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives, are now trying to understand what that means.
The well-known white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went on Facebook two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown and published a pointed article by Rebecca Carroll, columnist for the Guardian, calling for more protests from white Americans on the subject of racism.
"I hope that women who have a different but parallel reason to understand a body's inherent danger - and opinions on race that are clearly different in public polls - will lead the changes," Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem stands for an intersectional feminism that addresses racial and gender issues, some of her comments on the racial theme in America are astonished.
Christina Sommers, a researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Stole Feminism?" told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young men of color, "are far more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinem's remarks on Ferguson are contrary to her earlier criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently launched a small program, My Brother’s Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, there were annoying reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The relationship between the police and the black community is not the only problem that is pushing into the foreground of mainstream feminism.
After the U.S. Border Police picked up nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors on the country’s southwest border this year, the issue of immigration reform is also coming to the surface – this time as a women’s issue.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women for immigration reform, said that for a re-evaluation of the topic as an essential women’s theme, all they need to do is publish the stories of migrant women.
"They speak for themselves," said Mercado.
When the vast majority of work visas go to male immigrants, the women who accompany them are in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories find echo in women's organizations," she said.
"Pig House" in Ipswich is for sale
The picture of a house for sale was removed by real estate agents when it became clear that it was showing a big pig that had made it comfortable in the living room.
The detached house has one bedroom, is located on a private road in Ipswich and is offered for <0xC2><0xA3>120,000.
The details included a picture of the living room of the house - which also included a pig who had his head bedded on a sofa.
Real estate agent Connells said the pig in the photo was the owner's pet.
"However, the photo was incorrectly published and has since been removed," a spokeswoman for the company said.
In the house's exposé, Connells described the former assembly house as a "unique one-bedroom single-family house."
Although the broker removed the image from the website, it still appears on promotional material.
The house sale caused interest on social media when some asked if the pig was included in the purchase price.
The SW city of Harvey is home to a new millionaire after winning the lottery
A lottery player from Harvey is on this month
The search for a new millionaire in southwest Perth continues, with a lucky winner receiving nearly $1.1 million from the Saturday lottery draw.
A newspaper kiosk in Harvey pulled the jackpot in the first division draw for the second time in five years, after $1 million in November 2009.
However, the lucky winner still has to report.
Store owner Steve Forward said the profits will provide conversational material in the small town in southwest Perth.
The city is talking about nothing else, and everyone is pretty excited.
We thought that such a gain could occur.
Eight WA winners celebrated first division wins last month, a fitting conclusion for a few happy weeks for players in the state.
Last week, a player from Canning Vale became one of the five millionaires in August after a couple from Belmont made the $7.5 million mega profit just weeks earlier.
The winning couple had been playing for twenty years, saying that winning allowed them the opportunity to travel around the world and buy a new house.
The Harvey millionaire is the 59th winner of the first division in the WA this year, with a total of nearly $85 million.
Leonidas batted in the gladiator arena
Not only the gladiators stood in the mud at the first Rheinbacher Römertag in the amusement park.
But the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract well over 1,000 visitors yesterday, who defied the rain showers and the autumnal cold and were completely delighted by the historical spectacle.
There was a colorful series of representations, performances, games, exhibits and information about the time of the Romans and their significance for the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martial fighter force from the "Amor Mortis" gladiator school, which used every rainy break to demonstrate their robust martial arts in the arena groomed with soft sand.
Gladiator owner "Leonidas" proved to be a humorous and knowledgeable presenter, sending his men one after the other to the ring for heroic duel in various gladiator genres.
First it was the "Provocators" with rectangular shield and short sword as well as leg rail on the left leg and arm rail on the right arm.
This was followed by the "Essedarii" with chest shield, short sword and throwing lance as well as iron gladiator helmet, leg and arm protection.
Particularly impressive was the appearance of the "Retiarius", who competed against the "Secutor" with a net, trident and dagger and, after a short fight, pushed the boy to the ground.
Then the swords collided metallicly, the shields shielded and the throwing lances flew surrendering through the arena that one could become afraid for the health of the gladiators.
But the imposing "Summa Rudis", the muscular referee, always had an attentive eye on them.
"We wanted to revive Roman everyday life and make the culture of the Roman era tangible," explained Lorenz Euskirchen, chairman of the organizer "Freundeskreis Römerkanal", the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation, the amusement park became a "Oppidum Romanum", a Roman city, as Vice Mayor Claus Wehage noted in his greeting.
After all, the Romans not only brought war and conquest into our region, but also the Roman culture and numerous buildings that we still admire today.
Remains of this were also to be admired at the Roman Day, such as "aqueduct marble" from the eleven meters high and 1400 meters long Roman Canal Bridge, which once stood at Lüftelberg.
The Frontinus-Gesellschaft contrasted the water and energy supply once and now, and Managing Director Petra Fricke knew: "We still benefit from the knowledge of that time".
This is also confirmed by graduate surveying engineer Ralph Heiliger from the "EngineerteamZwei" from Rheinbach, who presented surveying instruments of the Romans such as Chorobat, Groma or Dioptra.
The Roman villa in Blankenheim presented sketches and models from the excavations in 1894 as well as bricks from the original hypocaust, the hot air heater that once warmed the Roman villa.
Impressive also the footprints left by Wolf and Fox two millennia ago in the footsteps of clay before they were burned.
In 2011, the Office for Soil Heritage Care at the Landesverband Rheinland excavated the remains of a Roman villa in the Nord Gewerbepark in Rheinbach.
They found enclosing walls of a farm building with a drain for drying cereals and malting.
The building probably belonged to a villa Rustica, an agricultural estate, explained archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser.
She presented a number of finds from these excavations in a glass display case, including a large plate, several fine glass jars, and parts of a delicate necklace.
The villa probably existed from the first to the fourth century AD, until the invasion of the Germans in the then Roman Rhineland, Morscheiser suspects.
With her, the children also dealt with the Roman windmill game, similar to today’s mill game, or they wrote their names with metal handles on wax boards like the Roman pupils once did.
At the stand of the Roman thermal baths in Zülpich, the children were allowed to lay mosaics themselves, craft glass mosaics at the stand of the Rheinbach Glass Museum and use a heavy wheat mill made of stone at the stand of the Eifel Nettersheim Nature Centre to grind the flour for a flatbread or a cereal.
With the originally rebuilt Roman touring car drawn by two cold-blooded people, the visitors drove through the amusement park and also passed the impressive booth of the Municipal Gymnasium, which presented the results of their "Roman Project Weeks".
With a Roman week from 13 to 21 September, the municipality of Wachtberg will also be involved in the Roman year 2014 proclaimed throughout Rhineland, which is supposed to commemorate the death of Emperor Augustus 2000 years ago.
Together with the home and history associations as well as the Wachtberger Wander-Verein, the Partnerschaftsverein and the Laienspielkreis Oberbachem, theme hikes, a lecture, cooking evenings as well as guided tours for school classes are offered and remind of the Roman past of Wachtberg.
For example, a Roman legionnaire tells of his work on the trained Wachtberg, introduces plants as living monuments from the Roman period and offers a funny lesson in terms of international understanding between a group of Wachtberg "Germans" and immigrated Romans.
The Adendorf primary school is dedicated to the Roman theme as part of a project week.
With the Roman week, the numerous traces of the Romans in Wachtberg, often but no longer visible at first glance, are to be re-experienced.
In the Wachtberg City Hall, a small presentation will commemorate the discovery of the Berkumer Matronenskult in 1879.
Ebola: The epidemic burdens West Africa’s economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a serious blow to the economy.
Markets are orphaned – and international companies are going a long way.
The devastating Ebola epidemic is putting a heavy blow on the economy of West Africa.
The harvest rots on the fields, the mines are abandoned and the markets are orphaned - the virus has severely added to the region.
Some international companies are already taking a distance.
"The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis, but also an economic one," the head of the African Development Bank, Donald Kaberuka, said in a statement.
Liberia is most affected
"It's a total disaster, we're losing a lot of money," says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells clothes on the second largest market in Liberia's capital Monrovia.
Only those who want to buy food or something to disinfect against Ebola can get on the market.
Liberia has been hit hardest by the virus, only here more than 600 people fell victim to the fever.
Recently, health authorities said the disease had spread to every corner of the country.
The virus has also spread in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
In total, more than 1,500 people have already died, and thousands more have been infected.
Foreign companies withdraw employees
Everywhere in the resource-rich countries, companies suspend their operations.
Foreign companies such as the steel group Arcelor Mittal are withdrawing their employees, several international airlines are no longer flying to the affected regions.
The local traders and farmers also react: Few merchants still leave their hometowns to get supplies.
In some quarantined areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia, cocoa and coffee beans, which are important for export, are rotting in the fields.
The farmers do not dare to leave their homes for the harvest.
Food is scarce
“People will travel less and less,” says Phillipe De Vreyer, a Parisian expert on West Africa’s economy.
For example, the man who usually goes to the market and sells his vegetables prefers to stay at home.
The population is therefore directly and urgently affected by the consequences of the epidemic: food is becoming scarce.
In the markets, the supply of staple foods such as rice is dwindling.
At the same time, the region, which is heavily dependent on international companies, is threatened with image damage - with far-reaching consequences.
The biggest danger is that international companies generally avoid the area for a long time, says Philippe Hugon of the French think tank Iris.
Decisive is how far and how long the virus will continue to spread.
"Investors may feel that it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and therefore to invest," Hugon warns.
The disease also weighs on the state’s stressed budgets
The disease also burdens the already strained state budgets of the affected states.
The rating agency Moody's fears that their budgets will be heavily strained by the high spending on the health system and additionally by the deteriorating economy.
The African Development Bank has already pledged to provide $60 million (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>45 million) to the health systems of the affected countries.
The effects are already apparent in Nigeria, where few Ebola cases have been diagnosed so far.
The oil-rich region in the southern Niger Delta has not yet been affected.
But elsewhere, many people are already staying at home for fear of an infection.
Reservations in hotels are also falling significantly.
Shooters Celebrate Their 50th Anniversary
The "Tannenwald" Berngau shooting association celebrates its 50th anniversary from 12 to 14 September.
The preparations for the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Tannenwald shooting association are running at full speed from 12 to 14 September.
On Friday, September 12th, a big entertainment evening with the group "Dorfrocker" is planned.
On Saturday at 6 p.m. is the big fireworks shooting.
Then there is the mood evening with the "Stoapfälzer Spitzbuam" in the large party tent.
Brass band takes care of the music
Highlights on Sunday are the festive service and 9.30 am in the parish church and the big procession at 2 pm.
In the afternoon is also the price distribution of the Bundes- and Gaussschießen.
A particularly beautiful sight will be the 25 party ladies with their dirndls.
Festkapelle is the Blaskapelle Berngau.
Mayor Wolfgang Wild and Secretary of State Albert Füracker took over the patronage.
The original name "Schützengesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau" dates back to 1907, when the association for "societal entertainment through practice in room shooting and small-caliber shooting" was founded on 21 March.
The Nazi regime had caused the dissolution of the association in 1937.
Only in 1964 did 19 young men find themselves again, who on April 30 in the inn Lukas raised the "new" shooting club "Tannenwald" Berngau from the baptism.
Karl März and Adolf Ried led the club as shooting champions through a difficult time in the beginning, where it was mainly about finding a club venue and installing the shooting operation.
Already in the autumn of 1965, the Schützenverein started in the inn "Leininger" with two teams in the lap competitions.
In the following years, the sports shooters, which were now organized into seven teams, established themselves in all classes up to the 1st Gauliga.
The club records were set annually and the magical limit of 380 rings was reached for the first time in 1980 by Rudi Meier.
Just as the performance of the active shooters has increased, the number of members has also developed positively.
After the club venue "Leininger" no longer met the requirements of a modern shooting club, the then board of directors under the leadership of Johann Rinn decided to create a future domicile in the cellars of the new "Landgasthof Härteis".
After a work of 2700 hours, on 8 May 1988, Father Strasser granted the church blessing for the new shooting rooms.
One of the great highlights in the history of the club was certainly the 44th Gaussschießen, coupled with the solemn consecration of the new sniper flag in July 1991.
On 23 and 24 April 1994, the Schützenverein celebrated its 30th anniversary.
In 1995, a bakery group was founded.
Josef Schmalzl became a firefighter.
A major challenge for the "Böllerer" and for the club as a whole was the organisation of the Bavarian Buller Meeting in 2005.
In the course of many hours of voluntary work, the members of the association modernised the rooms and the shooting facility in the Berngau courtyard last year and brought them to the latest state of the art.
Eleven teams in lap matches
You can also see the sporting achievements of the shooting club.
A total of eleven teams are currently participating in the lap competitions: six airgun teams, one airgun team, one sports pistol KK1, one youth team and two AH teams.
The 1st team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Kellermann rose in the 2013/14 round from the Gauoberliga (highest league in the Schützengau ANB) to the Bezirksliga 1.
The 2nd team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml has risen from the Gauliga Nord to the Gauoberliga.
In addition to shooting sports, events such as buckshots, carnival and royal ball, club excursions and Christmas celebrations have tradition.
The shooters are also present at the festivals in the parish and community.
Tony Stewart suffers accident after returning to the racetrack
Tony Stewart's return to the circuit ended about halfway through his race at the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart drove against the wall for the second time after his right front tire burst in lap 172 and ended his evening.
Stewart drove his damaged car into the garage and left it without talking to journalists.
His team chief Chad Johnston said his 14-member team was disappointed, but is now focusing on the race next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish we had a better stake and a better result for him," Johnston said.
We go to Richmond and hope we can do better there.
Stewart drove into a wall earlier in the race on Sunday evening after a collision with Kyle Busch and had to have the right side of his car repaired.
“I went in today with pretty good hopes for a good result,” Johnston said, adding, “It just didn’t work out.”
Not long after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded into the tug and the team had packed and was ready to leave.
Stewart dropped three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car hit and killed another rider at an ash track race in northern New York State.
He decided to return this week and win either in Atlanta or at the next race in Richmond to win a spot in the pursuit.
He returned to his workplace during an investigation into the tragic incident that led to the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who had stepped on the road during a race to confront Stewart.
The authorities announced on Friday that the investigation into the cause of the accident will continue for at least two weeks.
No decision has yet been made as to whether Stewart will face charges.
The three-time champion was welcomed with great applause when he was introduced before the race.
After a start at 12th position, Stewart had entered the first 10 shortly afterwards and was temporarily in fourth place.
After a restart in lap 122, Buschs got
Car with No. 18 out of control after exiting from turn 2 and collided with Stewart, with both cars driving against the wall.
Stewart continued, but dropped back to 21st place.
Looking for a dancer
Just try it out: Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Bettina, Emma and director Lisa Neitzel (from the left) are looking forward to fellow fighters.
Like many other clubs, the jazz groups on TV Jahn have full-day lessons at secondary schools.
After the summer holidays, some groups have decimated themselves heavily.
Now more and more young people are looking for a sport that is healthy and fun.
In the two jazz and modern dance groups of Lisa Neitzel, former dancer in the jazz and modern dance formation "Spirits", there are only nine children left.
"Three in the group of eight to twelve years old, six in the group of twelve to 15 years old," says the 20-year-old.
With more actives, the whole thing would be much more fun, "you could dance completely different choreographies," she says.
If you feel like dancing, you can taste the training lesson on Thursdays between 5 pm and 6 pm or on Fridays between 5 pm and 6:30 pm in the dance sports room at the former Hotel Meyer, Freistraße 9, without obligation.
"The training regularly starts with a warm-up program," says the trainer.
Various choreographies are then practised.
JazzDance has the feature that there is no fixed shape and is therefore open to many styles.
Elements from folklore to classical to sports and acrobatics are processed in jazz dance.
Of course, socializing is not too short either.
"We also go out for dinner, watch dance movies and have stayed in the dance room," says Lisa Neitzel.
In the group you can make friends, share a beautiful hobby and do a lot for your own motor development.
If you are not interested in jazz dance, you can also taste one of the other offers of TV Jahn.
Children and teenagers can always get a taste of children’s dance/jazz dance, bamboo ballet, video clip dancing and hip hop classes on Wednesdays.
The dance coach is Francisco Afonso.
Adult couples are welcome to the dance evenings on Monday and Wednesday.
If you like Discofox, slow waltz, Viennese waltz, rumba, cha-cha-cha and tango, you can stop by and take part.
Bulgarian prison guards protest nationwide
Hundreds of prison officials from all over Bulgaria have organized a nationwide protest in front of the Ministry of Justice in the capital Sofia.
In the peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demands for the restoration of their old working conditions, which have recently been changed.
Higher salaries are also on a list of demands to be discussed with interim Justice Minister Hristo Ivanov.
The officials have been symbolically protesting the new working hours for a month and demanding a return to the previous 24-hour shifts.
Despite the meetings between the union of prison employees and representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, the Bulgarian National Ratio (BNR) reported.
The negotiations are ongoing, the Director-General for the implementation of punitive measures, Rosen Zhelyazkov told the BNR.
The protest of the prison employees is expected to be supported by members of the union Association of Employees of the Ministry of the Interior.
Ukrainian army has abandoned airport of Luhansk
In eastern Ukraine, the pro-Russian fighters are on the rise.
After heavy fighting, which allegedly involved Russian tank battalions, the Ukrainian army abandoned the airport of the rebel stronghold of Luhansk today, Monday.
The army said seven soldiers had been killed in the past 24 hours.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had previously drawn personnel consequences from his army’s heavy defeats in the fight against the separatists and announced changes in the top army leadership without giving details.
Pro-Russian separatists shot down plane
In the fight against Ukrainian government forces, pro-Russian separatists have once again shot down a fighter plane and two military helicopters.
Around 100 soldiers were also injured or killed in fighting in the Donetsk region, the insurgents said on Monday.
Coast Guard ships sunk
The insurgents also claimed to have sunk two boats of the Ukrainian coast guard for the first time in the Azov Sea.
The Ukrainian border guards confirmed that two of his ships had fallen under fire on Sunday near the port city of Mariupol.
Seven border guards were injured, a spokesman in Kiev told 112.ua.
Two crew members were reported missing.
Local media blamed Russia for the incident.
The separatists also reported that they had taken control of several localities in the Donetsk area.
Diplomatic offensive in Minsk
The Ukraine Contact Group is meeting today in the Belarusian capital Minsk.
In addition to representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, an envoy of the separatists from eastern Ukraine should also participate.
In advance, all actors used their appearances to publicly announce their demand.
NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia due to the planned deployments in Eastern Europe as a result of the Ukraine crisis.
NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels that NATO adhered to the 1997 founding agreement of the NATO-Russia Council.
The NATO chief, however, accused Russia of "a blatant breach" of the agreement.
“Today we have to face the reality that Russia does not see NATO as a partner,” Rasmussen said.
Documents and statements from the Russian side indicate that they “consider us an adversary.”
Stronger NATO presence
Rasmussen has also announced that he intends to strengthen NATO presence in Eastern Europe.
A "Readiness Action Plan" to be adopted at the NATO summit in Wales will ensure that "we will have more visible NATO presence in the East as long as this is necessary," Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels.
Kiev and Moscow agree on new gas talks
Russia and Ukraine have officially agreed on new talks to resolve their gas dispute.
The negotiations are scheduled for next Saturday, Russian energy minister Alexander Nowak said on Monday.
It is still waiting for a decision by the European Union whether it will also send a representative to the talks.
Due to the dispute over the price of gas, Ukraine has not received any fuel from Russia for weeks.
Recently, EU Energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger had mediated between the two sides.
Ukraine warned that Russia could also interrupt gas supply to Europe.
Europe draws about a third of its natural gas from Russian sources, a large part of which flows through Ukraine.
Merkel says power word: toll will come "very clear"
The Chancellor has once again made it clear.
However, it is not a license for all complicated details.
Persistent concerns from the CDU against the car toll have increasingly angered the CSU.
After sustained resistance from her CDU, Chancellor Angela Merkel has spoken a powerful word for the introduction of a car toll.
"To be quite clear: it is in the coalition agreement, and it will come," the party leader said on Monday after meetings of the CDU's top committees in Berlin.
However, Merkel did not agree on a detailed model for the time being.
In the black-and-red government program, "certain parameters" are mentioned.
Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) has made a proposal, and we are now working on it.
However, the NRW-CDU insists on its no to a toll on all roads.
Merkel stressed that Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) is also constructively involved in the deliberations for a bill.
He also spoke with Dobrindt about other ways to activate more private capital for investments in infrastructure, including broadband expansion.
Schäuble had left a "mirror" report uncommented on Sunday, his house is testing its own concept to reimburse motorway investors with toll revenue - after the election in 2017.
CSU chief Horst Seehofer then warned against developing toll concepts against the prime minister in the Cabinet.
CDU Federal Vice President Armin Laschet reaffirmed his objections.
"The coalition agreement never assumed that all district and federal roads would be torn down," said the North Rhine-Westphalian CDU chairman.
In this respect, it is an important signal that Seehofer has now announced to talk about the topic again.
Resistance to the plans also comes from the CDU-Landesverbände Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate.
Background are fears that a toll may affect small border traffic to neighbouring countries.
Seehofer had demanded loyalty from the CDU coalition because of the toll criticism.
The Left considers the plans to fail in the face of the dispute in the Union.
"The Murks toll is dead," party leader Bernd Riexinger told the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Monday).
Dobrindt wants to introduce a vignette compulsory on all German roads, which is expected to start in 2016.
However, domestic car owners may not be charged additionally under the coalition agreement.
Therefore, they should receive a full compensation for the toll via the car tax.
However, according to EU law, the model may not disadvantage foreign drivers because of their nationality.
Genetic disorder often misdiagnosed
A British woman says she thought she would die as a result of a misdiagnosis for many years.
Karin Rodgers lived almost her entire adolescence in the belief that she had only a few years left to live after being diagnosed with another disease.
She actually suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), a group of inherited disorders that damage the nerves outside of the brain and spinal cord.
Charity CMT UK said misdiagnosis is a common problem in people with CMT because so little is known about this disease.
Approximately 23,000 people in the UK are presumably suffering from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscle weakness, an uncertain gait and curved toes.
The disease is incurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms will worsen over time.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed she was suffering from Friedreich ataxia (FA), a disease with very poor survival chances.
Rodgers thought she would be in a wheelchair before she turned 18, and die before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children, who is now 51 years old, said: "As a child, I knew I couldn't do the same thing as the others.
I fell down all the time and everything took longer for me.
I could never ride roller skates or skateboards with the other kids and was often teased at school because of my way of walking and running.
Rodgers said that at the age of 13, after several operations to relieve her Achilles tendon and stretch her feet, she saw her medical record when her doctor left the room and read that she was suffering from FA.
"I felt guilty because I had been curious, so I didn't tell anyone that, but I went home, looked for the disease in the library, and wrote to the FA Society," she said.
When I received an answer, I was shocked and panicked terribly.
I thought I would be in a wheelchair at 18 and die at 25, and slowly lose all my skills in between.
I did it all by myself and planned my own funeral.
She said when she turned 17, she realized that her abilities had not decreased as much as she had imagined and asked her doctor.
He just got up and hugged me and said, "My dear, I don't think you have that, otherwise you'd already be in a wheelchair."
I think you have something far less life-threatening.
After several genetic tests, her CMT was diagnosed.
"When he explained to me what CMT was, I felt like I was a winner," she said.
Charity CMT UK has launched a CMT awareness month to raise awareness of this disease.
Staff sergeant Berni Diether has been working as a fireworker since the closure of the former military training ground
For almost ten years, there has been no shooting on the former military training ground in Münsingen.
Nevertheless, deadly ammunition still appears every month in the heart of the Swabian Alb biosphere area.
The grenades are sometimes so dangerous that they have to be blown up on the spot.
A deafening bang echoes at the explosions over the heart of the biosphere area.
In December 2004, the last sharp shot was fired at the Münsingen troop training ground, which was closed at the end of 2005 after 110 years of military operation.
Since then, the 6500-hectare area has been at the heart of the Swabian Alb Biosphere Reserve, which is open to hikers and cyclists on 13 designated trails.
Tax burden on businessmen in Washington area increases with economic recovery
A recovery of the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax rulings for businesses in the country rose slightly last year, while economic recovery accelerated, a newly published study last week, and companies in the Washington area were no exception.
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia area together paid $27.6 billion to state and local agencies in fiscal 2013, up 3.8 percent from 2012 revenues of $26.6 billion.
The company’s state and local tax burden increased by 4.3 percent to $671 billion last year, compared to 3.9 percent the year before, and it was the third consecutive year of growth after several years of declining notices in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes increased more than local taxes, by 4.3 percent, according to the study conducted by the Ernst & Young service agency with the Center for State Taxation, a tax policy group.
More than half of the district’s tax revenue, 56 percent, comes from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland’s revenue comes from corporations.
Virginia has the lowest tax revenue from businesses, with 28 percent.
Much of the increase in tax revenues is due to a recovery in the company’s real estate values, the researchers say, which led to a 3.7 percent increase in real estate taxes this year after the three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1 percent.
While a large part of these gains came from large states such as California, New York, and Texas, the process seems to apply to the Washington area as well.
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid over $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 — a 4.2 percent increase over the course of a year.
But the apparent recovery in real estate values is not as effective in raising state and local tax revenues in Maryland, where property taxes amount to just over one-fifth of corporate tax returns.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay nearly half of their state and local taxes in the form of property taxes.
“In Maryland, a large part of the real estate, particularly in the D.C. tax area, is either owned by the government or by non-profit organizations that don’t pay real estate taxes,” said Douglas Lindholm, managing director of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland, for example, is forced to rely much more on income taxes to provide the same services that other states offer.
The recent recovery in corporate tax revenue cannot be attributed solely to the recovery of the real estate market
Business revenue also appears to be recovering, according to the data.
Companies in the region reported income taxes to state organizations of $2.3 billion compared to $2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland raised $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest amount in the region.
While the trend is going in the same direction, the local tax burden on businesses is not rising equally in all three locations.
The rate of increase in the district was 4.3 percent the national average, while the increase in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9 percent.
Only Virginia reported a below-average tax revenue of 4.1 percent.
Virginia has the lowest corporate income taxes in all three offices, with 6 percent (fixed corporate tax rates in all three).
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 percent and in the District is relatively high 9.975 percent.
A comparable study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that Virginia has lower state and local corporate taxes and a better overall tax climate than Maryland.
The district was not investigated in the study.
Despite the benefits, Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbors.
North Carolina has passed laws to lower its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate will drop to 5 percent next year.
If the state continues to meet its income targets in the coming year, this law could reduce the state’s corporate income tax rate to 3 percent by 2017.
Meanwhile, small businesses in the Washington area seem to be doing better, and they are therefore paying more state and local taxes, according to the latest study.
Corporate taxes paid as personal income taxes by small business people — a transitional structure by which most small businesses are organized — in the District, Maryland, and Virginia rose by 20 percent to $2.4 billion last year, a significantly faster growth rate than corporate taxes overall.
The researchers say the trend and rise in corporate taxes across the country is likely to continue this year, with a 6.2 percent increase in general U.S. and local government tax revenues in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year.
Still, the Washington area could be lagging behind if the federal government’s spending cuts impact the region’s labor market.
Partner city: German beer for Guangzhou
Hops and malt - also a popular combination in China.
German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt’s partner city in China now wants a brewery and also hopes for a direct flight connection between the two cities.
German beer brewed in Frankfurt’s partner city of Guangzhou is the urgent desire of officials in China.
"We would be delighted if a German brewery would settle in our city," said Li Yiwei, vice-party secretary of the South China metropolis, this week visiting a SPD delegation in his city.
In the course of the talks, the official of the ruling Communist Party of China repeatedly came back to this concern of the twelve-million-metropolis.
Guangzhou, also known as Canton in Germany, is one of the richest cities in China, Li said.
That is why people also had the purchasing power to afford German beer.
The Hessian SPD chairman Thorsten Schäfer-Gümbel, who led the German political delegation, told the host that he would be listening in Germany for a possible partner for the project.
"It doesn't take much for beer: good water, grains and joy of life," he added at lunch with the party leader in Guangzhou.
Mr. Li already radiated this joy of life, he flattered the host.
Then the official from Guangzhou came up with Schäfer Gumbel - but with red wine, which was served with food.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao goes back to German brewing art.
Tsingtao beer is brewed according to the German Purity Law.
More business transactions
A second wish of the Chinese hosts would be a direct flight link between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said Li, vice-chief of the party.
Lufthansa had offered the flight earlier but cancelled it in 2012 for economic reasons.
"It would be worth it again," the local politician was convinced.
"Business traffic between our two cities continues to grow".
Currently, travellers have to take the detour via Changsha in Hunan province, Li complained.
The administration of Guangdong Province, whose capital is Guangzhou, also hopes for the flight connection.
The vice-governor of the province, Chen Yunxian, emphasized this wish in his talks with the Social Democrats.
"This is a very good idea," said Schäfer-Gümbel - the Chinese Deputy Minister Li Jinjun, an intimate connoisseur of Germany, nodded in agreement.
Maintained partnership
The friendly vice-chief of Guangzhou’s party hopes he can visit Frankfurt next year for a partnership meeting.
Li Yiwei was already on the Main, but not yet in this position.
He came into office only this year after his predecessor had been promoted from office for allegations of corruption.
Local party leader Wan Qinglian also had to leave.
The crackdown on Guangzhou officials is part of a nationwide campaign against corruption in the party and administration, which is being harshly enforced by President Xi Jinping.
The new top politician Li Yiwei had worked for an American company before his party career, which is highly unusual in the Chinese Communist Party.
Before taking office in Guangzhou, he worked as a top official in Fujian, where the car manufacturer VW is building a large plant.
Frankfurt has officially entered into more than a dozen city twinnings.
The connection to Guangzhou, which is 9,000 kilometers away, is one of those maintained by both sides, for example with a student exchange.
Last year, the 25th anniversary of the German-Chinese union was celebrated.
The southern Chinese metropolis on the Pearl River is almost as strong with its economic power as the whole of Hesse.
Next year, it wants to reach a gross domestic product of 250 billion euros, Li reported.
Joan Rivers' family "squeezes their thumbs"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since she was admitted to a New York City hospital three days ago; however, her daughter today expressed hope that the 81-year-old comedian will recover from her illness.
"Thank you for your continued love and support," Melissa Rivers said in a statement today.
We're all squeezing our thumbs.
Her mother was admitted to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday following an emergency for cardiac arrest at a clinic on the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy.
The doctors deliberately keep them sedated and under close observation until they are more satisfied with their condition, which continues to be described as "serious".
The reactions came from many sides, including in the form of overwhelming online support from Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Eco-friendly vacuum cleaners and rising wages
Stricter environmental standards will apply to cars and vacuum cleaners that are on the market from today.
Similar to refrigerators and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners will receive a label from September 1, on which the buyer can see at a glance key data such as the energy efficiency of the device.
For new cars in the pollutant class "Euro 6" sharper nitrogen oxide values apply.
In addition, there is more money for the scaffolding builders: They receive a nationally uniform minimum wage of 10.25 euros.
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what information had reported on Monday morning: The online retailer – and video producer, and a host of other things – is buying the video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion ($970 million).
The announcement comes as a surprise, not because no one expected a takeover of Twitch, but because it was widely suspected that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago, it looked like selling Twitch to Google’s video service for a cool billion-dollar deal, and the collaboration also seemed natural.
Founded just three years ago as Justin.tv, Twitch was launched as a general streaming service – a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to release their bravures in games, a "YouTube for live games," according to an insider.
The Twitch interface.
And "let's play", a video genre in which wisers give the (mostly older) games a coat of paint of secret science theatre, are already very popular on YouTube.
It’s just that YouTube is often called when you want to describe Twitch, so the news that YouTube wanted to buy Twitch was taken a bit bored, a textbook example of an established tech company buying a potential competitor.
It’s a mystery why the deal with YouTube didn’t come about as the company was reportedly willing to pay as much as Amazon.
All we know about it right now is this statement from Emmet Shear, President of Twitch: “We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions, and they want to help us get there faster.”
Another secret is, frankly, the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me, who explain that they prefer to exercise rather than watch, it’s hard to grasp the attraction that assumes watching others play instead of taking the control console into their own hands.
It’s one thing to look over a friend’s shoulder at 3 o’clock in the morning as she sneaks through Resident Evil, and something completely different to watch a spinner get shot in the head 20 times in a row in Call of Duty.
You could watch all these games right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games, so watching without your own control over the perspective can be a really good recipe for headaches.
I admit that the fast runs in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronic age complete games in record time are entertaining.
But as long as there isn’t a game or humor virtuoso, his Twitch channel probably isn’t that interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know about it?
Twitch is accessed by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of internet traffic peaks.
And how exactly does Amazon want to make money from it?
It’s hard to imagine Twitch being integrated into Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as YouTube could have easily swallowed Twitch.
But Twitch has something every company would like to have: thousands of young men being courted as advertisers.
As the chairman of Twitch, Shear, said, Amazon and Twitch “both believe in the future of gaming,” and the medium shows no signs of shrinkage, not even—swallow—as a spectator sport.
There was a lot going on on Saturday at the bouncy castle at the Burggartenfest.
The concept of the organizers was correct.
Despite the heavy rains on Saturday evening, an estimated 1,200 music fans came to the open-air festival in the Burggarten.
At times, the admission had to be stopped.
"That was annoying," said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salty l light and fun.
From two Spanish words Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem formed the name Amula.
The open air in the Salzwedel Castle Garden should radiate brightness in the day and in the evening through various shows.
And the fun comes by itself anyway.
This was already evident on early Saturday, when the first visitors set out for the open air.
A celebration for all generations had been promised by the organizers.
And they succeeded.
Salzwedeler, but also guests from the surrounding area made themselves comfortable around the supply stands on the Burggartenwiese.
They watched the first live performances, rocked with their feet in the beat, enjoyed cool drinks - in short: pure relaxation and enjoyment were trendy.
And that across the generations.
While some limped on blankets on the extra-carved white sand at the beach bar, others sipped wine at a quarter in the wine shop, the offspring raged on the bouncy castle, which was a great attraction for the smaller guests.
But even in the case of children's make-up, the volunteers literally had to do all they could to master the crowd and conjure up imaginative creations in the little faces.
The bigger ones used the kicker tables or participated in a skateboarding workshop hosted by the Goodfoot crew from Saltwedel.
Until the great rain came.
Shortly before 5.30 p.m., he slammed down on the visitors, especially families looking for the vastness and dryness.
But the attractiveness of the festival did not stop it.
"There were more people coming than expected," said Ron Sem, who spoke of a "success all over the line."
Therefore, nothing stands in the way of a repeat of the big party next year.
Although the content and size of the event still has to be worked on, Sem made it clear in a first balance sheet on Sunday to the popular vote.
He said it was annoying that the admission had to be stopped in the meantime.
Obviously, the security company had been booked with too little force.
As a result, some who had already paid did not come to the site anymore.
The resonance was very good.
In a first cautious estimate, the Salzwedel co-organizer spoke of about 1200 visitors, who tumbled into the castle garden.
There were problems with sound technology.
The Salzwedeler hip hop band Blocks<0x60>n<0x60>Rox cancelled their performance.
The technicians were unable to create a fairly reasonable sound.
The planned shisha lounges could not be set up because the tents could not be brought to Salzwedel due to a tire break.
“We’ll be there next year,” the organizer said.
The premiere of the Amula Open Air was more than successful from the number of visitors.
And that in bad weather.
However, the organizers have made some mistakes, which will still be forgiven the first time, but must be eliminated in the second edition.
The organizers also have to criticize the social network Facebook.
"Sorry, but for twelve euros you simply expected more," Melanie Meier comments on the event page.
"Unfortunately, you took over a bit," says Ele Zimmermann at the same place.
Others don’t see the initial problems so closely.
I think it is very good that some not only talk stupidly, but also really try to put something on their feet.
Hat off!", Stephanie Jenss writes to Amula.
Now the organizers have a year to address these criticisms.
New Radom in Berkum: Wachtberg's landmark shrinks
As expected, this is not the case.
Rather, the available component is waiting to be inserted into the striking structure.
The action is in the context of a larger measure: almost 50 years after the establishment of the space observation radar TIRA, the shell, the so-called radom, is completely renewed.
The new Radom will be slightly smaller than the old one with a diameter of 47.5 meters.
However, the size still remains a world record.
The last step to completing the new case is to change the cap
The upper quarter of the old shell is separated and removed with a crane.
After that, the last quarter of the new shell is put on.
If the weather plays along, the action should go over the stage at the beginning of this week.
Participant in the Ice Bucket Challenge gets jaw twisted
Isabelle Roberts from the UK cried so much when her ice-cold water was poured over her head that she hurt the bone structure of her face.
This Ice Bucket Challenge was painfully missed.
A woman was hospitalized after screaming so much at the Ice Bucket Challenge that she dislocated her jaw.
Isabelle Roberts from the UK shrieked so much when her ice-cold water was poured over her head that she hurt the structure of her face.
“The water was so cold that I screamed, and while I did, my jaw just stopped,” she told The Mirror.
Ice water is poured over the 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but that didn't work, the jaw was hooked, and then I understood that something was wrong.
My mother and sister saw this too and almost got in their pants with laughter, but I had to go to the emergency room.
The 20-year-old from the UK was hospitalized to have her jaw retracted after participating in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The clip became an Internet sensation and was linked thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
Will the castle clubs soon be back on track?
Recently there was a disagreement between the two Wolfratshaus castle clubs.
The boards are now considering a possible cooperation.
As a model for the reconstruction of the Wolfratshaus castle, the late Richard Dimbah, former chairman of the Wolfratshaus castle friends, led the project in Guédelon, France.
Just a year ago, there was no good climate between the Burgverein and the Burgfreunde Wolfratshausen.
So far, the points of view on how to deal with the history of the Wolfratshaus castle and a possible reconstruction seemed extremely different.
Now the two camps are moving towards each other: talks about a common approach are to be held soon.
The boards of Torsten Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfreunde) confirm this at the request of our newspaper.
"I called Mr. Piffl and suggested that we could sit down one day," reports Sjöberg.
In his view, all members of both clubs could in the future pull back together.
Thus, visible successes can be seen more quickly.
While the friends of the castle around the sudden deceased Richard Dimbah had until last in mind a reconstruction of the castle on the mountain forest, for the castle club around Sjöberg the "discovery and experience" of the site stands at the forefront.
Herbert Piffl, second chairman of the Burgfreunde, was very pleased about the call.
Since Dhimbah's death, he presides over the castle friends.
A new chairman is to be found at a general meeting in mid-September.
According to the 74-year-old, the association currently has around 40 members.
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbah, we first let the club's activities rest out of respect. This "think phase" was necessary to "consider how it could continue."
According to Piffl, the new chairman will then go into conversation with the Burgverein.
Until then, the castle friends could also create a current mood within their group.
There is currently no candidate for the presidency, says Piffl.
"But I am confident that someone will find himself". He himself does not want to run because he has his residence in Bad Tölz.
The new chairman should be a Wolfratshauser.
The Tölzer would like to continue to work on the project "but very gladly".
The different points of view in terms of reconstruction will probably remain in the eyes of Piffl in the near future.
He commends Dimbath as a "missionary" who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.
Two similar, already advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not an airlock.
Due to the high participation of the population as well as by volunteers from all over the world, they are a tourist magnet.
Piffl: "I was skeptical at first too.
But over time, I have become more and more convinced that it makes sense to push the project forward. A "single selling point" could be created for the raft city.
There's nothing else here.
In addition, the project could be financed through EU grants, visitor tickets and potential sponsors, Piffl believes.
"Personally, therefore, I do not want to throw the idea of reconstruction overboard", he hopes that the Burgverein may be moving on this point.
Their goal of first documenting the story “is important and good.”
After that, you could continue to see.
Clever ways to save on university textbooks
Since the cost of university textbooks for many students is more than $1,000 a year, fast-second-semester student Matt Schroeder came up with a clever savings idea.
He invented a loan system for books from students of higher semesters and offered a nominal compensation to delay resale.
"My math book usually costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a chick-fil-a cookie," said Schroeder, 19, who attends Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester would have cost him $430, he said.
He spent $120.
The college management said that on average, students spend more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and study materials, but that there are different cost mitigation options for students.
Online stores and creative approaches such as the Schroeders are increasingly the solution of choice for students.
Hiring textbooks is becoming more popular, and so students can use a book for a semester, often at a significantly cheaper price than when buying.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 university bookstores, said textbook rentals have doubled since 2011.
Surveys in the industry show that about a quarter of the books in college bookshops were rented last spring semester, Neebos vice president Tevor Meyer said.
Less than half of all textbooks are purchased in campus bookshops, according to the National Association of College Stores.
Here's the one-off for the best deals.
Buy online
Some new books cost online only one-third of the price for which they are available in the campus bookstore.
The ninth edition of "Calculus" by Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs nearly $290, but can be purchased from the specialized textbook retailer Chegg.com for $239.99.
Buy used
If you don’t mind the notes of others or normal signs of use, second-hand books are a good option.
"Calculus" is used to have on Chegg.com for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, graduate student at Brigham Young University, says he spent 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used edition of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business."
The book was sold for $48.
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls, recommended students ask their professors if previous spending was allowed.
Sometimes the updates are not relevant for the seminar work.
In such cases, older issues can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest issue.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, Half.com from eBay Inc is also a popular alternative to used books.
Renting
Hiring textbooks is worth considering if you treat them reasonably well, remember to return them and do not want to keep the books after completing the course.
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a newly purchased book.
For example, a student could rent “Calculus” for the duration of a semester for about $20.
Find out about the terms of the business where you are renting, including the penalty fees that may be incurred for writing notes, underlining, or signs of use.
Tenants beware: If you do not return the book, the penalty fees may even exceed the price of a new book.
E-books
E-books instead of traditional textbooks are also an option.
Sometimes these books are de facto rented by providing an electronic license for a certain period of time from wholesalers such as Amazon.com, Chegg, and Barnes & Noble Inc.
At Chegg you can rent "Calculus" for 6 months for about $61.
Bracey says that students often find the best deals in literature courses, as many classics can be downloaded for free these days, while scientific and engineering textbooks can be very expensive.
In any case, look around.
Joe Gault, 29, who will be attending Pepperdine Law School soon, recommends the ISBN number for determining the price of books, as you can be sure to find the right textbook.
And before an online order, one should check, so Gault, whether the book is actually in stock.
He learned this lesson the hard way.
He bought a book that had four weeks delivery time and eventually paid the full price at the college bookstore.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" didn't become a cash hit
Sylvester Stallone’s The Expendables 3 made less than $30 million of his $90 million budget in the U.S., while Sin City: A Dame to Kill For made only $12 million of his $70 million budget.
“Sex Tape,” a film tailored to Cameron Diaz, made only $14.6 million on the opening weekend, while children’s movies like “Dragon Taming Made Easy 2” also disappoint in revenues.
An article by the Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin suggests that the lack of quality in the films themselves could be the reason for the children’s films.
Collin described 2014 as "the worst year" for children's movies so far and described "Dragon Taming Made Easy 2" as a purely "functional" fantasy sequel.
However, with movies for a slightly older audience, it seems that the quality of the movies is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic rating for each summer film launch shown on at least 2,000 screens between Memorial Day and July 20, 2013 and the current year.
The results are based on the opinions of cinemagoers and film critics and suggest that this year’s film hits are equivalent to last year’s.
Some commentators believe that the development is due to changing viewing habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services such as Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney’s upcoming Jungle Book film, told the Hollywood Reporter website: “I think times are changing.”
We must accept this and not try to follow the past.
In contrast to the currently weak cash results of Hollywood productions, Netflix has recently generated revenue of $1.2 billion in streaming content, almost twice as much as last year, where revenue was $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios for focusing too much on film adaptations of comics, prophesying a "core meltdown" of Hollywood.
In light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that his gloomy prophecy may well contain a true core.
However, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic because of the potential cash hits expected in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World:
X-Men producer Simon Kinberg recently described the drop in cash results as simply “cyclical,” saying to Hollywood Reporters, “Next summer will be the biggest summer at the box office ever, and no one will worry about the business anymore.”
When a few years ago the 2nd table tennis district class was cancelled for the purpose of tightening the league division, that was a step in the right direction.
Now the German Table Tennis Federation has taken an additional 3rd Bundesliga in the program.
As a result, those who have not ascended have descended.
Thus, Göttingen's highest-class team torpedo in the Oberliga relegation has avoided the descent, but plays in the coming season only fifth-class.
Fourth-class torpedoes remain ladies, despite their grand march into the regional league.
The boys and girls of Torpedo start in the Lower Saxony League, as well as the boys of SC Weende.
The SG Lenglern and the torpedo reserve compete in the new Verbandsliga, in the Landesliga no more Göttingen clubs are represented.
For the ladies, the TTV Geismar plays in the Verbandsliga, the torpedo second in the Landesliga.
What looks like a better district class in terms of composition is now the new Bezirksoberliga Süd.
TSV Seulingen, VfB Lödingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Bovender SV, Langenholtensen, FC Weser and the TTC compete.
In the district league play as regional representatives Dransfeld and the SC Weende, in the district class of the TTC II, Red-White, the Bovender SV II and the teams of the TTV Geismar II and III.
Güntersen, the TTC and the TTV Geismar II are part of the game.
Torpedo III and Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen start in the Bezirksliga.
With nine teams each
SC Weende sends his girls to the small district league.
The district league squadron of the SCW boys - there still starts Torpedo II - is not complete.
In a district class, Geismar, Tuspo Weende and the Bovender SV go into the season.
In the first season of the newly founded regional association, the two Göttingen circuit leagues start with nine teams each.
In the West Staffel are the Rot-Weiß II, Bovender SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Mielenhausen and SG Lenglern II.
Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen play in the Ost-Staffel.
The Damen-Kreisliga consists of Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Hemeln, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and the SG Rhume.
This is still better than in Osterode, where there are no women’s teams at the county level.
It is striking that none of the six 2nd circuit classes achieves target strength, here the innovative and active district board will have to think about it.
NATO summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
On the weekend there were protests from opponents of the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the center of Newport for an anti-NATO march.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered in Cardiff in front of the city hall to hold a so-called counter summit.
Stephen Fairclough followed the developments for us this weekend and spoke to demonstrators who travelled from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenagers flew out of the Blue Mountains
TWO teenage bushwalkers were brought to safety by rope winch after being trapped overnight in the Blue Mountains in NSW.
THE 16-year-old girl and the 19-year-old man set off for their tour shortly after Sunday afternoon at Govetts Leap in Blackheath.
Concerned relatives called the police at about 8 p.m. when the two had not returned home.
A search force from local police and emergency services set out and the couple were found near the Bridal Veil waterfalls at about 11 p.m.
The girl had injured her knee and the man had fallen and had his head opened.
Rescue personnel stayed with the couple overnight, and they were flown out on Monday morning.
They were taken to the Blue Mountains Hospital in stable condition with an ambulance.
Anti-government protests escalate in Pakistan
The approximately 1,000 protesters were pushed out of the PTV building by soldiers, Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said.
The transmitter resumed broadcasting after about half an hour.
PTV director Athar Farooq said the protesters equipped with sticks had damaged equipment in the editorial office.
Dead or injured were not reported.
The protesters demand the resignation of the head of government, whom they accuse of electoral fraud.
Police said a mile away from the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, there were clashes again on Monday by some 3,000 protesters with security forces.
According to hospital reports, a police officer was injured.
Over the weekend, at least three people were killed and more than 500 injured as protesters attempted to reach Sharif’s residence.
They demand the resignation of the Prime Minister.
The powerful military had called for a political solution to the conflict on Sunday night after a meeting at the army headquarters, “without wasting time and without using force.”
"The army remains committed to its role in ensuring the security of the state."
The escalating violence has stirred concern about an intervention by the military, which has been put in a more frequent coup in the past.
The protests led by opposition politician Imran Khan and preacher Tahirul Qadri have continued since Independence Day on August 14.
Sharif refuses to resign.
Khan and Qadri called on their followers to endure on Sunday.
"We will not go back without forcing Sharif to resign," Khan said.
Qadri spoke similarly.
Khan accuses Sharif of winning parliamentary elections in May last year through fraud.
Qadri calls for the resignation of the central and provincial governments.
Then a transitional government should reform the electoral system and proclaim new elections.
More than 40,000 security forces are deployed to protect the government district.
The protesters had initially peacefully persevered in front of parliament until Khan and Qadri called on them to advance to Sharif’s residence on the weekend.
Hütteldorfer after second win of the season in third place of the table.
With the 2-0 over Grödig, a bitter week on Sunday took a conciliatory end for Rapid.
"The victory is very liberating," said coach Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached an intermediate low with the out in the Europa League on Thursday.
"The experience of success was incredibly important," confirmed captain and goalkeeper Steffen Hofmann, who led with green-white in third place.
Rapid has shown the right reaction to the disappointment against Helsinki with the second win of the season and goes into the international game break with a success experience.
"We wanted to show a positive reaction," said outside defender Thomas Schrammel, who set the course for victory in the 14th minute with his magnificent lead volley from the 16th.
“I thought I’d cut all the frustration from Thursday and snuck it under the bar,” said the 26-year-old, smiling.
When Schrammel met for the last time in a Bundesliga match so far on November 13, 2010, that was still for Ried.
The first championship hit in Rapid-Dress will therefore remain in his special memory.
"For me, this is something very special, I'm from the Rapid offspring," Schrammel said.
Due to the short-term cymbal injury of Mario Pavelic, Schrammel moved from the left to the right defensive side and did his thing very well there too.
He has enough experience that he can also exercise this position in reverse.
He has earned the goal, he has already made some assists this year," Barisic praised.
Team showing character Schrammel also delivered the flank to 2-0 by Hofmann after a good an hour, which finally brought the decision.
Because before that, the guests could also write.
"Thank God we were a little lucky today," noted Schrammel, who alluded to the gap between performance and result in recent weeks: "The results did not match, but the game was always good compared to last year."
Barisic even found that they had been "better in many games before than today" - against "the strongest team that has played at this stadium this season."
The first three-pointer since 26 July has therefore proven that the team structure is intact despite the setbacks: “Today my team has shown that it has character.”
No less pleasing to him: "That we finally played to zero again".
The fact that Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger have several outages to complain about and that Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger made their starting eleventh debuts make the victory even more valuable.
"You must not forget that," Barisic, who lost in the past three days with Behrendt and Pavelic players, "who have been very stable lately."
The international break must therefore be used to “lick wounds and add a little bit in the physical area,” Barisic, who has five U21 players in his ranks, said.
One to whom the break may be particularly important is Captain Hofmann.
He breaks up for the team, goes over it with pain.
It is in this difficult phase that he has shown that he is a very important player for us," Barisic said.
Hofmann not only gave Rapids the structure before his replacement in the 68th minute, but also scored the second goal.
For the 33-year-old, who completed his 350th Bundesliga game, it was the first out of the game since 2 November 2013 (4:2 over the Admira).
Hofmann: "Do not believe that everything is all right now" "We certainly had a bit of luck, but at some point luck must also come back to us.
Now it was high time," Hofmann said.
However, he warned to concentrate on further work: "You cannot always see this in black and white.
We haven’t played as badly in the last few weeks as it has been portrayed.
But we must also not believe that everything is fine now.
He could not deny the importance of his role for the team.
It is a very young team that I can help very much at the moment.
At certain stages, they stick to me," Hofmann said.
Grödig coach Michael Baur had little to blame for himself and his team.
He regretted the quick match "from the category Magic Goal", as well as the regular goal by Nutz in the 40th minute, which had been wrongly denied by referee Kollegger.
The only accusation I can make to the team is that we weren’t concrete enough towards goal in some stages.
We have had too few degrees.
Defender Maximilian Karner looked similar: "It started badly, but then we found it clean and even scored a goal.
Overall, there would have been more in it.
Under this peak rests
We showed a powerful tribe during our puzzle of the summer series "Mein Stück vom Rhöner Glück" last Friday.
Several of these tree giants still exist in the district, the specimen shown is the "Geißruheiche" above Unterweißenbrunn.
A bumpy footpath leads up to the 600-year-old oak.
It passes Koppeln, basalt stone piles and basalt stone seas.
A bit below the quarry from Bauersberg, a kilometre north of the road to Weisbach, there it stands.
The natural monument looks vital, it protrudes above the other trees of the surrounding area and is reminiscent of an American sequoia with a circumference of over eight meters.
A little Buddha on a stump suggests that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
But despite intensive research, there were only clues to the origin of the name.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has consulted the Bischofsheimer Archiv and interviewed older people from Unterweißenbrunn to find out what their relationship with the Geißruheiche is.
The result of his research remained the rather sober explanation for the name.
According to this, up to about 80 years ago, the goat herders drove their animals from Unterweißenbrunn to the meadows that had been laboriously cleared and stoned.
At the foot of the tree are said to have rested the animal keepers exhausted by the ascent.
In the meantime, the area has regained its importance, because in the meadows actually graze goat herds again.
The area has also been declared the core zone of the biosphere reserve, Schneider further found out.
However, you should be careful when entering the stone collections, because the basalt warmed by the sun is also a popular place to stay for otters.
A hiking trail leads from Unterweißenbrunn to the tree, but it is somewhat hidden.
Further trails are signposted, which ascend in the direction of Hochrhön and invite to an extended hike.
Where is the water castle?
However, a water castle, which is sought at our next task, is rarely found in the height.
The reflection in the trench already gives a good impression of the building, but we have some historical buildings in the district, to which the building counterfei could fit.

After weeks of turmoil, Italy’s Prime Minister and current EU Chairman, Matteo Renzi, has enforced the nomination of his Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini as head of EU foreign policy against strong conservative resistance at the EU special summit last week, she will succeed Britain’s Catherine Ashton.
Renzi considers, as the pro-government daily La Repubblica reflects, the appointment of his Mogherini, who is also a favorite in the government team, as a strengthening of the position of the Social Democrats and his own in the EU.
He also expects a boost for his "reform package" in Italy.
Last but not least, Renzi hopes to calm down the left-wing party base that is constantly rebelling against him, because Mogherini is assigned to it, albeit in a more moderate way.
In contrast to the conservative representatives with Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Poland nominated as Council President Donald Tusk, the prevailing opinion in Rome is thus to establish a political balance.
The chief diplomat of the EU will also be the deputy of Commission President Juncker.
The pending approval of the European Parliament is deemed to be certain.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would hardly have called the nomination of the 41-year-old politician of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) an "important recognition" of Italy's role in the EU.
La Repubblica spreads optimism that Mogherini, which has been proven in leading party offices for almost two decades and known for her ambition, will be able to cope with the "enormous challenges".
The native Roman woman is married and has two daughters.
In 1996, she began her career as a political scientist in the youth organization of the then Democratici di Sinistra (Left Democrats), which in 2008 joined forces with the Catholic centre party Margherita to form today's Social Democratic PD.
In 1999, Mogherini became Vice-President of the European Community Organisation of Socialist Youth (European Young Socialists) for three years.
When she was elected to the Left Democrat Party Council in 2001, she joined the high party politics and worked in the foreign policy department, whose head she soon became.
It occupied traditional focal points of Italian foreign policy such as the Middle East, became known by studies on NATO deployment in Afghanistan, in which Italy is involved with a contingent of troops, maintained contacts with the Social Democrats in Europe and with the Democrats in the US.
Since 2008, she has been a member of the Chamber of Deputies, where she is an expert on defence and European and international affairs.
When Renzi became prime minister in February 2014, he appointed Mogherini as his foreign minister.
If the PD today has a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country, which contributed to the party’s over 40 percent vote in the EU elections in May, then, as noted in PD circles, Federica Mogherini has a share of it.
The allegations in Brussels that the new EU foreign minister has too little diplomatic experience, that is, lack of substance, are countered in the PD.
In Brussels, especially by Poland and the Baltic members, Mogherini's suspiciously realistic accents on the crisis in Ukraine are being pursued and defamed as a "Russia-friendly course".
It endorses the South Stream pipeline operated by the Russian company Gasprom, through which Russian natural gas will be transported directly to southern Europe bypassing Ukraine, which also serves to secure Italy’s energy.
After Renzi took office as EU President in July, Mogherini traveled to Moscow for her first state visit.
Photos they showed with Putin at the shake-hands were taken in Brussels with outrage, as well as inviting the Kremlin chief for October to a Milan economic summit.
A total of nine young people started their apprenticeship at emz-Hanauer in Nabburg on Monday.
Among them is an apprentice who has previously completed another training in the company.
In the future, the new employees will work in four apprenticeship occupations: electronics (three apprentices), mechatronics (two), tool mechanics (two) and process mechanics (two).
All trainees come from the district of Schwandorf: Tobias Braun and Thomas Bücherl from Schwarzach, Stefan Brickl and Florian Rewitzer from Schmidgaden, Johannes Beer from Neunburg vorm Wald, Felix Domaier from Oberviechtach, Daniel Sorgenfrei and Sebastian Zahner from Pfreimd as well as Ferdinand Strebl from Teunz.
The new apprentices previously attended primary and secondary schools and secondary schools.
From Wednesday to Friday, trainees of all ages as well as instructors travel to a team training event in Oberammergau, where, among other things, a full-day hike and rafting on the Inn are on the program.
The company has 435 employees throughout Germany and 950 worldwide.
The number of apprentices spread over all years is 27.
The socialists in France should “hold their mouths and put France in order,” said François Hollande’s main ally.
Mr. Valls called on the deeply divided left to show “their love” for the controversial socialist president, whose cabinet reorganization has met with disapproval from the vast majority of the French.
The President deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to stay by his side," he said with great applause.
As a calming gesture, the prime minister insisted that his government would not question the controversial 35-hour week in France despite fierce demands for a relaxation of the arrangements on the part of Emmanuel Macron, the new Minister of Economic Affairs.
On Saturday, Mr. Hollande urged his fellow socialists to show themselves “united” with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the Minister of Justice, sprinkled sand in the gears, appearing at a meeting of renegade socialist MPs and criticizing the Socialist Party for taking the French “the faith in their future.”
Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader of the National Front, mocked the socialist struggles and said she couldn’t imagine that the new Valls government would last for more than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the emperor without clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls also has none, they are forced to form a new government if the old one has not even survived a summer.
"And the new one will not survive autumn or winter," Miss Le Pen told supporters.
She reiterated her party's call for a dissolution of parliament, saying she was confident that she would emerge victorious in early elections and was ready to go to government.
The ruling party of France suffered a defeat in the local elections in March and the right-wing National Front was ahead of the EU elections in May.
A poll in the Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche found that 76 percent of French people believe that the Socialist Party is at risk of breaking up into several rival factions before the end of Hollande’s 2017 term.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Sciences Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government did not achieve an improvement in the economy and record unemployment figures.
"There is a small window of opportunity, but public opinion must quickly feel that things are changing," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could deteriorate further.
Norwegian Cruises on the verge of a $3 billion deal with Prestige Cruises
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third largest cruise line provider in the world, is conducting advanced negotiations to acquire its competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc. for about $3 billion, according to industry experts.
A deal would give Norwegian Cruise, a $6.8 billion market valued company, access to Prestige Cruises’ luxury cruise ships as well as its wealthy clientele, while competing with major rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
An agreement could be announced as early as this week, the sources said on Sunday, warning that the talks could also end unsuccessfully.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns a 20 percent stake in Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to remain anonymous because the negotiations were not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, while a spokesman for Apollo declined to comment.
The Miami-based company Norwegian Cruise operates 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its revenue in 2013 was $2.57 billion, an increase of 13 percent compared to 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, operates under the brand names Oceania and Regent, which together operate eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenues for 2013 of $1.2 billion, an increase of 6 percent compared to the previous year.
The cruise industry totals about $29 billion and is expected to grow over the next few years due to the strengthening of the middle class in emerging markets such as China and India.
The companies are trying to position themselves as the best choice among cruise carriers for these new customers.
Prestige Cruises applied to the U.S. regulators in January 2014.
Apollo has been the majority shareholder in the company since a $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was formed in its current form in 2000 through a merger with a cruise company owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a leisure and casino company controlled by Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise went public in January 2013.
Genting held 28 percent of the shares at the end of June, according to regulatory authorities, Apollo 20 percent of the shares and the private equity company TPG Capital LP an 8 percent stake in the company.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise jointly hold over 82 percent of passenger capacity on American cruise ships, according to the original application documents for the IPO of Prestige Cruises.
Pro-Hong Kong activists condemn China on the day after the election decision.
A group of peking loyalists waved the Chinese flag nearby.
The Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress passed a framework law on Sunday, which allows only two or three candidates for the 2017 Hong Kong leadership election.
All candidates must first obtain the majority support of a nominating committee, which is expected to be filled with peking loyal members.
This decision makes it almost impossible for opposition Democrats to be admitted to elections, prompting pro-democracy activists to realize their threat and to cripple the financial centre of Hong Kong with “Occupy Central” protests.
Political reforms have long been a controversial issue in Hong Kong; and China’s party leadership fears that calls for democracy may spread to other cities.
Following the publication of a Beijing White Paper outlining China’s domination of Hong Kong in June, democracy activists held an unofficial referendum on the electoral process in the Special Administrative Region, in which hundreds of thousands marched into the city’s business district and organized a sit-in.
Li's interview is organized by the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong.
The Deputy Chairman of the Standing Committee on Legal Affairs, Zhang Rongshun, and the Deputy Director of the Office for Hong Kong Affairs and Macau of the State Council, Feng Wei, should be interviewed during the course of the day.
Student activists announced that they would gather in the afternoon in front of the leadership office in Hong Kong.
Britain did not include any democratic elements until the final phase of the 150-year colonial government in Hong Kong.
Putin asks Kiev to start "state talks" with eastern Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian government stop fighting the separatists in the east of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the “state” of the renegade region.
His spokesman Dimitri Peskov later made clear that Putin did not mean that the territory of eastern Ukraine under the control of the separatists would become a part of Russia, but that his status with Ukraine would need to be redefined in order to give the Russian-speaking region the power to represent its rights and interests.
However, Putin’s appeal to the Kiev government to negotiate on an equal footing with the pro-Russian insurgents fits with the strategy he has apparently pursued since the start of the riots five months ago: help the separatists take territory and pressure on the Ukrainian government to enable the newly proclaimed Novorossia region to gain de facto independence for an alliance with Russia instead of the West.
In an interview with the state television channel Channel One, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to recapture separatist-held areas in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were captured in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on March 18.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently referred to the occupied territory as "Novorossia" or "New Russia", a term reminiscent of the pre-revolutionary splendor of the Russian empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who, in the wake of the campaigns of Ukrainian politicians for the Oct. 26 elections and while government groups are attacking civilian communities in the separatist-held areas are hoping for soon-to-be peace talks are “capped in their illusions,” Itar-Tass reported.
"We need to immediately engage in detailed talks, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organization of society and the state status of South-East Ukraine, in order to safeguard the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskov said Putin’s reference to statehood should be seen in the context of the greater autonomy discussed for months by the Kiev leadership to dispel fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are at risk.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the necessary autonomy to the eastern regions, Peskov said.
It is not a matter of negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal conflict in Ukraine."
The Kremlin spokesman’s clarification to correct the “misinterpretation” of Putin’s remarks underlined Russia’s claim to leadership in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the East as opposed to the direct annexation of Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million residents are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have far greater difficulty annexing the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and polls from the pre-conflict period revealed a broad majority for staying in Ukraine.
The autonomy addressed by Russian diplomats on international forums would give the regional governments in Ukraine power to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations, thus giving the Kremlin de facto control over an area connecting the Russian territory with Crimea.
The peninsula in the Black Sea, annexed five months ago, is the home port for the majority of the Russian navy, as well as an important trading port and historic coastal region.
The regions between the Rostov region in Russia and Crimea are also rich in mines, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian military.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, in his inauguration speech on June 7, suggested that Ukrainian legislation should consider amendments to the Constitution, after new elections, which would give the respective territories greater control over their finances and the status of languages.
But his notion of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast to those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels, whose arming and incitement Moscow is accused of.
Putin’s last call to Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders on an equal footing followed a further advance of the rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks invaded eastern Ukraine via the previously peaceful region along the Azov Sea.
The Russian-backed separatists took control of Novoasovsk in a gesture that, according to fears of Ukrainian security officials, is the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region up to Crimea.
For this reason, massive civilian and military preparations have begun to fortify Mariupol, a 500,000-population steel-industrial port located between Novoasovsk and the narrow access to the Crimean peninsula.
Speaking at a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels on Saturday, Poroshenko urged action to prevent another Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We are at a point where there is no turning back," Poroshenko warned.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit decided no concrete actions, the leadership demanded the draft further sanctions against Russia, which should come into force in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukraine crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovajsk after two Russian tank columns and 1,000 soldiers invaded the Donetsk region last week to support the besieged separatists, said Colonel Andriy Lysenko, spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council Reports on Saturday in Kiev.
The first presumably 63 Ukrainian soldiers trapped by the Russian invasion of Ilovaysk were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian paratroopers captured on Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko said on Sunday.
Naked photos scandal over Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten made no secret of his anger at hackers, who presumably stole nude pictures of his fiancée Gabi Grecko and a Who is Who of Hollywood’s A celebrity.
The movie city is in a state of excitement after a series of unambiguous photos of a nude Jennifer Lawrence appeared on the Internet in a hacking scandal around celebrities.
The hacker probably has 60 nude photos of Lawrence, star from "The Tributes of Panem" and of superstars, including the models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, the singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle as well as the actress Kirsten Dunst.
Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko from Melbourne allegedly also made private photos public due to an iCloud gap.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
Noblesten, who was engaged to Grecko last month, told Confidential: “It’s disgusting.”
All private letters and pictures should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and passed on to others.
Grecko, currently in New York, reportedly told a news website that the hack was "shameful" and that the victims felt "injured."
The hacker probably has 30 pictures of Palmer with her ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two shots in which she lies upstairs without a pool.
Palmer's film works include "Love Is Invincible" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck star Strahovski and the actress Browning from Sucker Punch were unavailable yesterday for comments on the hacked images.
A representative of Lawrence' told TMZ, "It's an abominable violation of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his tweet: "Posting hacked images from a mobile phone is nothing but the sale of hiding goods."
Purely legally, the re-distribution of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Cyclists, joggers and hikers participated yesterday in the 8th cycling on the Großer Feldberg and supported the association "Hilfe für Krebskranke Kinder".
The tour, which was one torture for some, was an easy training for others.
But everyone agreed on one thing: it was fun.
Thomas Studanski probably slept well last night.
For the first time in his life, the head of the Oberursel brewery rode a bike on the Feldberg yesterday.
For the good cause.
He can easily put away the small sore muscles, especially since his participation in the 8th cycling on the Großer Feldberg in favour of the association "Hilfe für Krebskranke Kinder" (Frankfurt) also personally brought him a valuable insight.
That's a great thing.
"I know now that I can do that - fine!"
A little bit on the way in the applause curve?
No, if I had stopped once, it would have been...
Like Thomas Studanski, who sits for the CDU in the Oberursel city parliament, many of the 718 participants tortured themselves yesterday in the early dew and came close to exhaustion, but happy on the plateau.
Others, on the other hand, found it easier to overcome the 11-kilometre stretch between Hohemark and Feldberg.
Norman Dießner, for example.
The completely red green politician from the county council - red dress, red bike - did something understated at the start ("Every lot of professionals, there is Arriving the goal!"), but then proved to be half a professional on the mountain and went through the goal after 45 minutes without breathing.
He, too, drove through the track in a slide, as did Nina Kuhn, press spokeswoman for the city of Oberursel, who had set out together with Frank Grüneisen.
For the two triathletes, the "Feldberg cycling" was not necessarily a sporting challenge: "This is about charity, we like to be there - we would have made a trip today anyway," says Kuhn.
On the way they met Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) had driven down to Oberursel in the morning, to straight back to the height.
The Frankfurter Florian Zierz had swung into the saddle at 9 o'clock in the morning at home, "made" the Feldberg twice, and then rolled home with fun.
Also had fun "Frieden-Toni".
For the head of the Oberursel cult kiosk, cycling over the Feldberg is simply one of them.
He had aimed for 40 minutes with his 6.5-kilo race bike.
A crazy event.
For this purpose - I like to be there," said Andreas Balzke.
The well-trained Mainzer says of himself that he is an "ambitious road cyclist".
He must be, because he was on the "Fixie-Rad", these are also road bikes, but without a gearbox...
Not only did the 20 hikers who climbed the White Wall and the foot dance to the summit prove that it was easy to get up without a bike, but also a jogger who pulled a car tyre with weights behind him on a cord.
Bergwacht-Dozent Professor Volker Lischke, who provided safety with his team, equipped with all-wheel-bully and quad, said: "I know this one from Frankfurt, who is training for a special sledge trail, only that he pulls the sled himself".
The 718 participants – and thus as many as never before – had been sent on the track in groups in the morning.
The hikers first at 9.30 a.m.
The first cyclists and runners followed at 10 a.m.
Five minutes later, the first mountain bikers set off.
Bent Hansen, chairman of the association "Radeln auf dem Großen Feldberg", gave the start commands and wished the participants a nice trip.
For next year, he hopes to succeed in blocking the route up to the Feldberg for the safety of the participants.
